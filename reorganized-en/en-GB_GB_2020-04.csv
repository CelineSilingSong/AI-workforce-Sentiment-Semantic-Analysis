Artificial intelligence will drastically transform the economy and the workplace. Which skills will be required and is training the all-encompassing solution?

In the automation and digitalisation we experienced hitherto, people were given a machine—such as a laptop with the usual office software, a 3D printer or a computer-numeric-controlled milling machine—which they could use to perform their job. Knowledge and communication became more mobile. At the same time, the new machines made possible customised production.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems enable machines to work with people. As they are being introduced into the workplace, new kinds of co-operation are already being defined. And there is little doubt AI systems will play a far greater role in people’s lives. In the future, machines could predict errors or disruptions in work processes (for example, in the context of predictive maintenance) or conduct the beginning of a phone call with a customer.

These changes require adaptations. But who will have to adapt? Who will determine which adaptions are made and what form should they take?
Expectations placed on workers
We often hear that workers should receive continued training, to remain ‘employable’. And who has anything against training? Yet the debate isn’t progressing beyond general demands. How individual professions and sectors are affected, as well as the corresponding satisfaction of the demand for training, have not been adequately addressed or implemented. Instead, expectations are placed on workers to behave in an economically rational way—and to kindly get some training.
Participation in continued professional training programmes has in fact risen since 2010 and while now stagnating is at around 50 per cent. On-the-job training enjoys particularly high acceptance. But it is also clear that not all workers are being reached. Individuals with less formal education, those in smaller firms, those who are older or who work part-time participate less in continued training.

One study actually showed that those workers who can be easily replaced are the least likely to participate in training. In a way, we are perpetuating the inequalities of our school system. We are in danger of of ending up with an even more divided labour market, with well-paid specialists on the one side and a new precariat which performs ancillary tasks—before and after the algorithm—on the other.
Contextual conditions
To ensure that current changes lead to more rather than less social cohesion, we have to create contextual conditions that make workers feel protected from unfulfillable demands. After a 40-hour working week, most of us do not have the time alongside family and care work to take part in a training programme.
This will become even less likely if labour gives into demands from the employer lobby for more flexible working times and a softening of free time. We must create more time and space to empower and protect workers who—for whatever reason—don’t want this. Here legislation, such as in Germany the Qualification Opportunity Act and the Work-for-Tomorrow Act, as well as in-company guidance on continued training, should play an important role.
With these legislative initiatives, Germany’s labour minister, Hubertus Heil, has already proposed or begun to enact improvements. Under discussion are the many aspects of how to finance continued training programmes. In the Work-for-Tomorrow Act, continued training is made extremely attractive for companies affected by structural change.
Workers don’t just need subsidies—they need time and guidance. And the Federal Labour Office has been offering continued training advice since the beginning of 2019. A right to continued training should guarantee that employers provide enough time for it. Under such conditions, programmes can be created that empower workers. 
Works councils
Works councils are key actors making sure that such opportunities are actually used. They are not ‘inhibitors’, trying to prevent the introduction of AI systems. Rather, they ensure that processes are implemented well and that tasks are redistributed. They do the preliminary work that will lead to greater acceptance of AI systems within companies, while at the same time providing better working conditions for the workforce.
For this to happen, we need works councils that are knowledgeable about the material. At the same time, works-council members, especially those who are not exempted from their regular tasks to take care of their works-council duties, have enough on their plate. We cannot simply unload additional tasks on to them. So they must be able to bring external expertise, on AI, data privacy and additional aspects of digitalisation, into the workplace.
Some employers are already engaged in active union-busting. In future, it will be even easier to hinder the activities of works councils if workers see and talk to each other less and less, because they will ever more frequently be working at different times and in different locations. A sense of belonging and exchange with works councils can be weakened this way.
As a reaction, work councils must also become more digital. As companies are redefined, we also need new forms of organising works councils—for example, by organising the next election via a Messenger group. We want to address such issues and others in an amendment to the Works Council Constitution Act.
Shaping the transformation
But which abilities and skills, which kinds of knowledge will broad segments of the population—such as, for example, a 56-year-old steel worker, a 32-year-old father working part-time or a 61-year-old tax adviser on a temporary contract—need in the future, to help shape the transformation and get closer to the goal of good work?
Already today, human-machine co-operation places new demands on workers. How will we deal with our algorithmic or robotic colleagues?
Complete trust in an AI system or dealing blindly with decision processes—similar to the annoying clicking away of cookie settings on websites and the acceptance of unread terms and conditions—should not be what we see in workplaces. For this reason, the ability to think critically and to question results is all the more important.
Such ability must be founded on basic knowledge of how AI systems work. This does not mean everyone needs to be able to write code. But we should learn that AI systems and their decision-making processes have strengths and weaknesses. A successful instance of the imparting of knowledge is the ‘Elements of AI’ online course, now available in a number of EU languages, including German.
Technical knowledge also remains relevant because it empowers workers to provide critical feedback on the implementation and continued development of AI systems—because not each and every technical possibility can be practically and reliably implemented. Technical knowledge keeps workers on an equal footing with the algorithms.
Besides good formal training, tomorrow’s workplace will require from workers more communication and teamwork, because the tasks under discussion will only be able to be mastered by a group. Here, workers’ ability to give and receive constructive criticism will be key to maintaining their ability to keep learning.
What are called ‘soft skills’ today could soon prove to be ‘hard skills’, essential for companies’ success. Such skills are formed and fine-tuned through their daily application. Both employers and employees face the challenge of organising work in the future in a way that will foster these indispensable skills. 
Good work
Through works councils and staff committees, workers must be integrated into the planning of continued training. This includes the development of training programmes and the form they will take, and the preparation of plans for a qualified workforce.
It is the duty of social democracy to make sure that human beings don’t get the short end of the stick in the human-machine partnership. At the end of the day, machines should enable more autonomy and bring us closer to the goal of good work. We do not need another relationship of dependency in which the machine is constantly telling us where to go and which movements we should make.
We’ll do that ourselves. To be able to codetermine the shape of the workplace of tomorrow, we need new contextual conditions, of which education and continued training are part—but only part.

In fact, our entire ecosystem, including the food we eat and the air we breathe, counts on pollinators. But the pollinator population is declining according to Sabiha Rumani Malik, the founder and executive president of The World Bee Project. But, in an intriguing collaboration with Oracle and by putting artificial intelligence, internet of things and big data to work on the problem, they hope to reverse the trend.
How Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Big Data Can Save The BeesAdobe Stock

Why is the global bee population in decline?

According to an Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report, pollinators are in danger. There are many reasons pollinators are being driven to extinction, including habitat destruction, urbanization, use of pesticides, pollution, fragmentation of natural flowering habitats, predators and parasites, and changing climate. However, until recently, with The World Bee Project's work, there hasn't been a global initiative to study bee populations or to research and attack the issue from a global perspective.

Why is it important to save the bees?

Did you know that bees, along with other pollinators, such as butterflies, are the reason plants can produce seeds and reproduce? According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 35 percent of food crops and three-quarters of the world’s flowering plants depend on bees and pollinators. In fact, in order to ensure the almond crop gets pollinated in California each year, most of the beehives in the United States are shipped to California to ensure it. In fact, bees help to pollinate 90% of the leading global crop types, including fruit trees, coffee, vanilla, and cotton plants. And, of course, healthy plants are critical in replenishing our oxygen supply thanks to photosynthesis.  
PROMOTED
If the pollinators aren't alive or healthy enough to do their job, our global crop production, food security, biodiversity, and clean air is in peril. Honeybees are the world's most important pollinators. As much as 40 percent of the global nutrient supply for humans depends on pollinators. Presently there are approximately 2 billion people who suffer deficiencies of micronutrients.
“Our lives are intrinsically connected to the bees,” Malik said.

Partnership to monitor global honeybee population
The World Bee Project is the first private globally coordinated organization to launch and be devoted to monitoring the global honey bee population. Since 2014, the organization has brought together scientists to study the global problem of bee decline to provide insight about the issue to farmers, governments, beekeepers, and other vested organizations.

How technology can save the bees
How could technology be used to save the bees? Technology can be leveraged to help save the bees in a similar way that it is applied to other innovative projects. First, by using internet-of-things sensors, including microphones and cameras that can see invasive predators and collect data from the bees and hives. Human ingenuity and innovations such as wireless technologies, robotics, and computer vision help deliver new insights and solutions to the issue. One of the key metrics of a hive's health is the sounds it produces. Critical to the data-gathering efforts is to ""listen"" to the hives to determine colony health, strength, and behavior as well as collect temperature, humidity, apiary weather conditions, and hive weight.
The sound and vision sensors can also detect hornets, which can be a threat to bee populations.
The data is then fed to the Oracle Cloud, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms get to work to analyze the data. The algorithms will look for patterns and try to predict behaviors of the hive, such as if it's preparing to swarm. The insights are then shared with beekeepers and conservationists so they can step in to try to protect the hives. Since it's a globally connected network, the algorithms can also learn more about differences in bee colonies in different areas of the world. Students, researchers, and even interested citizens can also interact with the data, work with it through the hive network's open API, and discuss it via chatbot.
For example, the sound and vision sensors can detect hornets, which can be a threat to bee populations. The sound from the wing flab or a hornet is different from those of bees, and the AI can pick this up automatically and alert beekeepers to the hornet threat.
Technology is making it easier for The World Bee Project to share real-time information and gather resources to help save the world's bee population. In fact, Malik shared, ""Our partnership with Oracle Cloud is an extraordinary marriage between nature and technology."" Technology is helping to multiply the impact of The World Bee Project Hive Network across the world and makes action to save the bees quicker and more effective.

A multitude of factors, including technological advancements like big data, artificial intelligence, mobile, cloud-based HR and labor technology, are contributing to rapid change. Artificial intelligence, specifically, is predicted to drive the future of work, yet multiple reports indicate that human resources professionals are ill-equipped to make this happen successfully.Believe it or not, the HR function is no stranger to artificial intelligence and many HR functions already utilize the unsupervised learning and predictive modeling benefits that come along with AI, especially in tasks such as recruiting and training. AI for recruiting, for example, is an existing category of HR technology designed to reduce — or even remove — time-consuming activities like manually screening resumes.   New generations entering the workforce, and older generations delaying retirement, are contributing to larger applicant pools, so HR professionals are already experiencing the lift of having an AI-backed system to identify qualified candidates. Employing AI technology for the repetitive parts of standard HR tasks like sourcing, screening and nurturing candidates will increase and grow into more sophisticated tasks, like scheduling interviews and even engaging with and interviewing candidates. Although there are existing areas within the HR function that already leverage the power of AI, the rapid pace of digitization and technology disruption will enhance the need for further expansions. IBM predicts that 120 million workers in the world’s ten largest economies will need to be reskilled in the next few years to adapt to an AI-driven marketplace. Additionally, Deloitte’s 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report reveals a similar sentiment, stating that while 72% of respondents think adopting AI is vital for their business, only 31% feel ready to address this transformation.   But failure to implement wholesale changes backed by digitization and insight-driven learnings will result in the loss of an organization’s competitive edge, and HR departments will have to account for the ensuing adverse effects on long-term growth. So this brings the question, will HR be replaced by AI? The short answer is no. Instead, HR will be enhanced by the insights and capabilities that will inherently come with AI’s unsupervised learning and predictive modeling.

   Most organizations that have invested and integrated AI into their HR functions have a new perspective that’s worth noting. Think of HR jobs now as a hybrid model with people and technology co-existing. Best practices in this hybrid model focus on carefully designed work and processes with specific delineations on who or what is doing the activity — additionally, monitoring and measuring how you utilize AI with human oversight is imperative. Continual learning needs to be reviewed by an HR leader to avoid biases and other unintended consequences of automating tasks and processes.The future workforce will see a hybrid of both humans and technology working together seamlessly. AI will not replace work that requires empathy, problem-solving, social skills, or emotional intelligence. It’s not about technology replacing the personal touch; it’s about technology enabling the personal touch and raising the bar. While efficiencies may reduce the number of HR roles in the future overall, the type of work performed by HR professionals will be higher paying, and more strategic, high-value based responsibilities.In addition to the artificial intelligence benefits that are currently leveraged by many HR professionals, future examples of AI-based HR capabilities include:Productivity: This will develop through email and time management insights, workplace redesign and internal talent mobility.Management: HR professionals leveraging AI to analyze engagement feedback and assess managerial readiness and team health.Compensation: AI can identify gender and age inequality, matching pay to demand and optimizing reimbursement to market figures.Artificial intelligence is positioned to plan a role in nearly every HR domain, changing and enhancing every process. The way organizations source, assess, hire, train, develop, pay, and move people will all be informed by AI.Companies can reframe the integration of AI as a complement to human expertise rather than a zero-sum game in which humans fill in for what machines cannot accomplish yet. With the increase of automated software and chatbots, AI has the power to become a secret workhorse for HR departments delivering exponential growth in the next three to five years. The responsibility of leveraging systems of intelligence to better inform decisions on recruitment, assessments, learning, management, career advancement, compensation, wellbeing, compliance and productivity, among others, will fall squarely on the shoulders of HR departments. Utilizing machine learning to assist the human touch will soon become the price of entry, versus the exception to the rule.

    The development of full of artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race-Stephen Hawking
    
            


 Artificial intelligence (AI)is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.    Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.    Rail engine has given an unforeseen speed to the world. And penicillin has changed the dynamics of the field of medicine drastically. Then, the advent of computer has made a telling impact, on mankind altogether. Now, another revolutionary game changer of even bigger magnitude is making its way into the human life in a never-seen-before kind of fanatic pace;that is Artificial intelligence (AI).With a brain that thinks, learns, logics just as a human being does, the AI is giving a new momentum to machinery and institutions alike. Now experts say most of the new career opportunities are going to be for those who take get mastery over this AI. In this context, let us take a good look at what this AI is about, the kind of impact it is going to make on job opportunities and so on…   The world is changing with a rapid pace, thanks to the ever new innovative technological changes and advancements, which in effect is throwing a great challenge to the mankind. Sensing the abundant opportunities, this phenomena is throwing open, most of the students are falling in line and trying to catch up with the new AI technologies for a better and brighter future. In this context, it can undoubtedly be said that the most impactful technological invention of this century is definitely going to be the AI. Many surveys say the number of inventions in India is going to increase by two times by 2021. India has already been taking firm steps in terms of strategies and plans that would help in the manifold growth of the AI.   What is AI?   Computer needs a language for it to work. It doesn’t work unless programmes are executed. It is a machine that does not do anything by thinking on its own and only executes the pre-directed work. But the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is totally different. Machines can take their own decisions according to the situation with the help of the AI. The humanoid robot- Sofia, designed by Hong Kong’s Hanson Robotic Company in 2016, is an example of this. This robot is a computer algorithm that learns by observing the environment around, just as a human being does. When a particular task is performed repeatedly with the computer that has an AI fitted, it thinks over on its own as to how that task can be bettered, and even corrects if there be any mistakes in the course of performing the said task. The mobiles that we use now already have a bit of the AI fitted into them. It suggests possible words when something is even being typed in. Likewise, it separates spam and promotional mails as well. In a sense, the computer thinks the way we would want it to, and makes the task easier for us.   These are all AI  Alexa voice speaker is a well-known tool which answers the queries of the users. The technology used in it is none other than the AI. Likewise, the AI software ‘AlfaGo’ developed by Google’s DeepMind is considered the toughest game in the world. And China’s ‘Go’ has defeated even the Grandmasters. It could do so by understanding the whole old data of the game that was installed into it, playing the game over and over again, and correcting improving itself. IBM has also designed an AI called Watson. Facebook also designed computers named Bob and Elice, which work based on the AI, but later on done away with them as they started conversing in a language that is understood only between the two of them.   The way forward  There is a little doubt the world will revolve around the AI in the near future. The doctors have already used the AI to diagnose melanoma. Many recruiters also have been of the late depending on it to zero in on their human resources. Australia’s biggest energy firm Woodside has also used IBM’s ‘Watson’. It claimed this move enabled results in their research in less than one fourth of the time compared with that done by its employees. Many firms around the world have improved their efficiency by using IBM’s AI technology. This technology enables improved marketing efficiency and better results. It even tracks the moods and purchasing patterns of the customers beforehand for the firms. Thus, they stand a good chance of improved performance.   Caution needed  It seems the AI will be put into use in many fields in a massive scale. It re-emphasizes the need of continuous improvisation of AI skills the experts in the said fields possess. Especially those who want to be or to come into corporate companies, they should upgrade their AI knowledge to get through the interviews and get recruited.   Types  AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields:   Machine learning, A neural network, Deep learning, Cognitive computing, Computer vision, Natural language processing.   Opportunities  Artificial intelligence is not here to replace us. It augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do. Because AI algorithms learn differently than humans, they look at things differently. They can see relationships and patterns that escape us. This human, AI partnership offers many opportunities. It can:      Bring analytics to industries and domains where it’s currently underutilized.  Improve the performance of existing analytic technologies, like computer vision and time series analysis.  Break down economic barriers, including language and translation barriers.  Augment existing abilities and make us better at what we do.  Give us better vision, better understanding, better memory and much more.    The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks, but it’s not a replacement for humans – and won’t be anytime soon.

It spots new outbreaks, identifies people with fevers, diagnoses cases, prioritizes the patients most in need, reads the scientific literature, and is on its way to creating a cure.If only.WIRED OPINIONABOUTAlex Engler is a David M. Rubenstein Fellow at the Brookings Institution and an adjunct professor and affiliated scholar at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.As the world confronts the outbreak of coronavirus, many have lauded AI as our omniscient secret weapon. Although corporate press releases and some media coverage sing its praises, AI will play only a marginal role in our fight against Covid-19. While there are undoubtedly ways in which it will be helpful—and even more so in future pandemics—at the current moment, technologies like data reporting, telemedicine, and conventional diagnostic tools are far more impactful. So how can you avoid falling for the AI hype? In a recent Brookings Institution report, I identified the necessary heuristics for a healthy skepticism of AI claims around Covid-19.Let’s start with the most important rule: always look to the subject matter experts. If they are applying AI, fantastic! If not, be wary of AI applications from software companies that don’t employ those experts. Data is always dependent on its context, which takes expertise to understand. Does data from China apply to the United States? How long might exponential growth continue? By how much will our interventions reduce transmission? All models, even AI models, make assumptions about questions like these. If the modelers don’t understand those assumptions, their models are more likely to be harmful than helpful.Trending NowDr. Seema Yasmin Debunks Coronavirus MythsThankfully, in the case of Covid-19, epidemiologists know quite a bit about the context of the data. Even though the virus is new and there is much to be learned, there is tremendous depth of expertise around what questions to ask and how they can be answered. Modern statistical epidemiology dates to the early 1900s, which means the field is incorporating a century of scientific research into its analyses. In contrast, machine learning methods tend to assume that everything can be learned directly from a data set, without incorporating the broader scientific context.Consider, for example, the claim that AI was the first to detect the coronavirus. Machine learning is very dependent on historical data to create meaningful insights. Since there is no database of prior Covid-19 outbreaks, AI alone cannot predict the spread of this new pandemic. What’s more, the claim implicitly overstates the ability of AI to inform us about huge and rare events, which is not the strength of AI at all. As it turns out, while software may have sounded the alarm, grasping the significance of the outbreak required human analysis.AI’s real value lies in its ability to create many minute predictions. For instance, the AI epidemiology company BlueDot has successfully helped the state of California monitor the spread of the coronavirus. The company augmented traditional epidemiological models with machine learning, using flight patterns to predict the spread at the zip code level. That’s the value of AI. Those granular estimates can enable precise allocation of funding, supplies, and medical staff.AdvertisementThat said, you should not trust all individualized estimates from AI. Frequently, a company will report accuracy—the percent of predictions that are correct during development—to purport the effectiveness of an AI model. Unfortunately, this number is easy to juke and often offers an incomplete picture. For instance, Alibaba has claimed it can diagnose Covid-19 from CT scans with 96 percent accuracy. But, if you check in with the subject matter experts, you’ll see that the American College of Radiology has said that CT scans should not be used as “first-line tests to diagnose Covid-19."" Other experts echo that this method is not yet proven, and further caution that while the algorithm may be fast, it requires that CT scan rooms must be cleaned and their air recirculated between each patientMost PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDAs for that impressively high rate of accuracy, it’s time to share a dirty secret of the machine learning world: any data scientist in the field would scoff at that level of accuracy. It’s unbelievably high. Without any caveat, self-criticism, or external validation, it’s suspicious on its face. Even if it is true, we often need metrics aside from accuracy to know if a model is effective, such as the percent of sick individuals who are correctly diagnosed. While fatigued medical systems have turned to AI analysis of x-rays for triaging patients based on the severity of their lung conditions, AI can’t currently diagnose Covid-19 on its own.Even AI models that are thoroughly tested and validated in development need further skepticism, since real-world situations nearly always degrade AI performance. In a recent paper about the diagnosis of malignant moles, researchers noticed that their AI models had learned that medical rulers were often present in images of moles known to be malignant. This has the dual effect of driving accuracy up in the lab but down in the real world.This lesson gives us reason to be dubious of AI systems that attempt to detect fevers from thermal cameras. Surveillance technology company Athena Security claimed that, in the past month, they had adapted their existing software to do just that. Even before it was reported that Athena had allegedly faked the software demonstration, the claim warranted skepticism. While the fever-detecting technology may work well in lab conditions, the software would require a clear and precise view of a person’s inner face, something that could be difficult for a camera to obtain for, say, a person quickly walking into a grocery store. That’s not to mention that the analysis is affected by ambient temperature, humidity, and even the sex of the subject, which, of course, opens the door to bias.Fever detection is a plausible use case of AI, but it will take far more time, effort, and money to build systems that are robust enough to trust. AI predictions are only valuable if they enable an intervention—is the fever detection reliable enough to prevent people from entering a supermarket or pharmacy? The CDC doesn’t think so and would require a confirmatory test in addition to thermal cameras.All this should give you pause when evaluating claims that tout AI as our Covid savior, and that’s before considering the high likelihood that, just as we’ve seen with other applications of machine learning, it will introduce unintended consequences and systemic bias. But while a dose of skepticism is healthy, the near-future impact of AI on some of these applications is bright. AI is a widely applicable technology with tremendous potential, but its advantages need to be hedged in a realistic understanding of its limitations.WIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

CINCINNATI - By leveraging the basics of artificial intelligence technology now used to predict risk for suicide or other mental health issues, researchers developed an AI system that analyzes linguistic patterns to predict a youth's risk for committing acts of school violence.
Study data published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics by physicians and clinical informaticians at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center show the system can detect the risk of aggression for individual subjects.
The AI system uses pattern-recognizing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. It combines the analytical scope and speed of information technology with clinical risk-assessment data and practitioner expertise, thereby automating a complex and time-consuming process, according to Yizhao Ni, PhD, co-principal investigator and a clinical informatician in the Division of Biomedical Informatics.
The technology uncovered multiple warning signs that could deliver useful clinical insights to assist personalized interventions, Ni explained. When fully developed, the system's built-in risk assessment scales and automated risk prediction algorithms should produce an accurate and scalable computerized screening service to prevent school violence.
""Students are physically or verbally bullied on school property, electronically through texting or social media, and youth violence costs society billions of dollars in health care expenses or lost productivity,"" Ni said, citing data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 ""Our study demonstrates that overall, our AI system matches the clinical judgements and accuracy of psychiatrists 94 percent of the time. It has tremendous potential to help address youth violence at school and eventually other mental health conditions.""
Empowering a Solution
Earlier research shows that using NLP and machine learning technologies pioneered at Cincinnati Children's and elsewhere improve risk prediction for mental health problems like suicide. Current study authors note that so far there are no automated solutions developed to predict the risk for violent behaviors at school. 
Recent advancements in school-based crime prevention programs demonstrate the best results occur when at-risk youth receive timely and individualized intervention, according to Drew Barzman, MD, co-principal investigator and director of the Child and Adolescent Forensic Psychiatry Service at Cincinnati Children's.
But high patient need and busy clinical schedules can constrain the ability to complete the complex, labor intensive tasks needed for timely clinical evaluation of mental health patients. An effective automated system could help overcome this challenge and help mental health caregivers deliver timely interventions based on a youth's individual needs, he said.
Study Design
The study was tested by embedding it as a clinical service in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Cincinnati Children's. The division's inpatient units receive about 30,000 psychiatric admissions annually. Its outpatient clinic has over 52,000 patient visits every year.
Conducted between May 2015 and April 2018, the study prospectively recruited 131 students between ages 10 and 18 years from middle and high schools in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee.
Clinical assessments by psychiatrists indicated that 68 students (52 percent) were considered high risk towards others. For analysis with the AI assessment tool, the patients were segmented into smaller groups to compare the system's predictive reliability when compared physician-generated patient clinical assessments. These comparisons yielded the AI system's overall risk assessment match rate of 94 percent.
Future development plans for the tool include seeking research collaborations with other medical institutions and school systems to test live implementation in educational and medical settings, according to the researchers. Researchers said that based on funding capabilities, this will be the next phase of their work. ###
The study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (1R01LM012230, 1U01HG008666, UL1TR001425), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1R21HS024983) and internal funding from Cincinnati Children's.

How Artificial Intelligence Impacts Healthcare



The global healthcare market was valued at $8,452 Bn in 2018 and the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9%. The healthcare costs are also rising, and the industry is actively involved in not only reducing the costs of care but also enhancing the overall caregiving. 
Artificial Intelligence is one such technology — which if invested in and implemented thoroughly can improve the healthcare industry. 
AI technology has mighty applications in the industry, and the outcomes are going to be revolutionizing and impressive if adopted properly. The AI application in healthcare will work towards reducing spending and improving patient outcomes. 
Currently, the influence of AI in healthcare is still at its nascent stage. Even in these early years, you can see a phenomenal improvement in the operations and healthcare costs.
What is the one issue that the healthcare industry faces? There are a lot of tasks that require human intervention, and most of them are repetitive in nature. This consumes a lot of time and energy of the resources, leaving limited to no time for important and core tasks. Apart from this, the patients are not empowered, and there is no system where their care needs can be met instantaneously.
Many healthcare providers are planning to invest in Artificial Intelligence. The initial investment is mostly focused on the admin areas. Gradually, the industry will move its investment in the clinical segments.
#1 Managing the EHR
Electronic health records brought about the much-needed transformation in the healthcare industry. The transition from paper-based records to something more intelligent and improved was worth it. However, with this transition came the limitations of data overload and seemingly long documentation. This led to complexities in handling the data and managing it.
Artificial Intelligence seems to be taking this aspect a bit too seriously and planning to transform it. The idea is to automate most of the processes involved in managing and maintaining these records.
The clinical documentation, which is the most important aspect, involves a lot of time and effort. Combine the Natural Language Processing abilities of AI with voice recognition and dictation, you can process the documents with ease and comfort. With an effective and intuitive UI, you can retrieve the information and even store it effortlessly.
With all the information related to medication and the medical condition available in real-time, doctors can treat the patients with ease, without worrying about the overdose of the drugs. They will be aware of the allergies and infections the patient has, which helps them improve the caregiving. The next set of medications is also recorded in the health records, making it accessible to the users as well.
#2 Virtual Assistance
The second most sought after the influence of AI in the healthcare industry is in the form of a virtual assistant.
Virtual assistance helps the patient overcome their issues and manage their health in a better way. It helps the patients feel empowered and understand their goals better and work towards them. it is almost as if they have an assistant taking personal care of them. This will help the healthcare industry shower in-person care and help the patients recover faster.
The virtual assistants are responsible for timely reminders. These reminders help the patients take their medicines and ensure they don’t miss out on the appointments with the caregiver or the doctor.
In case the patients are on a strict diet, the assistants can help by sharing diet plans, healthy ways of eating and other aspects.
Artificial intelligence comes in many forms from virtual assistance, bots, and digital access to doctors’ care.
Many patients need to procure medicines regularly, which they fail to remember. The virtual assistant will take note of the date when the medicines will finish, and help the patients reorder their medicines for the month.
In case of emergency, the virtual assistant will take remote help from the doctor and get immediate assistance. They will also notify the patients about the upcoming appointments and tests that they need to take before visiting the doctor next.
In short, they will assist and remind the patient for everything needed, thus indulging in self-care goals.
#3 Proactive Care
Earlier, before technology intervention, doctors used to offer reactive care. In this method, the disease was diagnosed, symptoms studied, and then care was offered to them. However, things have changed with AI. You would notice that the systems are not able to study your medical condition and analyze your body to understand the high-risk factors. 
For instance, if you have a family history of diabetes, then the system will monitor your body and keep a close eye on the transforming conditions. The system will immediately identify the symptoms that will lead to diabetes or possible condition. 
When the symptoms are identified, you will receive alerts that will ask you to conduct a test or change your diet. This will majorly depend on the factors identified, the algorithm fed into the machine, and other aspects.
The system will monitor all the factors and offer suggestive healthcare remedies, which will make your life smooth and easy.
#4 Bots for Support
In many cases, the healthcare providers, especially the caregivers are busy throughout the day. This makes it difficult for them to offer patient management and ensure that the patients remember their appointments. They are also unable to keep track of the schedule of the day, and in many cases, they don’t possess all the reports related to the patient.
The bots do a wonderful job of assisting and providing assistance. The bots will not only provide alerts in real-time to the caregivers but also send the alerts to the patients, thus ensuring proper scheduling.
Apart from this, immediate customer service happens to be a tedious affair for the stakeholders of the healthcare industry. With bots, the physicians and other caregivers can support the patient immediately, and ensure they get timely solutions.
#5 Personalized Services
Personalize services in the healthcare industry are possible with every segment of the healthcare industry. For instance, healthcare insurance is an important part of the industry. Most people look for options that suit their requirements, premium budget, and other factors. 
AI will consider everything and offer personalized insurance solutions that cater to your needs. It will also consider the external factors responsible for the choice before helping you choose the right insurance solution.
Caregiving is an important part of the healthcare industry. Personalizing the treatment plan can improve the patient’s health and empower them. For instance, the same treatment cannot be given to two different individuals. Though they are suffering from the same problem. One person would be allergic to a particular component while the other may not. 
You will need to devise the treatment plan after considering all the factors, medical history, diagnosis, and family history. It is impossible for you to go through all this data and build the insights correctly — that’s why you need AI. 
Incorporating this technology, you will be able to offer personalized treatment plans, and ensure better facilities for the patient. To know more about how Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing eCommerce, you can refer to this blog to know 5 different ways how it is transforming the industry. 
Summing Up
A lot of healthcare organizations and hospitals are upping their game by investing a good amount in Artificial Intelligence and using the latest Artificial Intelligence frameworks and tools. They aim to improve their services and offer better care management. From advancing their diagnosis to improving their treatment methods, the stakeholders are working towards offering fulfilling solutions to healthcare issues. 
In combination with Blockchain and IoT, AI will offer impressive solutions to the healthcare industry, and there are many reasons why Artificial Intelligence is important. Moreover, share your views on AI and how it will revolutionize different industries.

Researchers unveil a pruning algorithm to make artificial intelligence applications run faster

                                        by Kim Martineau,                                                                                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology







                MIT researchers have proposed a technique for shrinking deep learning models that they say is simpler and produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods.

As more artificial intelligence applications move to smartphones, deep learning models are getting smaller to allow apps to run faster and save battery power. Now, MIT researchers have a new and better way to compress models.





It's so simple that they unveiled it in a tweet last month: Train the model, prune its weakest connections, retrain the model at its fast, early training rate, and repeat, until the model is as tiny as you want.
""That's it,"" says Alex Renda, a Ph.D. student at MIT. ""The standard things people do to prune their models are crazy complicated.""
Renda discussed the technique when the International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR) convened remotely this month. Renda is a co-author of the work with Jonathan Frankle, a fellow Ph.D. student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and Michael Carbin, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science—all members of the Computer Science and Artificial Science Laboratory.
The search for a better compression technique grew out of Frankle and Carbin's award-winning Lottery Ticket Hypothesis paper at ICLR last year. They showed that a deep neural network could perform with only one-tenth the number of connections if the right subnetwork was found early in training. Their revelation came as demand for computing power and energy to train ever larger deep learning models was increasing exponentially, a trend that continues to this day. Costs of that growth include a rise in planet-warming carbon emissions and a potential drop in innovation as researchers not affiliated with big tech companies compete for scarce computing resources. Everyday users are affected, too. Big AI models eat up mobile-phone bandwidth and battery power.






The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis triggered a series of mostly theoretical follow-on papers. But at a colleague's suggestion, Frankle decided to see what lessons it might hold for pruning, in which a search algorithm trims the number of nodes evaluated in a search tree. The field had been around for decades, but saw a resurgence after the breakout success of neural networks at classifying images in the ImageNet competition. As models got bigger, with researchers adding on layers of artificial neurons to boost performance, others proposed techniques for whittling them down.
Song Han, now an assistant professor at MIT, was one pioneer. Building on a series of influential papers, Han unveiled a pruning algorithm he called AMC, or AutoML for model compression, that's still the industry standard. Under Han's technique, redundant neurons and connections are automatically removed, and the model is retrained to restore its initial accuracy.
In response to Han's work, Frankle recently suggested in an unpublished paper that results could be further improved by rewinding the smaller, pruned model to its initial parameters, or weights, and retraining the smaller model at its faster, initial rate.
In the current ICLR study, the researchers realized that the model could simply be rewound to its early training rate without fiddling with any parameters. In any pruning regimen, the tinier a model gets, the less accurate it becomes. But when the researchers compared this new method to Han's AMC or Frankle's weight-rewinding methods, it performed better no matter how much the model shrank.
It's unclear why the pruning technique works as well as it does. The researchers say they will leave that question for others to answer. As for those who wish to try it, the algorithm is as easy to implement as other pruning methods, without time-consuming tuning, the researchers say.
""It's the pruning algorithm from the 'Book,'"" says Frankle. ""It's clear, generic, and drop-dead simple.""
Han, for his part, has now partly shifted focus from compression AI models to channeling AI to design small, efficient models from the start. His newest method, Once for All, also debuts at ICLR. Of the new learning rate method, he says: ""I'm happy to see new pruning and retraining techniques evolve, giving more people access to high-performing AI applications.""

Using data has been an important element of Bayer Crop Science for decades, but the organization got a real data-driven shot in the arm with Bayer’s 2018 acquisition of Monsanto. Since then, it has sought to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to every aspect of its business.
One area where AI is playing an increasingly important role is precision agriculture. Traditional farming today means planting your field with seeds, spraying the entire field with fertilizer and pesticides, and irrigating the entire field. But fields aren’t uniform: The soil isn’t necessarily the same across the field, some parts need more fertilizer or less; some areas need more water or less; and so on. Precision agriculture seeks to bring more intelligence to the process.
[ Learn the secrets of highly successful data analytics teams. | Beware the 12 myths of data analytics and the sure-fire ways organizations fail at data analytics. | Get the latest on data analytics by signing up for CIO newsletters. ]
“For precision planting and precision farming, companies like Bayer work really closely with the farmers to understand their land, their acreage, the type of soil they have, the water flow, and then work with them,” says Michelle Lacy, data strategy lead for R&D in the Plant Biotechnology Division at Bayer Crop Science. “These are the best seeds; these are the best plant breeds that work well in this area of your farm. Planting the right seed type — the right corn line or soybean line or what have you — that will thrive in that soil type or the amount of water or nitrogen that you have. That’s precision farming.”











 
 
 
This data-driven approach to agriculture requires data to be collected by farmers and their equipment, such as combines that take soil measurements as they work; third parties, including academics and government employees; and Bayer Crop Science employees.

Bayer is now leveraging image analytics powered by TIBCO Spotfire visual analytics as part of that effort. It uses drones that take high-definition pictures to monitor crops. Plant height, color/greenness, and whether plants are diseased or infested with insects can be captured by images. A machine learning algorithm processes those images and blends the data with data about the soil, irrigation, and fertilization to provide in-depth insights into each part of a field. Bayer Crop Science uses TIBCO Data Virtualization software to understand the various data sources and schemas and bring them together without altering the physical source.
“In the past you’d have folks go in and walk the field and take measurements and observations on clipboards,” Lacy says. “They still do that to some extent, but for large data capture, that’s the use case where we use drones.”











 
 
 
Reaping value from drone data
In addition to helping farmers, that data also drives Bayer Crop Science’s research into new plant strains. The images can be used to compare an insect-resistant or disease-resistant strain against control groups. In areas affected by tornados, AI can stitch together drone images to show which crops stood up or fell over during storms.
“It’s hard to know how much damage you have just by eyeballing it because corn plants are really tall,” Lacy says. “So being able to fly over it and assess the damage is another use case for image analytics and our drones. It’s just faster. We can get information either to our labs or our farmers a lot quicker.”
Lacy says one key to Bayer Crop Science’s data-driven transformation has been its adherence to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles. FAIR is a sort of data bill of rights that says users should be able to find their data easily, users should be able to access the data they need when making decisions (while still following cyber security policies), data should be interoperable, and data should be reusable.











 
 
 
“It’s extremely important,” Lacy says. “It’s the foundation of our data strategy.”

Often, data developed by one group can be helpful to work undertaken by other groups. To make efficient use of the data, the various groups need to know the data exists and how to find it, and the data must be compatible.
“If you’re running various assays on a single plant, whether it’s field assays or you’re running different experiments in a lab, you’ve got to be able to bring that data together,” Lacy says. “You can think of it as a jigsaw puzzle and all these different assays you run are pieces of that puzzle. The project lead has to put those pieces back together.”

ECS Federal won a small contract on a big topic: $83 million for prototyping integrated artificial intelligence platforms for the U.S. Army.
The work will take place over the next three years under a cost-plus fixed-fee contract to account for additional costs that may be incurred, according to the award notice. The Army says it is undergoing a “foundational” year for data migration and IT modernization that will form the basis of future deployments of AI. ECS will research and prototype platforms that the service’s future algorithms could be built on.
The Army is exploring AI’s use in the battlefield and in back-office operations. Some systems have run into roadblocks that need stronger data collection or more-mature AI technology, like the platforms ECS might deliver. The notice did not include details on the platforms ECS will be researching and developing.
The service’s leadership continues to highlight the technology’s role in the military. “AI has become the coin of the realm,” Alexander Miller, a senior adviser for science and technology in the Army, said during a NextGov event today.

AWS Announces General Availability of Amazon Augmented Artificial Intelligence (A2I)








Source: Amazon










Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Augmented Artificial Intelligence (A2I), a fully managed service that makes it easy to add human review to machine learning predictions to improve model and application accuracy by continuously identifying and improving low confidence predictions. Amazon A2I helps developers add human review for model predictions to new or existing applications using reviewers from Mechanical Turk, third party vendors, or their own employees. Amazon A2I makes it easier for developers to build the human review system, structure the review process, and manage the human review workforce. For example, developers could use Amazon A2I to quickly spin up and manage a workforce of humans to review and validate the accuracy of machine learning predictions for an application that extracts financial information from scanned mortgage documents or an application that uses image recognition to identify counterfeit items online, so that the quality of results improve over time. There are no upfront commitments to use Amazon A2I, and users pay only for each review needed. To get started with Amazon A2I, visit aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai
Today, machine learning provides highly accurate predictions (known as “inferences”) for a variety of use cases, including identifying objects in images, extracting text from scanned documents, or transcribing and understanding spoken language. In each case, machine learning models provide an inference and a confidence score that expresses how certain the model is in its prediction. The higher the confidence number, the more the result can be trusted. Typically, when developers receive a high confidence result they can trust that the prediction is accurate, and, depending on the use case, they can use it to fully automate a process. For example, developers of a social media application that matches a user’s photos to celebrity faces might rely on an 80% confidence score to generate and return a lot of entertaining matches. However, there are other times when it is strongly recommended to have both high confidence (up to 99%) and human review, such as public safety use cases involving law enforcement. In situations where the confidence score is lower than desired and/or human judgment is required, reviews can be used to validate the prediction. This interplay between machine learning and human reviewers is critical to the success of machine learning systems, but human reviews are challenging and expensive to build and operate at scale, often involving multiple workflow steps, operating custom software to manage human review tasks and results, and recruiting and managing large groups of reviewers. As a result, developers sometimes spend more time managing the human review process than building the intended application, or they have to forego having human reviews, which leads to less confidence in deploying applications that utilize machine learning.
With Amazon A2I, developers can add human review to machine learning applications without the need to build or manage expensive and cumbersome systems for human review. Amazon A2I provides over 60 pre-built human review workflows for common machine learning tasks (e.g. object detection in images, transcription of speech, and content moderation, etc.) that allow machine learning predictions from Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract to be human-reviewed more easily. Developers who build custom machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker (or other on-premises or cloud tools) can set up human review for their specific use case in the Augmented AI console or via its Application Programming Interface (API). After setting a confidence threshold for model predictions, developers can choose to have predictions below that threshold reviewed by Amazon Mechanical Turk and its 500,000 global workforce of independent contractors, third-party organizations who specialize in business process outsourcing (e.g. iVision, CapeStart Inc., and iMerit), or their own private, in-house reviewers. Developers can specify the number of workers per review and Amazon A2I then routes each review to the precise number of reviewers. For example, a company building a system for processing financial loan applications using Amazon Textract can easily configure Amazon A2I to work with Amazon Textract outputs such that forms that have a confidence score less than 99% will be routed to human reviewers from their private workforce. Human-validated results are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and developers can set up Amazon CloudWatch Events notifications to review metadata about inference accuracy and retrieve the results.
“We often hear from our customers that Amazon SageMaker helps speed training, tuning, and deploying custom machine learning models, while fully managed services like Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract make it easy to build applications that incorporate machine learning without requiring any machine learning expertise. But even with these advancements, our customers still say there are critical use cases where human judgment is required like in law enforcement investigations, or times when human review can be used to resolve the ambiguity in predictions when confidence levels fall below a given threshold for less sensitive use cases, and the current human review process involves a lot of custom effort and cost,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Today, we’re excited to help our customers remove another obstacle to building machine learning applications with the launch of Amazon A2I, which makes it significantly easier and faster to incorporate human judgment into machine learning applications in order to ensure higher quality predictions over a sustained period of time.”
Amazon A2I is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU West (London), EU West (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai).
National Health Service, Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) is part of the UK National Health Service and provides a range of support services to NHS organizations, NHS contractors, and patients. As part of their business process services, they process 54 million paper prescriptions and other healthcare documents each month. “The NHS is investing in the promise of AI to improve the quality of public healthcare across the UK. Human judgment is critical and in fact is often required for decisions involving medical payments,” said Chris Suter, Head of Cloud Platforms and Innovation, NHS BSA. “Amazon Textract is compelling because it offers AI powered extraction of text and structured data from virtually any document. We are excited about Amazon Augmented AI because it allows us to take advantage of machine learning while still applying human judgment. That’s a game changer for us.”
As America’s Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc. is redefining the way consumers and businesses buy wireless services through leading product and service innovation. “Providing relevant information, such as account details and available discounts, in real time to our customer care agents while they are in live conversations with customers is one of the ways T-Mobile uses machine learning to improve customer experience. Using A2I, we will be able to ensure that our models continuously deliver top-quality insights by having humans validate random samples of model predictions,” said Heather Nollis, Machine Learning Engineer, T-Mobile. “Trust is the hardest thing to build when it comes to machine learning, and A2I will allow us to make sure that our models are making the fewest mistakes.”
Deloitte is helping transform organizations around the globe. The organization continuously evolves how it works and how it looks at marketplace challenges so it can continue to deliver measurable, sustainable results for its clients and communities. “Part of setting our clients up for success is helping them leverage the latest technology. Using machine learning enables us to help improve our clients’ systems and boost their productivity while reducing time to market for products, services, and applications. As part of providing the latest advancements in ML to our clients, we see the benefits of human-in-the-loop systems adding an extra layer of confidence to ML applications,” said Beena Ammanath, Managing Director at Deloitte Consulting LLP. “Our clients in the insurance industry, for example, could use A2I to help verify the accuracy of ML models for automated image-based vehicle damage detection and analysis of text-based insurance claims. We’re excited to see the many ways our clients across industries could benefit from incorporating A2I into their ML workflows.”
Belle Fleur believes the machine learning revolution is altering the way we live, work, and relate to one another, and will transform every business in every industry. “We started using Amazon Textract with one of our financial services clients and quickly realized that coupling that service with Amazon A2I allows them to go through huge quantities of documents and extract relevant data needed for their clients. Adding Amazon A2I helped us incorporate human judgment for documents that require contextual interpretation and validate the data,” said Tia Dubuisson, President at Belle Fleur. “Not only did this decrease the time spent on human validation, but it also pulled all the relevant extracted data into one place in an easy to understand workflow for reviewers so that they are able to quickly and easily review machine learning outputs from Amazon Textract. Amazon A2I not only provides us and our customers peace of mind that the more nuanced data extracted is reviewed by humans, but it also helps train and improve our machine learning models over time through continuous auditing and improvement.”

The cluster’s focus areas will include artificial intelligence (AI), character and video recognition, document analysis and biometrics. Immensely popular fields world-wide, AI research is growing at an incredible rate, with many applications being translated for industry use. According to Accenture, AI has the potential to add US$957 billion, or 15 percent of India’s current gross value in 2035.
UTS already conducts extensive research in these areas in its Centre for Artificial Intelligence and School of Software. ISI has built strong expertise via research undertaken in its Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit.
Both institutions have strong research groups, capabilities with complementary strengths, and a joint body of work in the fields. Building on ISI and UTS expertise, the research cluster enables accelerated collaboration between researchers from both institutions to grow the scale of research.
The cluster will also enable PhD students from India and Australia to work together closely, including in lab space in India made available by ISI.
Dr Umapada Pal at ISI and I have collaborated for many years, and it’s wonderful to now see our “research cooperation take the next step,” said Professor Michael Blumenstein, Associate Dean at the UTS Faculty of Engineering and IT.
“With ISI being one of India’s key academic institutions, this joint cluster will create further linkages between our academics and offer an exceptional opportunity for UTS staff and students working with ISI experts.”
During a recent visit to ISI, UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor International Iain Watt noted, “The signing of this JRC is a culmination of years of academic cooperation and development of a strong friendship. ISI making available lab and research space in Kolkata for UTS staff and students is fantastic, and will further strengthen our partnership.”
ISI Deputy Director Dipti Prasad Mukherjee said, “The recently signed Memorandum of Understanding and Joint Research Cluster initiative between Indian Statistical Institute and UTS will enable the two institutions to grow international research collaborations in the broad area of artificial intelligence, including pattern recognition and computer vision.
“There also exist opportunities to partner with industry, seek out international funds, and strengthen our cooperation through jointly supervised PhD students.“
This collaboration enables UTS and ISI to respond to research challenges at an international level, and generate practical software solutions that address real-world problems in the areas of health,
document analysis, drone-based technologies, as well as various other applications of AI and machine learning.
There are also potential partnership opportunities to provide research solutions to national and global companies.

As AI enters the workplace, we need to reflect upon the criteria by which human work is evaluated and human subjectivity depicted.
Phoebe V Moore
Control panels are the obvious place to run operations centrally.
The control rooms of Star Trek’s fantastical Enterprise (and the hub of
the actual Project Cybersyn under Chile’s radical president Salvador Allende) in
the 1960s and 70s were however operated by humans with relatively primitive
technologies. 
Today, much of the work of the people we imagined in
these rooms—the bouffanted women in silver A-line dresses and men in blue boiler
suits pushing buttons to operate the manoeuvres of galactical imperialism—is
done by computers. But what will happen when the proverbial windows looking out
to the galaxies only display a cadre of robots and the control panels’ blinking
lights are the only reflective glimmer?

So-called Industries 2.0-4.0 have
seen an onslaught of machines and machinic competences in the workplace control
rooms of today, via robotic process automation, semi-automation, machine
learning and algorithmic management systems. Digitalised workplace design and
surveillance techniques are oriented around the rise in new technologies, where
the processing and quantification of workers’ data is seen to be necessary for
a company’s competitivness.
People analytics
The contingent technology for
workplace processes to reach a new pinnacle of computational sophistication is
the rise in artificial-intelligence
tools and applications. AI allows semi-automation of decision-making
processes via machine learning, which is particularly applicable in the case of
human-resource driven ‘people analytics’ (PA), where predictions and
prescriptions about job candidates and workers—or ‘data subjects’ as the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) puts it—can now be made based on quantification
techniques applied to data sets. 
Put simply, with the use of PA,
we are asking machines to relay truths, or subjective images about other people,
via computation. While we once expected the machine to mirror the human, we now
seem to be looking into a machinic mirror for our own reflection and those of
others. The full implications of this ‘mirror stage’ of capitalism—to borrow a
phrase from the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan—are yet to be played out but are exceedingly
important.

For Lacan, the mirror stage was
the moment in which the child realises her separation from the rest of her
environment. The mirror stage for what I am calling ‘smart workers’ within
capitalism today must be a moment of defying the assumption that we are inexorably
subsumed into a machinic subject, retaining the firm scaffolding of what makes
us human and posing resistance to a purportedly automatic domination. Given growing
expectations that AI will become universal, to avoid the most negative
implications it implies for workplaces and workers with regards to automation
and surveillance, it is increasingly important to exercise reflexivity and retain
our human autonomy, as decision-making about workers is increasingly based on
quantification and automation. 
Machine learning
People analytics is perhaps the best-known
form of AI-augmented workplace tool. Generally speaking, PA is a set of human-resource
(HR) activities which rely on a process whereby managers can identify patterns
and compare them across data sets collected about workers. 
The AI component in PA lies in how algorithms
are set up to make the decisions, via machine-learning procedures. Big data,
algorithms and machine learning are central in digitalised recruitment, where
decisions about talent spotting, interviewing, leadership prediction, individual
worker performance, health patterns across workers and other operational
management issues can be digitally assisted. 
Indeed, machines become the mirror for
workers’ subjectivities via quantification. Predictions are made about
applicants regarding aptitude and job fit—and, once workers are in position, many
things can be assessed, ranging from the diligence of their work to their
likelihood for disengagement.  
A Deloitte report indicates that 71 per cent of international companies have reported they value PA and see it as a priority, because it allows management to conduct ‘real-time analytics at the point of need in the business process … [and] allows for a deeper understanding of issues and actionable insights for the business’ to deal with what have been called ‘people issues’. In other HR-related reports, the revelations of ‘people risks’ and ‘people problems’ which PA can unveil throw the concept of the mirror phase of capitalism into sharp relief: who are we (humans), in the machine’s reflection? 
Increased stress
PA is likely to increase workers’ stress if
data are used in appraisals and performance management without due diligence in
process and implementation, leading to complaints about micromanagement and
feeling spied on. If workers know their data are being read
for talent spotting or deciding possible layoffs, they may feel pressurised to
advance their performance, and begin to overwork, posing significant risks. Another risk arises with liability, where
companies’ claims about predictive capacities may later be queried for accuracy
or personnel departments held accountable for discrimination. 
Indeed, if algorithmic decision-making in PA
does not involve human intervention and ethical
considerations, this HR tool could expose workers to heightened structural,
physical and psychosocial risks and stress. How can workers be sure
decisions are being made fairly, accurately and honestly, if they do not have
access to the data held and used by their employer? This should be dealt with
to some extent in the European Union context with the GDPR but that is by no
means a fait accompli. 
PA practices are particularly worrying if they lead to
workplace restructuring, job replacement, job-description changes and the like.
In any case, the use of machine learning to make predictions and provide
analyses about people relies
on specific kinds of intelligences prioritised under capitalism—efficiency,
reliability, competitiveness and other data-driven imperatives—which may or may
not reflect who individuals are, or would like to be, in modern society.
Research necessary
Many high-level governmental and
organisational reports are predicting that AI will improve productivity,
enhance economic growth and lead to prosperity for all—in a similar way ‘scientific
management’ was once heralded. As with scientific management, however, high-level
discussions do not seem to link the anticipated prosperity directly with the
realities of the everyday (and everynight) human work which ultimately fuels
growth. Meanwhile, various AI-augmented tools and applications are being
introduced to improve productivity, in factories and offices and ‘gig’ work. 
There is a lot of research on automation
but not on how AI, as a form of semi-automation, carves out the capacity for
substitution of human activities in the workplace. There is also extensive
research on surveillance, but again not scrutinising how AI facilitates
advances in surveillance in the workplace. 
Scholarly and governmental research on these subjects should take AI seriously by putting a metaphorical mirror into place for social reflection about how these processes occur and on which assumptions they rest—rather than presenting AI merely as forms of autonomous software and immutable techniques for facilitation. While there have been significant inroads in climate, medical, fashion, insurance and justice-systems research, studies on AI’s uses to evaluate workers and aptitudes through quantification are lagging behind. Stories of discrimination and bias are already making headline news where PA has been applied and, without reflection on the mistakes made in AI and quantified analyses of workers, this is set to continue and even get worse. 
Digital democracy
The rise in data accumulation in
recent times and the reliance on algorithms for workplace decisions has led to
the possible removal of the role of the physical manager through a machinic
system. If workers were to take over workplace control rooms through deciding
which tools and processes are applied, digital democracy at work could
be imagined. 
But the use of AI
undemocratically could just as easily occur and lead to the removal altogether
of human autonomy, via automation, from workplace decision-making and tasks. The
current Covid-19 crisis has also led to the rise in online working, giving
increased leeway for quantified judgements and machinic management.   
More research is needed in these
areas, to get a full picture of what AI will mean and, in many cases, already means for human-machine relations in workplaces. What
precisely are the types of
intelligences which we expect today from
machines and are these really reflective of human intelligence? Why do we
choose the categories of intelligence that we do, and how are data collection
and processing activities relevant to the affective side of the human
experience? 
Perhaps most importantly, what
are the surrounding risks for workers as technology advances and as we begin to
question our own role in production and think about that of the machine, as AI
is set to increase its autonomy? The question more broadly for humanity
is: who do we think we are as we reach the mirror stage in capitalism, where we
should realise we are separate and retain autonomy from
a machinic subject? 
As we busily instal machines into workplaces via robotics and management tools with seemingly superior intelligence to ourselves, we should ask: in whose (or which) reflection are we now looking?

There is no hotter topic in the world of IT than artificial intelligence (AI). A good low-cost introduction to the fields of speech and image recognition as well as other aspects of AI is the Maixduino board which, including the fitted camera and small LCD panel, comes in at only around €30/£25/$35; what’s more, it can readily be programmed using the familiar Arduino IDE. In the first installment of this series we will look at the comprehensive array of hardware offered by the Maixduino and at a couple of demonstration programs, including one that can recognize 1000 different objects.  The use of artificial intelligence is on the increase in many areas, and it is finding its way into many types of device and application. This year it is estimated that worldwide business applications in the field of artificial intelligence will generate revenues of some $4.8bn, and that figure is predicted to rise to over $30bn by 2025. Anyone with knowledge of the subject area can look forward to enhanced employment prospects, as expertise in artificial intelligence is urgently sought after. It is therefore worthwhile to take a little time to get to grips with the topic and the new worlds of possible applications that it opens up. And, last but not least, it’s a lot of fun!
The term ‘artificial intelligence’ is generally considered to cover the creation of systems exhibiting intelligent behaviour. One part of this is ‘machine learning’, whereby instead of having an application function specified in all its detail by the developer, a general-purpose programming framework in the form of a neural network (NN) is used, which learns the required function by itself using a large corpus of training data. One class of machine learning is called ‘deep learning’, where more complex and optimized program structures are used to improve results further. We will be looking at these ideas in more detail later in this short series of articles.
However, artificial intelligence is not a new subject: its beginnings can be traced back to the 1950s. The breakthrough that occurred a few years ago was the result of considerable increases in the amount of computational power available. Graphics cards with hundreds of processor cores operating in parallel and highly-specialized artificial intelligence chips enabled artificial intelligence systems to be implemented and trained. That opened the door to automatic speech recognition, as used in many personal assistants, and image recognition of objects of all kinds. artificial intelligence also plays an important role in autonomous vehicles. In some areas AI has already surpassed human abilities: artificial intelligence systems can beat world champions in the games of chess and go, and can detect tumours more reliably than human medical specialists. But do not worry: the systems are only superior in the particular areas in which they have been trained, and the areas in which the systems are trained will continue to be chosen by humans.

A low-cost introduction
A good low-cost introduction to this world is the Maixduino, which in the form of the ‘MAix BiT’ kit including the board, camera and small LCD panel can be obtained from Elektor: see the text box. The board has the same format as an Arduino Uno (from which it gets its name), but the hardware it includes is considerably more comprehensive. The board is manufactured by the Chinese company Sipeed. Alternatives to the Maixduino include the Nvidia Jetson Nano, the ROCK PI N10 Model A, the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 and others, but these all cost considerably more.
In this first installment of this series we will look at the rich hardware environment offered by the Maixduino and how it can be programmed with the help of the Arduino IDE. As well as a couple of typical Arduino-esque applications, we will look at how to use the camera and the screen. And the final highlight will be a demonstration of how to use the board to recognize objects.
In the second and third installments we will delve deeper into the topic of artificial intelligence, describe the structure of neural networks, install MicroPython and its accompanying IDE and demonstrate how facial recognition works. We will also look at how you can program your own AI applications and how to communicate with the Internet.

A deep dive into the ‘super Arduino’
The specifications of the Maixduino will have hardware enthusiasts licking their lips! The overall size and construction of the board is broadly aligned with that of the Arduino Uno, but you will immediately notice the higher component density and that many additional connections are available. At the heart of the board there are two large modules. The first is the Sipeed M1 AI processor module based on the Kendryte K210 device, whose interior workings we will look at later, and the second is an ESP32 module for communicating over WLAN and Bluetooth and for acquiring analogue signals. The ESP32 contains two processor cores clocked at 240 MHz and so by itself offers a considerable amount of processing power, and it can be used to offload communication functions from the main processors. The ESP32 has already featured in many articles in this magazine, and so we will not go into further detail about it here.
The header connectors correspond in number and arrangement to the original Arduino, and the pin assignments are mostly identical. But beware that the inputs and outputs are designed for 3.3 V or even 1.8 V operation, and the input circuitry will be destroyed if 5 V is applied.
Further details are shown in Figure 1. Two 24-pin sockets are provided for interfacing to the camera and to the LCD panel. A slot is provided for a microSD card which can be used to make a large amount of storage available to the Maixduino. The USB connector is the modern type-C kind and is used for programming and monitoring. And, to allow the processing of audio data, the board includes a digital microphone and an audio amplifier with a 3 W output driven by a digital-to-analogue converter. So there is plenty of hardware on the board to let you get started on a range of possible projects without having to add extra boards.


Figure 1: The hardware facilities offered by the Maixduino.


The pinout of the board (see Figure 2) closely resembles the original. The supply voltage can be provided over the DC barrel jack or using the VIN pin at 6 V to 12 V; alternatively, 5 V can be supplied over the USB connector. Six of the ESP32’s GPIOs are brought out; these are the ones that can alternatively be used as analogue inputs A0 to A5. On the opposite edge of the board are the inputs and outputs of the K210 module. These can be controlled using the usual Arduino commands, with the ‘Arduino pin number’ being the number of the input or output bit of the K210.


Figure 2: Maixduino pinout.


 
#define LED 12            // K210 IO12, Maixduino pin 10
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);     // configure port as output
digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);  // port to high (3.3 V)
 
The RST pin is designed to operate at 1.8 V and external circuitry should not apply a higher voltage than that to it. Outputs IO36 to IO47 are also designed for low-voltage operation: these are not brought out to the headers, but are used internally, for example to drive the LCD panel. The serial RX and TX ports and the I2C interface are provided with suitable pull-up resistors fitted on the board.
Unfortunately the K210 datasheet does not specify the maximum output current available at the outputs. However, they should be capable of driving an LED at up to say 10 mA or so; for higher currents a driver IC should be added.

The big enchilada: Kendryte K210
The K210 SoC (system on a chip) made by the Chinese company Kendryte is at the heart of the Maixduino. It is made using a low-power silicon technology on a 28 nm process and has been available on the market since September 2018. For carrying out ‘normal’ work it offers two 64-bit processor cores that are clocked at 400 MHz, with overclocking up to 800 MHz possible. These cores are based on the RISC-V specification: this saves the manufacturer from having to pay licensing fees to Arm and so helps to contribute to the low total cost of the device. Both processors come with an FPU (floating-point unit) that operates in both single and double precision. Figure 3 shows in more detail what is inside this chip.


Figure 3: Block diagram of the Kendryte K210.


The special feature of the K210, however, is its KPU (knowledge processing unit) that can be used to construct and execute neural networks. The total compute power available is astonishing at this price point: 0.46 Tops, or 460 billion operations per second. With overclocking this figure can even be doubled, allowing, for example, up to 60 objects per second to be recognized. The high processing performance is achieved using 64 arithmetic units operating in parallel and a bus width of 576 bits. Also, the power dissipation of just 0.3 W is very low in comparison to other artificial intelligence systems. For example, Nvidia recommends using a 5 V 4 A (hence 20 W) power supply for its Jetson Nano, which at 0.4 Tops offers comparable computing power.
The KPU can implement advanced neural network architectures, including convolutional networks. These have a particularly efficient filter structure that makes them especially well suited to image processing applications: more on this in the second instalment of this series. The main memory included in the SoC has a capacity of 8 MB, divided into 2 MB for the main processors and 6 MB for the KPU. That means that up to 5.9 MB is available for storing the neural network configuration, which is enough to implement a medium-sized network.
However, the K210 has more hardware tricks up its sleeve. These include an audio processing unit (APU) which is particularly helpful for pre-processing in speech recognition applications. The unit can handle up to 8 channels (or 4 stereo channels) at input sample rates of up to 192 kHz. An FFT (fast Fourier transform) unit is available to carry out analysis of the frequency spectrum of a signal.
Also noteworthy are the AES and SHA-256 accelerators provided to speed up cryptographic functions.
And of course the device includes the usual complement of peripherals including UART, I2C, SPI, I2S, timer, RTC and PWM.
Sipeed has added 16 MB of flash memory on the board alongside power supply circuitry, the microphone and 3 W power amplifier, and the excellent ESP32 module.

Software development
It is not just the shape of the board that is similar to the original Arduino: the board uses the same Arduino IDE, with the Maixduino core being integrated into the environment in the same way as the ESP8266 or ESP32. Under File -> Preferences it is necessary to add a new board manager URL: if you right-click on the button to the right of the text entry box a small window will open to make entering the URL easier (see Figure 4). If you only want to program the Maixduino, then only the ‘sipeed’ line needs to be added; then the on-board ESP32 will also be programmed using it.


Figure 4: Adding the Maixduino core configuration.


To install the Maixduino board tools select the menu item Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager. Enter the search term ‘Maix’ (as shown in Figure 5) and then proceed to install the tools.


Figure 5: Installation of the Maixduino core tools.


Now we can start to do some programming. Rather than the conventional ‘hello world’ program, we will jump straight into to testing the camera and screen. Connect the Maixduino over USB and in the Tools menu set the following parameters.
 
Board: Sipeed Maixduino
CPU Clock Frequency: 400 MHz
Burn Tool Firmware: open-ec
Burn Baud Rate: 1.5 Mbps
Tool Install Location: Standard
Port: <COM port that you are using>
Programmer: k-flash
 
A demonstration program that captures an image and displays it on the LCD is already available within the IDE. Call it up using File Examples Sipeed_OV2640 selfie and once it is uploaded to the board (you may need to press the reset button at this point) you can run it. The code is shown in Figure 6.


Figure 6: Arduino IDE with the ‘selfie’ program.


The program starts by bringing in the functions from the Sipeed libraries for driving the camera and LCD, which are connected to the board using an SPI bus. The image format chosen is QVGA resolution (320 by 240 pixels) with RGB565 colour. The setup routine initializes both devices, and in the main infinite loop the captured images are transferred directly to the LCD: it could hardly be simpler.
The image is not particularly contrasty, but it is sharp and updates are smooth. Figure 7 shows the results.


Figure 7: Captured image of an adaptor plug.


As you can see, the Maixduino is as easy to use as an Arduino Uno. However it offers many more possibilities and we can immediately start to build more sophisticated applications.

Our first AI model
We will be looking in more detail at deep learning aspects of artificial intelligence in the second article in this series, but here we can demonstrate a simple application. We will be using ‘MobileNet’: nothing to do with mobile phones, but rather an image classifier that can recognize and identify 1000 types of everyday objects. This uses a neural network, which is a software structure built from nodes organized in layers trained using a lengthy process in which it is presented with thousands of images.
Since the file containing the training image set runs to some 200 GB and the training process itself is very time-consuming, it is not really practical to carry it out on the Maixduino. However, it is possible to install a ready-trained model and immediately set it to work recognizing images. The steps to achieve this are as follows.
 
The required software can be found here. It consists of the following components.
 
mobilnet_v1.ino: main C++ program for running the demonstration
MBNet_1000.h: header file for the demonstration routines
MBNet_1000.cpp: C++ routines for acquiring, recognizing and displaying objects
names.h: header file with object descriptions
names.cpp: C++ routine for describing the recognized objects
 
Download these files and place them all in the same directory. The pre-trained artificial intelligence model mobilenet_0x300000.kfpkg can be downloaded from link [5]: compressed, it is just a few megabytes long. After decompressing it with 7zip you should find a folder mobilenet_0x300000 in which there are two files: the model is the one called ‘m’. Copy this file onto a microSD card in the root (top-level) directory and insert the card into the slot on the Maixduino.
A glance at the program code in Figure 8 shows that it is possible to program even very complex applications with little effort. That is of course all down to the powerful libraries: in the field of artificial intelligence there are very many highly efficient libraries available. The first part of the program declares the camera, LCD and the KPU along with their parameters. The camera resolution is configured to the same format as the training images, 224 by 224 pixels. Finally, the object mbnet marshals together the KPU, camera and LCD resources.


Figure 8: MobileNet demonstration program.


The setup routine initializes the demonstration code, and then in the main loop we have the classification of the objects in the images acquired by the camera and their display on the LCD panel. Again, it is hard to imagine that an object recognition program could be any simpler.
As a test we can put a photograph of a cat in front of the camera (as shown in Figure 9). The system immediately recognizes it as a tabby or Egyptian cat (Figure 10). The application is capable of classifying about five images per second and is therefore capable of producing useful results even if the camera is moving. The most important things are to have good lighting and not too busy a background to the image.


Figure 9: Acquisition of an image of an object.




Figure 10: The object is identified and classified.


As can be seen from Figure 10 the acquired image uses only a blue and white colour palette, in the interests of increasing the recognition rate. This is a commonly-used method: instead of using all three colour channels in an image we use only one to reduce the amount of pixel data and hence the amount of processing power required. The technique of using a ready-trained network, or in other words of carrying out training and classification on different platforms, is also widespread in this type of application. Many users take advantage of the large amounts of processing power available on AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud to train their neural networks, while running them (which requires considerably less in the way of resources) on smaller-scale platforms. The semiconductor industry is already responding to this demand: Intel recently announced their Nervana NNP-T and NNP-I neural network processors, where the ‘T’ version offers higher processing power for training, and the ‘I’ version is a lower-performance device aimed at inference and classification applications.

Coming up...
The demonstration application we have looked at in this article can only scratch the surface of the topic of artificial intelligence, but with luck your interest in the possibilities of machines that learn has been piqued.
In the next instalment of this series we will look at the structure and function of a neural network in more detail. That will come with a new development environment: we will be introduced to the temptations of Linux and the Python programming language, as that is where the most powerful libraries and frameworks are available. These frameworks make the creation of a neural network as easy as plugging together Lego bricks. We will also look at a face recognition application and at how to develop your own neural network structures. If you are too impatient or curious to wait for that, the book Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid is recommended.

        Page 1 / 1                              Discussion (9 comments)  Add a comment     patmolloy 4 years ago    Hi Walter, great and interesting article. Thanks!
Along with some other folks, I am having trouble with adding the board withhttp://dl.sipeed.com/MAIX/Maixduino/package_Maixduino_k210_index.json
Just does not work. Any idea? Simply going to that URL throws an ""Unknown Error"" on the page.
After a lot of work (8+ hours) I managed to assemble a collection of files that enabled me to install the board and compile the MobileNet script.
When running, I just see ""Loading ..."" on the LCD (on a red background). And a lot of ""detect object fail"" messages in the serial debug. Will something only appear on the LCD when it is actually recognised do you know.  I've tried various pictures .. so far no luck at all!
Thanks!
Pat

             Brian Catchpoole 4 years ago     As Pat says great article Walter, but I have also struggled to get this running satisfactorily on the Arduino IDE. On boot up of the Maixduino screen displays “Welcome to MaixPy” on a red background. Compile of ‘selfie’ aborts with error: “cannot declare variable 'camera' to be of abstract type 'Sipeed_OV2640'”. This is the case with “mobilenet” as well. Verbose error report attached if of interest.CheersBrian  Compilation Report.zip (3kb)      Reply

             Brian Catchpoole 4 years ago    I have now managed to compile satisfactorily thanks to helpful people on line. Turns out the issue is two typo’s in the following library files: “Sipeed_OV2640.cpp” at line 724 “Sipeed_OV2640.h” at line 57 Change “ setRotaion” to “setRotation” (note extra t) Sadly this gets me no further than Pat with mobilenet_v1, my screen displays ‘loading …’ on a red background. No matter what I put in front of the camera the message “detect object fail” is output to Serial 3. All of which suggests a camera hardware issue? Any thoughts?        Reply

AbstractThe diagnosis of heart failure can be difficult, even for heart failure specialists. Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) has the potential to assist physicians in heart failure diagnosis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-CDSS for heart failure. AI-CDSS for cardiology was developed with a hybrid (expert-driven and machine-learning-driven) approach of knowledge acquisition to evolve the knowledge base with heart failure diagnosis. A retrospective cohort of 1198 patients with and without heart failure was used for the development of AI-CDSS (training dataset, n = 600) and to test the performance (test dataset, n = 598). A prospective clinical pilot study of 97 patients with dyspnea was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS compared with that of non-heart failure specialists. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was evaluated. In retrospective cohort, the concordance rate was 98.3% in the test dataset. The concordance rate for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and no heart failure was 100%, 100%, 99.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In a prospective pilot study of 97 patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, 44% had heart failure. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was 98%, whereas that between non-heart failure specialists and heart failure specialists was 76%. In conclusion, AI-CDSS showed a high diagnostic accuracy for heart failure. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of heart failure, especially when heart failure specialists are not available.

IntroductionThe prevalence of heart failure (HF) has been increasing1,2. HF is associated with high morbidity and mortality3. Because HF is a complex syndrome that can result from structural and functional cardiac disorder, rather than a single disease entity, its correct diagnosis can be challenging even for HF specialists. Currently, HF is classified according to ejection fraction, i.e., HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)4. A correct diagnosis is mandatory before proper treatment can be initiated4,5. Furthermore, present-day physicians are challenged by rapidly changing scientific evidences, new drugs, and the complexity of guidelines for HF management, especially in outpatient clinic. With enormous advancements in information and communication technologies, such as easy storage, acquisition, and recovery of big data and knowledge, artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining an important role in cardiology6.Two types of AI decision systems are available: a white-box-based and a black-box-based one. A white-box AI-based decision system involves correlations and transparency among rules for the analysis of accumulated data, and is mainly constructed using supervised algorithms such as decision tree algorithm7. On the contrary, a black-box-based AI has opaque algorithms and its process and reasoning applied in providing the respective conclusions are difficult to clarify. IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) is black-box AI-based decision systems. WFO demonstrated a concordance rate of 93% for the treatment recommendation in breast cancer. However, WFO cannot disclose the recommendation processes for the final clinical decision8.Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a health information technology that assists physicians in clinical decision making. The concept of computer-based clinical decision has been developed for informatics six decades ago9. In spite of the enthusiasm for evolving CDSS which is assisted with the potential of AI, the realities and complexities of real clinical practice limit the rapid evolution of CDSS. An effective CDSS requires CDSS to match the individual patient’s characteristics to the clinical knowledge base, provides patient-centric assessments and recommendations, and finally presents recommendations in white-box manner to the physicians for their final decision8.We conducted a study assessing the level of agreement with respect to the HF diagnosis to identify the three types of HF, i.e. HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, between HF specialists and AI-CDSS at a tertiary center in Korea. First, we created an AI-CDSS using a hybrid approach of expert-driven knowledge acquisition and ML-driven rule generation. Second, we evaluated the diagnosis concordance (degree of agreement) of AI-CDSS in a test set of patients with and without HF as a pilot clinical study. Third, we prospectively tested the diagnostic performance of AI-CDSS in consecutive patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic.ResultsDevelopment of cardiovascular AI-CDSSUsing the training dataset of 600 patients with and without HF, the AI-CDSS was created using predefined steps including expert-driven knowledge acquisition, machine learning (ML)-driven rule generation, and hybridization of both types of knowledge.Expert-driven knowledge acquisitionIn the knowledge modeling phase, the clinical recommendations of diagnosis were first transformed into mind maps and then transformed to a decision tree. The decision tree was evaluated and modified by the physicians until a consensus was achieved. The final decision tree was termed as R-CKM (Supplementary Fig. 1) and included 14 contributing factors (Supplementary Table 1) and 4 possible outcomes: HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF, and no-HF.ML-driven rule generationWe used five machine learning algorithms i.e. Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), J48, and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). All algorithms selected only few features such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) as highly contributing factors (Supplementary Table 2). To boost the model performance, the auto-feature selection method was used and LVEF, electrocardiography, LVMI, and LAVI were selected as the most significant features (Supplementary Fig. 2).The five algorithms showed different accuracy (Supplementary Table 3). We also calculated the rank of each algorithm based on the accuracy, number of rules extracted, and number of attributes involved, using the rank formula developed in our previous work10. Finally, CART algorithm was selected to create ML-driven knowledge, because it showed the highest accuracy and rank of 88.5 and 0.5736, respectively. The CART algorithm mainly focused on features of LVEF, LAVI, and tricuspid regurgitation velocity (Supplementary Fig. 3). The algorithm correctly predicted HFmrEF and HFrEF with 100% accuracy, whereas HFpEF and no-HF were predicted with 78.9% and 80.5% accuracy, respectively.Hybrid knowledgeThe merging of the CKM from the expert-driven knowledge and the PM from the ML-driven knowledge approach led to the final hybrid knowledge in form of R-CKM (Fig. 1, Supplementary Materials). Sometimes, physician may miss some of the attributes or path of attributes during development of CKM, and the ML generated PM finds the missing attributes or paths. For instance, the CKM is starting with the “Sign & Symptoms” as shown in (Supplementary Fig. 3), while the PM starts checking from “LVEF” as shown in (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, the hybridization algorithm recognizes that the CKM is missing a path of “Not Available” values between “Sign & Symptoms” and “LVEF” attributes. When we added this new path into CKM, the number of knowledge base rules increased drastically. The addition of new path into R-CKM increases the coverage of patient cases to generate right recommendations and increase the accuracy.Fig. 1: Comparison of existing CDSSs and our proposed artificial intelligence-CDSS.CDSS Clinical Decision Support System, CKM clinical knowledge model, I-KAT Intelligent Knowledge Authoring Tool, NCCN National Comprehensive Cancer Network, NICE National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, PM prediction model.Full size imageValidation of AI-CDSSStudy populationThe test dataset included 598 patients (490 patients with HF, 108 patients without HF). Patients with HF were older (73.1 ± 13.8 years vs. 64.8 ± 13.8 years, P < 0.001), more likely to be male (52% vs. 37%, P = 0.005), and had higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels (10,075 ± 11,778 pg/L vs. 82 ± 68 pg/L, P < 0.001). Concerning the echocardiographic parameters, patients with HF had lower LVEF (45.5 ± 17.4% vs. 64.1 ± 6.5%, P < 0.001), higher LAVI (53.9 ± 21.1 ml/m2 vs. 31.2 ± 8.5 ml/m2, P < 0.001), and higher E/e′ (18.6 ± 9.8 vs. 9.8 ± 3.5, P < 0.001) (Table 1). Among patients with HF, 199 (40.6%), 63 (12.9%), and 228 (46.5%) were classified as having HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, respectively.Table 1 Characteristics of the study population retrospective patients (n = 598).Full size tableDiagnostic accuracyThe results of comparative analysis are shown in Fig. 2. The concordance rate was 100% in HFrEF and HFmrEF for all three approaches. With respect to HFpEF, the concordance rate was 82%, 79%, and 99.5% for expert-driven, ML-driven, and hybrid CDSS, respectively. Similar findings were observed for no-HF. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 90%, 88.5%, and 98.3% for expert-driven, ML-driven, and hybrid CDSS, respectively, showing a remarkable increase in accuracy by 8% with the hybrid approach, i.e., AI-CDSS.Fig. 2: Comparative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of different approaches in the retrospective cohort.CDSS Clinical Decision Support System, HFmrEF heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, HFpEF heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, HFrEF heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.Full size imageThe expert-driven approach had a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.96 and 0.71, respectively (Supplementary Table 4), whereas the ML-driven approach had a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.72 and 0.94, respectively (Supplementary Table 5). Strikingly, the hybrid approach had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.99, respectively (Supplementary Table 6).Subgroup analysisWe divided the patients according to echocardiographic parameters. Set A included all echocardiography parameters, whereas set B included only LVEF, LAVI, and LVMI. The concordance rate was lower in set B than in set A (Supplementary Fig. 4). In our study, the age of the included patients ranged from 20 to 92 years. Age did not affect the accuracy of the system (Supplementary Table 7).Accuracy of AI-CDSS in a prospective cohort of patients with dyspneaA total of 100 consecutive patients who presented with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic were enrolled. Of these, the data of three patients were not complete; thus, the data of 97 patients were used in the final analysis. Of the 97 patients, 43 (44%) had HF. In this prospective cohort, the concordance rate of the non-HF specialists was 76%, whereas that of AI-CDSS was 98% (Fig. 3). Especially, the diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF was low among the non-HF specialist, whereas the diagnosis of no-HF was comparably high.Fig. 3: Comparative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of physicians and AI-CDSS in the prospective cohort.Abbreviations are as in Fig. 2.Full size imageDiscussionCorrect diagnosis of HF can be challenging for physicians, even for HF specialists. In this study, we first created AI-CDSS by using the data of 1198 patients with and without HF and showed that AI-CDSS had very high diagnostic accuracy in these patients. In a prospective cohort of patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, AI-CDSS consistently showed a remarkably high diagnostic accuracy. By contrast, non-HF specialists showed a relatively low diagnostic accuracy for HF. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of HF, especially when HF specialists are not available.CDSS has been applied in clinical diagnosis11, preventive care12, and chronic disease management13, among others. It provides a proficient decision-making service to improve the quality of healthcare, but has several complexities and limitations8. Generally, AI-CDSS acquires knowledge from structured and unstructured data using ML and natural language processing techniques14,15. The amalgamation of ML-driven rule generation with expert-driven knowledge acquisition enhances the system accuracy10. Therefore, we chose the hybrid approach for the knowledge acquisition of AI-CDSS, which includes three distinct steps: expert-driven knowledge acquisition, ML-driven rule generation, and hybridization of both types of knowledge.In expert-driven knowledge acquisition, we first built CKM by transforming expert-driven knowledge into a mind map and decision tree10. Finally, the decision tree was validated with the PM of ML-driven knowledge.In ML-driven knowledge acquisition, we created a PM with an available big dataset. Various ML algorithms can be used to analyze and extract the hidden patterns in the form of knowledge models. In our study, we used white box AI and causal machine algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector), J48, and CART/CRT. White-box model AI are selected for their transparency, which enables easily determining all attributes for classification and verification of new patient data16. They also increase the physicians’ satisfaction level, because the rationale for a decision is also provided to the physician using the features contributing to the final decision. In addition, the computational complexity of the decision tree constructing algorithms (white box) is relatively low. By contrast, black box algorithms have no transparency in knowledge modeling owing to difficulty in interpreting the inner working layers of the models.In the hybridization of the both knowledge types, we validated the PM from the ML-driven approach against the mind map of CKM from the expert-driven approach to produce the final hybrid knowledge in form of R-CKM.Finally, we developed a web-based application in the form of cardiovascular AI-CDSS for use of physicians in real clinical practice. For this purpose, the R-CKM knowledge was transformed into MLM for knowledge shareability and computer-executable format using I-KAT, which had been developed by our team7. The resultant knowledge can be easily shared and integrated into various formats of HF diagnosis systems, because the resultant knowledge was built with consolidation of the standard data model vMR (Virtual Medical Record) and the standard terminology SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms).Because HF is a syndrome with various clinical features, its diagnosis can be very challenging even for HF specialists. In patients with HF, pulmonary congestion can develop because of congestion in the left heart, causing dyspnea. However, dyspnea as a symptom can also arise from lung disease, anemia, and mental disorders17. Leg swelling is a typical sign of congestion in the right heart. However, it also has many differential diagnoses, including kidney disease, adverse effect of drugs, and chronic venous insufficiency, among others18. In clinical practice, many patients are diagnosed as having HF even if they do not have HF, and vice versa. A correct diagnosis of HF is crucial because patients with HF have a grave prognosis that is comparable to that of oncologic malignancies19, and there exist therapy that can improve survival in patients with HF4,6. Consequently, misdiagnosis of HF can hinder the chance of improving the outcomes. AI-CDSS is a tool that helps in making better medical decisions, thereby reducing clinical errors and improving the quality of life. It has the potential to generate alerts and reminders, diagnostic assistance, therapy critiquing and planning, and image recognition and interpretation.Currently, HF is classified according to LVEF into HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF. With respect to HFrEF, a decrease in LVEF may alert physicians to the possible diagnosis of HF. By contrast, for HFpEF >50%, the normal systolic function may “blind” the physicians and HFpEF may remain undiagnosed. We showed that AI-CDSS showed acceptably high concordance for diagnosing HF regardless of type, whereas non-HF specialists misdiagnosed HFpEF in almost half of the patients.In medicine, IBM WFO demonstrated high concordance with oncologists in treatment recommendations14. In the field of cardiology, our study presents the clinical feasibility of AI for diagnosing HF.There are several limitations in this study. The intervention of the physicians is crucial in knowledge creation and validation. However, the level of expertise varies from physician to physician, so that the CKM developed by physicians in a hospital may differ from that developed in another hospital. Similarly, because the attributes in the PM depend on the patient data used, they may also differ from variables recommended in the guidelines. Therefore, further studies are necessary to validate the AI-CDSS in other study populations.In conclusions, AI-CDSS showed high diagnostic accuracy for HF, independent of HF types. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of HF, especially when HF specialists are not available.MethodsStudy population and data collectionRetrospective cohortWe included 1198 patients with and without HF from January 2016 to December 2017. We divided the patients into two datasets. The first 600 patients were used for the generation of AI-CDSS as a training dataset for ML, whereas the remaining 598 patients were used for the validation of the AI-CDSS as the test dataset. HF was defined as present when patients had symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea) or signs of HF (rales, pitting edema, ascites) and met one of the following criteria: lung congestion, objective findings of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or structural heart disease. Clinical information including demographics, symptoms, signs, medical history, laboratory examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography was obtained. Control patients, i.e., those without HF, were randomly selected from the electronic medical records.Prospective pilot cohortFor an additional validation of AI-CDSS, we enrolled 100 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic. The treating physicians performed history taking and physical examination, ordered diagnostic tests, and made a final diagnosis, i.e., HF or no-HF, according to their clinical judgment. The data were first recorded in an electronic clinical research form, and then automatically transferred to the AI-CDSS. A direct extraction of patients’ data from electronic medical record was circumvented because of the information security regulation at our institution.The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. For the retrospective cohort, the requirement for written informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. Each patient in the prospective cohort provided informed consent before study enrollment. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.EchocardiographyAll images were obtained using a standard ultrasound machine with a 2.5-MHz probe. Standard techniques were used to obtain M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler measurements in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines20. Tissue-Doppler-derived peak systolic, early, and late diastolic velocities of the septal mitral annulus were recorded. Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were measured from apical four- and two-chamber views and LVEF was calculated using Simpson’s biplane method.Generation of cardiovascular AI-CDSSThe traditional CDSSs usually focus on the expert-driven approach with collaboration between physicians and knowledge engineers, where the knowledge engineer is an expert in AI language who investigate the underlying problems, develop the main concepts, and efficiently represent the knowledge in the domain. The fundamental knowledge resource is the clinical practice guidelines and physicians’ expertise. The AI-CDSS uses patient data as the second important resource of knowledge after processing with ML algorithm (ML-driven approach). Figure 1 shows the difference between the traditional CDSSs and the cardiovascular AI-CDSS. The existing CDSSs maintain the knowledge base by the knowledge engineers. In contrast, AI-CDSS focuses on the hybrid approach of expert-driven knowledge acquisition and ML-driven rule generation and overcomes the physicians’ dependency on knowledge engineers. In AI-CDSS, the clinical knowledge model (CKM), a classical top-down decision tree, is generated by domain expert (physician) using guidelines and their experiences; it is called the Expert-Driven Knowledge. The second step is to create ML-based prediction model (PM) using several ML algorithms, which is called the machine learning (ML)-driven knowledge. The third step is to generate the refined-CKM (R-CKM) by the computer scientists using a quick, simple, and iterative agile software development. The R-CKM generation is composed of making prediction model of ML-driven knowledge and validation of expert-driven knowledge with respective ML-driven knowledge using several ML algorithms with training dataset of 600 patients’ data; it is called the hybrid knowledge. Finally, the R-CKM knowledge is transformed into shareable and interoperable setting in the form of Health Level-7 (HL7) complaint standard knowledge representation, termed Medical Logic Module (MLM), using the Intelligent Knowledge Authoring Tool (I-KAT) developed by our group. The executable MLM in the shareable knowledge base is executed to generate decisions based on the patients’ input to assist the physicians. More details of cardiovascular AI-CDSS are explained in the Supplementary methods.Study variablesHF was defined when patients had signs or symptoms of HF and either lung congestion, objective findings of LV systolic dysfunction, or structural heart disease. The diagnosis of HF was confirmed by two independent HF specialists who had >10 years of clinical experience. The diagnosis by the experts was considered the gold standard.According to the LVEF on echocardiography, patients were classified as having HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), HFmrEF (40% ≤ LVEF < 50%), and HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%).The diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS was measured using experts’ diagnosis as the gold standard. Concordance was defined as present when experts and AI-CDSS had the same diagnosis, i.e., both HF or both no-HF. Discordance was defined to exist when there was a disagreement between diagnoses.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics were calculated to determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the registry population. Data were presented as numbers and frequencies for categorical variables and as mean ± standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. For the comparison between groups, the χ2 test (or Fisher’s exact test when any expected cell count was <5 for a 2 × 2 table) was used for categorical variables, whereas unpaired Student’s t-test was used for continuous variables. Concordance was expressed as the percentage agreement. Pearson’s correlation was used to calculate the association between expert opinion and AI-CDSS judgment.A two-sided P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).Role of the funding sourceThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) has the potential to assist physicians in heart failure diagnosis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-CDSS for heart failure. AI-CDSS for cardiology was developed with a hybrid (expert-driven and machine-learning-driven) approach of knowledge acquisition to evolve the knowledge base with heart failure diagnosis. A retrospective cohort of 1198 patients with and without heart failure was used for the development of AI-CDSS (training dataset, n\u2009=\u2009600) and to test the performance (test dataset, n\u2009=\u2009598). A prospective clinical pilot study of 97 patients with dyspnea was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS compared with that of non-heart failure specialists. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was evaluated. In retrospective cohort, the concordance rate was 98.3% in the test dataset. The concordance rate for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and no heart failure was 100%, 100%, 99.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In a prospective pilot study of 97 patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, 44% had heart failure. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was 98%, whereas that between non-heart failure specialists and heart failure specialists was 76%. In conclusion, AI-CDSS showed a high diagnostic accuracy for heart failure. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of heart failure, especially when heart failure specialists are not available.', 'datePublished': '2020-04-08T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2020-04-08T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '6', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0261-3', 'keywords': ['Heart failure', 'Outcomes research', 'Medicine/Public Health', 'general', 'Biomedicine', 'Biotechnology'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-020-0261-3/MediaObjects/41746_2020_261_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-020-0261-3/MediaObjects/41746_2020_261_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-020-0261-3/MediaObjects/41746_2020_261_Fig3_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'npj Digital Medicine', 'issn': ['2398-6352'], 'volumeNumber': '3', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Dong-Ju Choi', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0146-2189', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Seoul National University Bundang Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'djchoi@snubh.org', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Jin Joo Park', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9611-1490', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Seoul National University Bundang Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Taqdir Ali', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Kyung Hee University', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Sungyoung Lee', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5962-1587', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Kyung Hee University', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'sylee@oslab.khu.ac.kr', '@type': 'Person'}], 'isAccessibleForFree': True, '@type': 'ScholarlyArticle'}",,,,,,,,,,

SmithApril 8, 2020This article is part of our latest Artificial Intelligence special report, which focuses on how the technology continues to evolve and affect our lives.A couple of decades ago, Jeff Alger, then a senior manager at Microsoft, was coaching state-level soccer teams and realized that there was very little science to player development.“There were no objective ways of measuring how good players are,” said Mr. Alger, “and without being able to measure, you have nothing.”He said it offended his sense of systems design to recognize a problem but do nothing about it, so he quit his job, got a master’s degree in sports management and started a company that would use artificial intelligence to assess athletic talent and training.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis company, Seattle Sports Sciences, is one of a handful using the pattern-recognizing power of machine learning to revolutionize coaching and make advanced analytics available to teams of all kinds.The trend is touching professional sports and changing sports medicine. And, perhaps inevitably, it has altered the odds in sports betting.John Milton, the architect of Seattle Sports Sciences’ artificial intelligence system, spent a week in October with the Spanish soccer team Málaga, which plays in Spain’s second division, capturing everything that happened on the pitch with about 20 synchronized cameras in 4K ultra high-definition video.“It’s like omniscience,” Mr. Milton said. The system, ISOTechne, evaluates a player’s skill and consistency and who is passing or receiving with what frequency, as well as the structure of the team’s defense. It even tracks the axis of spin and rate of rotation of the ball.That is not the only way that the company’s technology is being used. Professional soccer teams derive a growing slice of revenue from selling players. Soccer academies have become profit centers for many teams as they develop talented players and then sell them to other teams. It is now a $7 billion business. But without objective measurements of a player’s ability, putting a value on an athlete is difficult.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s a matter of whether that player’s movements and what they do with the ball correspond to the demands that they will have on your particular team,” said Mr. Alger, now the president and chief executive of Seattle Sports Sciences. He said, for example, that his company could identify a player who was less skilled at other phases of the game but was better at delivering the ball on a corner kick or a free kick — a skill that a coach could be looking for.Some systems can also detect and predict injuries. Dr. Phil Wagner, chief executive and founder of Sparta Science, works from a warehouse in Silicon Valley that has a running track and is scattered with equipment for assessing athletes’ physical condition.The company uses machine learning to gather data from electronic plates on the ground that measure force and balance. The system gathers 3,000 data points a second and a test — jumping or balancing — takes about 20 seconds.“Athletes don’t recognize that there’s an injury coming or there’s an injury that exists,” Dr. Wagner said, adding that the system has a proven record of diagnosing or predicting injury. “We’re identifying risk and then providing the best recommendation to reduce that risk.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageTyson Ross, a pitcher whose workouts are tailored by Sparta Science.Credit...Charles Krupa/Associated PressTyson Ross, a pitcher competing for a roster spot with the San Francisco Giants, has been using Sparta Science’s system since he was drafted in 2008. He visits the company’s facilities roughly every other week during the off-season to do vertical jumps, sway tests, a single leg balance test and a one-arm plank on the plate, blindfolded.“Based on the data that’s collected, it tells me how I’m moving compared to previously and how I’m moving compared to my ideal movement signature, as they call it,” Mr. Ross said. Sparta Science then tailors his workouts to move him closer to that ideal.The Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions and the Washington Redskins, among others, use the system regularly, Dr. Wagner said. Sparta Science is also used to evaluate college players in the National Football League’s annual scouting combine.Of course, it is inevitable that machine learning’s predictive power would be applied to another lucrative end of the sports industry: betting. Sportlogiq, a Montreal-based firm, has a system that primarily relies on broadcast feeds to analyze players and teams in hockey, soccer, football and lacrosse.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMehrsan Javan, the company’s chief technology officer and one of its co-founders, said the majority of National Hockey League teams, including the last four Stanley Cup champions, used Sportlogiq’s system to evaluate players.Josh Flynn, assistant general manager for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Ohio’s professional hockey franchise, said the team used Sportlogiq to analyze players and strategy. “We can dive levels deeper into questions we have about the game than we did before,” Mr. Flynn said. But Sportlogiq also sells analytic data to bookmakers in the United States, helping them set odds on bets, and hopes to sell information to individual bettors soon. Mr. Javan is looking to hire a vice president of betting.They key to all of this sports-focused technology is data.“Algorithms come and go, but data is forever,” Mr. Alger is fond of saying. Computer vision systems have to be told what to look for, whether it be tumors in an X-ray or bicycles on the road. In Seattle Sports Sciences’ case, the computers must be trained to recognize the ball in various lighting conditions as well as understand which plane of the foot is striking the ball.ImageMembers of the Columbus Blue Jackets, one of the N.H.L. teams that are using Sportlogiq to analyze players and strategy.Credit...Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports, via ReutersAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTo do that, teams of workers first have to painstakingly annotate millions of images. The more annotated data, the more accurate the machine-learning analysis will be. “Basically, whoever has the most labeled data wins,” said Mr. Milton, the A.I. architect.Seattle Sports Sciences uses Labelbox, a training data platform that allows Mr. Milton’s data science team in Seattle to work with shifts of workers in India who label data 24 hours a day. “That’s how fast you have to move to compete in modern vision A.I.,” Mr. Milton said. “It’s basically a labeling arms race.”Dr. Wagner of Sparta Science agrees, noting that with algorithms readily available and cloud computing power now available everywhere, the differentiator is data. He said it took Sparta Science 10 years to build up enough data to train its machine-learning system adequately.Sam Robertson, who runs the sports performance and business program at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, said it would take time for the technology to transform sports. “The decision-making component of this right now is still almost exclusively done by humans,” he said.“We need to work on the quality of the inputs,” he said, meaning the labeled data. “That’s what’s going to improve things.”Craig S.

Twenty-five years after the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, significant gender bias in existing social norms remains. For example, as recently as February 2020, the Indian Supreme Court had to remind the Indian government that its arguments for denying women command positions in the Army were based on stereotypes. And gender bias is not merely a male problem: a recent UNDP report entitled Tackling Social Norms found that about 90% of people (both men and women) hold some bias against women.
Gender bias and various forms of discrimination against women and girls pervades all spheres of life. Women’s equal access to science and information technology is no exception. While the challenges posed by the digital divide and under-representation of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) continue, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are throwing newer challenges to achieving substantive gender equality in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
If AI and automation are not developed and applied in a gender-responsive way, they are likely to reproduce and reinforce existing gender stereotypes and discriminatory social norms. In fact, this may already be happening (un)consciously. Let us consider a few examples:  

As a 2019 UNESCO report highlights, it is not a coincidence that virtual personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Cortana have female names and come with a default female voice. Companies behind these virtual assistants are reinforcing the social reality in which a majority of personal assistants or secretaries in both public and private sectors are women.
Gender bias pervades AI algorithms as well. With 78% of AI professionals being men, male experiences inform and dominate algorithm creation. This gender bias can have significant adverse implications for women. For example, algorithms could affect women’s access to jobs and loans by automatically vetting out their applications or giving women applicants an unfavourable rating. Similarly, the algorithm-based risk assessment in criminal justice systems could work against women if the system did not factor in that women are less likely than men to reoffend.
Although robotization and automation of jobs will impact both men and women, gender bias is likely to carry forward and thus impact women disproportionately. For instance, women over-represented in certain high-risk automation sectors might suffer more: if over 70% of workers in apparel manufacturing are women, automation will affect women more than men. Relative lack of mobility and flexibility is also very likely to reduce bargaining position of, or alternative job options for, women generally.

Despite the potential for such gender bias, the growing crop of AI standards do not adequately integrate a gender perspective. For example, the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence does not make an explicit reference to integrating a gender perspective, while the AI4People’s Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society mentions diversity/gender only once. Both the OECD Council Recommendation on AI and the G20 AI Principles stress the importance of AI contributing to reducing gender inequality, but provide no details on how this could be achieved.
The Responsible Machine Learning Principles do embrace “bias evaluation” as one of the principles. This siloed approach of embracing gender is also adopted by companies like Google and Microsoft, whose AI Principles underscore the need to avoid “creating or reinforcing unfair bias” and to treat “all people fairly”, respectively. Companies related to AI and automation should adopt a gender-response approach across all principles to overcome inherent gender bias. Google should, for example, embed a gender perspective in assessing which new technologies are “socially beneficial” or how AI systems are “built and tested for safety”.
What should be done to address the gender bias in AI and automation? The gender framework for the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights could provide practical guidance to states, companies and other actors. The framework involves a three-step cycle: gender-responsive assessment, gender-transformative measures and gender-transformative remedies. The assessment should be able to respond to differentiated, intersectional, and disproportionate adverse impacts on women’s human rights. The consequent measures and remedies should be transformative in that they should be capable of bringing change to patriarchal norms, unequal power relations. and gender stereotyping.
States, companies and other actors can take several concrete steps. First, women should be active participants—rather than mere passive beneficiaries—in creating AI and automation. Women and their experiences should be adequately integrated in all steps related to design, development and application of AI and automation. In addition to proactively hiring more women at all levels, AI and automation companies should engage gender experts and women’s organisations from the outset in conducting human rights due diligence.
Women should be active participants—rather than mere passive beneficiaries—in creating AI and automation.
Second, the data that informs algorithms, AI and automation should be sex-disaggregated, otherwise the experiences of women will not inform these technological tools and in turn might continue to internalise existing gender biases against women. Moreover, even data related to women should be guarded against any inherent gender bias.
Third, states, companies and universities should plan for and invest in building capacity of women to achieve smooth transition to AI and automation. This would require vocational/technical training at both education and work levels.
Fourth, AI and automation should be designed to overcome gender discrimination and patriarchal social norms. In other words, these technologies should be employed to address challenges faced by women such as unpaid care work, gender pay gap, cyber bullying, gender-based violence and sexual harassment, trafficking, breach of sexual and reproductive rights, and under-representation in leadership positions. Similarly, the power of AI and automation should be employed to enhance women’s access to finance, higher education and flexible work opportunities.
Fifth, special steps should be taken to make women aware of their human rights and the impact of AI and automation on their rights. Similar measures are needed to ensure that remedial mechanisms—both judicial and non-judicial—are responsive to gender bias, discrimination, patriarchal power structures, and asymmetries of information and resources.
Sixth, states and companies should keep in mind the intersectional dimensions of gender discrimination, otherwise their responses, despite good intentions, will fall short of using AI and automation to accomplish gender equality. Low-income women, single mothers, women of colour, migrant women, women with disability, and non-heterosexual women all may be affected differently by AI and automation and would have differentiated needs or expectations.
Finally, all standards related to AI and automation should integrate a gender perspective in a holistic manner, rather than treating gender as merely a bias issue to be managed.
Technologies are rarely gender neutral in practice. If AI and automation continue to ignore women’s experiences or to leave women behind, everyone will be worse off.

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Morgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services. According to our AI Opportunity Landscape research in financial services, approximately 10% of AI vendor products in the industry are wealth management solutions, and 4% are asset management solutions.  The latter is on par with customer service and lending applications, indicating that the use-case has at least some comparable traction with AI. Morgan Stanley in particular has been using AI for this use-case since at least 2018: Next Best Action: A tool on Morgan Stanley’s WealthDesk platform that can purportedly help its wealth and asset managers make more informed decisions for their clients and reach more of their clients at once. They also bolster their AI initiatives by deploying data science talent in advisory positions: Data Center of Excellence: A 30-person operation that provides consulting to various departments within the financial institution with the goal of setting them up for AI adoption. In this article, we lay out the available information on both of these initiatives an explore the benefits they could bring to the company, starting with Morgan Stanley’s wealth and asset management tool, Next Best Action: Wealth and Asset Management Tool: Next Best Action Lou Pirenc, Global Head of Data at the Research Division of Morgan Stanley, gives a brief primer on how the company has been researching AI for use in trading and wealth management in the video below:  Many financial institutions have been using artificial intelligence to augment their wealth and asset managers with predictive analytics tools that help them better determine how to best invest their clients’ money. These applications, in some cases called “robo advisers,” suggest investments that are supposed to be financially lucrative and in-line with client preferences based on trends in the market. They often combine natural language processing and predictive analytics approaches. In doing so, these applications can analyze financial news sites and past emails between the wealth/asset manager and client in order to suggest possible action steps the wealth/asset manager should take on behalf of that client. For example, if a client has stock in a company that is set to do well in an upcoming quarter because it just poached top talent from another well-known firm, an algorithm might suggest to a wealth manager that they inform their client about an investment opportunity. Morgan Stanley’s wealth/asset management application, launched in 2018, is called Next Best Action. Jeff McMillan, Chief Analytics and Data Officer at Morgan Stanley, said the application allows wealth managers to have deeper conversations with their clients, seemingly because they are able to access more data about their preferences an market trends faster. McMillan also emphasized how AI increased the scale at which wealth managers could reach their clients. Instead of emailing their clients one-by-one when there’s a sharp dip in the market, they could email hundreds of their clients at once. Next Best Action appears to be part of Morgan Stanley’s larger wealth management platform, WealthDesk, which is built on BlackRock’s Aladdin. The company purportedly rolled out WealthDesk as a means to unify wealth managers’ workflows into one digital environment, allowing them to access all of the tools they need on one platform instead of logging into several. WealthDesk seems to allow Morgan Stanley’s wealth managers to access information on client accounts held at other financial institutions as well. This could give them a more holistic view of their clients’ assets, allowing them to make better investment decisions for them. By the end of 2018, Morgan Stanley claimed that 10 to 15% of their more than 15,000 financial advisers had adopted WealthDesk. Data Center of Excellence In 2018, Morgan Stanley set up its Data Center of Excellence in order to help the financial institution develop its data infrastructure with the express goal of being able to leverage AI in in the future. The Center is purportedly made up of 30 data science and IT experts who advise other departments within Morgan Stanley on how to collect and store the data they work with. These experts currently operate within New York, London, and Montreal. The Center has in part focused on helping these departments process the unstructured data they are collecting, which includes text data stored internally, likely client emails, call logs, market research, and other digital assets. AI applications for wealth management likely also need to process unstructured data from the internet, including articles and research on financial news websites. In addition, the Center works with the financial institutions machine learning engineers to make sure they are using the right data to build algorithms for use-cases in fraud detection, wealth management, and more. Such an initiative could  greatly help Morgan Stanley with the challenges of AI adoption in the enterprise, and it could prevent departments within the company from wasting money on AI applications they don’t have the data to build nor the talent to maintain. Large financial institutions often have trouble avoiding AI adoption pitfalls such as the lure of AI novelty and the difficulty of predicting the ROI of AI. Morgan Stanley’s Data Center of Excellence could help departments with data audits in which cross-functional teams made up of data scientists, subject-matter experts, and IT personnel within the department discuss the data that is available to them with the goal of figuring out how it could be leveraged to solve business problems. For example, a financial institution’s wealth management department will need to do a data audit to find out where it is storing all of the research that its financial advisers are using to inform the decisions they make for their clients. In some cases, the department may not be storing a lot of this data, which would threaten any work on an AI algorithm that could augment their wealth managers. The department would have to start collecting this data, which would delay any AI project from coming to fruition for several months. Financial institutions are not used to these kinds of problems when it comes to IT. They are used to procuring and building software that is much more “plug and play” than AI. Morgan Stanley’s Data Center of Excellence likely sets realistic expectations for what the company can do with AI in its various departments and provides guidance on how each department in each of the cities the Center works in can set themselves up for success with AI. Emerj for Financial Services Companies Financial institutions need research on their competitors’ AI initiatives if they want to keep, but this information is often difficult to find and extremely misleading. Emerj helps large financial institutions find out which AI applications are delivering high ROI for their competitors and determine where AI can increase revenue, drive efficiencies, and increase customer satisfaction in use-cases like wealth management, asset management, customer service, and fraud detection.

4 roles of AI in content management systems


Enterprise content management systems employ AI in a number of ways, including chatbots, robotic process automation, enterprise search and content security.

Enterprise content management platforms enable businesses to organize and maintain their content, and many organizations are noticing an uptick in AI features within these systems.







By applying the different components of AI -- including machine learning, natural language processing and data mining -- ECM systems become smarter and provide end users with new capabilities that can make them more efficient.
Here are four roles of AI in content management systems:

1. Enterprise search
One of the most-used features in ECM platforms is the search function. This is a common starting point for anyone looking for specific content, whether it be a presentation file, policy, training guide or item within a catalog. But as the amount of data within ECM systems grows over the years, so, too, do the search results, forcing users to spend time sifting through the returns and making them less productive.
But with the help of AI in enterprise search, users can identify the information they seek using machine learning and data mining capabilities.
Microsoft announced AI capabilities in enterprise search with Project Cortex at Ignite 2019. This technology is able to analyze different types of content from various sources -- such as SharePoint Online, Exchange Online and OneDrive -- and organize it into shared topics such as projects, products, processes and customers to create a knowledge network for users to access as part of their search results.


2. Chatbot capabilities
Some ECM vendors -- such as Microsoft SharePoint -- have even added chatbot capabilities to their offerings. In Microsoft's case, Bot Framework V4 provides connectors to deliver fully-functioning chatbots to interact with SharePoint content.
By generating a chatbot using Bot Framework, designers can build the functionality to interact with the bot through web chat windows, Microsoft Team conversations, Skype conversations and voice by using Cortana.
Several real-life examples of queries that these chatbots can answer in an ECM system include:

""Bot, locate the latest sales presentation for ABC client,"" as a sales representative searches for a proposal or presentation;
""Bot, search for a legal document related to HIPAA cases,"" as an attorney searches for documents related to a specific case; and
""Bot, I am looking for training material on how to use our equipment AP-1023,"" as a field technician searches for machinery user guides.



3. Robotic process automation
The next capability that AI brings to the table in content management systems is robotic process automation (RPA), which is the ability for AI to handle high-volume, repetitive tasks. Today, many ECM platforms still rely on the use of traditional workflow engines to provide automation capabilities for approval processes, document routing based on categories, revision review and other commonly used workflows.
But the use of AI provides opportunities for more complex automations such as document routing based on content, classification of documents based on content, e-discovery searches, image classification and object recognition.
RPA can be of great use to businesses. For example, imagine an accounting department uses RPA to assist with invoicing. Using RPA, AI can analyze incoming documents that the accounting department scans -- such as invoices -- then perform text and pattern recognition to extract some of data elements. AI then routes the document to the appropriate individuals or teams who need to work on it. This takes humans out of the equation, freeing them up for other tasks.


4. Content security
AI is also helpful in securing content. For many companies, saving credit card or bank account numbers and other sensitive information within an ECM system is generally prohibited. But with increasing pressures on businesses to ensure they meet all the different compliance requirements that include HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA and others, relying on audits to find content that might violate company rules and polices can result in risks of noncompliance.
AI can detect in real time if content in an ECM platform is noncompliant by detecting abnormal behavior -- such as unusually large document downloads or a suspicious login from unfamiliar locations -- which helps organizations meet compliance requirements and reduce risks significantly.

Artificial intelligence can augment human work—if workers’ representatives have a voice in implementing it.
Florian Butollo
The discourse on artificial intelligence and work is shaped by conflicting narratives. Disempowering notions about mass unemployment and a loss of human control in the face of ever-more-powerful machines are widespread. But AI also inspires visions of human empowerment, according to which labour will be upgraded as machines support human effort and relieve us from the burden of onerous work, leaving us with more interesting, creative and cognitive tasks. 
Both narratives are one-sided, deriving projections as to the future of
work from the nature of technology as such. To overcome this simplistic
dichotomy, the social context in which AI is introduced needs to be addressed. It
is not just an interaction between man
(or woman) and machine—AI is
implemented within a far-flung division of labour, which entails multiple forms
of co-operation, task specialisation and inequality. To answer the question of
who benefits and who loses through its introduction, it is thus necessary to
ask how relations of power between human agents are reconfigured.

Significant limitations
Hubris surrounds the term AI and is responsible for many of the misconceptions.
The present technological path of machine learning has generated astonishing
breakthroughs, yet significant limitations are encountered when the calculated
results are contextualised and applied. 
And while it is now possible to detect patterns in massive data sets which
surpass the capabilities of human reason—essentially amounting to a different
form of intelligence than that of humans—the ‘predictions’ derived from these
are structurally conservative. They merely project such patterns into the
future, based on correlations established rather than a deeper understanding of
underlying factors. 
What is more, AI systems continue to be trained towards very specific
tasks and cannot transfer capacities to different data sets or changed
surroundings. In other words, AI delivers highly-sophisticated statistical
evidence for processes of high regularity in controlled surroundings.

There is a multiplicity of applications where these forms of pattern
recognition matter, especially in the image or speech recognition and
match-making which constitute the main fields of AI today. But this is
intelligence in the statistical sense, not anything equivalent to human
intelligence. 
It fails to work once there are more complex, multi-factor environments
involved—think Brexit or the notorious butterfly which might trigger a
hurricane in a different region of the world! Human reasoning must step in to
contextualise AI results, to understand its implications in real-life
scenarios. 
Augmented
intelligence
In terms of possible impacts on work, this means AI can be used to
subordinate workers to the mechanical calculations of the machine or to empower
them to contextualise and use AI as augmented
human intelligence. Both approaches exist. 
The first path isolates the work process from its real-life context. The
design of a logistics warehouse or simple manufacturing operation can easily be
translated into a data model with input, processing and output variables. AI algorithms
can recurrently recalculate the set of factors involved and transmit these to
human agents, obliged to follow suit. 
Such forms of automated decision-making leave little room for the
opinions of workers. Devices displaying the next operation approximate to
‘objective’ efficiency and functionality, to the extent that it becomes futile
to argue. The bugs and readjustments that (as always) occur remain the
preoccupation of data scientists and management. Workers are supported in their
actions but they become highly replaceable, their bargaining power undermined.
The second path ascribes the tasks of contextualising AI to workers. AI
might provide transparency about the current state of processes and hints as to
possible measures to smooth the operation of a firm, be it a factory or an
office. Yet humans face the challenge to interpret such results, based on their
capacity to assess the surrounding factors and their experience. This way,
decisions can be augmented via a translation and adaption to real-life
conditions, building on work experience, intuition and general reasoning. These
capacities can be developed through enhancing workers’ capacities to
understand, interpret and act upon automated decision-making. 
New forms of interaction
It is easy from this to deduce scenarios of a downgrading or an
upgrading of work. The point, however, is to identify the variables that affect
whether one tendency or the other predominates. This is not rooted in the
structural surroundings of certain work contexts or in technology itself but in
the active design of new forms of man-machine interaction. 
Three dimensions are particularly relevant. The first concerns the
fundamental question of investment in technologies, the second the design of
interfaces between AI and its users and the third the challenge of equipping
workers to upgrade their skills. 
Regarding investments, AI can be used for a broad variety of tasks which can be detrimental or supportive when it comes to workers’ empowerment. The question of how technological choices affect power relations in the workplace is a complicated one which needs to move centre-stage in discussions among workers’ representatives. It is linked to management choices favouring the design of enterprises as learning organisms (thus requiring the input of workers) as against neo-Taylorist options that reduce workers to narrowly-circumscribed functions.
Next, the design of technology becomes an important matter for workplace
politics. Do the interfaces of AI systems indicate a set of options and the
contingency of automatically-generated results? Or do they narrowly prescribe
actions that will be mistakenly taken as givens by human agents? Does AI
challenge us to interpret its results or relegate us to an observing position?
These are delicate questions as to what roles are ascribed to workers in AI
models.
Finally, how do companies support workers in developing new skills in a
setting of augmented intelligence and how is this incentivised? Calls for more
extended training and lifelong learning are widespread—workers need to acquire
a deeper understanding of automated processes to make the right decisions,
involving the skills to negotiate the translation of insights from the data
level to physical processes and real-life communication. 
But if workers need to learn more and constantly, how is this to be encouraged?
If lifelong learning becomes a requirement that is not compensated through higher
wages and relief from other responsibilities, it could soon become not a
blessing but a burden. Workers would need to run to stand still in the
hierarchies of the workplace. 
Tough challenges
All these dimensions constitute tough challenges for workers, works
councils and trade unions. They are relevant fields for designing the
workplaces of the future, as the technological choices and their embeddedness
are surrounded by conflicting interests, in which workers need to strengthen
their voice. This necessitates an upgrading of the side of labour towards
stronger capabilities in evaluating technologies and putting them to use according
to their interests. 
And this challenge becomes enduring: AI systems are not merely another machine which once introduced keeps on working in the same way, but learning organisms which modify their functions going forward. AI thus requires an augmentation of bargaining intelligence, so as to be capable of affecting the balance of forces on the shopfloor to workers’ advantage.

In light of the recent events surrounding Covid-19, learning for grades K-12 looks very different than it did a month ago. Parents and educators may be feeling overwhelmed about turning their homes into classrooms. 
With that in mind, a team led by Media Lab Associate Professor Cynthia Breazeal has launched aieducation.mit.edu to share a variety of online activities for K-12 students to learn about artificial intelligence, with a focus on how to design and use it responsibly. Learning resources provided on this website can help to address the needs of the millions of children, parents, and educators worldwide who are staying at home due to school closures caused by Covid-19, and are looking for free educational activities that support project-based STEM learning in an exciting and innovative area. 
The website is a collaboration between the Media Lab, MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, and MIT Open Learning, serving as a hub to highlight diverse work by faculty, staff, and students across the MIT community at the intersection of AI, learning, and education. 
“MIT is the birthplace of Constructionism under Seymour Papert. MIT has revolutionized how children learn computational thinking with hugely successful platforms such as Scratch and App Inventor. Now, we are bringing this rich tradition and deep expertise to how children learn about AI through project-based learning that dovetails technical concepts with ethical design and responsible use,” says Breazeal. 
The website will serve as a hub for MIT’s latest work in innovating learning and education in the era of AI. In addition to highlighting research, it also features up-to-date project-based activities, learning units, child-friendly software tools, digital interactives, and other supporting materials, highlighting a variety of MIT-developed educational research and collaborative outreach efforts across and beyond MIT. The site is intended for use by students, parents, teachers, and lifelong learners alike, with resources for children and adults at all learning levels, and with varying levels of comfort with technology, for a range of artificial intelligence topics. The team has also gathered a variety of external resources to explore, such as Teachable Machines by Google, a browser-based platform that lets users train classifiers for their own image-recognition algorithms in a user-friendly way.
In the spirit of “mens et manus” — the MIT motto, meaning “mind and hand” — the vision of technology for learning at MIT is about empowering and inspiring learners of all ages in the pursuit of creative endeavors. The activities highlighted on the new website are designed in the tradition of constructionism: learning through project-based experiences in which learners build and share their work. The approach is also inspired by the idea of computational action, where children can design AI-enabled technologies to help others in their community.
“MIT has been a world leader in AI since the 1960s,” says MIT professor of computer science and engineering Hal Abelson, who has long been involved in MIT’s AI research and educational technology. “MIT’s approach to making machines intelligent has always been strongly linked with our work in K-12 education. That work is aimed at empowering young people through computational ideas that help them understand the world and computational actions that empower them to improve life for themselves and their communities.”
Research in computer science education and AI education highlights the importance of having a mix of plugged and unplugged learning approaches. Unplugged activities include kinesthetic or discussion-based activities developed to introduce children to concepts in AI and its societal impact without using a computer. Unplugged approaches to learning AI are found to be especially helpful for young children. Moreover, these approaches can also be accessible to learning environments (classrooms and homes) that have limited access to technology. 
As computers continue to automate more and more routine tasks, inequity of education remains a key barrier to future opportunities, where success depends increasingly on intellect, creativity, social skills, and having specific skills and knowledge. This accelerating change raises the critical question of how to best prepare students, from children to lifelong learners, to be successful and to flourish in the era of AI.
It is important to help prepare a diverse and inclusive citizenry to be responsible designers and conscientious users of AI. In that spirit, the activities on aieducation.mit.edu range from hands-on programming to paper prototyping, to Socratic seminars, and even creative writing about speculative fiction. The learning units and project-based activities are designed to be accessible to a wide audience with different backgrounds and comfort levels with technology. A number of these activities leverage learning about AI as a way to connect to the arts, humanities, and social sciences, too, offering a holistic view of how AI intersects with different interests and endeavors. 
The rising ubiquity of AI affects us all, but today a disproportionately small slice of the population has the skills or power to decide how AI is designed or implemented; worrying consequences have been seen in algorithmic bias and perpetuation of unjust systems. Democratizing AI through education, starting in K-12, will help to make it more accessible and diverse at all levels, ultimately helping to create a more inclusive, fair, and equitable future.

Now, an increasing number of cities are suspending recycling services, partly out of fear that workers might contract the coronavirus from one another while sorting through used water bottles, food containers and boxes.One solution: Let robots do the job.Since the coronavirus took hold in the United States last month, AMP Robotics has seen a “significant” increase in orders for its robots that use artificial intelligence to sift through recycled material, weeding out trash.“Some facilities that were looking at getting one or two robots are now saying, ‘We need quite a bit more,’” said the Colorado company’s chief executive, Matanya Horowitz. “It’s all moving quite fast.”Before the pandemic, automation had been gradually replacing human work in a range of jobs, from call centers to warehouses and grocery stores, as companies looked to cut labor costs and improve profit.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut labor and robotics experts say social-distancing directives, which are likely to continue in some form after the crisis subsides, could prompt more industries to accelerate their use of automation. And long-simmering worries about job losses or a broad unease about having machines control vital aspects of daily life could dissipate as society sees the benefits of restructuring workplaces in ways that minimize close human contact.ImageCredit...Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York TimesImageAMP’s chief executive, Matanya Horowitz, said the pandemic had increased demand for the automated system.Credit...Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times“Pre-pandemic, people might have thought we were automating too much,” said Richard Pak, a professor at Clemson University who researches the psychological factors around automation. “This event is going to push people to think what more should be automated.”The grocery industry is leaning more on automation to free up employees to deal with the crush of demand during the pandemic.Brain Corp, a San Diego company that makes software used in automated floor cleaners, said retailers were using the cleaners 13 percent more than they were just two months ago. The “autonomous floor care robots” are doing about 8,000 hours of daily work “that otherwise would have been done by an essential worker,” the company said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt supermarkets like Giant Eagle, robots are freeing up employees who previously spent time taking inventory to focus on disinfecting and sanitizing surfaces and processing deliveries to keep shelves stocked.Retailers insist the robots are augmenting the work of employees, not replacing them. But as the panic buying ebbs and sales decline in the recession that is expected to follow, companies that reassigned workers during the crisis may no longer have a need for them.The role of a cashier is also changing. For many years, retailers have provided self-checkout kiosks. But those machines often require intervention by workers to help shoppers navigate the often fickle and frustrating technology.ImageA screen showing how AMP’s artificial intelligence identifies items on a conveyor.Credit...Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York TimesThe pandemic is prompting some stores to adopt even more aggressive “contactless” options. From farm stands to butchers, merchants are asking customers whenever possible to use mobile payment services like PayPal or Venmo. Banking regulators in Europe last week increased the amount of money that shoppers can pay through their mobile devices, while reducing some authentication requirements.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile fully automated stores, such as Amazon Go, might have seemed like a technological curiosity a few months ago, they are likely to become a more viable option for retailers.“No one would probably have thought of a cashier’s job as being dangerous until now,” Mr. Pak said.Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies labor markets, said that with companies hurting for cash, the pressure to replace humans with machines becomes even more intense.“People become more expensive as companies’ revenues decline,” he said.A new wave of automation could also mean that when companies start hiring again, they do so in smaller numbers.“This may be one of those situations when automation does substantially depress rehiring,” Mr. Muro said. “You may see fewer workers when the recovery does come.”ImageA scanner at the entry of an automated Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle.Credit...Christian Sorensen Hansen for The New York TimesEven some conversations are being automated away. With closed offices keeping many of its workers away, PayPal has turned to chatbots, using them for a record 65 percent of message-based customer inquiries in recent weeks.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPayPal is also using automated translation services so its English-speaking representatives can help customers who don’t speak English.“The resources we are able to deploy through A.I. are allowing us to be more flexible with our staff and prioritize their safety and well-being,” PayPal said in a statement.YouTube said in a blog post that with fewer people in its offices around the world, machines are doing more content moderation.“We will temporarily start relying more on technology to help with some of the work normally done by reviewers,” the company said. “This means automated systems will start removing some content without human review.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRecycling is one industry that may be altered permanently by the pandemic. Some workers, who earn as little as $10 an hour, have been concerned about coming to work during the crisis and some cities have been scrambling to find enough protective gear for all of their employees. Federal health officials have assured them that the risks of transmission from household refuse is low. But workers in recycling facilities often work side by side sorting material, making social distancing difficult.ImageA robotic floor cleaner at a Giant Eagle supermarket. The chain said automation freed up employees to take on pandemic-related tasks.Credit...Brain CorpAt AMP Robotics, executives like Mr. Horowitz say their robots will enable recycling facilities to space out their employees, who stand at conveyor belts weeding through the used plastic and paper.Another benefit of the bots: “They can’t get the virus,” Mr. Horowitz said.Michael Corkery is a business reporter who covers the retail industry and its impact on consumers, workers and the economy.

How Artificial Intelligence Is Optimizing Revenue Cycle Management
Artificial intelligence is addressing some of the biggest pain points in revenue cycle management, leading to increased revenue capture and integrity for early adopters of the technology.

April 10, 2020 - Prior authorizations are one of the most burdensome aspects of revenue cycle management.
In a survey of 1,000 practicing physicians conducted by the American Medical Association (AMA), 86 percent of doctors described the burden of prior authorizations as high or extremely high. Nearly an equal amount (88 percent) also said the burden has increased over the last five years.
""It's very, very resource-intensive on both sides, not just on the provider side. It's a series of interactions that are very transactional,"" Sharlene Seidman, a vice president at Yale New Haven Health, recently told RevCycleIntelligence.
Those interactions add up. Physicians and their staff spend almost two full business days each week completing prior authorizations, and more than one in three physicians has staff who work exclusively on the task, the AMA survey found.
The transactional nature of prior authorizations makes it ripe for automation, Seidman stated. But electronic adoption of prior authorizations remains low, according to data from the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare, Inc. (CAQH).
Adoption of electronic prior authorizations increased by just one percentage point to 13 percent from 2018 to 2019, CAQH reported using data from medical plans covering nearly half of the US’ insured population.
“Numerous barriers have prevented or slowed the adoption of electronic prior authorization,” explained CAQH. Those barriers include lack of operating rules and standards, infrastructure, and vendor readiness.
Yale New Haven Health is overcoming some of those challenges using emerging technology in healthcare: artificial intelligence.
“There is a series of repetitive tasks that our staff has to follow and the automation solution that we're seeking with Olive can learn those steps and replicate them, and in the future even anticipate if there are changes based on historical denials that we've received,” Seidman explained.
“We have seen some early successes with cash coming in a little more quickly, claims getting resolved more quickly. It's working,” she stated.
Prior authorization is one of the best use cases for artificial intelligence in healthcare right now. The transactional nature of prior authorizations makes it an ideal candidate for AI technology, which can leverage real-time analytics and machine learning to identify cases needing prior authorization, submit requests to payers, and check statuses.
But prior authorizations are just one of the burdensome processes in a transaction-heavy part of healthcare: the revenue cycle.
“The level of complexity in managing revenue cycle is very high,” explained Joe Polaris, SVP of product and technology at R1 RCM, a revenue cycle management vendor. “It's a very transaction-oriented business in that every patient who has a need for medical care is going to have a significant number of transactions from the point of scheduling all the way through the multitude of steps to create a clean claim, submit it, and get paid.”
This makes revenue cycle management very difficult to scale, especially for large organizations. According to Polaris, the only real way to achieve scale without the right technology is “to hire really smart people, and make them work even harder, and get even smarter.”
But that isn’t an area that healthcare organizations should be directing their resources, Polaris stressed.
“That’s a business problem that makes revenue cycle right for disruption.”


Electronic prior authorization adoption continues to lag, according to the latest CAQH Index.

				The potential to optimize revenue cycle management
AI is not new to healthcare. For years, innovative providers have been leveraging the technology to deliver better care for patients with everything from sleep disorders, eye disease, cancer, and even COVID-19.
The technology has created hype for clinical care, promising to catch diseases faster, expand access to care in underserved or developing regions, reduce the burden of EHR use, and more.
But applying AI to revenue cycle management could be the technology’s biggest break in healthcare.
“There was a study done that estimated about $470 billion was spent on billing and insurance-related activities. The reason for that was there's an obscene amount of work that goes into getting a claim billed and then collecting on that claim,” said Ross Moore, MBA, general manager of revenue cycle at Olive, a health IT company that uses AI to automate provider workflows.
“Those manual, redundant tasks that are taking place in patient access, coding, billing, collections, and denials, those tasks themselves that are performed by the revenue cycle departments can actually be automated using AI.”
AI deals really well with high transaction environments in which there are codified rules – like the healthcare revenue cycle.
The revenue cycle contains an abundance of tagged data, which means values are codified to data points to indicate certain events, like why a claim was denied or attributes of a patient’s diagnosis, Polaris explained.



Joe Polaris, SVP, product & technology, R1 RCM


“Whether it's matching a patient with the right provider, estimating out-of-pocket costs, or coding the claim, those are things that have long lists of variables associated with them, and AI is pretty uniquely good at evaluating those variables and coming up with an ever-improving success rate of getting to the right outcome against any of those process steps,” he said.
AI can do this by imitating intelligent human behavior through algorithms that find patterns and plan future actions in order to produce a positive outcome. This differs from other emerging technologies like machine learning or robotic process automation, which can identify patterns like AI but focus on improving accuracy rather than achieving positive outcomes. These other technologies also have no or limited ability to plan a future action beyond the task at hand.
Therefore, AI’s “intelligence” can effectively address the most pressing revenue cycle management issues, such as prior authorizations, claim status checks, and out-of-pocket cost estimates, all while getting the information that needs human intervention to the right person at the right time.
“When the technology is used inside of Epic, Cerner, or our standalone clinical intelligence products, it looks based on what it learns in the document, and then it renders the information to the appropriate party,” stated Michael Clark, senior vice president and general manager for provider solutions within Nuance’s healthcare division.
“So, there's a case manager who is interested in what's going on in encounter documentation.  There's a coder. There's certainly a physician. Through AI and machine learning, you can make available, out of the same set of facts and circumstances in the data, information to those different stakeholders, eliminating redundancy, reworking, and retrospective queries.”



Michael Clark, SVP, general manager for provider solutions, Nuance


AI-powered revenue cycle management technology can also do that in real-time – something the revenue cycle has struggled to achieve due to its high volume of transactions.
“Providers need to know in real-time who is cleared to be treated financially and who is not to make the most informed decisions for the practice. Patients, too, need to know what they’re responsible for paying so they can choose treatment options that are right for them,” said MaryAnne Thompson, controller at MidLantic Urology LLC, a group of 70-plus physicians in Pennsylvania.
“We were encouraged by the idea that AI would give us real-time insights to drive meaningful change and help us capture as many dollars as possible, while also delivering a good patient experience.”
MidLantic Urology is leveraging AI through a financial clearance workflow automation solution that “provides visual cues to practice executives, so [they] know where each patient is in the financial clearance process, in real-time, and what needs to happen next.”
The solution has already helped the group improve gross revenue by 18 percent, a number Thompson expects to increase by 12 percentage points this year. The group is also working on 85 percent fewer claims at any given time, she reported.
As a result, MidLantic Urology realized a 50 percent reduction in anticipated staffing requirements for its newly centralized billing department. Yale New Haven Health also saw workforce optimization results by using AI to improve prior authorizations.
“It has never been to eliminate positions. It's been more about refining processes and then moving further ahead,” Seidman said. “Getting to more of those value-adding functions sooner so that we could focus on what's really important to us, which is our patient.”
Results like these are creating buzz around AI and revenue cycle management. But adoption still lags as the market attempts to find the right place for AI.
Getting lost in the noise
Providers are being bombarded with pitches for products that promise to leverage the latest AI technology to solve some of the revenue cycle’s biggest pain points while maximizing revenue capture and integrity.
Despite the seemingly growing number of products and the revenue cycle’s ripeness for automation, adoption of AI for revenue cycle management is not as robust as one may think.
“We're shifting from early adopter where you have the innovative health systems trying to invest in technologies to do things differently to the early majority where we're seeing more and more providers that are doing things like pilots and proof of concepts to adopt automation in their organization,” Moore explained using the technology adoption curve from Geoffrey A. Moore’s 1991 book Crossing the Chasm.
Providers are gearing up for wider adoption. A recent Black Book survey of C-suite executives found less than half (44 percent) of healthcare organizations already use AI in some form or another, but 88 percent anticipate widespread implementation within the next five years. Those implementations would impact revenue integrity, clinical documentation improvement, coding, and other parts of the revenue cycle, respondents stated.
But getting everybody on board with crossing the chasm may be a challenge.


For AI to take off for RCM, providers must cross the technology adoption chasm as defined by Geoffrey Moore in Crossing the Chasm.

“There's still a black box feeling around AI, whether it's healthcare or other industries,” Clark said. “But in healthcare, more importantly, there are patients. At the end of the documentation, there's a patient. So, the black box aspect of it has slowed more rapid adoption.”
In healthcare, the work done during the early adopter stage will be key to AI investments in the near future. Providers need to see financial improvements before they will feel comfortable adopting AI technology in their revenue cycles.
“What truly drives the adoption and the belief are the demonstrable outcomes,” Clark said. “As more and more solutions deliver on the outcomes that were pitched to users, providers will gain confidence, and in gaining that confidence, they're more open to applying AI in a different setting or in another area that they may have been concerned about before, but are now ready to automate.”
Thompson offered a similar sentiment regarding her organization’s technology investment strategy.
“We would definitely consider purchasing future technology solutions that rely on AI or machine-learning algorithms if they are proven to help improve practice margins and operational efficiencies,” said Thompson.
“What do we want to accomplish by leveraging a particular technology solution? What efficiencies will we gain? How quickly will we yield a return on investment,” she said regarding MidLantic Urology’s “goal-oriented” strategy for purchasing IT.
The revenue cycle management solution market doesn’t answer those questions just yet. Technology companies have yet to deliver consistent tools to the market and physician practices and other small healthcare organizations are not experiencing the massive write-offs to demand the tools, according to Matt Seefeld, EVP at the health software and services company MedEvolve.

“When you get in the larger groups, the pain is starting to really amp up. But when you're still an independent private practice, surgical specialty, or even specialties like derm, ophthalmology, ortho, neuro, cardiology, a lot of those folks are still getting by with average tools. That's not going to last forever,” he said.
“But I think that there are going to be some key players that bring more awareness to this topic and it's going to have to be the clients that start to demand it from vendors.”
Healthcare organizations that have yet to see the need for such technology or do not have the capital or infrastructure to support the investment may have to wait a little to unlock the benefits of AI-powered revenue cycle management. But being an early adopter does have its advantages, said Clark.
“That learning loop and its imperfections are not reasons to not embrace it,” Clark explained. “As a matter of fact, it's more of a reason to embrace it because by living it, you end up really understanding how real it is or how real it isn't.”
“It gives you a chance to make some quick decisions on whether this is something worth continuing to invest the time, energy, or the money in, or whether it's something that is not really artificial intelligence and shouldn't be construed as such.”
Investing in AI for revenue cycle management
Healthcare may still be figuring out the market for AI in revenue cycle management, but providers can still realize the benefits of the innovative technology.
A good place to start with AI investments is identifying use cases. Providers should be looking for opportunities to use automation to perform tasks that negatively impact net revenue. Then, they should assess staffing costs, Moore stated.
He encouraged stakeholders to ask: How many people are performing a specific function? And where can automation free up capacity for more value-adding activities?

This strategy helped Yale New Haven Health leverage AI to optimize prior authorizations.
“We had to take a much closer look at our processes because we didn't want to automate a bad process or an already efficient process. We did some pre-work to process map what we were doing,” Seidman explained.
Once the health system decided on what processes to automate with AI, it then went on to select a technology partner. Seidman and her team reviewed around 25 companies, a process that was well worth the effort to find the right technology partner.
“Make sure that you find a company who you share the same goals with,” Seidman advised. “It's a little difficult because a lot of these companies are saying, they have it built. Then, when you actually have a conversation, they’re really looking for a partner to build this with.”
Yale New Haven Health’s goal was to put the patient in the center of everything being done, so the health system went with a vendor whose mission was not to replace staff with AI, but redirect staff to doing more patient-centric activities, like talking about insurance benefits or setting expectations for patient financial responsibility.
Providers should also bring in the employees who do the work to evaluate the solution, she recommended. “They can share the process that they're following in reality versus what we believed what was happening.”
Implementation of AI can also start small to ensure revenue cycle management success, added Thompson.
MidAtlantic Urology recently underwent exponential growth, from a small practice with a few locations to one of the largest specialty practices in the nation with 46 locations. Growth through acquisitions translated to value for patients, but it also left the practice with a fragmented revenue cycle management system.
“We had little to no reporting mechanisms in place and we weren’t automated, so we couldn’t identify the problem areas, where they stemmed from, who made them, or how to resolve them,” Thompson stated. “These challenges were holding back the organization’s overall success, so we started looking at cloud-based applications that could provide us with visibility into financial clearance as well as insights, metrics, and KPIs that would allow us to effect a positive change in our A/R.”
MidAtlantic Urology chose to beta test a financial clearance workflow automation tool from MedEvolve. The organization started by using the tool at one practice and expanding out from there once financial improvements were realized.
It took six months for the organization to go 100 percent live with the tool, but providers in the practice are now seeing revenue increases and the organization plans to keep improving by adding more AI-powered revenue cycle management tools, including AI as-a-service.
AI as-a-service may be the next step for the technology in the revenue cycle management space. The service allows healthcare organizations to outsource AI technology, which enables providers to dabble with AI for revenue cycle management without heavy upfront investments.
This type of AI is not as mature in the market as other versions of the technology, like point solutions or robotic process automation offerings. But it is gaining a foothold, Moore stated.
“The end-to-end identification of processes to automate, doing the actual build, and maintaining those bots is really a huge effort,” he said. “Over 50 percent of automation programs fail, and this isn't healthcare specific, but across the board. The reason for that is there’s a lot of work that goes into maintaining those bots.”
“AI-as-a-service is focusing on offering that maintenance aspect, as well as using machine learning capabilities and learning that's taking place across a neural network to enhance that bot.”
The service enables providers to engage with AI to optimize revenue cycle management and even beyond.
“Health systems are taking those pilots and the proofs of concept and adopting it on a broader level,” Moore stated. “What we'll find most of the time is revenue cycle management is a natural place to get started with automation. But then as you're having the conversations with an organization, they're thinking about where they want to be in the future.”
“It's really not focused solely on revenue cycle. It's being able to set up the capabilities in a way you can scale the program to other areas in the organization whether it be supply chain some of the clinical departments in the organization, IT, or accounting.”
So, whether one believes in the hype or not, AI is making a place for itself in the healthcare revenue cycle.
“There's going to be more of a bias, or even a mandate, that organizations adopt some of these technologies,” Polaris maintained. “Right, wrong, or indifferent, the buzz is out there.”

Challenged by outsiders, arriving with new practices blended with new-age technologies including artificial intelligence has brought a truly profound evolution in how architecture is being done now..The conception of buildings has in fact already started a slow transformation: first by leveraging new construction technics, then by developing adequate software, and eventually today by introducing statistical computing capabilities including Data Science &amp; AI..&quot;Modularity, Computational Design, Parametricism and finally Artificial Intelligence are to us the four intricated steps of a slow-paced transition. Beyond the historical background, we posit that this evolution is the wireframe of a radical improvement in architectural conception,&quot; says Stanislas Chaillou, Harvard Graduate School of Design..According to the Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. Having said that, a recent study at University College London (ULC) and the University of Bangor said that although automation and artificial intelligence, for the time being, would not replace architects, the discipline will undergo massive transformations in the near future. Computers can replace tedious repetitive activities, &quot;optimizing the production of technical material and allowing, among other things, atomize the size of architectural offices. Each time fewer architects are needed to develop more complex projects.&quot;.Architectural Digest notes that to create new designs, architects usually use past construction, design, and building data. Instead of putting their minds together to create something new, it is alleged that a computer will be able to utilize tons of previous data in a millisecond, make recommendations and enhance the architecture design process..With AI, an architect would very easily go about researching and testing several ideas at the same time, sometimes even without the need for a pen and paper. Also, an architect could pull out a city or zone-specific data, building codes, and redundant design data, and generate design variations. Even on the construction side, it is said that AI can assist with actually building something with little to no manpower. Will this eventually lead to clients and organizations simply reverting to a computer for master-plans and construction?.Researchers at Oxford suggest that even with AI coming into the scene, the essential value of architects as professionals who can understand and evaluate a problem and synthesize unique and insightful solutions will likely remain unchallenged..Let's explore how AI can be used in Architecture..Parametric Architecture.Parametric architecture is a hidden weapon that allows an architect to change specific parameters to create various types of output designs and create such structures that would not have been imagined earlier. It is like an architect's programming language..It allows an architect to consider a building and reframe it to fit into some other requirements. A process like this allows Artificial Intelligence to reduce the effort of an architect so that the architect can freely think about different ideas and create something new..Construction and Planning.Constructing a building is not a one-day task as it needs a lot of pre-planning. However, this pre-planning is not enough sometimes, and you need a little bit of more effort to get an architect's opinion to life. Artificial Intelligence will make an architect's work significantly easier by analyzing the whole data and creating models that can save a lot of time and energy of the architect..All in all, AI can be called an estimation tool for various aspects while constructing a building. However, when it comes to the construction part, AI can help so that human efforts become negligible..Laying the Foundation.The countless hours of research at the starting of any new project is where AI steps in and makes it easy for the architect by analyzing the aggregate data in a millisecond and recommending some models so that the architect can think about the conceptual design without even using the pen or paper..Just like while building a home for a family, if you have the whole information about the requirements of the family, you can simply pull all zoning data using AI and generate design variations in a short time period..AI for Making Homes.This era of modernization demands everything to be smartly designed. Just like smart cities, today's high technology society demands smart homes. However, now architects do not have to bother about how to use AI to create the designs of a home only, but they should worry about making the user's experience worth paying..Smart Cities.Change is something that should never change. The way your city looks today will be very different in the coming time. The most challenging task for an architect is city planning that needs a lot of precision planning. However, the primary task is to analyze all the possible aspects, and understand how a city will flow, how the population is going to be in the coming years..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  With all the excitement and hype about AI that’s “just around the corner”—self-driving cars, instant machine translation, etc.—it can be difficult to see how AI is affecting the lives of regular people from moment to moment. What are examples of artificial intelligence that you’re already using—right now? At Emerj, the AI Research and Advisory Company, we work with ambitious enterprise leaders to develop powerful AI strategies and find high-ROI AI projects. While this often implies examining the AI initiatives of their peers, new AI use-cases and application ideas can come from consumer technologies as well – and that’s the focus of this article. In the process of navigating to these words on your screen, you almost certainly used AI. You’ve also likely used AI on your way to work, communicating online with friends, searching on the web, and making online purchases.  We distinguish between AI and machine learning (ML) throughout this article when appropriate. At Emerj, we’ve developed concrete definitions of both artificial intelligence andmachine learning based on a panel of expert feedback. To simplify the discussion, think of AI as the broader goal of autonomous machine intelligence, and machine learning as the specific scientific methods currently in vogue for building AI. All machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning. Our enumerated examples of AI are divided into Work & School and Home applications, though there’s plenty of room for overlap. Each example is accompanied with a “glimpse into the future” that illustrates how AI will continue to transform our daily lives in the near future.  Examples of Artificial Intelligence: Work & School Commuting According to a 2015 report by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, commute times in the US have been steadily climbing year-over-year, resulting in 42 hours of rush-hour traffic delay per commuter in 2014—more than a full work week per year, with an estimated $160 billion in lost productivity. Clearly, there’s massive opportunity here for AI to create a tangible, visible impact in every person’s life. Reducing commute times is no simple problem to solve.  A single trip may involve multiple modes of transportation (i.e. driving to a train station, riding the train to the optimal stop, and then walking or using a ride-share service from that stop to the final destination), not to mention the expected and the unexpected: construction; accidents; road or track maintenance; and weather conditions can constrict traffic flow with little to no notice. Furthermore, long-term trends may not match historical data, depending on the changes in population count and demographics, local economics, and zoning policies. Here’s how AI is already helping to tackle the complexities of transportation. 1 –  Google’s AI-Powered Predictions Using anonymized location data from smartphones, Google Maps (Maps) can analyze the speed of movement of traffic at any given time. And, with its acquisition of crowdsourced traffic app Waze in 2013, Maps can more easily incorporate user-reported traffic incidents like construction and accidents. Access to vast amounts of data being fed to its proprietary algorithms means Maps can reduce  commutes by suggesting the fastest routes to and from work.   Image: Dijkstra’s algorithm (Motherboard) 2 –  Ridesharing Apps Like Uber and Lyft How do they determine the price of your ride? How do they minimize the wait time once you hail a car? How do these services optimally match you with other passengers to minimize detours? The answer to all these questions is ML. Engineering Lead for Uber ATC  Jeff Schneider discussed in an NPR interview how the company uses ML to predict rider demand to ensure that “surge pricing”(short periods of sharp price increases to decrease rider demand and increase driver supply) will soon no longer be necessary. Uber’s Head of Machine Learning Danny Lange confirmed Uber’s use of machine learning for ETAs for rides, estimated meal delivery times on UberEATS, computing optimal pickup locations, as well as for fraud detection.   Image: Uber heat map (Wired) 3 — Commercial Flights Use an AI Autopilot AI autopilots in commercial airlines is a  surprisingly early use of AI technology that dates as far back as 1914, depending on how loosely you define autopilot. The New York Times reports that the average flight of a Boeing plane involves only seven minutes of human-steered flight, which is typically reserved only for takeoff and landing. Glimpse into the future In the future, AI will shorten your commute even further via self-driving cars that result in up to 90% fewer accidents, more efficient ride sharing to  reduce the number of cars on the road by up to 75%, and smart traffic lights that reduce wait times by 40% and overall travel time by 26% in a pilot study. The timeline for some of these changes is unclear, as predictions vary about when self-driving cars will become a reality: BI Intelligence predicts fully-autonomous vehicles will debut in 2019; Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says the timeline for self-driving cars is “a years thing, not a decades thing”; Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu and Stanford faculty member, predicted in early 2016 that self-driving cars will be mass produced by 2021. On the other hand, The Wall Street Journal interviewed several experts who say fully autonomous vehicles are decades away. Emerjalso discussed the timeline for a self-driving car with Eran Shir, CEO of AI-powered dashcam app Nexar, who believes virtual chauffeurs are closer than we think.   Email 1 – Spam Filters Your email inbox seems like an unlikely place for AI, but the technology is largely powering one of its most important features: the spam filter. Simple rules-based filters (i.e. “filter out messages with the words ‘online pharmacy’ and ‘Nigerian prince’ that come from unknown addresses”) aren’t effective against spam, because spammers can quickly update their messages to work around them. Instead, spam filters must continuously learn from a variety of signals, such as the words in the message, message metadata (where it’s sent from, who sent it, etc.). It must further personalize its results based on your own definition of what constitutes spam—perhaps that daily deals email that you consider spam is a welcome sight in the inboxes of others. Through the use of machine learning algorithms, Gmail successfully filters 99.9% of spam.   2 – Smart Email Categorization Gmail uses a similar approach to categorize your emails into primary, social, and promotion inboxes, as well as labeling emails as important. In a research paper titled, “The Learning Behind Gmail Priority Inbox”, Google outlines its machine learning approach and notes “a huge variation between user preferences for volume of important mail…Thus, we need some manual intervention from users to tune their threshold. When a user marks messages in a consistent direction, we perform a real-time increment to their threshold.” Every time you mark an email as important, Gmail learns. The researchers tested the effectiveness of Priority Inbox on Google employees and found that those with Priority Inbox “spent 6% less time reading email overall, and 13% less time reading unimportant email.” Glimpse into the future Can your inbox reply to emails for you? Google thinks so, which is why it  introduced smart reply toInbox in 2015, a next-generation email interface. Smart reply uses machine learning to automatically suggest three different brief (but customized) responses to answer the email. As of early 2016, 10% of mobile Inbox users’ emails were sent via smart reply. In the near future, smart reply will be able to provide increasingly complex responses. Google has already demonstrated its intentions in this area withAllo, a new instant messaging app which can use smart reply to provide both text and emoji responses.  Grading and Assessment    1 –Plagiarism Checkers Many high school and college students are familiar with services like Turnitin, a popular tool used by instructors to analyze students’ writing for plagiarism. While Turnitin doesn’t reveal precisely how it detects plagiarism, research demonstrates how ML can be used to develop a plagiarism detector. Historically, plagiarism detection for regular text (essays, books, etc.) relies on a having a massive database of reference materials to compare to the student text; however, ML can help detect the plagiarizing of sources that are not located within the database, such as sources in foreign languages or older sources that have not been digitized. For instance, two researchers used ML to predict, with 87% accuracy, when source code had been plagiarized. They looked at a variety of stylistic factors that could be unique to each programmer, such as average length of line of code, how much each line was indented, how frequent code comments were, and so on. The algorithmic key to plagiarism is the similarity function, which outputs a numeric estimate of how similar two documents are. An optimal similarity function not only is accurate in determining whether two documents are similar, but also efficient in doing so. A brute force search comparing every string of text to every other string of text in a document database will have a high accuracy, but be far too computationally expensive to use in practice. One MIT paper highlights the possibility of using machine learning to optimize this algorithm. The optimal approach will most likely involve a combination of man and machine. Instead of reviewing every single paper for plagiarism or blindly trusting an AI-powered plagiarism detector, an instructor can manually review any papers flagged by the algorithm while ignoring the rest. 2 –Robo-readers Essay grading is very labor intensive, which has encouraged researchers and companies to build essay-grading AIs. While their adoption varies among classes and educational institutions, it’s likely that you (or a student you know) has interacted with these “robo-readers’ in some way. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE), the primary test used for graduate school, grades essays using one human reader and one robo-reader called e-Rater. If the scores differ substantially, a second human reader is brought in to settle the discrepancy. This addresses the primary concern with robo-readers: if students can deduce the heuristics e-Rater’s use for determining their grade, they could easily exploit them to write nonsensical essays that would still score highly. This hybrid approach contrasts with how the ETS handles the SAT, where two human graders evaluate essays and a third is brought in if the scores differ substantially between the two humans. The synergistic approach in the former shows that by pairing human intelligence with artificial intelligence, the overall grading system costs less and accomplishes more. Glimpse into the future There are many promising avenues for AI to improve education in the future. One-size-fits-all classes may be replaced by personalized, adaptive learning that is tailored to each student’s individual strength and weaknesses. ML may also be used to identify at-risk students early on so that schools can focus extra resources on those students and decrease dropout rates. Banking/Personal Finance One of Emerj’s most popular guides is on machine learning in finance. While the guide discusses machine learning in an industry context, your regular, everyday financial transactions are also heavily reliant on machine learning. 1 – Mobile Check Deposits Most large banks offer the ability to deposit checks through a smartphone app, eliminating a need for customers to physically deliver a check to the bank. According to a 2014 SEC filing, the vast majority of major banks rely on technology developed by Mitek, which uses AI and ML to decipher and convert handwriting on checks into text via OCR.   Image: Mobile deposit (The New York Times) 2 – Fraud Prevention How can a financial institution determine if a transaction is fraudulent? In most cases, the daily transaction volume is far too high for humans to manually review each transaction. Instead, AI is used to create systems that learn what types of transactions are fraudulent. FICO, the company that creates the well-known credit ratings used to determine creditworthiness, uses neural networks to predict fraudulent transactions. Factors that may affect the neural network’s final output include recent frequency of transactions, transaction size, and the kind of retailer involved. 3 – Credit Decisions Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, the financial institution must quickly determine whether to accept your application and if so, what specific terms (interest rate, credit line amount, etc.) to offer. FICO uses ML both in developing your FICO score, which most banks use to make credit decisions, and in determining the specific risk assessment for individual customers. MIT researchers found that machine learning could be used to reduce a bank’s losses on delinquent customers by up to 25%. Glimpse into the future Can a robot give you sound investing advice? That’s the premise behind upstarts like Wealthfront and Betterment, which attempt to automate the best practices of seasoned investors and offer them to customers at a much lower cost than traditional fund managers. In early 2016, Wealthfront announced it was taking an AI-first approach, promising “an advice engine rooted in artificial intelligence and modern APIs, an engine that we believe will deliver more relevant and personalized advice than ever before.” While there is no data on the long-term performance of robo-advisors (Betterment was founded in 2008, Wealthfront in 2011), they will become the norm for regular people looking to invest their savings. This is already happening with younger people—in the above announcement, Wealthfront notes that 60% of its customers are under the age of 35. Examples of Artificial Intelligence: Home Social Networking 1 – Facebook When you upload photos to Facebook, the service automatically highlights faces and suggests friends to tag. How can it instantly identify which of your friends is in the photo? Facebook uses AI to recognize faces. In a short video highlighting their AI research (below), Facebook discusses the use of artificial neural networks—ML algorithms that mimic the structure of the human brain—to power facial recognition software. The company has invested heavily in this area not only within Facebook, but also through the acquisitions of facial-recognition startups like Face.com, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for a rumored $60M, Masquerade (2016, undisclosed sum),  and Faciometrics (2016, undisclosed sum).  Image: Facebook’s facial recognition (Huffington Post) Facebook also uses AI to personalize your newsfeed and ensure you’re seeing posts that interest you, as discussed in an Emerj interview with Facebook’s Hussein Mehanna. And, of particular business interest to Facebook is showing ads that are relevant to your interests. Better targeted ads mean you’re more likely to click them and buy something from the advertisers—and when you do, Facebook gets paid. In the first quarter of 2016, Facebook and Google secured a total of 85% of the online ad market—precisely because of deeply-targeted advertisements. In June 2016, Facebook announced a new AI initiative: DeepText, a text understanding engine that, the company claims “can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several thousand posts per second, spanning more than 20 languages.” DeepText is used in Facebook Messenger to detect intent—for instance, by allowing you to hail an Uber from within the app when you message “I need a ride” but not when you say, “I like to ride donkeys.” DeepText is also used for automating the removal of spam, helping popular public figures sort through the millions of comments on their posts to see those most relevant, identify for sale posts automatically and extract relevant information, and identify and surface content in which you might be interested. 2 – Pinterest  Pinterest uses computer vision, an application of AI where computers are taught to “see,” in order to automatically identify objects in images (or “pins”) and then recommend visually similar pins. Other applications of machine learning at Pinterest include spam prevention, search and discovery, ad performance and monetization, and email marketing. 3 – Instagram Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012, uses machine learning to identify the contextual meaning of emoji, which have been steadily replacing slang (for instance, a laughing emoji could replace “lol”). By algorithmically identifying the sentiments behind emojis, Instagram can create and auto-suggest emojis and emoji hashtags. This may seem like a trivial application of AI, but Instagram has seen a massive increase in emoji use among all demographics, and being able to interpret and analyze it at large scale via this emoji-to-text translation sets the basis for further analysis on how people use Instagram. 4 – Snapchat Snapchat introduced facial filters, called Lenses, in 2015. These filters track facial movements, allowing users to add animated effects or digital masks that adjust when their faces moved. This technology is  powered by the 2015 acquisition of Looksery (for a rumored $150 million), a Ukranian company with patents on using machine learning to track movements in video. Glimpse into the future Facebook is betting that the future of messaging will involve conversing with AI chatbots. In early 2015, it  acquired Wit.ai, an engine that allows developers to create bots that easily integrate natural language processing into their software. A few months later, it opened its messenger platform to developers, allowing anyone to build a chatbot and integrate Wit.ai’s bot training capability to more easily create conversational bots. Slack, a social messaging tool typically used in the workplace, also allows third parties to incorporate AI-powered chatbots and has even invested in companies that make them. Soon, your shopping, errands, and day-to-day tasks may be completed within a conversation with an AI chatbot on your favorite social network.  GIF: Facebook-hosted chatbot (VentureBeat) Online Shopping 1 –Search Your Amazon searches (“ironing board”, “pizza stone”, “Android charger”, etc.) quickly return a list of the most relevant products related to your search. Amazon doesn’t reveal exactly how its doing this, but in a description of its product search technology, Amazon notes that its algorithms “automatically learn to combine multiple relevance features. Our catalog’s structured data provides us with many such relevance features and we learn from past search patterns and adapt to what is important to our customers.” 2 –Recommendations You see recommendations for products you’re interested in as “customers who viewed this item also viewed” and  “customers who bought this item also bought”, as well as via personalized recommendations on the home page,  bottom of item pages, and through email. Amazon uses artificial neural networks to generate these product recommendations. While Amazon doesn’t reveal what proportion of its sales come from recommendations, research has shown that recommenders increase sales (in this linked study, by 5.9%, but in other studies recommenders have shown up to a 30% increase in sales) and that a product recommendation carries the same sales weight as a two-star increase in average rating (on a five-star scale). 3 – (More) Fraud Protection Machine learning is used for fraud prevention in online credit card transactions. Fraud is the primary reason for online payment processing being more costly for merchants than in-person transactions. Square, a credit card processor popular among small businesses, charges 2.75% for card-present transactions, compared to 3.5% + 15 cents for card-absent transactions. AI is deployed to not only prevent fraudulent transactions, but also minimize the number of legitimate transactions declined due to being falsely identified as fraudulent. In a press release announcing the rollout of its AI technology, MasterCard noted that 13 times more revenue is lost to false declines than to fraud. By utilizing AI that can learn your purchasing habits, credit card processors minimize the probability of falsely declining your card while maximizing the probability of preventing somebody else from fraudulently charging it. Glimpse into the future The key to online shopping has been personalization; online retailers increase revenue by helping you find and buy the products you’re interested in. We may soon see retailers take it one step further and design your entire experience individually for you. Google already does this with search, even with users who are logged out, so this is well within the realm of possibility for retailers. Startups likeLiftIgniter offer “personalization as a service” to online businesses. Others, like Optimizely, allow businesses to run extensive “A/B tests”, where businesses can run multiple versions of their sites simultaneously to determine which results in the most engaged users.  Mobile Use 1 –Voice-to-Text A standard feature on smartphones today is voice-to-text. By pressing a button or saying a particular phrase (“Ok Google”, for example), you can start speaking and your phone converts the audio into text. Nowadays, this is a relatively routine task, but for many years, accurate automated transcription was beyond the abilities of even the most advanced computers. Google uses artificial neural networks to power voice search. Microsoft claims to have developed a speech-recognition system that can transcribe conversation slightly more accurately than humans. 2 – Smart Personal Assistants Now that voice-to-text technology is accurate enough to rely on for basic conversation, it has become the control interface for a new generation of smart personal assistants. The first iteration were simpler phone assistants like Siri and Google Now (now succeeded by the more sophisticated Google Assistant), which could perform internet searches, set reminders, and integrate with your calendar. Amazon expanded upon this model with the announcement of complimentary hardware and software components:  Alexa, an AI-powered personal assistant that accepts voice commands to create to-do lists, order items online, set reminders, and answer questions (via internet searches) Echo (and later, Dot) smart speakers that allow you to integrate Alexa into your living room and use voice commands to ask natural language questions, play music, order pizza, hail an Uber, and integrate with smart home devices.  Microsoft has followed suit with Cortana, its own AI assistant that comes pre-loaded on Windows computers and Microsoft smartphones. Glimpse into the future Smart assistants will be the key to bridging the gap between humans and “smart” homes. In October 2016, Google announced Google Home—its competitor to Amazon Echo that features deep integration with other Google products, like YouTube, Google Play Music, Nest, and Google Assistant. Through voice commands, users can play music; ask natural language questions; receive sports, news, and finance updates; call an Uber; and make appointments and reminders. According to market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon has sold over 5 million Echo devices as of November 2016; however, a month later Amazon’s press release boasted a 9x increase in Echo family sales over the previous year’s holiday sales, suggesting that 5 million sold is a significant underestimate. AI-assistants, while still not used by the majority of Americans, are rapidly spilling over into the mainstream. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed what’s currently possible by spending a year building Jarvis, an imitation of the super-intelligent AI assistant in Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man films. In a Facebook post, he outlines connecting the myriad of home devices to one network; teaching Jarvis his preferences so it could play music and recognize friends at the door and let them in; building a Facebook messenger bot for Jarvis to issue text commands; and creating an iOS speech recognition app to issue voice commands. The primary limitation for Zuckerberg, a billionaire with daily access to the world’s best engineers, was not technology, but rather having devices that could easily communicate with each other and Jarvis in a central, unified system. This suggests that if Google or Amazon is successful in integrating their smart speakers with many other home devices (or proprietary versions), that Jarvis-like home AI would be available to anyone in the next five years.  Image: Mark Zuckerberg’s Jarvis Wrap Up We’ve only scratched the surface of examples of AI and ML in day-to-day life. Specific industries and hobbies have habitual interaction with AI far beyond what’s explored in this article. For example, casual chess players regularly use AI powered chess engines to analyze their games and practice tactics, and bloggers often use mailing-list services that use ML to optimize reader engagement and open-rates. How will AI affect daily life on a grand scale in the near future? Futurist and Wired magazine co-founder Kevin Kelly predicts that, as AI becomes more deeply integrated in our lives, it will become the new infrastructure powering a second industrial revolution.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving—literally. Researchers have created software that borrows concepts from Darwinian evolution, including ""survival of the fittest,"" to build AI programs that improve generation after generation without human input. The program replicated decades of AI research in a matter of days, and its designers think that one day, it could discover new approaches to AI. ""While most people were taking baby steps, they took a giant leap into the unknown,"" says Risto Miikkulainen, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, who was not involved with the work. ""This is one of those papers that could launch a lot of future research."" Building an AI algorithm takes time. Take neural networks, a common type of machine learning used for translating languages and driving cars. These networks loosely mimic the structure of the brain and learn from training data by altering the strength of connections between artificial neurons. Smaller subcircuits of neurons carry out specific tasks—for instance spotting road signs—and researchers can spend months working out how to connect them so they work together seamlessly.

In recent years, scientists have sped up the process by automating some steps. But these programs still rely on stitching together ready-made circuits designed by humans. That means the output is still limited by engineers' imaginations and their existing biases. So Quoc Le, a computer scientist at Google, and colleagues developed a program called AutoML-Zero that could develop AI programs with effectively zero human input, using only basic mathematical concepts a high school student would know. ""Our ultimate goal is to actually develop novel machine learning concepts that even researchers could not find,"" he says. The program discovers algorithms using a loose approximation of evolution. It starts by creating a population of 100 candidate algorithms by randomly combining mathematical operations. It then tests them on a simple task, such as an image recognition problem where it has to decide whether a picture shows a cat or a truck.Advertisement In each cycle, the program compares the algorithms' performance against hand-designed algorithms. Copies of the top performers are ""mutated"" by randomly replacing, editing, or deleting some of its code to create slight variations of the best algorithms. These ""children"" get added to the population, while older programs get culled. The cycle repeats. The system creates thousands of these populations at once, which lets it churn through tens of thousands of algorithms a second until it finds a good solution. The program also uses tricks to speed up the search, like occasionally exchanging algorithms between populations to prevent any evolutionary dead ends, and automatically weeding out duplicate algorithms. In a preprint paper published last month on arXiv, the researchers show the approach can stumble on a number of classic machine learning techniques, including neural networks. The solutions are simple compared with today's most advanced algorithms, admits Le, but he says the work is a proof of principle and he's optimistic it can be scaled up to create much more complex AIs. Still, Joaquin Vanschoren, a computer scientist at the Eindhoven University of Technology, thinks it will be a while before the approach can compete with the state-of-the-art. One thing that could improve the program, he says, is not asking it to start from scratch, but instead seeding it with some of the tricks and techniques humans have discovered. ""We can prime the pump with learned machine learning concepts."" That's something Le plans to work on. Focusing on smaller problems rather than entire algorithms also holds promise, he adds. His group published another paper on arXiv on 6 April that used a similar approach to redesign a popular ready-made component used in many neural networks. But Le also believes boosting the number of mathematical operations in the library and dedicating even more computing resources to the program could let it discover entirely new AI capabilities. ""That's a direction we're really passionate about,"" he says. ""To discover something really fundamental that will take a long time for humans to figure out.""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is clearly a must-have when it comes to being competitive in today’s markets. But implementing this technology has been challenging, even for some of the world’s top companies. There are issues with data, finding the right talent and creating models that generate sufficient ROI.


As a result, many AI projects fail. According to IDC, only abut 35% of organizations succeed in getting models into production successfully.

“While we see AI technologies performing a swath of incredible feats such as Google Translate, AlphaGo, and solving a rubik's cube, it can be hard to tell which business problems AI is apt to solve,” said Ankur Goyal, who is the CEO at Impira. “This has led to a lot of confusion—and a vendor community that has taken advantage of it by labeling things as AI when they aren’t. It’s very reminiscent of early last decade when cloud technologies took off and we had a lot of cloud washing going on. We had vendors marketing themselves as cloud players when their offerings were vaporware. Similarly, we are going through a period of AI washing now.”

So then, if your company is thinking of implementing AI, what is the best way to start? How can you help boost the odds of success and avoid the pitfalls?

Here’s a look at some strategies:

Beware Of The Hype
AI is not magic. It will not solve all your company’s problems.  Rather, you need to take a realistic approach to the technology.
“Unlike traditional data analytics, machine learning (ML) models that power AI are not always going to offer clear-cut answers,” said Santiago Giraldo, who is the Senior Product Marketing Manager of Data Engineering at Cloudera. “Implementing AI into the business requires experimentation and an understanding that not every experiment is going to drive ROI. When an AI project is successful, it is often built on top of many failed data science experiments. Taking a portfolio approach to ML and AI enables greater longevity in projects and the ability to build on the successes more effectively in the future.”
Governance First
You don’t want to spend time and money on a project and then realize there are legal or compliance restrictions. This could easily mean having to abandon the effort.
“First, customer data should not be used without permission,” said Debu Chatterjee, who is the senior director of platform AI engineering at ServiceNow. “Secondly, bias from data should be mitigated. Any model which is a black box and cannot be tested through APIs for bias should be avoided. The risk of bias is present in nearly any AI model, even in an algorithmic decision, regardless of whether the algorithm was learned from data or written by humans.”

Identify the Problem To Be Solved
In the early phases of an AI project, there should be lots of brainstorming. This should also involve a cross-section of people in the organization, which will help with buy-in. The goal is to identify a business problem to be solved.

“For many companies, the problem is that they start with a need for technology, and not with an actual business need,” said Colin Priest, who is the VP of AI Strategy at DataRobot. “It reminds me of this famous quote from Steve Jobs, ‘You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to sell it.’”
The problem to be solved should also be specific–that is, something that can be measured–and narrow. Don’t boil the ocean.
“It is the small steps that count,” said Mike Brooks, who is the Senior Director of APM Consulting at Aspen Technology. “Do not make the mistake of trying to make AI work for everything, all at once. After analyzing value for each AI initiative, the real benefits come when it solves a very specific goal.”
Costs
While it is important to estimate the ROI of a project, there is often too little attention paid to the cost side of the equation. But this can lead to disappointment. After all, it is never fun to be over budget on a corporate initiative. 
“Companies looking to implement an AI project should start by looking at the cost of the operation and doing an analysis on how that cost structure compares to best practices,” said Jerry Kurtz, who is the EVP and Head of I&D at Capgemini North America. “The cost of storing and transforming data is typically 70% of the budget, and only brings 10% of the value. Being able to leverage AI to solve business problems is only 30% of the cost, and brings 90% of the value. If an organization can reduce data costs and improve data quality, they’ll have more budget to put toward leveraging AI to solve those business problems, like improving productivity and efficiency.”
Buy-In
Implementing AI can be wrenching for an organization.  Employees may be skeptical of the technology and could fear for their jobs. 
This is why there needs to be focus on getting buy-in, which means having clear communication of the benefits. It should also involve a commitment from the C-Suite. Consider that—according to a recent survey from O’Reilly—the biggest bottleneck for AI is an unsupportive culture. 
“For AI to succeed you must have the buy-in of your workforce and the right employee upskilling programs,” said Anand Rao, who is the Global AI Lead at PwC. “You can’t simply offer AI training courses to employees; you need to go further and offer both immediate opportunities and incentives to apply what they’ve learned. Furthermore, business stakeholders and end-users—not just the tech staff—need to be included from the beginning of any project. If they’re not brought in at the start, your organization risks building a solution that does not work for the people who will be using it.”

Microsoft is dedicating $20 million to advance the use of artificial intelligence and data science in COVID-19 research, with a particular focus on diagnostics, hospital resources, and other critical areas.







For more coronavirus updates, visit our resource page, updated twice daily by Xtelligent Healthcare Media.
The donation will bolster the efforts of Microsoft’s AI for Health initiative, a five-year, $40 million project that aims to advance the health of people and communities around the world.
“As of the time of writing, the COVID-19 virus has infected more than 1.4 million people around the world. The crisis has made it painfully clear that health transcends every border, impacting every person on the planet,” John Kahan, chief data analytics officer at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post.
“Given the urgency, we are mobilizing our AI for Health initiative to focus on helping those on the front lines of research of COVID-19. We’re focusing our efforts in five specific areas where we think data, analysis and the skills of our data scientists can have the biggest impact.”
COVID-19-related research efforts will focus on data and insights to inform safety and economic impacts, as well as the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Research will also explore the allocation of resources at hospitals across the country, dissemination of accurate information, and scientific studies to understand COVID-19.
“Data and computation will help light the path to mitigating the pandemic. We’re passionate about aiming our computing resources and expertise at empowering those with the most promising directions, including efforts in biomedicine, logistics, epidemiology and public health,” said Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s Chief Scientific Officer.
The donation is part of Microsoft’s larger commitment to combating COVID-19. The corporation is working to support remote education and empower students around the world, helping businesses work from home, and securing needed medical supplies.
“Given the global scale of the pandemic, technology will play a critical role in nearly every facet of addressing COVID-19, from using AI to crunch massive datasets to analyzing disease vectors and identifying treatment impacts,” Kahan said.
“We will collaborate with nonprofits, governments and academic researchers on solutions, and bring our experience to the table, providing access to Microsoft AI, technical experts, data scientists and other resources.”
Microsoft has already engaged in several key partnerships to accelerate the fight against COVID-19, including the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a public-private effort led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. As part of the consortium, Microsoft is offering researchers access to the world’s most powerful computing resources, helping to speed the pace of scientific discovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Microsoft has also partnered with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a global health research organization at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The institute is releasing a set of COVID-19 data visualizations and forecasts that the White House, governors, and hospital administrators can use to mobilize resources.
Additionally, Microsoft is collaborating with the Washington State Department of Health on a dashboard that aims to increase the speed, timeliness, and accuracy of data reporting to the public. The dashboard relies on data reported by local health jurisdictions, healthcare facilities, and labs.
Finally, to better track understanding and progress against COVID-19, Microsoft has developed a set of interactive visualizations that the company will continue to update and refine with new data and insights.
Combating the COVID-19 pandemic, a global challenge, is well-suited for the goals of Microsoft’s AI for Health initiative. Launched in January 2020, AI for Health is designed to empower nonprofits, researchers, and organizations with AI and data science tools.
“Through AI for Health, we will support specific nonprofits and academic collaboration with Microsoft’s leading data scientists, access to best-in-class AI tools and cloud computing, and select cash grants. As a tech company, it is our responsibility to ensure that organizations working on the most pressing societal issues have access to our latest AI technology and the expertise of our technical talent,” Kahan said when Microsoft announced the initiative.
“We look forward to working with researchers, academics, nonprofits, health industry professionals and policymakers around the world as we accelerate research and insights. Together, we can improve the health of people and communities globally.”
With this $20 million contribution, Microsoft expects to accelerate the speed with which researchers and healthcare professionals understand and develop solutions for COVID-19.
“COVID-19 is a global problem and finding a solution will take all our efforts. We are humbled and honored to work with researchers across the globe and support them with this additional dedicated support from AI for Health,” Kahan concluded.

This is the first part, a kind of introductory story to a series where I will be describing my company’s efforts and progress in bringing AI (Artificial Intelligence) to the world of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). We believe it will be a complete game-changer for many industries, not only bringing speedup and cutting TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) but most importantly, offering entirely new possibilities for the CFD users. These 3 elements are also the goals for us as a company, and I will be referring to them in my subsequent stories while sharing the progress of this fascinating research project at byteLAKE. So let me say, welcome to the AI for CFD, season premiere. Follow us on a journey to bring your CFD work to a very new level. Also, you are very welcome to join the discussions and actively participate in the groups I linked below. We’re really looking forward to hearing your comments, and hopefully, our work will inspire you to open up your thoughts with us.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite: AI for CFDAI for CFD will be a complete game-changer for many industries, not only bringing speedup and cutting TCO but most importantly, offering entirely new possibilities for the CFD users.I am pretty sure that the audience of this story is very well familiar with what the CFD is and I bet most of you bring tons of precious experience in the field. But just in case you landed here by chance or out of sheer curiosity or simply wonder how to pave your way to getting started with fluid dynamics, let me start by saying a few words of definition. In that context, and I will explain it in more detail in my future posts, we’re also thinking of lowering the entry barrier for those who want to get started with CFD simulations to solve particular engineering problems. In other words, part of our job is to make the CFD learning curve much steeper: straight forward tools you need to rapidly solve complex problems.CFD, Computational Fluid Dynamics tools combine numerical analysis and algorithms to solve fluid flows problems. They are used to model fluids density, velocity, pressure, temperature, and chemical concentrations in relation to time and space.A range of industries such as automotive, chemical, aerospace, biomedical, power and energy, and construction rely on fast CFD analysis turnaround time. It is a key part of their design workflow to understand and design how liquids and gases flow and interact with surfaces.Typical applications include weather simulations, aerodynamic characteristics modeling and optimization, and petroleum mass flow rate assessment.As a company, we’ve been working in the CFD field for many years now. We are not your typical CFD user or adopter. Our take on the subject is more from the algorithmics perspective and its adaptation or optimization (if you like) to various, heterogeneous HPC configurations.For instance, one of the projects we did was about moving weather simulation engine from Fortran-based desktop implementation to a fully scalable, MPI-enabled C++ & NVIDIA CUDA optimized version. Needless to say, the work included a tremendous effort to mathematically redesign the computations, as well as reorganize the data to efficiently deploy it in many-CPU and many-GPU cluster environments. One such was Piz Daint supercomputer in Switzerland (still the fastest supercomputer in Europe). We’ve summarized some of the key parts of that project in the case study on our website: www.byteLAKE.com/en/MPDATA (CFD acceleration with GPU).Then, we shifted our gears towards FPGAs, a story that led us to explore the potential of datacenter accelerator cards named Alveo. In collaboration with Xilinx, we designed from scratch the Advection algorithm and adapted it heavily to the U250 and later U280 Alveo boards. Again, straight-forward porting was not an option due to hardware specifics and our ambition to make the most of it. We decided to go with OpenCL though. However, in that particular example, our code reached almost 99% of the attainable performance. Hence, we saw no reason for moving to C++. Eventually, as in the previous case, we saw some interesting acceleration numbers. What is different though, we achieved these within extremely low energy budgets, positioning the Alveo-based configurations as a preferred accelerator if Green Computing is on your agenda. We’ve described all the technical details at www.byteLAKE.com/en/FPGA as well as in a linked technical blog post.Jobs in Big DataBoth of these experiences (and many other, similar in scope) led us to a conclusion that:CFD adaptation to hardware accelerator cards, while promising in many cases, certainly does not bring substantially new value to the industries.The speedup offered by GPUs and FPGAs is definitely of value. Energy efficiency concerns seem to be gaining a wider audience, pushing the engineers further towards more efficient designs. However, we need to remember that CFD codes have primarily been designed for and still are heavily being customized for CPU-only machines. Therefore adaptation to heterogeneous architectures comes at a cost. A substantial one to be honest. And while such efforts are indeed interesting and just referring to the case studies I linked above, “CFD on steroids” makes sense in many cases. However, we as a company see it as an intermediate step, leading to a completely new, refreshed approach to the engineering simulations as a whole.Beyond HPC, it is AI that we as a team always strive to leverage everywhere we possibly can to augment the intelligence of humans, machines, and even algorithms. Therefore we have been experimenting with applied machine learning for CFD for quite some time. The first time we successfully used it, was probably in combination with a mixed-precision arithmetic to further increase the efficiency of calculations in terms of shortening the time to results and lowering the energy consumption. Then we modeled a simplified advection of sin(x) * cos(y) by predicting its result with a custom-designed AI model, based on machine learning and 2D convolution. We trained the model with 1000 time steps. As a result, it needed only 3 time steps of simulation to predict the next 100 time steps. And the accuracy loss was under 0.001. Quite a simple scenario to start with and we are now tackling on a way more complex simulations, details of which I will be covering in the next parts of this series.Top 4 Most Popular Ai Articles:1. 10 trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI)2.

Bursting the Jargon bubbles — Deep LearningAs a sneak peek preview, we have just completed the full simulation of the OpenFOAM’s (OPENFOAM®) motorBike and used AI to predict its first returning matrix. At this very early stage, the accuracy of calculations is 95% (as compared between AI vs. motorBike solver results). We are now focusing on accuracy and memory optimizations. I will share more soon.So if you are working in the AI + CFD field or are curious about the topic, feel free to reach out to me.

HighlightsAn AI expert was the first to identify signs of COVID-19 pandemicSocial distancing along with AI can help win the war against COVID-19Expert says that AI will change the world dramatically in coming yearsNew Delhi: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used across many levels in the fight against the coronavirus, but the best tools to tackle any pandemic are quarantine and social distancing, asserts one of the world’s leading AI experts Toby Walsh. He says an AI epidemiologist was the first to identify the first signs of the pandemic, scanning millions of tweets and blog posts to pinpoint a new disease coming out of Wuhan back in December 2019. Mr. Walsh who is Scientia Professor of AI at the University of New South Wales and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science said,
AI can be (and is being) used across many levels of the fight to beat the coronavirus. AI is also being used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. Technology will help. But old-fashioned tools will help win the war. The best tool we have is the oldest – the one we’ve used for 700 years against any pandemic, namely quarantine. In Venice in 1377, ships from plague-stricken countries were forced to wait off its port for 40 days to assure that no latent cases were aboard.

He further said that the next best tool that will help us prevent the spread is social distancing. Technologies like AI will help on top of this. But it is these simple, blunt and old tools that will ultimately decide how many people die, he say.
On the role of AI in the fight against this deadly virus, he says,
AI is being used in the hunt to search for existing drugs that can be repurposed to fight the disease. It is also being used to understand the biochemistry of the coronavirus. Besides, AI help is taken to diagnose those infected with COVID-19 by reading CT-scans for the distinctive patterns on people’s lungs.
Mr. Walsh has recently come out with a book “2062: The World that AI Made” in which he explores the impact artificial intelligence will have on work, war, economics, politics, everyday life and even human death. He started writing the book, published by Speaking Tiger, the day he finished reading Yuval Noah Harari’s “Home Deus”. He says,
AI is a profound technology that will change the very fabric of our society. But we won’t become gods. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. It is our mortality and our humanity that will become deeply important as the features that will distinguish us from the immortal and omnipotent machines that we will create.

When Mr. Walsh finished writing the book, his eight-year-old daughter asked him what it was about. He recalls,
I told her the book was about the world she will inherit. How will the world in 40 or 50 years be when machines are as smart if not smarter than us, when machines can do almost all our jobs. Will these machines even be conscious? What will our society be like then? And then I did the maths, and in 2062, she will be exactly my age to the year. This book focuses on the year 2062. Most experts in AI believe that there’s a 50 per cent chance we will have created machines that can think as well as us by 2062.
Artificial Intelligence, says Mr. Walsh, will change the world dramatically. He adds,
We need, therefore, to think big about the changes we should make to society today if we are to ensure that the world of 2062 is the one we want. If we make the right choices, AI promises to make life better – not just for the few but for the many. It can let us all live healthier, wealthier and perhaps even happier lives.

HII will design artificial intelligence-powered models of immunity that can accelerate vaccine development and testing for a wide range of diseases, including COVID-19.
Vaccine development can be a long and laborious process, mainly due to the complexity of the human immune system and its variability among different people and groups. With advances in computing and artificial intelligence, genomics, systems biology, and bioinformatics, HII will try to decode the underlying ways the human immune system fights disease.
“Successful vaccination requires four components —knowing the vaccine target, what kind of immune response you want, how to generate that response, and understanding responses in the people who you want to vaccinate,” said Sarah Fortune, chair of Harvard Chan’s Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. 
“We understand a lot about the first two elements and very little about the last two. But by addressing these critical knowledge gaps, we envision a day when there are modular blueprints for successful vaccines that speed the process and increase likelihood of success.”
The initiative will specifically focus on the principles of effective immunity in aging populations, the world’s largest growing demographic. These individuals have a massive disease burden, as well as high morbidity and mortality in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent research has shown that older adults are at greater risk of complications from coronavirus. A study from UTHealth estimated that areas with high concentrations of residents over the age of 65 or with chronic diseases are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and are most likely to require hospitalization.
In its pilot phase, HII will examine how immunity changes with age, and how to predict or improve immune response among older adults.
“Decline or dysfunction of the immune system among people age 70 and older is a major public health issue as the global population ages. We are seeing this acutely now with COVID-19, which is mostly spread by younger people, but which older people die from at much higher rates,” said Jaap Goudsmit, adjunct professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at Harvard Chan School and chief scientific officer of the Human Vaccines Project.
The insights from HII will help develop artificial intelligence-powered models that allow researchers to virtually test potential vaccines and predict which therapies might work best across populations. This could accelerate vaccine and drug development, resulting in less money spent on trials and testing.
“The way we fight disease is broken—we launch into disease-specific battles without understanding the rules that affect our chances of success,” said Michelle A. Williams, Dean of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
“The Human Vaccines Project set out to change that by decoding the human immunome, and we are already seeing initial findings from their tremendous work. We are excited to bring the intellectual and technological resources of Harvard Chan School, and our colleagues across Harvard, to further those efforts through HII.”
HII will work with blood samples from thousands of people enrolled in epidemiological studies around the world. Members of the Human Vaccine Project and Harvard Chan scientists have done extensive work in various cohorts, and specific pilot studies are almost completed.
HII will build on these longitudinal cohort studies and apply state-of-the-art methods in epidemiology, immune monitoring, systems biology, AI and machine learning to define effective immunity in aging populations. Researchers will then apply this data towards speeding vaccine and therapeutic development.
“The world’s population is aging at unprecedented rates, significantly increasing the burden of non-communicable diseases and vulnerability to infectious diseases, as evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic,” said Wayne C. Koff, president and CEO of the Human Vaccines Project.
“The complexity of the human immune system has confounded efforts to prevent and control diseases in aging populations, and this collaboration will marry expansive data collection through clinical research with new technologies and cutting-edge science to catalyze new approaches to fighting major global diseases.”
By combining the Human Vaccine Project’s global network of academic, biotech, and pharma partners with Harvard’s expertise, HII will enhance the potential for defining effective immunity in aging populations. The initiative will aim to develop novel strategies for enabling longer, healthier lives.
“We are very excited to launch the Human Immunomics Initiative with the Harvard Chan School, and bring together our synergistic capabilities towards accelerating disease prevention for aging populations,” said Koff.

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Deloitte, EY, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and KPMG are among the largest service providers in the accounting industry— collectively referred to as the Big Four. Many of the financial and consulting services offered by these firms – such as advising on investment decisions – involve finding patterns in very large sets of data. This data is often beyond the understanding of a single person (or team of persons) and is often “noisy” and without a set format. The Big Four all seem to have artificial intelligence initiatives – and the goal of this article here is to compare and contrast their AI-related efforts (and purported results). A few of the Big Four have invested heavily in innovation labs and claim to embrace a new era of automation and augmentation. In the article below we aim to answer the following three questions: What are the different AI technologies the Big Four are implementing and how? Which services are most likely to be automated first? What are the similarities and differences in the AI initiatives and strategy for each of the Big Four? We’ll explore the AI investments and initiatives of these companies one-by-one, starting with Deloitte.  Deloitte It is one of the biggest accounting brands under which lie several professionals and firms that offer auditing, strategy consulting and tax preparation related services. As with most large consulting firms, Deloitte vies for market share and press through thought leadership – and like the other Big Four – it has increasingly focused it’s white papers and research on the topic of artificial intelligence. A recent Deloitte article breaks down AI technologies into the following discreet categories: Product: AI technology embedded into the product or service itself to provide all the associated end-customer benefits. Process: AI technology to streamline daily workflow and operations to automate and increase day-to-day productivity. Automation can happen in two forms: by either reducing manpower directly or augmenting a worker’s ability to perform a task better/faster. Insight: AI is used to make informed and strategic decisions to provide targeted advice to a company to new or existing businesses. Based on our assessment, most of Deloitte’s own AI-related initiatives seem to fall into the categories of Process and Insight, as we’ll see below. A concrete example of an AI-enabled process is the document-review platform developed by Deloitte US innovation that went live in 2014. Deloitte claims that this platform has automated the process of reviewing and extracting all the relevant information from contracts, and reducing meticulous, laborious human efforts. The company claims that this technology has helped reduce the time spent on reviewing legal contract documents, invoices, financial statements and board meeting minutes by up to 50 percent or more. Deloitte has recently partnered with IBM Watson. The Deloitte touts the partnership as a way to provide end users with cognitive-technology-enhanced solutions for their businesses. Following are some business use-cases as a result of this partnership: LeasePoint– It is powered by IBM TRIRIGA and utilizes Deloittes knowledge in leasing industry to teach the AI-enabled system to develop an end-to-end leasing portfolio Visual inspection of assets– Using IBM’s Maximo technology Deloitte claims to be improving asset inspection on wind farms. Learn more in this video. Deloitte Catalyst – another recent AI initiative from the global consulting giant – is a network of startups, that are working together to translate AI technologies into practical business solutions for client firms. Deloitte offers Catalyst companies funding, and access to Deloitte’s client base in order to partner and flesh out their business applications. Most AI firms are still figuring out exactly how to drive business value with their technology, and Deloitte hopes to forge partnerships with these cutting-edge firms to help bring the latest AI innovations to their clients. The video below explains the initiative (starting around 55 seconds):  Ayasdi, Narrative Science, and Kira are claimed to be among the businesses partnering with Deloitte in their Catalyst program. “Technology like AI can help make these processes more efficient, accurate and comprehensive, helping us get better insights to clients sooner, and empowering our professionals to deliver high-value services to our clients”. – Craig Muraskin, Managing Director, Deloitte U.S. Innovation Group EY Formerly known as Ernst & Young, EY is one of the largest professional service providing firms in the world. It operates as a network of firms which function independently in different countries, collectively offering assurance, audit, tax, consulting and advisory services to companies. The company has recently applied AI to the analysis of lease contracts. The company claims that the use of AI has made it easier to capture relevant information from contracts such as lease commencement date, amount to be paid, and renewal or termination options. According to an article in Accounting Today, EY is working to automate the auditing process. They claim that this reduces the administrative time spent on reviewing audit documents and gives employees more time to participate in the judgment and analytical part of the process. These applications appear to be in pilot phase (which is to be expected). as sifting through the auditing or lease documents can be extremely time consuming. According to EY Global Assurance Innovation Leader Jeanne Boillet in a June 2017 report: “These pilots show that AI tools would make it possible to review about 70%-80% of a simple lease’s contents electronically, leaving the remainder to be considered by a human. With more complex leases (in real estate, for instance), that figure would be more like 40%, but as the tools improve, and the machines learn, it is likely that more complex contracts and data can be read, managed and analyzed.” Another area where EY has applied AI technology is the automation of routine tasks, such as auditing (which we covered in greater depth in our full article on AI in insurance), by using it’s own proprietary Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system. EY claims that this technology, known as  , helps the firm deliver more accurate, efficient audits for its clients. EY Australia has already adopted this digital auditing technology, claiming that 50% of its bank audit confirmations were lodged using the AI-enabled system. This AI-enabled system can accept and confirm audit requests, process and provide the auditors with the relevant documentation for final analysis and judgment. EY has also launched an AI proof-of-concept, using computer vision to enable airborne drones to monitor inventory during the auditing process. For example, this drone can count the number of vehicles in a production plant under audit, and communicate this data directly into the EY Canvas – the global audit digital platform. According to EY, use of drones allows more data to be captured in the process of auditing. It also allows auditors to focus on risk areas rather than taking stock of inventory manually. This drone initiative seems to be in research and development mode at the time being and doesn’t seem to be a service offered broadly to EY’s client base. A screen shot of EY’s press release about their experimentation with drone use for inventory management While overtly embracing the developments in AI, EY is also aware of the threat AI poses to white-collar work, and they appear to be addressing automation seriously in their thought leadership. EY’s recent report on the future of work highlights some of the societal and regulatory concerns of job automation in the decade ahead. A screenshot of EY’s report on the job market implications of AI Predictably, much of EY’s thought leadership touts the benefits of augmentation instead of automation. EY Global Assurance Innovation Leader Jeanne Boillet says that Artificial Intelligence “has the potential to transform audit, but it will never replace the auditor”. We find the word “never” to be downright ridiculous, but we cannot blame EY leadership from having to tout this opinion, and there is no reason to blame Mrs. Boillet for being so black-and-white about the matter, anyone in her shoes would say the same thing. This belief in an “augmented”, not an “automated” future is a common theme among large, people-heavy legacy businesses. Many would argue that businesses of this kind (chock full of knowledge workers working in spreadsheets) are among the biggest “low-hanging fruit” for automation, and it behooves older people-heavy businesses to dispel disturbing thoughts about massive layoffs. By no means are we suggesting that the Big Four are inherently doomed to perish by nimbler, less human-laden competitors. Rather, we want to address the fact that these firms can be expected to have only one opinion on this matter. The impact on employee morale and shareholder value would likely be tragic if EY’s leadership (or the leadership of Accenture, Deloitte, or any other large consulting firm) were to state openly that many of their current jobs may be fully automated, and that some of these jobs would not be replaced. Hence, large firms of this kind are only permitted to give one opinion, an inherently self-serving one, one with a commitment to stave off risk and ensure it’s own survival. We don’t consider this immoral, it’s the same kind of self-preservation we’d see in any other sector or industry. It may not be blameworthy, but it is our job here at TechEmergence to make it known that these opinions should not be taken at face value. Whenever a company has no choice but to tout a single perspective, we’re likely to lay those facts outright so that business readers (like yourself) can make more informed decisions. We should expect to see large, people-heavy legacy companies (For more insight into the kinds of jobs that might be first – or last – to automate, read or listen to our previous interviews with Martin Ford, Kevin LaGrandeur, and Marshall Brain – all of which are focused on the impact of automation on the job market.) PwC The second largest professional services firm by revenue, PwC, claims to have begun adopting AI as well. The International Accounting Bulletin awarded the ‘Audit Innovation of the year’ for PwC’s technology GL.ai in October 2017. GL.ai was developed in collaboration with H2O.ai, a Silicon Valley company that developed an AI-enabled system capable of analyzing documents and preparing reports. Using AI approaches like reinforcement learning, PwC claims that GL.ai learns and becomes more capable with every audit (a common capability for ML applications). GL.ai has already been trained on audit data from Canada, Germany, Sweden and the UK. We were unable to find robust case studies of the technology in our analysis, and – like most of the AI applications at Big Four firms at this time – the technology seems to be in development. They claim to have made a significant investment in Natural Language Processing (NLP)- an AI-enable technology for this purpose. NLP makes sense of complex lease agreements, revenue contracts, and board meeting minutes to form meaningful insights for clients. Anand Rao – Global AI lead at PwC – told TechEmergence about another PwC AI use-case in the automotive industry: “Using ‘digital twin’ technology and ‘future power’ we have helped large auto manufacturers visualize and navigate over 200,000 go-to-market scenarios to fine-tune their strategy and launch a new multi-billion dollar business in ridesharing and autonomous/electric vehicles. This particular application has won the Best Enterprise Award recently and is the wave of next generation of AI on ‘Gamifying Strategy’ – it takes the methods used to create AlphaGo and other game playing programs to the Boardrooms and Strategy Groups. We have done this at more than half-a-dozen clients”.  Like the other Big Four firms, PwC is actively involved in publishing thought leadership (articles, white papers, and more) on the implications of artificial intelligence. A recent PwC analysis of the financial services sector identifies a number of automation and augmentation concerns related to AI – and advice from PwC on how firms might adapt to AI in the future. A screenshot featuring part of PwC’s predictions on the impact of AI in FinTech PwC’s “AI: Sizing the prize” report estimates the percent increase in GDP to be attributed to AI in various economic regions (see below). The image below is only a small snapshot, because of the complexity of the topic (and the inherent challenges in predicting the future), we advise the reader to assess multiple sources and develop their own conclusions. A screen shot of part of the report on PwC’s “AI: Sizing the prize” report “Artificial intelligence can help people make faster, better, and cheaper decisions. But you have to be willing to collaborate with the machine, and not just treat it as either a servant or an overlord”. – Anand Rao, US Analytics Group Innovation Leader   KPMG KPMG has built its own portfolio of AI tools called KPMG Ignite. The KPMG Ignite offering is designed to enhance business decisions and process on a digital platform. Key features of KPMG Ignite include AI tools (a few examples of which are listed below), AI integrators to make these tools compatible with existing IT infrastructure, guidance for client firms and testing, prototype development, and innovation on emerging AI applications. KPMG is also using AI to analyze and extract information from leasing or investment agreements. Following are some of the business process where KPMG claims to have applied AI-enabled technology- Call Center Analytics Engine- Utilizes NLP to design a model to predict future events and even convert customer calls to unstructured text, which is then streamlined to identify keywords, customer sentiment and predict future trends. AI Anomalous Event Predicting Tool- Uses AI techniques to develop a model to predict future business events. Document Compliance Assessment Engine- Uses AI to read a documentation- contract, leasing and investment agreement- in its entirety and yield relevant information. (Learn more about Business implications of AI from KPMG here) KPMG signed a “Participation Agreement” with IBM in June 2016 – apparently with the intention of using IBM Watson to automate audit-related processes. It isn’t clear if this “Participation Agreement” involved paying IBM, or if both firms are looking to prove out a use-case together in a kind of barter. Little seems to be available about the present progress of said agreement. In a 2016 press release, KPMG’s John Kelly (Senior Vice-President, Cognitive Solutions and IBM Research) states: “Auditing and similar knowledge services are increasingly challenged with tackling immense volumes of unstructured data. Cognitive technologies such as Watson can transform how this data is understood and how critical decisions are made. By applying Watson, KPMG is taking a forward-looking approach to extending its expertise, helping professionals and clients gain new insights from critical enterprise information” As we might expect, KPMG has joined the thought leadership game around artificial intelligence – with the intent of informing their clients and appearing ahead of the curve. Like Deloitte, they’ve created a number of layperson-friendly AI explainer videos to explain AI’s potential impact on their work: KPMG’s “ethical compass for automation” highlights some of the societal concerns that they consider to be important in the years ahead. KPMG’s Automation Practice Lead, Todd Loar, explains the fundamental findings of their report in the 5-minute presentation below:  On the Game of Thought Leadership for Consulting Companies As analysts in the AI industry, we’re tasked with sorting out truth from hype. With the popularity of AI (and the growing sentiment of its inevitability in effecting all business sectors), it often behooves companies to seem ahead of the AI curve. In the world of startups, companies increasingly see their competitors use “artificial intelligence” in pitch decks and on their “about” page – and the pressure mounts to do the same (even if they have no AI skills or talent, and even if the product is in no way predicated on artificial intelligence). In the world of consulting firms, the same phenomenon occurs. Businesses must “keep up with the Joneses” in the perception game of AI competence, or else they’ll lose business to someone who puts up a better front. As in the startup world, this leads to a vicious cycle of mutual one-upmanship without the prowess to back up the claims. For some reason I find that business readers often know intuitively that a startup’s pitch deck is self-serving, but they’re often unable to apply that same “taking it with a grain of salt” mentality to white papers and reports, which – like pitch decks – serve the goal of filling a company’s bank accounts, not of portraying truth for its own sake. This disclaimer is important: Thought leadership is perception management, not objective analysis. This isn’t to say that we don’t believe that the Big Four are using AI. These companies have massive revenues and thousands of talented people – and based on our assessment, all four of the Big Four claim to have integrated AI into some of their service offerings, and we’d suspect that this is, in fact, the case. Rather we imply they have no choice but to say that they are on the cutting edge of AI (or they risk losing business to their better-marketed competitors). This isn’t blameworthy, it’s business – and we aren’t here to point fingers, but to lay the situation out as it is. Time will tell which of these companies is leveraging the technology most fruitfully, and we imagine that there will be a rather intense competition among these top firms to improve their service quality and profit margins through automation. Indeed part of our job here at TechEmergence is to do the “digging” ourselves and aim to get behind the bluster of press releases, but we’d like to remind our readers to think like an analyst as they consume information that might affect their strategy and procurement. Concluding Thoughts on AI in the Accounting Big Four In the sections above, we reviewed how AI is being used by all the Big Four. Based on our research on these companies, two common trends seem clear: First, they seem to be investing in AI technologies for accounting services. AI is being integrated into the core of the business and its use is showing a gradual increase. Second, the Four also purport to see AI as a critical factor to give them an edge over others and are in some sense competing with each other to gain AI supremacy. The use of AI holds many promises for the future of these consulting giants. It may take away the pain of flipping through hundreds of pages for hours and making reports. A lot of data collected during auditing and tax preparation is unstructured and prone to human error. AI-enabled technology, trained on this unstructured data is increasingly capable of recognizing the errors and streamlining parts of the process. Next in line for augmentation and automation are advisory services. Using consulting and advisory data, firms are now training AI networks to learn how to interact with client firms looking for business solutions. The decision to relying on AI solutions requires administrative streamlining and strategic planning on many levels. The firms have worked hard to define these strategies to implement and integrate AI technologies in the workplace. For example, Deloitte aims to create process maps to keep track of the organization’s core business processes. Our analysis of machine learning in the finance sector indicates that this industry is among the most likely to adopt more white-collar automation in the years ahead – a trend we see clearly in the analysis of the Big Four. This will help identify business processes where AI might have the most impact. PwC, advises choosing areas that are operational or explanatory in nature and explore AI solutions to these problems before others (source). These strategies can help to facilitate a judicial use of budget, resources, and planning that goes into the use of AI in a business. Given the impact that AI is poised to make, there has to be a discussion about the extent to which we rely solely on machine-based intelligence and decisions. Every industry embracing AI for a business solution is concerned with the impact that this technology can have on humans in the workplace. For the Big Four, this is reason for greater concern, as they operate in a people-centric business – and one that some experts would presume to be ripe for massive disruption through automation. Our analysis reveals that the Big Four are investigating the concerns of workforce automation – though most all of their published thought leadership paints an optimistic future of augmentation, rather than one of automation. Time will tell when it comes to the effects of AI on the knowledge workers within the Big Four. My fingers are crossed that their industry – as with many others – have insight and ability to adopt. They’re certainly working on it.   Header image credit: b4f.eu Related Posts AI-based Business Process Management in Banking - Current Use-CasesBusiness process management (BPM) in banking involves the automation of operations management by identifying, modeling,… The Principles of AI Governance - with Karine Perset of the OECDWe interviewed Karine Perset, from the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation in France… AI Startups in Auto Lending - 2 Well-Funded ExamplesThe auto-lending industry stands to benefit from artificial intelligence in much the same way as… AI in Building Automation - Current ApplicationsIn our previous report, we covered the current use cases for AI in construction and… AI for Compliance in Banking - Where Banks Should Focus NextIn the banking sector, supervisory organizations create and oversee the compliance rules that banks and… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Biotech Get Real
Whether modeling the real world or making sense of real-time data, AI can enhance drug development from candidate screening to trial management

AI may be used to extract insights from millions of experimental affinity measurements and thousands of protein structures to predict the binding of small molecules to proteins. This approach is being realized by Atomwise, the developer of AtomNet, a structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. AtomNet helped Stanford University researchers screen 6.8 million small molecules for their ability to target Miro1, a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease. In the space filling structure for Miro1 shown here, the area in white represents the screening site. The most promising compound, the Miro1 Reducer, appears in the inset.
Artificial intelligence (AI) may sound futuristic, but it already exists in many everyday technologies. For example, it gives our handheld devices voice and facial recognition capabilities. AI is also making its presence felt in biotechnology, where it has become integral to many aspects of drug discovery and development.
AI applications in biotech include drug target identification, drug screening, image screening, and predictive modeling. AI is also being used to comb through the scientific literature and manage clinical trial data.




By leveraging machine learning, AI can manage disparate clinical trial datasets, enable virtual screening, and analyze vast amounts of data. Besides reducing clinical trial costs, AI can gain otherwise unobtainable insights and feed them back into the drug development process.
AI technologies to serve the biotech industry are being developed by several companies. Their services are rapidly becoming indispensable as older methods like classical statistical analysis or manual image scanning reach their practical limits.
A new world of abundance
Atomwise was the first company to apply a common type of machine learning, convolutional neural networking (CNN), to drug design and discovery. CNN is used in familiar everyday applications like Alexa’s speech recognition technology or Facebook’s image tagging feature. Atomwise has 550 ongoing machine learning projects focusing on problems like hit discovery, potency optimization, selectivity optimization, and off-target toxicity testing.







According to Atomwise CEO Abraham Heifets, PhD, there is virtually no limit to the number of small-molecule compounds that can be virtually screened using Atomwise’s algorithm. “We did the largest screen in human history recently—12 billion molecules,” says Heifets. Most of those 12 billion molecules don’t exist in nature and have never existed. Any of them, however, can be synthesized by Atomwise partners. These vendors can quickly synthesize interesting candidate molecules from a set of basic building blocks and deliver them within four to six weeks. Heifets asserts that the availability of those theoretical compounds is increasing rapidly, and soon it may be possible to screen 100 billion molecules.
The problems of drug screening shift with a large abundance of molecules. “If you have 100 billion molecules and you have a 99% accurate model, it sounds pretty good.” Heifets explains. “But that means you have a 1% false-positive rate, and your right answer will be swamped in a billion false positives. In fact, what you need to fruitfully, productively work in this new world of abundance are computational techniques that are far in excess of 99% accuracy—99.999%.”
Like many other disruptive technologies in pharmaceutical research—technologies such as CRISPR gene editing, proteolysis targeting chimera–induced protein degradation, and RNA interference—AI is generating a lot of excitement. “AI,” Heifets maintains, “promises to [help drug developers] go after previously intractable targets.” He points out that early interest in disruptive technologies such as AI tends to precede incredible clinical results. “It is,” he emphasizes, “the promise of opening up greenfield opportunities.”
Autonomous AI in real-world use
Machine learning also offers exciting opportunities in the realm of clinical diagnostics. For example, AI technologies for medical applications are being developed by Eyenuk. The company’s first product to market, EyeArt®, uses AI to detect disease from retinal images. In a clinical trial that included 942 patients and spanned 15 medical centers around the United States, sensitivity for detection of diabetic retinopathy was over 95%.
Eyenuk, an artificial intelligence medical technology and services company, has developed the EyeArt platform, which uses artificial intelligence to detect diabetic retinopathy. EyeArt can autonomously analyze a patient’s retinal images to robustly detect signs of disease and return an easy-to-read report in under 60 seconds.
EyeArt was developed using machine learning to train its algorithms on nearly 2 million images. “Now imagine training your resident with so many images,” says Eyenuk CEO Kaushal Solanki, PhD. “That’s just not possible.”




Experts recommend annual screening for diabetic retinopathy for everyone with diabetes. Currently, the United Kingdom is the only country in the world screening more than 80% of its diabetes population. That’s nearly 2.5 million patients whose retinal images would need to be individually reviewed by experts every year.
The U.K. National Health Service (NHS) carried out a health technology assessment in which EyeArt was compared with several competing technologies. EyeArt was found to be superior by a broad margin. The assessment’s findings, which were published in 2016, showed that EyeArt has 99.6% sensitivity for detecting proliferative disease, and 93.8 % for referable disease. The NHS is now shifting its workflow to adopt EyeArt for its screening programs. Meanwhile, pilot assessments at six centers in the United Kingdom have been completed.
Channeling the data deluge
Traditional methods of data analysis in drug discovery work best with straightforward, homogenous data. However, those methods fall short when the data becomes complex, for example, when patient records chronicle multiple diagnoses, comorbidities, complex treatment plans, and many encounters with clinics and clinicians. AI can integrate that information, analyze it, and produce stratified patient groups. That ability to handle complex, multivariate data is revolutionizing the design and execution of clinical trials.
Sensyne Health is at the forefront of this clinical data movement. Sensyne’s chief of translational medicine, Rabia T. Khan, PhD, says that the traditional model of drug discovery, which burns through  billions of dollars and still produces high failure rates, is unsustainable. She adds, however, that AI promises to reduce costs and failures. Sensyneis partnering with the NHS to capture patient data and enable the stratification of patients for clinical trials.
“Because this data is so noisy and sparse and heterogeneous, you really do need AI,” Khan argues. “If you use classical approaches, you can’t identify subpopulations in heart failure. But when you go on to use more complex machine learning–based methods, you’re able to identify subpopulations of heart failure and show that there are more than just the two well-known subgroups of heart failure.
“There are actually multiple subgroups. We’re currently looking into how drugs are effective in many of those different subgroups.”
She predicts that eventually the industry will move away from classical randomized controlled trials and toward virtual trials. Enabled by AI, virtual trials will do the heavy lifting, providing much of the information that used to require expensive human trials. In fact, this information will be available for a prospective drug before the the drug is ever tested in human beings.
“Instead of taking something from an abstract idea in a dish all the way through to clinical work,” Khan says, “we will start with real-world data, link that to patient samples, and use that for drug discovery, and then we will feed the same information back into the clinical trial.”
Another company focused on managing clinical trial data is Precision Medicine Group. The company’s Precision for Medicine business recently acquired QuartzBio, an AI platform that analyzes biological and clinical data streams to extract knowledge and insights to accelerate drug development.
In clinical trials, there have been many attempts to funnel data from diverse sources to clinical trial investigators, who would then be able to quickly and flexibly interpret the data holistically. These attempts seldom succeed, suggests Cliff Culver, senior vice president of Precision Medicine Group.
“All of that data is generated independently and lives in disconnected formats all over the place,” he says. “For a drug company, multiple people would work for multiple weeks or months to pull all of that together, particularly when the focus involves linking quantifiable ‘reportables’ back to source information—like images or sequencing data—to enable ongoing quality control.
“The result is that analysis is meaningfully delayed, typically until after a trial is complete. And there’s rarely bandwidth to undertake deep data integration across trials within an organization. We do it as a trial is unfolding, so the company has regular insight into what’s happening, and then we do it at an enterprise level to maximize the utility of the data.”
Some of the approaches enabled by the QuartzBio platform bear a superficial resemblance to the unguided AI analyses used by Google, Netflix, or other large technology companies. Still, finding biological insights is different from choosing a movie you might like.
“In drug development, we typically have smaller and less dynamic data sets, and we have a material need to get beyond correlation to understand what’s happening biologically,” says Culver. “Our secret sauce is our ability to both pull all of that data together so you have the richest possible data set to explore and then apply the right data-driven or computational biology analysis, the AI, to derive actionable meaning.”
On-the-fly analyses
Concerto HealthAI is a precision medicine company with a major focus in oncology. It uses AI and machine learning to reveal how patients respond to treatments in real-world settings. The company’s work can guide pharmaceutical research, inform outcomes research and value-based studies, and accelerate drug development.
Concerto HealthAI CEO Jeff Elton, PhD, offers as an example of a typical cancer patient being diagnosed for the first time. That patient would initially be staged based on tumor location and size, metastatic status, and other features of the disease. Then this information would be used to guide treatment. Then, additional information—“on the fly” information about the patient’s progress or changes in disease status of the disease—may become available. It will not, however, automatically become part of the patient’s electronic medical record.
This sort of on-the-fly information is critical for pharmaceutical companies. For example, accurate information on staging at different timepoints in the patient history helps pharmaceutical companies understand why a treatment is or isn’t effective.
“We develop AI models that read the record, compute a stage, and give an accuracy score based on everything that’s in the record—imaging reports, molecular reports, and things of that nature,” says Elton. “We even arrange for analyses to accept data only if it is of a given accuracy.”
Concerto HealthAI’s technology can also be used to make predictions, such as whether a patient is going to be a responder or whether the response is durabile. These predictions can be valuable in the design of a clinical study. And they can offer clinical researchers a direct line of sight into the standard of care, which is important because often physicians will not place patients in a trial if it is too much of a burden compared to the standard of care. Concerto HealthAI’s models can predict patient burden for trial design purposes.
What all these capabilities allow researchers to do, Elton says, is run on-the-fly analyses, accomplishing in real time what would otherwise have required weeks of data preparation.

However, sometimes the technical and data-based complexities of AI challenge technology companies to deliver on their promises. Some companies are choosing to approach these AI challenges not by scaling back their AI ambitions, but rather by using humans to do the task that they are otherwise trying to get their AI systems to do. This concept of humans pretending to be machines that are supposed to do the work of humans is called “pseudo AI”, or more bluntly, just faking it.

Faking it Till You Make It with AI

Most notably, a number of companies have been claiming to use artificial intelligence in order to automate parts of their services such as transcription, appointment scheduling, and other personal assistant work, but in reality have been outsourcing this work to humans through labor marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. While artificial intelligence is actually used for the solution in part or at all, these companies have not been truthful with their claims of using computers to perform these services. 


CNBC published an article critical of Sophia, the AI robot from Hanson Robotics. When the company was approached by CNBC with a list of questions they wanted to ask, Hanson Robotics responded with a list of very specific questions for Sophia. In a followup video, CNBC questions whether the robot is meant to be research into artificial intelligence or is just a PR stunt. They also provided the responses. Even the owner of Hanson Robotics has gone on record as saying most media encounters are scripted.

However, Hanson Robotics is only one of the more notable pseudo-AI encounters to make the news. Popular calendar scheduling services X.AI and Clara Labs were found to both be using humans to schedule appointments and calendar items rather than purely artificial intelligence solutions. The above linked article quotes human workers who wished that the AI system did actually work as promised because the work was such boring drudgery. No doubt while these companies were the unfortunate ones to get unwanted media attention, there are no doubt many others who are pursuing the approach of using humans as a “stop gap” when the AI systems are deficient.
PROMOTED
What’s wrong with Pseudo-AI?
It isn’t unheard of though for companies in the tech industry to fake some or part of their services, especially when they are starting out. While this may work for some tech areas, does it work for AI? Some would say no.
The entire premise of AI is that it can accomplish feats that previously only humans were able to do. So faking AI capabilities actually undermines the very essence of what AI is promising to be able to do. AI is still a very emerging field and new artificial intelligence technology is being developed every day. Emerging companies are pitching technology solutions whose premise is that they can accomplish technically challenging tasks. But rather than delivering on these promises, these companies are simply performing technology-enabled outsourcing to humans, and often at very low wages.

Incidents like this have the potential to create a lot of problems in the tech industry. One of the biggest is the potential for an AI winter if people consistently see products that are being faked regularly. People will be less likely to want to invest in AI technology. AI winters, which are periods of decline of interest and funding in AI, have previously been triggered by substantial overpromising and underdelivering of AI capabilities. The increasing or widespread use of Pseudo-AI to cover up AI deficiencies could lead to disenchantment with AI as a whole, and contribute to widespread AI pullback.

Another big issue with Pseudo-AI approaches is the potential for breaches of privacy and confidentiality. A computer that processes information in isolation can safeguard data to various extents, but putting random humans in the loop is a recipe for potential data privacy breaches.

For example, AI solutions that process information in regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, or government systems can be compromised by humans that are not allowed to view confidential or private information. In one instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was legislated in the United States to help insure patient privacy. If a company lies about using computers to schedule appointments that contain private patient data, it isn’t clear whether or not they are able to uphold the standards set forth by HIPAA for patient information privacy and security. This could get companies employing Pseudo-AI approaches in a lot of hot water. 
Besides these issues, we need to also consider the basic ethical considerations of faking artificial intelligence. If you aren’t disclosing your company’s use of humans, there is a major ethical issue at hand. Is it okay to lie to your customers and the public in general?
Is Pseduo-AI The Exception in the AI Industry or an Increasing Reality?
While there are some companies implementing Pseudo-AI approaches, there are plenty of other companies who are in fact really using artificial intelligence across a range of implementation patterns. Many of them recognize and admit that there are still advancements needing to be made before their technology is perfected. Indeed, there are an increasing number of real-world use cases and case studies from actual implementation of machine learning across an increasing range of applications.
For those that are evaluating third-party solutions that claim AI capabilities, you should maintain an optimistic but skeptical perspective. One area of evaluation for AI solutions should be due diligence to see if the company has any humans in the loop that would otherwise be part of what the AI system should be doing. Ask the solution provider if there is ever a human that views the information, even if it is just to validate it. You can have them attest to the program being solely run by computers when signing contracts with them. 
One question that a lot of people come to when they find that there are faked AI services is: have we hit a wall in artificial intelligence development? At this point, we don’t completely know. Some companies, such as Facebook that have failed at some AI-based programs, but instead have leveraged humans masquerading as machines show that there are problems developing artificial intelligence even amongst the big names.
Only time will tell if we’ve hit a true roadblock in AI development and capabilities, or these stumbles are just speed bumps on the road to progress. What we do know though, is that companies need to take a serious look at how they market their products. Ethics is important not just from the viewpoint of providing a solution that matches customer and user expectations, but also about instilling trust in a technology that some are still very much wary of or dubious. Faking it until you make it is problematic from many perspectives, and we hope that even as a stop gap, this approach quickly falls from usage.

The machines are coming and they want your job, at a minimum. Scary stories are easy to find in all the erudite places where the tech visionaries of Silicon Valley and Seattle, the cosmopolitan elite of New York City, and the policy wonks of Washington, DC, converge—TED talks, Davos, ideas festivals, Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, The New York Times, Hollywood films, South by Southwest, Burning Man. The brilliant innovator Elon Musk and the genius theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking have been two of the most quotable and influential purveyors of these AI predictions. AI poses “an existential threat” to civilization, Elon Musk warned a gathering of governors in Rhode Island one summer’s day.WIRED OPINIONABOUTKevin Scott is the CTO and executive vice president of AI and research at Microsoft. He's the author of the book Reprogramming the American Dream: From Rural America to Silicon Valley—Making AI Serve Us All.Musk’s words are very much on my mind as the car I drive (it’s not autonomous, not yet) crests a hill in the rural southern Piedmont region of Virginia, where I was born and raised. From here I can almost see home, the fields once carpeted by lush green tobacco leaves and the roads long ago bustling with workers commuting from profitable textile mills and furniture plants. But that economy is no more. Poverty, unemployment, and frustration are high, as they are with our neighbors across the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachia and to the north in the Rust Belt. I am driving between Rustburg, the county seat, and Gladys, an unincorporated farming community where my mom and brother still live.I left this community, located down the road from where Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, because even as a kid I could see the bitter end of an economy that used to hum along, and I couldn’t wait to chase my own dreams of building computers and software. But these are still my people, and I love them. Today, as one of the many tech entrepreneurs on the West Coast, my feet are firmly planted in both urban California and rural Southern soil. I’ve come home to talk with my classmates; to reconcile those bafflingly confident, anxiety-producing warnings about the future of jobs and artificial intelligence that I frequently hear among thought leaders in Silicon Valley, New York City, and DC, to see for myself whether there might be a different story to tell.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIIf I can better understand how the friends and family I grew up with in Campbell County are faring today, a generation after one economic tidal wave swept through, and in the midst of another, perhaps I can better influence the development of advanced technologies that will soon visit their lives and livelihoods. In addition to serving as Microsoft’s CTO, I also am the executive vice president of AI and research. It’s important for those of us building these technologies to meet people where they are, on factory floors, the rooms and hallways of health care facilities, in the classrooms and the agricultural fields.I pull off Brookneal Highway, the two-lane main road, into a wide gravel parking lot that’s next to the old house my friends W. B. and Allan Bass lived in when we were in high school. A sign out front proclaims that I’ve arrived at Bass Sod Farm. The house is now headquarters for their sprawling agricultural operation. It’s just around the corner from my mom’s house, and in a sign of the times, near a nondescript cinder-block building that houses a CenturyLink hub for high-speed internet access. Prized deer antlers, a black bear skin, and a stuffed bobcat adorn its conference room, which used to be the family kitchen.W.B. and Allan were popular back in the day. They always had a nice truck with a gun rack, and were known for their hunting and fishing skills. The Bass family has worked the same plots of Campbell County tobacco land for five generations, dating back to the Civil War. Within my lifetime, Barksdale the grandfather, Walter the father, and now W.B. (Walter Barksdale) and brother Allan have worked the land alongside a small team of seasonal workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThousands of families in Campbell County used to grow and sell tobacco, but today only two families continue. Trouble for the tobacco industry began in 1964, when the surgeon general’s report officially recognized the health risks of tobacco. In the years since, between decreased demand, increased foreign competition, and no federal regulation of quotas, tobacco prices have plummeted. Eventually, the industry that was once a major employer in rural Virginia evaporated.AdvertisementThe Bass family grew brightleaf tobacco, commonly known as Virginia tobacco. With “bright” you cultivate the leaves only, about 18 to 22 leaves per stalk, for cigarettes. They also sold dark tobacco, which involves cultivating the whole stalk and using it for chewing tobacco and cigars. By 2005 the Bass family saw the writing on the wall for its once valuable operation, and began to transition their land from tobacco to sod, or turf—a grassy product they sell to construction companies for new and refurbished building landscapes, golf courses, and sports fields. By 2008 they were completely out of tobacco, and today their products are a new shade of green—Bermuda, zoysia, and fescue. They also grow some soybeans. “People gotta eat, but they won’t always need sod,” Allan said.As with any business, the cell phone and PC are ubiquitous at Bass Sod Farm. They also employed some automation technology to assist workers, including a Trebro harvester that rolls up the sod, stacks it on a pallet, and ensures minimum waste. Allan Bass took 40 hours of training to learn how to use it, and he has now put in about 3,000 hours of operation. According to Allan, “it’s an art and a science” to harvest the sod just right. The Bass brothers recently added GPS technology to their sprayers, significantly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. That transition is still a work in progress. “We don’t have it down pat yet,” Allan admits.What bugs them, though, is that technology is not as transparent as it used to be. The problem with self-driving tractors and GPS-guided sprayers is that you can’t see what’s broken, or at least your average farmer can’t. Their biggest worry is not some threat from AI, but making sure that the technology they do have is self-healing: “If something fails, you spend lots of time debugging it.” And the time Allan spends debugging his farm equipment is a big productivity hit for their small business.They regard tools enhanced with what I would describe as advanced machine learning, or early AI, as something that will be helpful in gathering intelligence on their crops. Drones, for instance, can take scores of pictures of “hot spots” on their crops to find irrigation problems, insects, and disease. They can be trained to find out about most potential calamities and provide an early warning system, likely saving many of the human jobs that would have been lost if the problem went undetected and the crops were ruined. Although the Basses feel their human solution has worked —“What we’ve got is working. Humans know what to look for”—it is time-consuming and costly for their small workforce to comb through acres of farmlands, looking for minute details. They’d much rather deploy human capital to expansion, quicker delivery, and product innovation—anything but walking mile after mile.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe Bass boys are optimistic. Business is good, and W.B.’s son chose to remain in Campbell County even though he’s become a computer engineer in nearby Lynchburg. The green shoots of the next Industrial Revolution can be seen at Bass Sod Farm.But not every business in the area is facing sudden transformation. Nearby, in Brookneal, Virginia, Sheri Denton Guthrie manages the finances at Heritage Hall Nursing Home. Heritage cared for three of my grandparents in their final years. I want to better understand how AI will one day affect a place I know all too well, the sort of place that millions of baby boomers will also soon know.Heritage has 17 homes scattered across rural Virginia. It has 60 residents and as many as 80 staff depending on occupancy. Sheri manages the homes’ books and has an astonishing amount of training on a range of health care systems, PointClickCare and Toughbook to name a few. Even with all the available technologies, she says it’s still too hard. Heritage gets paid based on individual residents’ “RUG scores,” short for a Resource Utilization Group calculation for Medicare and Medicaid. Staff go around with Toughbooks and log things like minutes of physical, speech, and occupational therapy; a doctor’s visit; a mental health consult; an IV; help from the nurse assistants. These services all add up to an overall RUG score for which the nursing home is reimbursed.Like the Bass brothers, Sheri is less worried about AI stealing jobs and more concerned about mundane things, like needing her financial system reports to line up on a printer. A few years ago, hackers stole personal records from their health care insurance provider, Anthem, so she also worries about privacy and security. AI-infused robots could almost certainly be trained to do many tasks in the nursing home, from inputting medical data to generate insights to providing medications and even treating wounds. Health care is transforming rapidly, but not uniformly. Sheri has one caveat for the near-term use of advanced technologies: “For our generation, yes, but not this generation. They’d beat the robot with a cane.”After a quick stop at the Golden Skillet for fried chicken, lima beans, and iced tea, I pay a visit to Hugh E. Williams, who manages a small team of workers at American Plastic Fabricators. Hugh E, as all our classmates know him, is a tall, strongly built man with a red beard that is only beginning to hint at his age, with a streak of gray down the middle. Hugh E and I grew up together. He’s proud to show me his plant, now located in an abandoned Bassett-Walker textile factory. Started in 1936 as Bassett Knitting Corporation an hour and a half west of Brookneal in Bassett, Virginia, the old mill was part of a storied Southern industry that turned cotton into clothes. Cotton textiles once dominated the South’s economy, but cheaper labor abroad and earlier forms of automation decimated the workforce. This mill in Brookneal closed with little hope of ever reopening.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDBut years later, a local entrepreneur began a modest company to shape small, precision plastic parts that were needed by a wide range of customers, from theme parks to defense contractors. The business, essentially a job shop, was hit hard by the financial crisis of 2008, but began to grow again in the aftermath by offering competitive pricing on polyethylene and high-density plastics fabrication. Eventually, with more than 20 employees and in need of a larger space, they took over the defunct textile mill. The day I visited, one of the workers was using a sophisticated milling machine controlled by a computer to create an intricate piece for Disneyland’s Jumpin’ Jellyfish ride. Disney sent Hugh E the specifications, workers programmed the machine, and voilà, one by one these young workers carve plastic into industrial works of art. A machinist's diploma from Southside Virginia Community College and a little on-the-job training can land a person a well-paying job in a small town that was once counted out.As I’ve witnessed firsthand, and as many working Americans have experienced personally, manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades now, moving overseas where things can be built cheaper. In Brookneal and across the country, in rural and urban settings alike, new manufacturing jobs are being created because AI, robotics, and advanced automation are becoming more capable and cheaper by the day, making it feasible to build things in the US and other markets where labor costs are high. As automation becomes less expensive and more powerful, small companies are able to lower their unit costs of production and become more competitive. This allows them to grow their businesses and create even more, higher-paying jobs.Combining the best of human skill with the best of automation can result in incredible prosperity. Look no further than Germany’s so-called Mittelstand. These are small- and medium-size enterprises generating less than 50 million euro in revenue annually. Collectively, it accounts for 99.6 percent of German companies, 60 percent of jobs, and over half of Germany’s gross domestic product. These companies are ingenious at finding narrow but valuable markets to serve, then using highly skilled labor and advanced automation to efficiently produce high-quality products. My friend Hugh E’s employer would be in the Mittelstand, along with 3.3 million others. The US should study and improve upon Germany’s model.Microsoft data indicate that manufacturing is among the fastest-growing segments for AI talent and skills. According to LinkedIn, demand for AI skills increased 190 percent between 2015 and 2017. The idea of creating new, skilled, well-paying manufacturing jobs in rural Brookneal would have been implausible a couple of decades ago. Now it is reality—that’s good news. And the better news is that the underlying automation trend will continue to provide ever more powerful, ever cheaper technology that will create even more opportunities for entrepreneurs and workers alike, in both rural and urban America.In the future, it’s likely that some of this automation will be able to do work that humans are doing today. That’s a good thing when it replaces repetitive labor, enabling humans to focus on higher-value work and ideas. That’s what automation has been doing for centuries. From the vantage point of the developed world in the early 21st century, it means more business and more jobs can be repatriated from overseas, that we can build new businesses with new jobs that would be economically infeasible or technically impossible today, and that we all will get higher-quality, cheaper, more innovative goods and services. In his book Hit Refresh, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reports on one such example: Kent International, maker of Bicycle Corporation of America–branded bikes.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDKent made news when it moved 140 jobs from China back to Manning, South Carolina, where the company had invested in robotics to automate many of the tasks once performed by people. What was once a low-tech, high-labor business is going through its own digital transformation and plans. CEO Arnold Kamler told us he plans to add 40 jobs per year, which is considerable growth in a small town. In fact, a number of states competed to land the plant. “A lot of people have that misconception that automation decreases jobs,” a production manager on the line said. “It’s just a different type of job, a more skilled job.” Without the robots, the human jobs wouldn’t exist.It’s likely that AI can help us equalize some of the inequities that have come as a result of late 20th century global free trade. It’s far less likely that we will achieve AI and robotics that are capable of completely replacing human workers in arbitrary manufacturing and service jobs anytime soon. And that’s especially true if we choose to place our thumb on the scale and deliberately pursue the former path versus the latter.In the face of increasingly wild hypothetical scenarios about AI’s potential dominance over humans, the reality of what AI is capable of now, and will be capable of in the near future, is more humbling. Even though AI is progressing incredibly quickly, we still have a way to go before it is able to dramatically transform the world ... for good or ill.My visits with the Bass brothers, Sheri, and Hugh E remind me that sharp intellect and attention to detail and optimism, rooted in today’s tech reality, remain strong among blue-collar, mid-skill rural—and I suspect Rust Belt—leaders and entrepreneurs. AI, robotics, drones, and data will continue to augment, not replace, workers in communities like Gladys and Brookneal for generations to come. Every week of every year I sit in product demonstrations and strategy sessions on AI development. Whether it’s in my role at Microsoft or as an investor in Silicon Valley, I am increasingly assured that AI will ultimately be about human empowerment, not displacement.As the autumn darkness descends on Campbell County, I turn the car around and head back to Mom’s house, just as I did so many times as a kid. I’ve been inspired by my old friends. That night, as sleep comes slowly, I imagine what I could do here to create jobs and help rebuild the local economy.From the book REPROGRAMMING THE AMERICAN DREAM: From Rural America to Silicon Valley—Making AI Serve Us All by Kevin Scott.

From here I can almost see home, the fields once carpeted by lush green tobacco leaves and the roads long ago bustling with workers commuting from profitable textile mills and furniture plants. But that economy is no more. Poverty, unemployment, and frustration are high, as they are with our neighbors across the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachia and to the north in the Rust Belt. I am driving between Rustburg, the county seat, and Gladys, an unincorporated farming community where my mom and brother still live.
I left this community, located down the road from where Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, because even as a kid I could see the bitter end of an economy that used to hum along, and I couldn’t wait to chase my own dreams of building computers and software. But these are still my people, and I love them. Today, as one of the many tech entrepreneurs on the West Coast, my feet are firmly planted in both urban California and rural Southern soil. I’ve come home to talk with my classmates; to reconcile those bafflingly confident, anxiety-producing warnings about the future of jobs and artificial intelligence that I frequently hear among thought leaders in Silicon Valley, New York City, and DC, to see for myself whether there might be a different story to tell.
If I can better understand how the friends and family I grew up with in Campbell County are faring today, a generation after one economic tidal wave swept through, and in the midst of another, perhaps I can better influence the development of advanced technologies that will soon visit their lives and livelihoods. In addition to serving as Microsoft’s CTO, I also am the executive vice president of AI and research. It’s important for those of us building these technologies to meet people where they are, on factory floors, the rooms and hallways of health care facilities, in the classrooms and the agricultural fields.

They also grow some soybeans. “People gotta eat, but they won’t always need sod,” Allan said.
As with any business, the cell phone and PC are ubiquitous at Bass Sod Farm.

Today’s report represents the first of those conclusions — 43 of them in fact, tied to legislative language that can easily be inserted by Congress during the fiscal year 2021 budget process.RELATED5 concerns the US must tackle to compete in AIThe National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hopes to roll its recommendations into congressional budgets as time goes on.By Aaron MehtaBob Work, the former deputy secretary of defense who is the vice-chairman of the commission, said the report is tied into a broader effort to move DoD away from a focus on large platforms.“What you’re seeing is a transformation to a digital enterprise, where everyone is intent on making the DoD more like a software company. Because in the future, algorithmic warfare, relying on AI and AI enabled autonomy, is the thing that will provide us with the greatest military competitive advantage,” he said during a Wednesday call with reporters.Among the key recommendations:The government should “immediately double non-defense AI R&D funding” to $2 billion for FY21, a quick cash infusion which should work to strengthen academic center and national labs working on AI issues. The funding should “increase agency topline levels, not repurpose funds from within existing agency budgets, and be used by agencies to fund new research and initiatives, not to support re-labeled existing efforts.” Work noted that he recommends this R&D to double again in FY22.The commission leaves open the possibility of recommendations for increasing DoD’s AI investments as well, but said it wants to study the issue more before making such a request. In FY21, the department requested roughly $800 million in AI developmental funding and another $1.7 billion in AI enabled autonomy, which Work said is the right ratio going forward. “We’re really focused on non-defense R&D in this first quarter, because that’s where we felt we were falling further behind,” he said. “We expect DoD AI R&D spending also to increase” going forward.The Director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) should report directly to the Secretary of Defense, and should continue to be led by a three-star officer or someone with “significant operational experience.” The first head of the JAIC, Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, is retiring this summer; currently the JAIC falls under the office of the Chief Information Officer, who in turn reporters to the secretary. Work said the commission views the move as necessary in order to make sure leadership in the department is “driving"" investment in AI, given all the competing budgetary requirements.The DoD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) should establish a steering committee on emerging technology, tri-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Principal Deputy Director of ODNI, in order to “drive action on emerging technologies that otherwise may not be prioritized” across the national security sphere.Government microelectronics programs related to AI should be expanded in order to “develop novel and resilient sources for producing, integrating, assembling, and testing AI-enabling microelectronics.” In addition, the commission calls for articulating a “national for microelectronics and associated infrastructure.”Funding for DARPA’s microelectronics program should be increased to $500 million. The commission also recommends the establishment of a $20 million pilot microelectronics program to be run by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), focused on AI hardware.The establishment of a new office, tentatively called the National Security Point of Contact for AI, and encourage allied government to do the same in order to strengthen coordination at an international level. The first goal for that office would be to develop an assessment of allied AI research and applications, starting with the Five Eyes nations and then expanding to NATO.RELATEDNew Pentagon budget request invests in 4 advanced technologiesThe Pentagon wants to focus its fiscal year 2021 research investments in four broad areas of emerging technologies: hypersonics, artificial intelligence, 5G/microelectroncs, and autonomous platformsBy Nathan StroutOne issue identified early by the commission is the question of ethical AI. The commission recommends mandatory training on the limits of artificial intelligence in the AI workforce, which should include discussions around ethical issues. The group also calls for the Secretary of Homeland Security and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to “share their ethical and responsible AI training programs with state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officials,” and track which jurisdictions take advantage of those programs over a five year period.Missing from the report: any mention of the Pentagon’s Directive 3000.09, a 2012 order laying out the rules about how AI can be used on the battlefield. Last year C4ISRNet revealed that there was an ongoing debate among AI leaders, including Work, on whether that directive was still relevant.While not reflected in the recommendations, Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive who chairs the commission, noted that his team is starting to look at how AI can help with the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, saying ""“We’re in an extraordinary time… we’re all looking forward to working hard to help anyway that we can.”The full report can be read here.Mike Gruss contributed to this report.About  Aaron MehtaAaron Mehta was deputy editor and senior Pentagon correspondent for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and acquisition at the highest levels of the Defense Department and its international partners.Share:More In Artificial IntelligenceSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",NewsArticle,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/,"{'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/resizer/av5AMkLDVgx9vUm3-6u-icEKJHk=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/RRPSPGCAR5AODC7B54JJDUHMCI.jpg', '@type': 'ImageObject'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aaron Mehta'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'C4ISRNet', 'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png?d=124'}}",Panel wants to double federal spending on AI,2020-04-02T14:11:16.362Z,2022-08-18T23:38:13.425Z,Artificial Intelligence,C4ISRNet,,,,,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/'}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,,,,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI a smart career for migrant workers

HANGZHOU-Gong Fei used to work at a construction site in Shandong province, but he has recently found a new job as an artificial intelligence trainer.
Gong, 26, works as an AI trainer for a company in his home city of Tongren, Guizhou province.
AI trainers help computers and machines ""understand"" the human world by categorizing and labeling text, pictures and videos, which are then analyzed by the devices.
Every day, Gong arranges hundreds of pictures on a computer screen into two categories. For images of a soccer match, he needs to annotate them with ""score"" and ""non-score"".
""I need to teach the computer how to recognize the pictures according to the annotations,"" he said. ""These days, more people have higher demands. They want to see more of their favorite stars or some particular scenes, and this is what I do; I make the systems smarter in regard to catering to people's needs.""
Gong said the job is not easy and requires extreme patience.
""Sometimes a picture needs to have up to 100 annotations, and it can take six or seven hours just to do one picture,"" he said.
""But I am glad they offered me this job during this difficult time.""
Gong said he can work from home and reduce his costs, which are much lower than the expenses he incurred while working outside his home province.
During the coronavirus outbreak, many migrant workers who usually leave the countryside for better-paying jobs in big cities have found new professions.
A total of 250,000 programs were added on Alipay, the mobile payment app of e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, during the epidemic. These programs offered 750,000 jobs. In provinces with large numbers of migrant workers, such as Shaanxi and Guizhou, thousands of workers have chosen to stay in their hometowns to become AI trainers.
The jobs are permanent and pay well. Alibaba said it had turned out 100,000 AI trainers, with their average payment expected to rise by at least 50 percent.
""I heard that my job has been officially recognized as a new profession by the government,"" Gong said.
Early last month, the government listed 16 jobs as new professions, including AI trainers.
Yang Weiguo, a professor of labor and human resources at Renmin University, said stabilizing and increasing employment is important. ""The digital era has created new professions,"" he said.
Lyu Peng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: ""The internet has truly played an important part during the epidemic. It digitalized China's service industry and became a new engine to power employment.""

Most organizations have begun to invest in AI to guide their sales representatives as it helps organizations stay adaptable to changing customer needs and evolving markets. AI guided selling usually takes the form of machine learning generated advice offered to reps on their CRM or other software. It’s primarily designed to help salespeople stay organized, prioritize leads, choose the customer most likely to buy for their next sales call, and so on. When its impact is fully realized, it gives salespeople more time to sell and information that they leverage to sell more effectively. I’ve seen solutions like this work, even quite well. With such great promise, companies are investing in and designing their own custom solutions. Many start-ups are developing solutions and makers of CRM software have widgets designed to address AI-guided selling. In my experience most companies are struggling to implement this approach.


Although most of these initiatives fail, an investment in AI is more critical now than ever. But why do they fail? After many conversations with business leaders about these failures, I’ve noticed a pattern: Many leaders point to absence of sufficiently robust data to fuel machine learning models. Without enough data, AI can’t make accurate predictions and if the system fails to make salespeople more insightful or effective, adoption plummets. Sales organizations find themselves in this situation for many reasons, from the inability to stitch together a comprehensive view of customers to transaction data that resides in siloed repositories, to poor CRM data or the inability to stitch the data together to enable sophisticated analysis. But it’s almost always more than data that limits the success of such efforts and solving these challenges are essential to driving the success of such initiatives. These include alignment across leadership, leveraging first line managers, picking the right models and fitting in with current processes.

1. Align leadership and evolve the metrics. Alignment among leadership on the vision for how AI will enable sales is critical to long-term success. This is a journey that requires alignment around different priorities at each stage. At first, AI guided selling may be about getting salespeople to try and then adopt the solution, while over time it may evolve to recommendation acceptance rates and participation in the feedback loop, and so on. While revenue matters, in the end, success is about embedding the right habits in place. Revenue and customer success will follow adoption.

2. Involve first line sales managers. The importance of first line sales managers can’t be overstated. They play several important roles in any sales organization including but not limited to managing sales representatives, customers and the business. In AI guided selling, if managers aren’t engaged early and often, from bringing the solution to life to ensuring that reps participate, adoption will lag. So thinking through how to get managers aligned with the objectives of such an initiative and familiar with the details of such an implementation is critical. And since managers play an active role in guiding how salespeople strategize and execute in their territories, driving this kind of behavior change across the sales organization requires the integration of AI in all rep-to-manager interactions.

3. The model must fit the need and be effective. First, models must fit their environments. For example, when enabling an inside salesperson who has responsibility for a hundred or more accounts, you’ll need a model that provides the right information about the right customer at the right time. Arguably, it’s difficult for a sales person to know and stay in touch with all customers across multiple products so this functionally is useful. In contrast, when enabling a salesperson with few, large strategic accounts, you’ll need a model that can coordinate sales efforts across myriad activities and individuals. Secondly, models must appropriately balance accuracy and explainability. With the current state of AI, greater accuracy comes at the cost of sacrificing clarity about why it’s made certain decisions. (The more complex the calculation, the harder it is to explain to a user with any efficiency.) If a salesperson receives a recommendation with limited explanation as to why it’s being made, she’ll be less likely to trust it, which will harm adoption.

4. Don’t let data insufficiency stop you. Yes, better data leads to more robust predictions but finding adequate data is a journey for most organizations and while it’s a worthwhile investment, it’s likely to take time. Data insufficiency, however, doesn’t have to mean you do not begin. There are many paths to addressing this challenge, including beginning with educated guesswork while a more comprehensive data journey is considered. For example, organizations can direct salespeople to call on customers who have not been called on in the recent past. Such simple heuristics will generate customer insights that will be useful for guided selling and lead to increased sophistication over time.

5. Augment the customer engagement process. AI guided selling solutions must enrich and augment the current customer engagement process. If an AI guided selling initiative requires salespeople to change the customer engagement process to accommodate, adoption will be difficult. AI guided selling solutions must fit within the natural workflow of the sales representative.

AI and work
AI has conjured up a dystopia of robots displacing human workers from employment. Some have predicted very large-scale job substitution but others question whether such a predetermined outcome can be envisaged: whether jobs are lost and how they are changed depends on whether workers are involved in the decisions that are made. Similar concerns apply to issues of recruitment and monitoring of workers: will AI data serve a ‘surveillance capitalism’ or could it assist workers in the performance of their jobs if they have more power to influence the outcome?

AI and society
AI raises wider questions about the society in which we live and that of the future. Market-research institutes foresee huge efficiency gains, but are these credible and, if so, how will such gains be distributed? Feminists and anti-racists have expressed concern that the algorithms on which AI depends unconsciously embed the social prejudices of their human authors. Issues of privacy and civil liberty surround the possession and control of the data mined by AI. How education must change so that citizens can feel empowered rather than alienated by AI is also at stake—as is the ever-present issue of where AI fits in meeting the existential challenge of climate change and biodiversity loss.

Digital transformation: Artificial intelligence in the public sector

 April 16, 2020   



© Andranik Hakobyan | 





Here, we look at the digital transformation of government, focussing on the role of artificial intelligence in the public sector





Former Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, once remarked that: “I believe the creation of the Government Digital Service is one of the great unsung triumphs of the last Parliament.” Today, the role of the Government Digital Service (GDS) as part of the Cabinet Office concerns the digital transformation of government. On the GDS’s blog, they sum up what they are all about in their own words. “We’re a centre of excellence in digital, technology and data, collaborating with departments to help them with their own transformation. We work with them to build platforms, standards, and digital services.” (1)
Artificial intelligence in the public sector
Recently, the GDS has published joint guidance with the Office for Artificial Intelligence about how to use and build artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. (2)

In A guide to using artificial intelligence in the public sector, we learn that AI could change the way we live and work, for example, several public sector organisations use AI for tasks ranging from fraud detection to answering customer queries successfully today. While it is estimated that AI could contribute 5% of the UK’s GDP by 2030, ethical, fairness and safety considerations must be taken into account

The paper also gives a very useful definition of AI, that includes the following: “At its core, AI is a research field spanning philosophy, logic, statistics, computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive psychology and economics

“AI can be defined as the use of digital technology to create systems capable of performing tasks commonly thought to require intelligence

“Machine learning is the most widely-used form of AI, and has contributed to innovations like self-driving cars, speech recognition and machine translation.”

One of the many case studies highlighted in the paper concerns the Department for International Development who partnered with Columbia University, the University of Southampton, and the United Nations Population Fund “to apply a random forest machine learning algorithm to satellite image and micro-census data.” Another is about how the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) uses AI to improve MOT testing.

The paper also draws our attention to the fact that AI can benefit the public sector, such as giving more accurate information, predictions and forecasts that result in better outcomes, more accurate medical diagnoses or automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks to free up the valuable time of frontline staff.

However, with an AI project, you need to consider several factors, including AI ethics and safety the paper urges, such as data quality, fairness, accountability, privacy, explainability and transparency, plus costs. The paper also notes that you need to ensure that your AI system is compliant with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), including the points that concern automated decision making.

“Automated decisions in this context are decisions made without human intervention, which have legal or similarly significant effects on ‘data subjects’. For example, an online decision to award a business grant.

“If you want to use automated processes to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects on individuals you must follow the safeguards laid out in the GDPR and DPA 2018.” (3)








Industrial Strategy
This article draws on a few highlights from the paper and it is well worth taking time to read the extensive information contained within.
The paper refers to the Industrial Strategy White Paper, which places AI and Data as one of four Grand Challenges, with support of up to £950 million in the AI Sector Deal.
In 2019, the then Digital Secretary, Jeremy Wright, provided his own thoughts on AI whilst underlining the innovation taking place in the UK’s ‘tech for good’ sector.
“Britain is already a leading authority in AI. We are home to some of the world’s finest academic institutions, landing record levels of investment to the sector and attracting the best global tech talent, but we must not be complacent.
“Through our AI Council we will continue this momentum by leveraging the knowledge of experts from a range of sectors to provide leadership on the best use and adoption of artificial intelligence across the economy.” (4)
GDS: Working hard to make their services work better
In closing, it was recently highlighted on the website of GDS that they are working hard to make “services work


better for their users”. During recent years, we learn that hundreds of services went through user-centred digital transformation and as such, now meet GDS’s Service Standard. The GDS supply more detail about this in their own words as this article about the digital transformation of government is near the end.
“Thousands of user-centred design specialists are working alongside digital, policy, and operations professionals to make services less complex, easier to understand, and simpler to use.” (5)
This fits in really well with the new legal regulations that oblige public sector bodies to make websites and apps accessible. (6)

In this article, we discuss three of Barclays’ AI initiatives in particular, as well as the AI vendors the bank claims to have worked with: Risk Modeling with Simudyne: Predictive analytics for analyzing the risk of lending to a loan applicant. Voice Recognition for Authentication with Nuance: Natural language processing-enabled identity verification and authentication via voice recognition. Business Process Automation with IBM: Automated debit and credit card deactivation and customer feedback analysis. We begin our analysis of Barclays’ AI initiatives with their “agent-based” modeling software, which they built with help from Simudyne. Agent-Based Modeling – Simudyne In July of 2019, Barclays announced a partnership with the AI startup Simudyne, which specializes in what the company calls “agent-based modelling.” This can be understood as the simulation of various banking situations using transactional data to build simulated customers within a bank’s ecosystem. This purportedly allows Barclays to simulate the banking and loan markets to produce detailed predictions.  Barclays claims that adopting Simudyne’s software helped them provide more robust offerings for their customers, such as new financial services.  This is likely because the software allows the client to develop a thorough understanding of the possibilities and risks associated with lending to a given customer or making a given investment. In addition to gauging the risk associated with individual customers, Barclays employees can purportedly use Simudyne’s solution to: Analyze mortgages: Simulate a relationship between customers and lenders by modeling housing and lending markets in conjunction with customer behaviors. Stress Test: Users can scale up their simulation to represent a greater portion of the market, or scale it down to show granular details about specific situations. The user can test how accurate their simulation is by continually scaling it up until the system cannot populate any more results. Contagion Risk: Create risk simulations in order to identify new investment risks and better understand how risky investment can lead to more precarious situations such as low liquidity. Simudyne’s agent-based modelling software most likely runs on predictive analytics, an AI approach for making predictions based on historical data. For example, the bank can choose to see what might happen if they chose to lend to three customers with varying credit scores. When running this simulation, they can choose how much mock-data should be attached to each simulated customer.  This mock data can include information from past investments and loan applications. The software could then purportedly determine how likely each customer is to pay back their loan in full.  The bank can also purportedly create a simulation of their investment applicants’ relationship to each other as well as other banks. Customers are organized according to the interactions and relationships they have with banks, credit unions, and other entities such as the IRS. The ML algorithm uses these factors to score customers on how likely they are to see profit from the investment or to pay their loan back.  Barclays also claims to run Simudyne’s solution through the cloud, which allows them to create simulations that encompass an even wider subset of data. This is because Barclays can now access all of their enterprise data from any of their data science labs. This means they can likely simulate large shifts in banking trends and begin preparing for the changes most likely to happen ahead of time.  For example, Barclays could see an influx of underserved loan applications over a short period of time. The bank’s risk managers could then run an agent-based simulation when trying to decide which of the applicants to lend to. This might show that nearly half of the applicants are indebted to other entities, and so are less likely to fully repay their loan with Barclays.  Voice Recognition for Authentication – Nuance Barclays also adopted a voice recognition solution from Nuance Communications to authenticate and verify its customers identities. Nuance refers to this capability as “voice biometrics,” and it runs on natural language processing (NLP) technology.  The bank claims its customer service agents are able to automatically detect if they are actually talking to who the customer claims to be or someone else and refuse access to those who do not pass authentication. Nuance claims that their clients’ users can see the following benefits when using voice biometrics: Improved customer experience: Customers may have less need to remember a password or PIN if they can be recognized with their voice. Enhanced security: Fraud rates may decrease in frequency when authentication is unique to every individual as opposed to based on security questions that are easily compromised.  Nuance claims the software detects the customer’s voice and authenticates it during the beginning of a customer service call without interrupting the call. If the software detects that the caller is not who they say they are, the customer service agent can choose to deny them access to personal information.  At this point, the agent may also be able to ask the customer to verify their identity through a password or PIN in order to continue receiving service. The following video from Nuance explains how their biometric authentication capability works:  Nuance lists a case study on their website detailing Barclays’ success with its software. Barclays conducted client research and purportedly found that their customers were looking for a better user experience within the telephone channel security process. Additionally, the bank’s client service center relationship managers spoke up about how it is uncomfortable to ask their clients a comprehensive set of security quests after establishing a good rapport with them.  After implementing the voice biometrics solution from Nuance, Barclays saw a 90% reduction in complaints about the security service. They also saw a 15% reduction in average call times, allowing them to field more client queries in less time. Business Process Automation – IBM Barclays also adopted two solutions from IBM: Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live, a cloud-based storage system for documenting customer journeys as data. Using Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live in conjunction, Barclays employees can purportedly: Access customer journeys globally and determine how well a customer’s needs were satisfied. Allow customers to receive SMS messages about attempted fraud with their account, which puts them in control of how they want to manage their funds should they be compromised. Process customer service reports such as lost or stolen credit cards and possible identity theft. The video below explains how Blueworks Live works:  IBM provides a case study which explains Barclays’ success with both the IBM Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live. The case study states that the solution helped Barclays gain a better understanding of how it documented customer journeys within the enterprise, how well they control them, and how customers feel about them.  The bank was purportedly able to take in reports of missing or compromised cards and replace them 67% faster. Additionally, they could also iterate on customer processes and roll out new ones 88% faster.  Emerj for Financial Services Leaders Leaders at large financial institutions use Emerj AI Opportunity Landscapes to discover how their competitors are leveraging AI to drive value in key areas like customer service and fraud.

Until last year, if you had checked into the Henn na Hotel in Japan you’d have had a staff of 243 robots at your disposal. From the nodding velociraptor and humanoid “manning” the front desk, to the recycling bin droid that roamed the corridors and the chatty in-room artificial intelligence (AI) concierge, the world’s first robot hotel even had mechanised fish swimming around a tank in the lobby.
The world’s first robot-staffed hotel
The Henn na, which loosely translates as “strange”, opened in Nagasaki in 2015 with a whirlwind of publicity. It was seen as a template for the future. A robot-staffed hotel could offer a fun and original experience for guests, while providing huge savings on staff costs for hotel owners.
“From an operational costs point of view, it was quite a brilliant thing,” says Dr Nick Naumov, senior lecturer in tourism and hospitality management at the University of Northampton and visiting professor at Meikai University in Tokyo Bay, who specialises in how AI and robots affect service quality in hotels.
“They started off employing 30 human staff for 140 rooms, which could be 300 guests. And when things went well initially, they brought that down to seven staff, which is a really good ratio.”
The in-room voice assistant would confuse snoring with a command and issue a response that would wake guests up
That this robot hotel originated in Japan, a nation which exports more industrial robots than any other and has long been ahead of the curve in robotics technology and innovation, chimed with the narrative perfectly.
Shortly after its opening, Henn na’s owner Hideo Sawada cited the country’s love of anime and manga robots as inspiration for the hotel. He went on to predict: “In five to ten years, this kind of robot hotel will spread all over the world.”
The company did open another hotel, at Urayasu in Tokyo Bay, and at one point had another eight robot hotels in the pipeline. But these plans never materialised and in January 2019 Henn na cut more than half its robot workforce.
Strange Hotel rings robot staff redundancies
At first guests had loved the novelty of the robot hotel experience and the colour it brought to their social feeds, but before long things started to go wrong. The robotic dinosaur and humanoid on the front desk could only speak one language each, English and Japanese respectively.
Later Mandarin and Korean were added, but that still left many guests wrestling to be understood, including a Scottish man, who documented his experience on YouTube. The robots also struggled with the different passport and identity-card formats and photocopying the documentation, so human staff constantly had to step in.
Guests grew frustrated with the in-room voice assistant called Churi. It could cope with basic commands, such as turning the lights on and off, but appeared primitive when asked more sophisticated queries, such as flight schedules or theme park opening times by guests accustomed to voice AI at a level offered by Google Home, Alexa and Siri. Churi would also confuse snoring as a voice command and issue a perky response that would wake guests up.
The hotel had to raise its staff count to deal with the escalating complaints, plus the robots themselves required an increasing amount of expensive maintenance. As Naumov says: “Just like any other tech, they needed regular servicing and constant software updates, and those things aren’t cheap.”
According to one hotel guest, following a visit in 2016: “About half the puppy-size lobby dancers appeared to be broken or in need of charging.” And after the hotel cut its robot workforce, a long-time staff member was quoted as saying: “It’s easier now that we’re not being frequently called by guests to help with problems with the robots.”
Imagining a future for robot staff and AI in the hotel industry
It’s not a question of whether customer service AI is valuable in a hotel setting, as it clearly is. But according to Dr Björn Schuller, professor of AI at Imperial College London, whose expertise includes affective computing, or the science of AI and emotion, what happened at Henn na Hotel reminds us to think about which applications AI is suitable for and which it isn’t: tech realism over tech optimism.
“Where a bot is most useful is not in place of a social context, but when you want precise information in as short a time as possible or to save you waiting for something,” he says.
Some of the most successful robots in hotels do just that, for example Hilton’s Connie, which employs IBM’s Watson AI software to provide personalised information about visitor attractions, restaurant recommendations and direct guests around the hotel. While other big-name hotel chains, such as the Marriott and Yotel, use robot butlers for speedy, but rudimentary, room service requests, such as fetching a towel, coffee or sandwich.
By using robots for room service and other entry-level tasks, such as cleaning and luggage transportation, which were both done by robots at Henn na, Naumov points out you improve efficiency, but also free up the human staff to welcome guests, handle complaints and deal with other crucial customer service needs.
“The human touch will never disappear,” he says, adding that human-centred service may become “the new currency of luxury hospitality in the future”. This could mean low-cost hotels running largely on service automation, robotics and AI with a skeleton staff, while expensive hotels retain a large, visible human workforce.
What’s the right kind of robot for a robot hotel?
There is also the question of trust. We might believe a human concierge is giving us the inside scoop on the best local restaurants or places to withdraw cash with a good rate, even if they’re not, but a robot would always put the hotel’s agenda first.
As Schuller says: “In the future a robot will always give you better information than a human, as they won’t forget things and they’ll be fully updated with the latest news, but then it becomes a matter of trust. A human can pretend they’re doing you a favour, even risking their job to do so, but we know a robot will always be on the company’s side.”
Unlike robot hotel Henn na’s front-desk humanoid, the Hilton and Marriott droids all look like typical robots, as imagined in 1980s films and TV, as opposed to human-like iterations, which some people find disquieting. In a low-cost hotel, we might not mind an unmanned check-in desk with facial recognition sensors, or to use our mobile phone as a room key, if it saves us time and money.
But to have a humanoid overseeing that function adds a layer of alienation to the experience that we might not have noticed otherwise.
However, the right kind of robot can become a star attraction. This happened in Belgium at Ghent, when Mario from the Marriott became a minor celebrity, visiting local schools, football clubs and even giving speeches at welcome and farewell events.
And with conversational AI set to get smarter and even more “charismatic”, according to Schuller, over the next few years hotels may be able to capitalise on this through creation of celebrity AI to attract guests and which could be combined with robotics technology.
As Schuller adds: “Once we have natives of socially and emotionally intelligent AI, this digitally advanced generation of consumers could have a whole different level of perception. Maybe they’d seek out AI with different personality attributes, famous AI for example, to give them kudos.” Just as long as the AI can spot the difference between snoring and talking.

Artificial intelligence is among the many hot technologies that promise to change the face of warfare for years to come. Articles abound that describe its possibilities and warn those who fall behind in the AI race. The Department of Defense has duly created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center in the hopes of winning the AI battle. Visions exist of AI enabling autonomous systems to conduct missions, achieving sensor fusion, automating tasks, and making better, quicker decisions than humans. AI is improving rapidly and some day in the future those goals may be achieved. In the meantime, AI’s impact will be in the more mundane, dull, and monotonous tasks performed by our military in uncontested environments.
Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing capability. Extensive research by academia and industry is resulting in shorter training time for systems and increasingly better results. AI is effective at certain tasks, such as image recognition, recommendation systems, and language translation. Many systems designed for these tasks are fielded today and producing very good results. In other areas, AI is very short of human-level achievement. Some of these areas include working with scenarios not seen previously by the AI; understanding the context of text (understanding sarcasm, for example) and objects; and multi-tasking (i.e., being able to solve problems of multiple type). Most AI systems today are trained to do one task, and to do so only under very specific circumstances. Unlike humans, they do not adapt well to new environments and new tasks.
Artificial-intelligence models are improving daily and have shown their value in many applications. The performance of these systems can make them very useful for tasks such as identifying a T-90 main battle tank in a satellite image, identifying high-value targets in a crowd using facial recognition, translating text for open-source intelligence, and text generation for use in information operations. The application areas where AI has been most successful are those where there are large quantities of labelled data, like Imagenet, Google Translate, and text generation. AI is also very capable in areas like recommendation systems, anomaly detection, prediction systems, and competitive games. An AI system in these domains could assist the military with fraud detection in its contracting services, predicting when weapons systems will fail due to maintenance issues, or developing winning strategies in conflict simulations. All of these applications and more can be force multipliers in day-to-day operations and in the next conflict.
AI’s Shortfalls for Military Applications
As the military looks to incorporate AI’s success in these tasks into its systems, some challenges must be acknowledged. The first is that developers need access to data. Many AI systems are trained using data that has been labeled by some expert system (e.g., labeling scenes that include an air defense battery), usually a human. Large datasets are often labeled by companies who employ manual methods. Obtaining this data and sharing it is a challenge, especially for an organization that prefers to classify data and restrict access to it. An example military dataset may be one with images produced by thermal-imaging systems and labeled by experts to describe the weapon systems found in the image, if any. Without sharing this with preprocessors and developers, an AI that uses that set effectively cannot be created. AI systems are also vulnerable to becoming very large (and thus slow), and consequently susceptible to “dimensionality issues.” For example, training a system to recognize images of every possible weapon system in existence would involve thousands of categories. Such systems will require an enormous amount of computing power and lots of dedicated time on those resources. And because we are training a model, the best model requires an infinite amount of these images to be completely accurate. That is something we cannot achieve. Furthermore, as we train these AI systems, we often attempt to force them to follow “human” rules such as the rules of grammar. However, humans often ignore these rules, which makes developing successful AI systems for things like sentiment analysis and speech recognition challenging. Finally, AI systems can work well in uncontested, controlled domains. However, research is demonstrating that under adversarial conditions, AI systems can easily be fooled, resulting in errors. Certainly, many DoD AI applications will operate in contested spaces, like the cyber domain, and thus, we should be wary of their results.
Ignoring the enemy’s efforts to defeat the AI systems that we may employ, there are limitations to these seemingly super-human models. An AI’s image-processing capability is not very robust when given images that are different from its training set—for example, images where lighting conditions are poor, that are at an obtuse angle, or that are partially obscured. Unless these types of images were in the training set, the model may struggle (or fail) to accurately identify the content. Chat bots that might aid our information-operations missions are limited to hundreds of words and thus cannot completely replace a human who can write pages at a time. Prediction systems, such as IBM’s Watson weather-prediction tool, struggle with dimensionality issues and the availability of input data due to the complexity of the systems they are trying to model. Research may solve some of these problems but few of them will be solved as quickly as predicted or desired.
Another simple weakness with AI systems is their inability to multi-task. A human is capable of identifying an enemy vehicle, deciding a weapon system to employ against it, predicting its path, and then engaging the target. This fairly simple set of tasks is currently impossible for an AI system to accomplish. At best, a combination of AIs could be constructed where individual tasks are given to separate models. That type of solution, even if feasible, would entail a huge cost in sensing and computing power not to mention the training and testing of the system. Many AI systems are not even capable of transferring their learning within the same domain. For example, a system trained to identify a T-90 tank would most likely be unable to identify a Chinese Type 99 tank, despite the fact that they are both tanks and both tasks are image recognition. Many researchers are working to enable systems to transfer their learning, but such systems are years away from production.
Artificial-intelligence systems are also very poor at understanding inputs and context within the inputs. AI recognition systems don’t understand what the image is, they simply learn textures and gradients of the image’s pixels. Given scenes with those same gradients, AIs readily identify portions of the picture incorrectly. This lack of understanding can result in misclassifications that humans would not make, such as identifying a boat on a lake as a BMP.
This leads to another weakness of these systems—the inability to explain how they made their decisions. Most of what occurs inside an AI system is a black box and there is very little that a human can do to understand how the system makes its decisions. This is a critical problem for high-risk systems such as those that make engagement decisions or whose output may be used in critical decision-making processes. The ability to audit a system and learn why it made a mistake is legally and morally important. Additionally, issues on how we assess liability in cases where AI is involved are open research concerns. There have been many examples in the news recently of AI systems making poor decisions based on hidden biases in areas such as loan approvals and parole determinations. Unfortunately, work on explainable AI is many years from bearing fruit.
AI systems also struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation. The infamous example often used to illustrate the difference is the correlation between drowning deaths and ice cream sales. An AI system fed with statistics about these two items would not know that the two patterns only correlate because both are a function of warmer weather and might conclude that to prevent drowning deaths we should restrict ice cream sales. This type of problem could manifest itself in a military fraud prevention system that is fed data on purchases by month. Such a system could errantly conclude that fraud increases in September as spending increases when really it’s just a function of end-of-year spending habits.
Even without these AI weaknesses, the main area the military should be concerned with at the moment is adversarial attacks. We must assume that potential adversaries will attempt to fool or break any accessible AI systems that we use. Attempts will be made to fool image-recognition engines and sensors; cyberattacks will try to evade intrusion-detection systems; and logistical systems will be fed altered data to clog the supply lines with false requirements.
Adversarial attacks can be separated into four categories: evasion, inference, poisoning, and extraction. It has been shown that these types of attacks are easy to accomplish and often don’t require computing skills. Evasion attacks attempt to fool an AI engine often in the hopes of avoiding detection—hiding a cyberattack, for example, or convincing a sensor that a tank is a school bus. The primary survival skill of the future may be the ability to hide from AI sensors. As a result, the military may need to develop a new type of AI camouflage to defeat AI systems because it’s been shown that simple obfuscation techniques such as strategic tape placement can fool AI. Evasion attacks are often proceeded by inference attacks that gain information about the AI system that can be used to enable evasion attacks. Poisoning attacks target AI systems during training to achieve their malicious intent. Here the threat would be enemy access to the datasets used to train our tools. Mislabeled images of vehicles to fool targeting systems or manipulated maintenance data designed to classify imminent system failure as normal operation may be inserted. Given the vulnerabilities of our supply chains, this would not be unimaginable and would be difficult to detect. Extraction attacks exploit access to the AI’s interface to learn enough about the AI’s operation to create a parallel model of the system. If our AIs are not secure from unauthorized users, then those users could predict decisions made by our systems and use those predictions to their advantage. One could envision an opponent predicting how an AI-controlled unmanned system will respond to certain visual and electromagnetic stimuli and thus influence its route and behavior.
The Path Forward for Military AI Usage
Artificial intelligence will certainly have a role in future military applications. It has many application areas where it will enhance productivity, reduce user workload, and operate more quickly than humans. Ongoing research will continue to improve its capability, explainability, and resilience. The military cannot ignore this technology. Even if we do not embrace it, certainly our opponents will, and we must be able to attack and defeat their AIs. However, we must resist the allure of this resurgent technology. Placing vulnerable AI systems in contested domains and making them responsible for critical decisions opens the opportunity for disastrous results. At this time, humans must remain responsible for key decisions.
Given the high probability that our exposed AI systems will be attacked and the current lack of resilience in AI technology, the best areas to invest in military AI are those that operate in uncontested domains. Artificial-intelligence tools that are closely supervised by human experts or that have secure inputs and outputs can provide value to the military while alleviating concerns about vulnerabilities. Examples of such systems are medical-imaging diagnostic tools, maintenance-failure prediction applications, and fraud-detection programs. All of these can provide value to the military while limiting the risk from adversarial attacks, biased data, context misunderstanding, and more. These are not the super tools sponsored by the AI salesmen of the world but are the ones most likely to have success in the near term.

AI might seem neutral and technical but it poses a differential challenge to female jobs and can be imbued with insidious gender biases.
Juliane Bir
Digitalisation is encroaching further and further into all our lives in ways of which we are scarcely aware. Algorithms and artificial intelligence guide a vast range of society’s choices and opportunities.
Trade unions are alarmed that AI poses a threat to gender equality, by undermining women’s job opportunities and reinforcing stereotypes in the workplace and society, incorporating biases and prejudices into algorithms and programmes. The European Trade Union Confederation is calling for tough measures to ensure women are not second-class citizens in the digital revolution.
There are two main areas of concern, covering women’s jobs and the wider impact of algorithms on their lives.

Challenging for women
Recent research for the International Monetary Fund finds greater automation will be especially challenging for women in the labour market. Hard-won progress towards improving the place of women in the workforce and winning equal pay may be quickly eroded if they work predominantly in sectors and occupations likely to be automated.
The IMF estimates that 26 million women’s jobs in 30 countries (mainly members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), have at least a 70 per cent risk of being replaced by technology within the next 20 years. Around 11 per cent of female workers could lose their jobs, compared with 9 per cent of men.
Older women and those in low-skilled clerical, service and sales positions are most likely to be affected. There is a danger too that employers will use the threat of automation to further force down wages and working conditions, compelling workers to compete in a race to the bottom they cannot win.

At the same time, women are under-represented in expanding fields in science, technology, engineering and mathematics—the so-called STEM disciplines—where cultural and social influences have contributed to their exclusion. Globally, women make up 36 per cent of STEM university graduates, yet only 25 per cent of STEM workers (see figure) and just 9 per cent of the decision-makers.

According to the IMF, much more needs to be done to boost women’s STEM skills and bridge the digital gender divide, by investment in access and infrastructure, and to close gender gaps in leadership positions and facilitate career progression. For example, attention is needed to childcare and working-time arrangements, as also to the needs of older and low-skilled female workers.
Biased systems
The shortage of female AI professionals carries a further risk—that the digital future will be made by men for men. Biased systems based on flawed data can now influence who gets a job interview or a loan, a promotion or a pay rise. If the people creating the algorithms do not reflect the world’s diverse population, that is a problem, and more female coders, inventors and investors are needed to develop innovations that cater to female needs.
Because existing algorithms tend to treat men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are in danger of becoming the norm. Women pay the price in time and money—even with their lives. For example, women and men show different symptoms for heart attack, but systems based on male experiences mean that women’s conditions may be incorrectly diagnosed.
There are numerous examples of AI systems behaving badly. Reuters revealed that after Amazon had spent years working on an automated recruitment system it realised that women were being excluded from software developer and other technical posts. Amazon’s computer models used data submitted over the previous ten years, most of it coming from men and reflecting male dominance in the tech industry. In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself to select male candidates and mark down curricula vitae that included the word ‘women’s’—including graduates from some women’s colleges.
Last year Apple faced allegations that its new credit card offered lower credit limits to women than men. Similar problems have dogged Google, IBM and Microsoft AI systems.
In facial-analysis programmes, some algorithms find men’s faces easier to identify than women’s, especially if they are dark-skinned—the computer scientist Joy Buolamwini discovered this discrimination through personal experience. Another headline-grabbing example came from a recent UNESCO report, which found female-gendered voice assistants, such as Alexa, reinforced stereotypes through their submissive, servile responses.
Growing injustice
The use of AI requires ethical and legal frameworks that will counter the risks of gender bias. Without regulation, society will reap the harvest of growing injustice.
All workers need to become ‘AI literate’—understanding its impact and anticipating how it will transform their roles, being able to process and manipulate data and to identify and solve problems. This requires a joint effort, with school systems backed up by employers, being sure to include women, minorities and older people and including AI literacy in negotiations with trade unions.
The digital age should eradicate inequalities at the workplace and bring better-quality jobs and healthier working conditions for all. It should anticipate skills needs and launch reskilling and upskilling programmes as an investment in the future, not a perceived cost. Workers and trade unions should be involved in planning all moves towards digitalisation.
Change in governance
The ETUC insists that AI should be designed to improve the quality of life, safety and prosperity of all Europeans citizens, including women. This requires a change in governance, to involve workers and trade unions in planning, investment and control of technology.
Workers and their unions should be informed and consulted and should participate in the whole process of implementing AI systems, with a guaranteed ‘right of explanation’ when AI is used in recruitment, promotion or dismissal procedures, and a right to appeal against decisions. Facial recognition and tools to monitor performance present risks to women workers in particular and should only be employed with adequate safeguards guaranteed in collective agreements. Workers should have the right to access, and to manage, their own AI-generated personal data.
Tech companies should recruit more women and education systems should encourage more women into STEM subjects. Human beings must have the right to supervise and control AI systems and this must be established as a fundamental legal and ethical principle for the regulation of robotics and artificial intelligence, including in the world of work.
Ultimately, companies can gain a competitive advantage by developing and using AI systems that are trustworthy, ethically and socially responsible, and which respect European values, gender equality and labour rights.

Google Engineers 'Mutate' AI to Make It Evolve Systems Faster Than We Can Code Them

Tech17 April 2020By David Nield 

 
(Andriy Onufriyenko/Moment/Getty Images) 



Much of the work undertaken by artificial intelligence involves a training process known as machine learning, where AI gets better at a task such as recognising a cat or mapping a route the more it does it. Now that same technique is being use to create new AI systems, without any human intervention.



For years, engineers at Google have been working on a freakishly smart machine learning system known as the AutoML system (or automatic machine learning system), which is already capable of creating AI that outperforms anything we've made.



Now, researchers have tweaked it to incorporate concepts of Darwinian evolution and shown it can build AI programs that continue to improve upon themselves faster than they would if humans were doing the coding.



The new system is called AutoML-Zero, and although it may sound a little alarming, it could lead to the rapid development of smarter systems - for example, neural networked designed to more accurately mimic the human brain with multiple layers and weightings, something human coders have struggled with.



""It is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks,"" write the researchers in their pre-print paper. ""We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space.""



The original AutoML system is intended to make it easier for apps to leverage machine learning, and already includes plenty of automated features itself, but AutoML-Zero takes the required amount of human input way down.



Using a simple three-step process - setup, predict and learn - it can be thought of as machine learning from scratch.



The system starts off with a selection of 100 algorithms made by randomly combining simple mathematical operations. A sophisticated trial-and-error process then identifies the best performers, which are retained - with some tweaks - for another round of trials. In other words, the neural network is mutating as it goes.



When new code is produced, it's tested on AI tasks - like spotting the difference between a picture of a truck and a picture of a dog - and the best-performing algorithms are then kept for future iteration. Like survival of the fittest.



And it's fast too: the researchers reckon up to 10,000 possible algorithms can be searched through per second per processor (the more computer processors available for the task, the quicker it can work).



Eventually, this should see artificial intelligence systems become more widely used, and easier to access for programmers with no AI expertise. It might even help us eradicate human bias from AI, because humans are barely involved.



Work to improve AutoML-Zero continues, with the hope that it'll eventually be able to spit out algorithms that mere human programmers would never have thought of. Right now it's only capable of producing simple AI systems, but the researchers think the complexity can be scaled up rather rapidly.



""While most people were taking baby steps, [the researchers] took a giant leap into the unknown,"" computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen from the University of Texas, Austin, who was not involved in the work, told Edd Gent at Science. ""This is one of those papers that could launch a lot of future research.""The research paper has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but can be viewed online at arXiv.org.

Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we design and build. By 2050, the effects of AI adoption will be widely felt across all aspects of our daily lives. As the world faces a number of urgent and complex challenges, from the climate crisis to housing, AI has the potential to make the difference between a dystopian future and a livable one. By looking ahead, we’re taking stock of what’s happening, and in turn, imagining how AI can shape our lives for the better.

Artificial intelligence is broadly defined as the theory and development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The term is often applied to a machine or system’s ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Today, AI already utilizes algorithms to suggest what we should see, read, and listen to, and these systems have extended to everyday tasks like suggested travel routes, autonomous flying, optimized farming, and warehousing and logistic supply chains. Even if we are not aware of it, we are already feeling the effects of AI adoption.
As Alex Hern explored at The Guardian, making predictions on the next 30 years is a mug’s game. However, the act of following trend-lines to possible conclusions and imagining how we might live is a productive exercise. We’re taking a closer look at how artificial intelligence will shape design by 2050. From air taxis and urban intelligence to construction and the Singularity, AI will continue to shape how we live, work and play.
The Future of Work
According to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. These jobs will be lost as “artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees.” Editorial Data & Content Manager Nicolás Valencia explored this idea two years ago and how automation will affect architects. The conclusion is that the most difficult jobs to replace require a high level of creativity and human interaction, and have a low percentage of repetitive activities. These will be the last to be replaced, but there will also be new jobs created that will become necessary to monitor and coordinate intelligent machines and systems.
As we approach a time when the broad intelligence of AI exceeds human levels, existential questions arise. What should you study when any job can be programmed or replaced? Will universal income be adopted as a result? Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes so. “AI is just the latest in technologies that allow us to produce a lot more goods and services with less labor,” says Gates. How we work, and what we can work on, will begin to change at an increasingly faster rate. If half of all work can be done by robots or machines in the next 15 years, it’s likely that all work will be shaped by AI before 2050.
Urban Intelligence & Big Data
AI and the “Internet of Things” are changing how we live, and in turn, society at large. Architect Bettina Zerza has explored how data and intelligent systems will dramatically shape our cities. She gives the example of micro sensors and urban technology that will record air quality, noise pollution and soundscapes, as well as urban infrastructure at large. How people move, where emissions are worst, and how efficient city processes are represent just a few of these ideas.
Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a number that will increase to 70% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. Here, AI can further analyze and monitor how we move about the city, work together, and unwind. In 30 years, we will also have entirely new versions of these modalities.
Transportation
How we move is already undergoing widespread transformation. Transit is being reimagined on the street and in the air, from public transit transforming to more user-centric mobility services, to rethinking regulatory and organizational structures. Looking at the evolution of transportation, there have been new innovations and shifts in the status quo every 50 to 70 years throughout the last two centuries. From ships and trains to automobiles and airplanes, these advances have changed the way we communicate, trade and connect to one another.
Today, there is a lot of talk about the Hyperloop systems, with Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT emerging as the leading teams rethinking transportation. The implications for 2050 are dramatic, where our current ideas and associations of cities, geography and resources will radically change. At the same time, companies like Uber and Volocopter are looking to the sky to design and develop the world’s first vertiport and air taxi hubs around the world. Trying to anticipate the future of mobility, the Third Dimension will open up new possibilities for transit.
Construction
Construction has been one of the most challenging sectors for artificial intelligence. British multinational infrastructure company Balfour Beatty published their predictions for 2050 in their Innovation Paper. The report outlines a series of conclusions: robots will work in teams to build complex structures using dynamic new materials, while elements of a build will self-assemble. Drones flying overhead will scan the site, sending instructions to robotic cranes and diggers and automated builders with no need for human involvement. The result is a human-free construction process, one where the role of the builder moves to “overseer” and they are remotely managing projects.
Moreover, if people are still on site before being phased out, they will be using robotically enhanced exoskeletons and neural-control technology to move and control machinery and other robots on site. These movements could eventually address the dangers of construction and make Zero Harm a reality. However, there are deeper ideological changes that come with human-free building. In terms of design and an appreciation for craft, we may begin to lose a “human touch” and the haptic qualities of construction. It is directly tied to the very meaning of tectonics; the science and art of construction, the activity of building, and the resulting details and connections.
The Singularity
Looking to the future, especially as far as 2050, there is a lot of discussion about the “singularity” moment in artificial intelligence. The Singularity is often defined as the point at which exponential technological advancements cross the threshold of “strong AI” and machines possess a broad intelligence that exceeds human levels. There is a very strong chance it will happen by 2050.
The singularity also represents a point where human intelligence and AI merge. Human intelligence will undergo an extensive integration with AI, forming a symbiotic relationship where AIs are empowered by human talent for creative and lateral thinking. At the same time, humans could be empowered by AI’s memory and rapid computing. The design implications are, quite definitively, hard to grasp. To put it another way, we may begin to create designs we don’t yet have the capacity to imagine.
Artificial intelligence will continue to inspire discussions on the precarity of work, our shared ethics, ideas like universal basic income and urban intelligence, as well as how we design. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live and how we shape the built environment. By doing so, we can being to imagine new creative and social processes, and hopefully, work with AI to lay the foundation for a better future.

Artificial intelligence is often associated with prophecies of job destruction. Yet an army of workers in the global south is being pressed into action.
Mark Graham
In discussions about the locations comprising the key productive nodes of artificial intelligence and other next-generation digital technologies, African workers rarely get a mention. Autonomous vehicles, machine-learning systems, next-generation search engines and recommendations systems—how many of these technologies are ‘made in Africa’? The answer, actually, is ‘all of them’.
In a paper from which this article is derived, we make visible the invisible and bring to light the role African workers are playing in developing such key emergent, and everyday, technologies—which underpin, or soon will, the enormous profits made by large technology companies based in the global north. In the context of hyperbolic claims about automation and robotisation—and the impending technological unemployment they are predicted to herald—human labour, including that of African workers, remains very much a part of contemporary digital capitalism.

Production networks
We conducted a five-year study (2014-19) in South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya, involving in-depth interviews and group discussions with more than 200 stakeholders—including workers, managers of outsourcing firms, government officials, trade unions, employment agencies, private-sector associations and industry experts. This enabled us to construct a snapshot of the key ways in which African digital labour has been integrated into the production networks of digital products and services being deployed around the world.
We focused on machine learning and digital decision-making. These activities are performed by workers employed within firms or operating as freelancers through digital work platforms (such as Upwork, Freelancer.com and Amazon Mechanical Turk), which act as intermediaries between employers and workers in a planetary labour market. Much hides behind the sleek, automated surfaces.
African workers play an important role in building and maintaining these technologies—acting as ‘data janitors’. Real people are still needed to structure, classify and tag an enormous amount of unstructured information for companies using machine-learning algorithms in their products.

While many scholars are predicting that machines will replace humans in the production process, thus increasing unemployment around the world, automation is not always what it seems. Technological advances and use of machines in production can destroy jobs in one location (primarily richer regions), yet can also open up many lower-income work possibilities for workers in poorer countries.
Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work looks like. We need detailed empirical studies of where value is created and captured in these production networks, which are opaque by design. Research can start to make the invisible nodes of these chains more visible and highlight the pay and working conditions of the workers who make everything possible.
This is not to say that many of these digital workers are poorly paid by local standards, or that they are ungrateful for their jobs. But high unemployment and a large informal sector mean these digital jobs receive overly positive reviews, while the risks are sidelined. And digital workers in Africa are still earning only a tiny fraction of the profits generated from their labour.
Socio-political response
The contemporary digital economy thus offers jobs and opportunities to African workers, but even more of an opportunity to the international corporations which seek to profit from their labour. There is no easy means for firms and individuals based in the world’s economic margins to move up global value chains, but this does not mean that we should throw up our hands and accept the status quo.
As digital connectivity spreads to the last corners of the world, we hope this knowledge will help build a greater socio-political response to the relatively labour-intensive nature of the contemporary digital economy, in which African workers play a significant role in value creation. Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work looks like and aim—at both the global and local scales—to make some of these value chains more transparent, ethical, and rewarding.
Meantime, there is still much to be done to understand better African digital labour, to challenge labour processes and employment relations, to improve the quality of work and to identify the common interests of workers—and the ways their labour connects distant sites of production and consumption.
