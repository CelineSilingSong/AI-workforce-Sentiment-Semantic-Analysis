With more than 30,000 employees spread across more than 60 affiliate locations and 14 manufacturing sites around the world, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly operates at a truly global scale. Operating at that scale comes with issues, not the least of which is sharing accurate and timely information internally and externally.
“From internal training materials to formal, technical communications to regulatory agencies, Lilly is translating information often,” says Timothy F. Coleman, vice president and information officer for information and digital solutions at Eli Lilly and Co.
For years, Lilly relied on third-party human translation providers for the bulk of its translation needs. Although public web translation services are available, confidentiality requirements meant those services did not meet Lilly’s standards for information security. Even with a footprint of more than 400 translation vendors, the process was slow.
 
 
 













 
 

“Lilly engages with costly third-party human-translation providers across the organization to provide verified and reliable translations,” Coleman says. “Depending on the requirements, the planning, translation, and verification of these engagements can take weeks to complete.”

Coleman adds that many bilingual Lilly employees were also being tapped to provide translations in addition to their current scope of work.
To address these challenges, the pharmaceutical firm developed Lilly Translate, a home-grown IT solution that uses natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to generate content translation via a validated API layer, Coleman says.
 
 
 













 
 

“This innovative application of natural language technology enables Lilly to achieve greater efficiency gains, significant cost reduction, higher quality content, and lead the way for future tech innovations using natural language technology to achieve enterprise value at scale,” he says.
Passion project pays off
Coleman says Lilly Translate started as a passion project by a curious software engineer who had an idea for addressing a pain point of the Lilly Regulatory Affairs system portfolio: Business partners continually experienced delays and friction in translation services.
“That married up well with an opportunity to explore and learn emerging technologies,” he says. “It became a great opportunity that a Lilly software engineer picked up and ran with, initially as a great learning opportunity.”
 
 
 













 
 

After sharing the idea and technical vision with peers and managers, the project immediately garnered support from leadership at Eli Lilly Global Regulatory Affairs International, who advocated for investment in the tool. Coleman’s team worked closely with Regulatory Affairs to identify requirements around document types, languages, and so on.

The Lilly Translate API and UI are delivered via a serverless tech stack built on Node.js, Python, .NET, and Docker. It can be accessed via mobile devices, web browsers, and programmatically through the secure API.
The service, which earned Eli Lilly a CIO 100 Award in IT Excellence, provides real-time translation of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text for users and systems, keeping document format in place. Deep learning language models trained with life sciences and Lilly content help improve translation accuracy, and Lilly is creating refined language models that recognize Lilly-specific terminology and industry-specific technical language, while maintaining the formatting requirements of regulated documentation.
 
 
 













 
 

“The product was developed via a DevSecOps agile framework,” Coleman says. “Initially, we did not have a dedicated Scrum master and product owner, but later we were able to adjust that. The increased focus helped us accelerate our delivery efforts.”
The project took about a year to get to MVP, with several iterations and pilots needed to achieve the level of translation quality needed to meet business expectations.
“The level of quality of the translation output was an initial challenge we faced where the team had to work through various services to figure out how to improve the overall general level of quality,” Coleman says. “Once improved, we had to work diligently to ramp up our [organizational change management] efforts to gain confidence in the tool.”
 
 
 













 
 

With the tool fully deployed, a process that required the creation of work orders and days or weeks to complete now takes just a few seconds or minutes. The automation has also led to a big cost savings.
“In surveys distributed across the company there is consistent feedback that Lilly Translate is saving time across multiple business processes as well as getting answers to questions faster,” Coleman says. “Lilly Translate touches every area of the company from HR to Corporate Audit Services, to Ethics and Compliance Hotlines, Finance, Sales and Marketing, Regulatory Affairs, and many others. The time savings is extensive. Translations are now taking seconds instead of weeks, providing key resources time to focus on other business-critical activities.”

Scientists and engineers are constantly developing new materials with unique properties that can be used for 3D printing, but figuring out how to print with these materials can be a complex, costly conundrum.

Often, an expert operator must use manual trial-and-error — possibly making thousands of prints — to determine ideal parameters that consistently print a new material effectively. These parameters include printing speed and how much material the printer deposits.

MIT researchers have now used artificial intelligence to streamline this procedure. They developed a machine-learning system that uses computer vision to watch the manufacturing process and then correct errors in how it handles the material in real-time.

They used simulations to teach a neural network how to adjust printing parameters to minimize error, and then applied that controller to a real 3D printer. Their system printed objects more accurately than all the other 3D printing controllers they compared it to.

The work avoids the prohibitively expensive process of printing thousands or millions of real objects to train the neural network. And it could enable engineers to more easily incorporate novel materials into their prints, which could help them develop objects with special electrical or chemical properties. It could also help technicians make adjustments to the printing process on-the-fly if material or environmental conditions change unexpectedly.

“This project is really the first demonstration of building a manufacturing system that uses machine learning to learn a complex control policy,” says senior author Wojciech Matusik, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT who leads the Computational Design and Fabrication Group (CDFG) within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). “If you have manufacturing machines that are more intelligent, they can adapt to the changing environment in the workplace in real-time, to improve the yields or the accuracy of the system. You can squeeze more out of the machine.”

The co-lead authors on the research are Mike Foshey, a mechanical engineer and project manager in the CDFG, and Michal Piovarci, a postdoc at the Institute of Science and Technology in Austria. MIT co-authors include Jie Xu, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, and Timothy Erps, a former technical associate with the CDFG.

Picking parameters

Determining the ideal parameters of a digital manufacturing process can be one of the most expensive parts of the process because so much trial-and-error is required. And once a technician finds a combination that works well, those parameters are only ideal for one specific situation. She has little data on how the material will behave in other environments, on different hardware, or if a new batch exhibits different properties.

Using a machine-learning system is fraught with challenges, too. First, the researchers needed to measure what was happening on the printer in real-time.

To do this, they developed a machine-vision system using two cameras aimed at the nozzle of the 3D printer. The system shines light at material as it is deposited and, based on how much light passes through, calculates the material’s thickness.

“You can think of the vision system as a set of eyes watching the process in real-time,” Foshey says.

The controller would then process images it receives from the vision system and, based on any error it sees, adjust the feed rate and the direction of the printer.

But training a neural network-based controller to understand this manufacturing process is data-intensive, and would require making millions of prints. So, the researchers built a simulator instead.

Successful simulation

To train their controller, they used a process known as reinforcement learning in which the model learns through trial-and-error with a reward. The model was tasked with selecting printing parameters that would create a certain object in a simulated environment. After being shown the expected output, the model was rewarded when the parameters it chose minimized the error between its print and the expected outcome.

In this case, an “error” means the model either dispensed too much material, placing it in areas that should have been left open, or did not dispense enough, leaving open spots that should be filled in. As the model performed more simulated prints, it updated its control policy to maximize the reward, becoming more and more accurate.

However, the real world is messier than a simulation. In practice, conditions typically change due to slight variations or noise in the printing process. So the researchers created a numerical model that approximates noise from the 3D printer. They used this model to add noise to the simulation, which led to more realistic results.

“The interesting thing we found was that, by implementing this noise model, we were able to transfer the control policy that was purely trained in simulation onto hardware without training with any physical experimentation,” Foshey says. “We didn’t need to do any fine-tuning on the actual equipment afterwards.”

When they tested the controller, it printed objects more accurately than any other control method they evaluated. It performed especially well at infill printing, which is printing the interior of an object. Some other controllers deposited so much material that the printed object bulged up, but the researchers’ controller adjusted the printing path so the object stayed level.

Their control policy can even learn how materials spread after being deposited and adjust parameters accordingly.

“We were also able to design control policies that could control for different types of materials on-the-fly. So if you had a manufacturing process out in the field and you wanted to change the material, you wouldn’t have to revalidate the manufacturing process. You could just load the new material and the controller would automatically adjust,” Foshey says.

Now that they have shown the effectiveness of this technique for 3D printing, the researchers want to develop controllers for other manufacturing processes. They’d also like to see how the approach can be modified for scenarios where there are multiple layers of material, or multiple materials being printed at once. In addition, their approach assumed each material has a fixed viscosity (“syrupiness”), but a future iteration could use AI to recognize and adjust for viscosity in real-time.

Additional co-authors on this work include Vahid Babaei, who leads the Artificial Intelligence Aided Design and Manufacturing Group at the Max Planck Institute; Piotr Didyk, associate professor at the University of Lugano in Switzerland; Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the David M. Siegel ’83 Professor of computer science at Princeton University; and Bernd Bickel, professor at the Institute of Science and Technology in Austria.

The work was supported, in part, by the FWF Lise-Meitner program, a European Research Council starting grant, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.

As a concept, artificial intelligence is very old. My first job out of college almost 40 years ago was as an AI systems developer using Lisp. Many of the concepts from back then are still in use today. However, it’s about a thousand times less expensive now to build, deploy, and operate AI systems for any number of business purposes.
Cloud computing revolutionized AI and machine learning, not because the hyperscalers invented it but because they made it affordable. Nevertheless, I and some others are seeing a shift in thinking about where to host AI/ML processing and AI/ML-coupled data. Using the public cloud providers was pretty much a no-brainer for the past few years. These days, the valuing of hosting AI/ML and the needed data on public cloud providers is being called into question. Why?
Cost of course. Many businesses have built game-changing AI/ML systems in the cloud, and when they get the cloud bills at the end of the month, they understand quickly that hosting AI/ML systems, including terabytes or petabytes of data, is pricey. Moreover, data egress and ingress costs (what you pay to send data from your cloud provider to your data center or another cloud provider) will run up that bill significantly.











 
 
 
Companies are looking at other, more cost-effective options, including managed service providers and co-location providers (colos), or even moving those systems to the old server room down the hall. This last group is returning to “owned platforms” largely for two reasons.

First, the cost of traditional compute and storage equipment has fallen a great deal in the past five years or so. If you’ve never used anything but cloud-based systems, let me explain. We used to go into rooms called data centers where we could physically touch our computing equipment—equipment that we had to purchase outright before we could use it. I’m only half kidding.
When it comes down to renting versus buying, many are finding that traditional approaches, including the burden of maintaining your own hardware and software, are actually much cheaper than the ever-increasing cloud bills.











 
 
 
Second, many are experiencing some latency with cloud. The slowdowns happen because most enterprises consume cloud-based systems over the open internet, and the multitenancy model means that you’re sharing processors and storage systems with many others at the same time. Occasional latency can translate into many thousands of dollars of lost revenue a year, depending on what you’re doing with your specific cloud-based AI/ML system in the cloud.
Many of the AI/ML systems that are available from cloud providers are also available on traditional systems. Migrating from a cloud provider to a local server is cheaper and faster, and more akin to a lift-and-shift process, if you’re not locked into an AI/ML system that only runs on a single cloud provider.
What’s the bottom line here? Cloud computing will continue to grow. Traditional computing systems whose hardware we own and maintain, not as much. This trend won’t slow down. However, some systems, especially AI/ML systems that use a large amount of data and processing and happen to be latency sensitive, won’t be as cost-effective in the cloud. This could also be the case for some larger analytical applications such as data lakes and data lake houses.











 
 
 
Some could save half the yearly cost of hosting on a public cloud provider by repatriating the AI/ML system back on-premises. That business case is just too compelling to ignore, and many won’t.
Cloud computing prices may lower to accommodate these workloads that are cost-prohibitive to run on public cloud providers. Indeed, many workloads may not be built there in the first place, which is what I suspect is happening now. It is no longer always a no-brainer to leverage cloud for AI/ML.

A brand-new area of computer science was initially referred to as “artificial intelligence” in 1955. Many daily jobs are being replaced by artificial intelligence, requiring less human involvement. But what precisely is this new AI technology? AI refers to the process of teaching a computer system to function and think like a human brain. This is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, in which the computer learns from past errors and observed patterns. For instance, a trained model defeated the world champion in the difficult-to-learn and won a game of AlphaGO by self-training itself many times and learning from its mistakes each time it lost a game.
Applications of AI technology are rapidly gaining ground in every aspect of our daily life, just as AI is quickly transforming several sectors. People may easily carry out tasks like phoning a buddy, determining the best route to their destinations, and turning on or off electrical equipment by giving voice instructions to their virtual assistant. AI technology is also finding applications in the automotive, e-commerce, AI farming, healthcare, and several other industries.
It won’t be long before artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced to the point where people rely on their virtual assistants to wake us up, driverless cars to get us to work, and perhaps AI-powered robots to assist us in making decisions at work by forecasting, analyzing, and providing valuable insights. It all seems somewhat fictional when we read this, don’t you think? Thoughts of video calling were commonplace, but today everyone has access to it through their cellphones.

Human language transcription and translation into useable forms is a common and quickly expanding phenomenon today. Speech recognition services are provided by businesses like NICE, Nuance Communications, OpenText, Verint Systems, and Siri on the iPhone.
Decision Management
Organizations currently employ decision management by integrating it into their applications to drive and carry out automated decisions to increase value to the business and profitability. AI systems may be equipped with logic by artificially intelligent computers, which can then be used to teach, maintain, and tune them. Several companies offer this service, including Informatica, Advanced Systems Concepts, Maana, Pegasystems, and UiPath.
Robotic Process Automation
Robotic process automation is the automated imitation of human work that allows business processes to run more efficiently. This procedure is the main emphasis of businesses like Pega Systems, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, UiPath, and WorkFusion. It’s crucial to remember that AI in this specific field is intended to help and complement human abilities rather than replace them.
Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The study of how human languages and computers interact is known as natural language processing. It is understandable why these phrases list the top 15 hottest artificial intelligence technology. Machine learning and text analytics examine phrase structure, meaning, and purpose. This technique is commonly used in security systems and fraud detection. NLP is used by several automated programs and helpers to extract unstructured data. Among the service providers are Basis Technology, Expert System, Coveo, Indico, Knime, Lexalytics, Linguamatics, Mindbreeze, Sinequa, Stratifyd, and Synapsify.
Cyber Defense
A computer defensive mechanism known as “cyber defense” tries to identify, stop, and neutralize assaults and threats to data and system infrastructure. Learning technologies that can be used to disclose questionable user behavior and identify cyber risks can be developed using machine learning methods and neural networks that can analyze sequences of inputs.
Content Creation
Although humans who work on films, advertising, blogs, and white papers create content, companies like Hearst, USA Today, and CBS use AI to generate content. Automated Insights’ well-known Wordsmith technology uses natural language processing (NLP) to construct news articles.
Emotion Recognition
This type of AI technology allows for the reading and interpreting of human emotions utilizing sophisticated picture or audio data processing. The use of technology by law enforcement during interrogations is every day. Beyond Verbal, nViso, and Affectiva are a few businesses that employ emotion recognition.
Marketing Automation
Teams and divisions in marketing and sales have embraced AI and reaped several rewards. Automated client segmentation, customer data integration, and AI campaign management techniques are standard. AdextAI has developed into an industry leader in the use of marketing automation.
Virtual agents
The use of virtual agents by instructional designers has increased significantly. A computer program that communicates with people is referred to as a virtual agent. Web and mobile applications use chatbots as customer care representatives to communicate with people and respond to their inquiries. Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant make planning meetings and shopping easier. A virtual assistant performs similar functions to a language assistant by taking cues from your preferences and choices. IBM Watson comprehends the common customer care inquiries posed in various ways. Virtual agents function similarly to software as a service.
Machine learning systems
Artificial intelligence’s field of machine learning allows computers to interpret large data sets without explicitly training. Business decision-making is aided by machine learning when data analytics are carried out utilizing statistical models and algorithms. To gain from machine learning’s use in various fields, businesses are investing extensively in this field. To evaluate patient data for illness prediction and efficient treatment, healthcare, and the medical profession need machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is necessary for the banking and financial industries to analyze client data, discover and recommend customer investments, and reduce risk and fraud. Retailers use machine learning to analyze customer data and forecast shifting consumer preferences and behavior.
Peer-to-peer network
Without a server, the peer-to-peer network enables connections between various computers and systems for data exchange. Peer-to-peer networks can handle even the most challenging challenges. The use of cryptocurrency involves this technology. Due to the connection of individual workstations and lack of installation of servers, the implementation is cost-effective.
Deep learning systems
Deep learning is another application of artificial intelligence that uses artificial neural networks. This approach encourages machines, including computers, to learn by doing, much like people do. Deep learning has gained traction in various industries, including aerospace and defense, to recognize things from satellites, worker safety by recognizing risk occurrences when a person comes in contact with a machine, cancer cell detection, and more. Because neural networks have hidden layers, the word “deep” was created. A neural network typically contains two to three hidden layers and up to 150 hidden layers. Deep learning is effective on large amounts of data when training a model with a graphics processing unit. To automate predictive analytics, a hierarchy of algorithms is used.
AI optimized hardware
There is a huge need for artificial intelligence software in the commercial world. The requirement for hardware supporting the program grew as the software received more attention.

Experts say Australian law is not up-to-date to sufficiently regulate the rising use of artificial intelligence. (Chris Yang: Unsplash)Dr Abbass said he stumbled on the Jingulu language by accident, while developing a new communication system. ""When I started looking at the abstract, it didn't take much time to click in my mind about how suitable it is, for the work I do on artificial intelligence and human AI teaming,"" he said. Language easily translatable into AI commandsDr Abbass said it was normal for AI researchers to draw on different forms of communication for their work, including other human languages, body language and even music.What is artificial intelligence?It's here already, and it's influence is growing. But what is it, how does it work, and what are the benefits and the concerns?Read moreHowever, he said the Jingulu language was especially well-suited to AI because it had only three verbs — 'go', come' and 'do' — which meant it could be easily translated into commands.""The specific AI model that we are working on relies on the very simple concepts of attraction and repulsion, in physics .... and this very simple concept fits underneath the mathematics of our AI,"" he said.""We can apply the 'go' and 'come' to the attraction and repulsion concepts, in the mathematical model that we have, and the 'do', to when there's no movement in a space.""The structure of Jingulu matches extremely nicely to the mathematics, and that's what made it really fascinating, for what we do.""""I have not encountered another language that has all of these advantages simultaneously, and in alignment with AI.""

Like most Australian Indigenous languages, Jingulu is considered endangered. Sign of growing interest in Indigenous languagesDr Abbass said the AI system was the first instance he was aware of in which an Australian Indigenous language had been used ""at the interface of human and AI communication"".""You never know where good ideas will come from, and without keeping our minds open, we won't be able to innovate,"" he said.Dr Nordlinger said researchers' use of Jingulu to develop the system was an example of the growing level of interest in Indigenous languages in Australia, both from Indigenous communities themselves and the wider Australian public.""People are becoming more aware of how fascinating these languages are, but also how endangered they are, and therefore how precious they are,"" she said.""I think [this study] is a sign of the growing interest for sure, and it can be a real positive.""It can only be a good thing to have more attention and more appreciation of these languages.""Posted 1 Aug 20221 Aug 2022Mon 1 Aug 2022 at 4:39pm, updated 1 Aug 20221 Aug 2022Mon 1 Aug 2022 at 8:13pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesConcerns raised about new tech that uses AI, cameras to monitor workplace safetyA Google employee falsely claimed a chatbot had sentience.

Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive test that measures the oxygen saturation level in a patient’s blood, and it has become an important tool for monitoring many patients, including those with Covid-19. But new research links faulty readings from pulse oximeters with racial disparities in health outcomes, potentially leading to higher rates of death and complications such as organ dysfunction, in patients with darker skin.
It is well known that non-white intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive less-accurate readings of their oxygen levels using pulse oximeters — the common devices clamped on patients’ fingers. Now, a paper co-authored by MIT scientists reveals that inaccurate pulse oximeter readings can lead to critically ill patients of color receiving less supplemental oxygen during ICU stays.
The paper, “Assessment of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Oxygen Supplementation Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit,” published in JAMA Internal Medicine, focused on the question of whether there were differences in supplemental oxygen administration among patients of different races and ethnicities that were associated with pulse oximeter performance discrepancies. 
The findings showed that inaccurate readings of Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients resulted in them receiving less supplemental oxygen than white patients. These results provide insight into how health technologies such as the pulse oximeter contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in care, according to the researchers.
The study's senior author, Leo Anthony Celi, clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, and a principal research scientist at the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), says the challenge is that health care technology is routinely designed around the majority population.
“Medical devices are typically developed in rich countries with white, fit individuals as test subjects,” he explains. “Drugs are evaluated through clinical trials that disproportionately enroll white individuals. Genomics data overwhelmingly come from individuals of European descent.”
“It is therefore not surprising that we observe disparities in outcomes across demographics, with poorer outcomes among those who were not included in the design of health care,"" Celi adds.
While pulse oximeters are widely used due to ease of use, the most accurate way to measure blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) levels is by taking a sample of the patient’s arterial blood. False readings of normal pulse oximetry (SpO2) can lead to hidden hypoxemia. Elevated bilirubin in the bloodstream and the use of certain medications in the ICU called vasopressors can also throw off pulse oximetry readings.
More than 3,000 participants were included in the study, of whom 2,667 were white, 207 Black, 112 Hispanic, and 83 Asian — using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version 4, or MIMIC-IV dataset. This dataset is comprised of more than 50,000 patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and includes both pulse oximeter readings and oxygen saturation levels detected in blood samples. MIMIC-IV also includes rates of administration of supplemental oxygen.
When the researchers compared SpO2 levels taken by pulse oximeter to oxygen saturation from blood samples, they found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients had higher SpO2 readings than white patients for a given blood oxygen saturation level measured in blood samples. The turnaround time of arterial blood gas analysis may take from several minutes up to an hour. As a result, clinicians typically make decisions based on pulse oximetry reading, unaware of its suboptimal performance in certain patient demographics.
Eric Gottlieb, the study’s lead author, a nephrologist, a lecturer at MIT, and a Harvard Medical School fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, called for more research to be done, in order to better understand “how pulse oximeter performance disparities lead to worse outcomes; possible differences in ventilation management, fluid resuscitation, triaging decisions, and other aspects of care should be explored. We then need to redesign these devices and properly evaluate them to ensure that they perform equally well for all patients.”
Celi emphasizes that understanding biases that exist within real-world data is crucial in order to better develop algorithms and artificial intelligence to assist clinicians with decision-making. “Before we invest more money on developing artificial intelligence for health care using electronic health records, we have to identify all the drivers of outcome disparities, including those that arise from the use of suboptimally designed technology,” he argues. “Otherwise, we risk perpetuating and magnifying health inequities with AI.”
Celi described the project and research as a testament to the value of data sharing that is the core of the MIMIC project. “No one team has the expertise and perspective to understand all the biases that exist in real-world data to prevent AI from perpetuating health inequities,” he says. “The database we analyzed for this project has more than 30,000 credentialed users consisting of teams that include data scientists, clinicians, and social scientists.”
The many researchers working on this topic together form a community that shares and performs quality checks on codes and queries, promotes reproducibility of the results, and crowdsources the curation of the data, Celi says. “There is harm when health data is not shared,” he says. “Limiting data access means limiting the perspectives with which data is analyzed and interpreted. We've seen numerous examples of model mis-specifications and flawed assumptions leading to models that ultimately harm patients.”

Associated PressPrincipal research scientist Leo Anthony Celi speaks with Associated Press reporter Maddie Burakoff about how pulse oximeters can provide inaccurate readings in patients of color. Celi highlights how oxygen levels can also be measured by drawing blood out of an artery in the wrist, the “gold standard” for accuracy, but a method that is a a bit trickier and more painful.

ReutersPrincipal Research Scientist Leo Anthony Celi oversaw a study which found that people of color were given significantly less supplemental oxygen than white people because of inaccuracies in pulse oximeter readings, reports Nancy Lapid for Reuters. “Nurses and doctors make the wrong decisions and end up giving less oxygen to people of color because they are fooled [by incorrect readings from pulse oximeters],” says Celi.

Today, AI has transformed our lives, from voice recognition devices to intelligent chatbots. This amazing technology has brought many good and bad things into our lives, and it will have an even greater impact in the coming decades. However, every good thing has a drawback, and AI is no exception.

Some of the most respected leaders of science, most notably the late Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that super-intelligent machines could pose a long-term threat to humanity. Fears of a potentially evil AI or AI gone rogue have been legitimized. While businesses are often eager to take advantage of all that AI has to offer, they may also be concerned about what might happen if AI were to overpower humankind. Regardless of how unlikely that is, with the advancement of AI algorithms and machine learning, it is now a topic worth discussing.


The Emergence of Different Types of AI
AI and its variants are used to devise novel solutions to various problems. This assists in reaching and exceeding human performance in any task. The systems are programmed to play a specific role as well as or better than a human. They have also become more successful in a brief period, which no one could have predicted—for example, beating human opponents in complex games, which experts predicted would take years.

As many are concerned about the power AI may one day wield over humanity, the reality is that top AI academics are equally worried about its more sinister potential. It is past time for people to realize that there will be no more attempts at developing powerful artificial intelligence. Unlike other revolutionary developments for humanity, if this fails, there is no chance to try again and learn from the mistakes. There have already been a few instances of developed AI gone rogue or AI functioning in unexpected ways, creating concern over AI dystopia—for example, Microsoft's Tay chatbot engaged in misogynistic and racist content within hours of launch. Within 16 hours, Tay was taken offline.

PROMOTED
How Will AI Effect Human Society?
There are legitimate reasons to be concerned. Current AI research is overly focused on making advances in a narrow set of domains and pays insufficient attention to the disruptive effects on society's fabric. If AI technology continues on its current trajectory, it will likely cause social upheaval for at least two reasons. Firstly, AI will have an impact on the future of work. Our current trajectory over-automates work while refusing to invest in human productivity. Further advances will displace workers while failing to create new opportunities and, as a result, miss out on AI's full potential to boost productivity. Also, AI has the potential to undermine democracy and individual liberties.

Wealth Inequality
Wealth inequality will be created as AI investors take the lion's share of the earnings. The gap between rich and poor will grow wider. The so-called ""M"" shape of wealth distribution will become more apparent.
Self-Learning Algorithms
Issues emerge not only in the social sense but also in AI itself, as the AI that is trained and taught how to operate the given task can eventually take off to the point where human control is lost, resulting in unanticipated problems and consequences. It refers to AI's ability to function autonomously after being loaded with all necessary algorithms, ignoring the command given by the human controller.
Origin of racial and egocentric bots
The human creators of AI may create something with racial bias or egocentrically oriented to harm certain people or things. AI has the potential to target specific races or programmed objects to carry out the programmers' command of destruction, resulting in a global disaster.
The AI revolution is a contentious issue. Many AI experts have openly spoken out about the negative effects of AI gone rogue on human society and asked researchers to investigate the societal effects of AI. The rapid advancement of AI technology necessitates constant regulation and monitoring before the negative consequences become too severe.
AI takeover will be limited to the entertaining plots of dystopian movies and fictional worlds if proper laws protect the users. The omniscient and nearly omnipotent power of AI has been called into question. There may be no definitive answer to the question of AI replacing humans in various industries. Only predictions and observations are available. The future of AI remains hazy, which justifies the question that we are repeatedly asked - will AI replace humans? The answer remains a mystery.

It's old news that locating, hiring and retaining top talent is HR's No. 1 challenge. However, the vast changes stemming from the pandemic's impact on remote work and many people's reassessment of their personal life choices, not to mention the ""great resignation,"" have exacerbated these perennial challenges. Systemic issues such as the dearth of child and family care with its outsized effect on the employment of women, the ongoing toll of COVID variants on workforce participation and productivity, the continual stress on healthcare professionals, and the unknown long-term effects of COVID and monkeypox present further complications.







All is not bleak for HR teams facing employee volatility, though, as advancements in AI have increasingly been applied to talent acquisition and other parts of HR. While talent acquisition vendors tentatively poked their toes into AI pre-pandemic, they made use of the time to create ""smart"" deep-learning platforms that underlie their cloud talent cloud applications. Today, AI is ubiquitous in products for sourcing, hiring and managing employees.
But what has changed and why does it matter?

What is artificial intelligence?
First, AI is not a product, a ""thing"" that an HRIS professional would go procure. It is, rather, an underlying platform or infrastructure on which specific products such as a recruitment system are built.
Implemented in software, an AI platform consists of a variety of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), predictive analytics and robotic process automation (see the sidebars for deeper dives into the last three). Collectively described as an ""engine,"" AI can support functions across the enterprise, creating efficiencies in supply chain management, customer relationships, product production and delivery, and business planning, to name a few. Now, AI is increasingly making inroads in HR processes and employee management -- specifically in easing issues in sourcing, hiring, onboarding, learning and the overall employee lifecycle.

An AI engine analyzes data -- ordinarily an immense amount of it -- then decides or recommends what should happen next to complete a task. Some products use multiple engines to improve reliability. The data could be in resumes, employee profiles, patient records, images like MRIs and X-rays, production schedules, employee promotion rates -- basically anything.



These capabilities of NLP are increasingly used in HR processes, including talent acquisition.





For example, iCIMS, a provider of talent management software, uses an ensemble AI methodology that learns from employer and job-seeker activity over more than 4,000 customers and hundreds of millions of data points across job openings, applications and hires.
The benefits are twofold: Not only can AI-powered systems deliver expected information faster and more efficiently, they can provide insight into areas that otherwise may not be obvious. The ability of the application to use machine learning to continually ""learn"" and adapt is a fundamental aspect of any AI program.


What is natural language processing?
Natural language processing is a key capability of AI. Consider the vast differences and nuances in written and oral language, and the varied ways humans ask questions and supply answers -- then multiply that across languages and dialects. Now add the computational power of today's machines that learn to understand text and spoken words and respond like people do.
A ready example is Amazon Alexa. Consider the following questions:

What is the temperature today?
How hot is it outside?
What's the temp?

All are variations of the same question that the AI is likely to respond to with the same correct answer: ""It is 86 degrees Fahrenheit outside now.""
Machines are getting smarter about nuances and better at assessing a speaker's intent or sentiment. Understanding subtleties of sarcasm or irony may be beyond what's necessary in evaluating resumes or applications, but it may have a place in video interviews.




How can AI be used in talent acquisition?
Here are 10 areas in which AI can benefit the talent acquisition process.


1. Job descriptions
Recruiters can't be expected to know everything about the nuances of job requisition language, especially new recruiters or recruiters for highly technical positions. What are the keywords in a given field that attract the most qualified responses? Which words unintentionally signal gender preference? This is where AI comes into play. Competitive talent acquisition products for several years have deployed intelligence that reviews linguistic choices and suggests alternatives. For example, if a recruiter is writing a req for a welder, and in their experience, all welders were male, the language may be unintentionally biased toward male applicants. The AI engine shouldn't have the same bias. As in all cases, it is necessary to apply a human eye to the results because if the AI data set consists only of male welders, the engine, looking at features that tend to surround welding skill, might conclude erroneously that other male traits are essential to being a proficient welder.


2. Job postings
CareerBuilder claims that its AI helps recruiters create job postings five times faster. The platform provides a candidate appeal score to help recruiters gauge how effective a post will be in attracting applicants, increasing applications by 175%, according to the company. A veteran in the hiring industry, CareerBuilder says its AI learns from data from more than 2.3 million job postings, 680 million unique profiles, 310 million resumes, 10 million job titles and 1.3 billion skills.
Recent AI tools can predict the salary range from a job posting that doesn't include salary data, potentially giving applicants more interview ammunition than recruiters intended.


3. Candidate sourcing
Starting with the wording of requirements in the job description, the AI engine can expand the search beyond the exact wording in the job post to related industry-specific language and terms. Unlike a simple word-matching algorithm, AI-enabled sourcing provides a semantic search by intent or meaning.
In addition, through the deep learning that permeates AI systems, the concept of skills adjacency is addressed. If a candidate knows how to do a certain thing, the software can infer the prerequisites of that skill or knowledge and determine the likelihood of the person having a similar but different skill, based on analysis of millions of data points. Candidate sourcing is thereby facilitated with a wider, more inclusive pool of candidates that humans may miss, and over time can answer such questions as the following:

What are the best sources of high-performing candidates who will stay on the job for more than two years?
What are the best sources of women who have been promoted into management positions?
What sources are yielding healthcare workers who can fill the position on day one?

When sourcing candidates or, later, evaluating them, AI has the ability to infer skills or interests from, for example, prior jobs held, volunteer positions or education. Because the program is always learning, it retains associations it can then apply in different recruitment scenarios. This can increase the possible positions within an organization for which the candidate or a current employee may be suited, even if they did not actually apply for them.


What is predictive analytics?
Predictive analytics uses predictive modeling to analyze patterns in data and create forecasts. Because AI engines can be fed big data -- millions and millions of data points -- they can report patterns that humans might take years to perceive. They can generate models to provide insights for business decisions and predict anomalies, for example, which is useful in product quality control and demand forecasting. Devoid of emotion, the engine can expose patterns and correlations that humans may miss or prefer to overlook. Prior history is only one input -- few in business want to recreate the past -- but combined with current data on trends and outcomes, AI-based predictive analytics can provide deep, relevant insights on which to base decisions and actions.




4. Applicant screening
In candidate screening, as in sourcing, the kinds of data from which a machine learning program can learn rules and patterns may be varied and include past or current employee resumes; competency or skill models that are tied to the specific industry or task; incoming resumes or records of employee success or longevity based on skills, education or even location. It may also include art or design portfolios, physical objects or electronic samples such as videos and games. External data sources such as national or international salary ranges, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics job classifications, etc., can also be fed into the ""brain"" that is AI. Machine learning can then help provide answers to questions such as ""What candidate traits correlate with long-term success in this position?"" Some firms use AI-powered games or video games to ascertain the fit between the candidate's personality or working preferences and the position.
Because candidates often want to apply to a company rather than a specific job, AI can recommend positions that are relevant to the skill set, education or soft skills of each candidate. It is also useful for recommending new positions or opportunities for current employees based on their skills, interests and aspirations.
This is a great advantage to both applicants and hiring companies. For example, a college graduate who might want to work for Microsoft can submit their resume and the AI-based talent acquisition tools can recommend the jobs for which they may be a likely candidate. In another scenario, if a non-degreed applicant is a gamer that a recruiter might reject out of hand (or perhaps never see their application at all), AI can look at non-traditional skills such as gaming and social media as applicable to a particular position. It is a huge time-saver for recruiters, hiring managers and candidates alike.


5. Skill assessment
Deep learning generally implies the use of vast neural networks, such as those Eightfold.ai uses: billions of profiles and global data points and over 1 million unique skills to provide data-driven insights about skills. With the goal of understanding an applicant's potential, Eightfold.ai helps companies identify the prevalence of capabilities on a global scale so they can find talent in particular locations. The software assesses a candidate's validated skills, likely adjacent skills, those that remain to be validated and missing skills. It's particularly important for reskilling for the AI to identify capability gaps in the workforce and find people with the best potential to fill them.





6. Bias mitigation
Many vendors employ AI in talent acquisition applications to alleviate bias in hiring and further diversity instead of perpetuating homogeneity in race, ethnicity, gender, gender preference, color, etc. An unbiased application can help eliminate bias arising from other characteristics that lead to discrimination, such as regional accents, perceived social standing and parental status. An AI tool is not going to be overly impressed with a beautiful resume layout or underwhelmed if a resume has a typo -- two things that can unconsciously influence human decisions.
Such smart programs evaluate job requisitions, postings and other written communications for gender-laden language. However, not all products purporting to use AI for talent acquisition are the same. If a company only uses its own historical data -- which is by definition limited -- biased output is likely to result. Successful applications that embed AI have access to deep-learning neural networks of external data with which to complement internal data sets.
Even so, recruiters have to be diligent in reviewing AI recommendations, as systemic bias in the past is not alleviated solely by using vast numbers of records. More than a few organizations have realized that the historical preponderance of white males still colors the AI-generated suggestions.


7. Online interviewing
In video interviews, AI can catch subtleties such as gestures and facial expressions that humans might not pay attention to and miss. Conversely, the tool can purposefully overlook mannerisms that the human interviewer may find distracting but which wouldn't impede the candidate's success in the job. Similarly, because AI can analyze huge volumes of data without fatigue, patterns may well emerge that would otherwise be overlooked by busy recruiters and hiring managers. It is this ability to make sense or find correlations in masses of information that makes AI such a valuable tool.
Not to be ignored is the ability of AI tools to look across calendars and manage interview scheduling, often one of the greatest sources of annoyance in the hiring process. Scheduling via AI can be less painful and more rewarding for everyone.



RPA is increasingly used for HR service tasks that are repetitive and labor intensive but have clearly defined rules.







8. Candidate experience
Robotic process automation (RPA) uses bots -- think Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri -- to replicate human actions in handling time-consuming questions and tasks. The increasingly widespread use of these natural language chatbots, some of which can understand and respond to both written and spoken input, is becoming de rigueur in human capital management software. Today's users are accustomed to bots as sources of information and direction and are used to interacting in natural language with bots in online and telephone transactions. Some recent studies show that younger people prefer interacting with a bot than a real person.
Hiring management platforms use chatbots to answer candidates' questions, guide them in timely choices and actions, and keep them informed of their status, while letting them know about new opportunities that might be good fits. In HR, bots are noted for their value in handling the repetitive questions employees tend to ask, such as ""What holidays does the company take off? How do I get proof of employment?"" As the number of people accustomed to chatbots increases, and as the bots get smarter, chatbot use lessens the number of escalations to humans that are required. In fact, Gartner anticipates that all future customer service will be conducted by bots. The same is likely true of candidate management.
Judicious use of bots in talent acquisition is an advantage because bots can respond to a candidate immediately and often in personalized ways. In response to the pervasive reliance on text messaging in recruiting conversations, tools such as HireVue and iCIMS' text engagement tools use NLP and machine learning to enable dual-conversation live chat and initiate intelligent text-based discussions, both of which are easy and convenient for the candidate. These applications understand people's natural inputs and ultimately improve feedback and predictions by learning over time. Their conversational interfaces can improve candidate engagement and personalize responses, and obviously, delivering bot-supplied answers in real time minimizes the need for human intervention. That saves time for the recruiter, the hiring manager and the candidate.
With intelligent bots, candidates often cannot tell they aren't dealing with a human. Today's smart bots, often referred to as digital assistants, can schedule interviews, respond in any language, walk candidates through video or text processes and provide encouragement if they get stuck in the application process. They are useful for career site chat, when a passive job seeker is just browsing a site, by calling attention to jobs of interest. The bot can embed employee video testimonials to further attract the potential applicant's interest.


What is RPA?
The word ""robot"" usually brings up images of Star Wars characters R2D2, C-3PO or the smooth-voiced Hal of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Today's factories and warehouses are heavily automated with robots used in production, picking and packing, and delivery. My personal favorite robot is a natural-language-aware barista in San Francisco that makes perfect lattes and cappuccinos without human intervention.
More commonly, though, RPA refers to software robots that handle repetitive and rule-based tasks. It generally uses structured data, and humans define the logic and rules. Today, such bots are everywhere on websites from banking to airlines, providing customer and candidate self-service. More sophisticated bots are likely to dominate all service in the future and human intervention or escalation will rarely be needed.




9. Economic advantages
The efficiency and speed of AI-enabled talent acquisition applications have positive cost benefits in that the AI engine never tires or takes a day off. CareerBuilder, for one, reports that its talent acquisition software has reduced the cost per candidate by as much as 50% since the product was rebuilt to employ AI. Chatbots allow recruiters to focus their talents in the bottom of the applicant funnel, a productivity boon. More expedient hiring, including improved time-to-fill and time-to-hire metrics, brings real cost savings to an organization. An empty seat is always an expensive proposition, and delays in responding to applicants is a sure way to lose them.


10. Onboarding
Employees feel most positive about their new position on the day they get the offer letter. Unfortunately, that high level of engagement can decline between offer acceptance and the first day on the job. Here is another major role for AI and bot-initiated communication. First, AI ""knows"" the forms that are necessary for what jobs in which locations, ensuring that the new hire gets the appropriate ones. Because all this can be done online with digital signatures, the tasks can be completed long before the first day at work. AI can also tell if the forms are complete and correct by spotting deviations in responses about age, Social Security number, addresses and the like and automatically requesting data verification or reentry.
As important, if not more, is the welcoming information for the new candidate. The hiring management program knows what location the person is working at or if they are working from home. Site-map simulations can walk the new hire through the building, showing them where to go on day one, where their office or cube is, where the cafeteria and restrooms are and where to get a badge or other ID. AI can automate requisition of the right materials and ensure that business cards are on the new employee's desk on the first day, a proven engagement technique. Bots with employee videos can introduce the new hire to other team members, all in the first few days after offer acceptance. Bots can answer FAQs of new hires, saving HR time and easing the employee's anxiety. Nevertheless, the welcome from the hiring manager, one would hope, is always real person to real person.


Summary
AI is ubiquitous in the new talent acquisition applications hitting the market. That it will make sourcing, screening and hiring easier and more efficient is clear. AI's applicability in HR and in all of business will be widespread, and organizations will be well served to create governance committees to oversee its use.
Because AI technology is in effect recommending, making choices and predicting, human vigilance remains necessary to ensure relevant data is being fed to the engine and that the output makes sense for the organization. Cathy O'Neil, author and data scientist, makes a compelling point in discussing the use of AI in decision-making: ""Algorithms are opinions embedded in code."" Those opinions are only good when they relate to the requirements of your business.

Artificial intelligence large language models used for writing and text-prediction are notoriously biased, but can be fine-tuned to become more inclusive.
Engineering and journalism researchers from the University of Southern California in the United States have teamed up to quantify and fix anti-queer bias in AI language models.
AI language models are capable of reading and writing text and predicting words in a sentence. But as most are trained by scraping text from the internet, they tend to repeat and amplify social biases. In fact as these models become more capable, their level of bias and toxicity increases.
Katy Felkner, a PhD student in computer science specialising in natural language processing says the problem of bias in language models is well documented.
“Large language models are very much a product of their training data. When the training data is scraped from the web with very minimal auditing, like most of the training data is today, you’re going to pick up a lot of the sort of nasty and hateful sentiments that are that are out there on the web.”
As part of the research, Felkner and team developed a new benchmark for measuring bias.

She says while there are generalised fairness measures available, there was limited research dealing with the issue of anti-queer and anti-trans bias in AI language models, and a lack of tailored benchmarks or metrics.
“I set out to do a more specific metric that would just address anti queer and anti trans bias but hopefully in a in a more nuanced and more holistic way.”
The project found that a popular model called BERT (short for bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) showed significant homophobic bias, measured through Felkner’s benchmark, which compares the likelihood that the model predicts heteronormative sentences versus sentences that include a queer relationship.
The team chose to focus on BERT as one of the first large language models to establish the power and potential of these technologies. There were practical reasons too as it was more accessible and practical to test and fine tune than other models.



By feeding more inclusive content like queer twitter and queer news, the research team successfully trained BERT to be less biased towards LGBTQI people.

The team was able to shift the bias score from 74% (using the off-the-shelf model) down to 55% through their fine-tuning.
She says the results mean that models “fine-tuned using our method are less likely to produce text that is toxic, harmful or mean, or homophobic or transphobic, and they are more likely to produce text that is is inclusive.”

This is important because large language models are increasingly driving other kinds of downstream applications, like job advertisements or clinical applications.
“As these models are getting better and better, people are encountering more AI generated, or partially AI generated text in their daily lives. And so we want to make sure that those models are not are not going to inadvertently produce harmful outputs.”

The project was presented by Felkner at the Queer in AI workshop at the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) conference and the team plans to publish a full conference paper.
For the next stage, the team hopes to crowd-source a wider set of perspectives from the queer community and audit more existing language models.

Is It Worth Learning A.I. and Machine Learning Skills Right Now?

Despite the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and machine learning, A.I. remains a relatively specialized job. The latest edition of CompTIA’s monthly jobs report shows only a few thousand postings for A.I.-related jobs in some of the biggest tech states (California, Texas, Washington, and so on). What does this mean for anyone interested in A.I. as a career?  
First, the CompTIA chart. If all the A.I.-related jobs seem concentrated in places like California, there’s a reason for that. These states boast massive tech hubs filled with a combination of tech giants and aggressive startups, and these companies have the resources to afford expensive A.I. talent (as well as the tech infrastructure needed for those specialists to do their jobs):   
  
Given the high degree of specialization, it’s not a shocker that A.I. jobs tend to draw high salaries. Last year, O’Reilly estimated the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. It’s also a profession likely to expand rapidly in coming years: According to Lightcast (formerly Emsi Burning Glass), which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, job postings requesting artificial intelligence skills will increase nearly 300 percent over the next two years.  
While the number of A.I. jobs remains relatively small, in other words, the need for A.I. skills in the context of other, “regular” technology jobs is much larger. According to Lightcast, some 142,346 job postings asked for artificial intelligence skills of some kind over the past 12 months. From data science to software development, there’s more emphasis on knowing everything from TensorFlow to how ML models work.    
And which jobs are asking for those A.I. skills? Let’s break it down:   
  
If you’re a data scientist or researcher, you’ll definitely want to study how A.I. can impact your workflow—the arc of your career might depend on it.

How we show up at home and at work sends a ripple of either positive or negative energy into the world we interact in. Research has shown that happiness is the precursor to success, not the result of success. Experts like Harvard researcher, Shawn Anchor, writes about his research on over 1,600 Harvard students and Fortune 500 companies world-wide in his acclaimed book, The Happiness Advantage, that further validated that Happiness First drives productivity, safety, and accelerates growth.


If you studied Old English which I did, you may recall reading Paradise Lost, by John Milton, written in 1667 which said, “The Mind has its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven.”

In other words, we become what we think and our outlook on life is a reflection of our own minds’ eye.

There is a business imperative to ensure happiness, from work and at home, is a strategic goal to develop healthy supply chains where ever there are human connections. Over 80% of supply chain disruptions/incidents happen with a human error and errors can increase 10X when people are angry or sad. These emotions are on tsunami like increases and the waves are increasing in intensity and impacting supply chain productivity —- everywhere — but how many board room director discussions or C suite discussions are measuring happiness daily - what if you could have an AI MRI vision across your control systems to identify and detect emotional health?

PROMOTED
This is the theme we will explore in this blog series - as Corporate Purpose will increasingly become more focus on happiness insights to manage risks.
Looking ahead, it is not conceivable that robotics and machine learning approaches will control all supply chain management control systems where there are no human connections. Although in less than 20 years, robots will increasingly become more mainstream. One only needs to follow Ford’s testing of DIGIT, a robot, to help make deliveries in self-driving cars, or Elon Musk’s Tesla robot designed to fetch tools, and perform dangerous repetitive tasks. Future supply chains will increasingly have robotic integrations and humans will be positioned for decision control(s) and higher order functions. In the meantime, our world is far from eliminating humans from supply chain logistics.
So what does happiness have to do with supply chain ecosystems?
First, it is important to understand that within our social context, we are living in that the happiness of humans in all countries globally is rapidly declining. Unhappiness is growing and the secondary impacts on the human condition are becoming more evident.

For example, there are very more human signs of increasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, and growing health concerns.
Here are some key facts to validate the decline of happiness:

1.) The Happiness Index Report (2022) reveals the steady increase of stress and rising rates of unhappiness over the past 15 years of data analysis.

2.) A Conference Board Survey found that only 45 % of workers surveyed were happy at their jobs, the lowest in 22 years of polling (2010 Research)
3.) Depression rates at 10x higher than they were since 1960. COVID-19 pandemic triggers 25% increase in prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide (WHO Research 2022)
4.) Forty-four percent of employees experienced a lot of daily stress in the previous day. While almost half of the world's workers felt the burden of stress, working women in the U.S. and Canada region were among the most stressed employees globally. (Global Workplace Report - 2022)
5.) The Misery Index (2022) tracks a combination of inflation and unemployment rates created by economist Arthur Okun has for example Canadian have the 6th worst Misery Index score (combined rates of inflation and unemployment) in 2021 out of 35 industrialized countries. The USA Misery Index rating due to increasing inflation rates are also plummeting.
6.) According to a paper in the American Economic Review called “Preferences over Inflation and Unemployment: Evidence from Surveys of Happiness unemployment causes 1.7 times as much misery as inflation.
7.) Between 1913 and 2020, the number of motor-vehicle deaths in the United States (which include all types of motor vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles) increased 831%, from 4,200 deaths in 1913 to 42,338 in 2020. However, the role cars play in daily life is vastly different now than when tracking began.In 1913, there were about 1.3 million vehicles and 2 million drivers, and the number of miles driven was not yet estimated. The latest 2020 data report 275.9 million vehicles, 228 million licensed drivers, and 2,904 billion miles driven annually (Injury Facts)
Impact of Unhappiness 
1.) Unhappy Employees Risk Customer Happiness - Inc. magazine research has validated that employee satisfaction is at an all-time low. About 40 % of American workers say their job is very or extremely stressful. According to a Gallup survey, eight in 10 Americans feel stressed during the day. About 40% say they lack the time to do what they want. Another survey conducted by Gallup reports that more than 20% of employees feel burned out at work. Heavy workloads, team conflicts, poor management and wage gaps all contribute to job dissatisfaction. If left unaddressed, these factors lower productivity and increase turnover rates. In addition, customers are impacted as when one is unhappy this manifests in employee’s patience with customers often more evident in their communication tonality. Also when an employee is sad, it is difficult to feel empathetic with customers, or listen attentively.
2.) Unhappy Employees Risk Job Satisfaction and as a result productivity declines, hostile work environments increase, etc. Unhappy, disgruntled employees can create a negative and stressful atmosphere in the workplace, which over time impacts the overall team productivity of team and in many cases creates a toxic work environment. A 2019 Deloitte survey revealed that only 49% of employees are satisfied with their jobs. The impact of low job satisfaction goes beyond high turnover rates. Employees are a company's biggest asset. If their expectations are not met, they may lack the motivation needed to reach peak performance and excel in their roles.
The Financial Performance Impact of Unhappiness
American companies lose $450 to $500 billion per year because of disengaged employees. Furthermore, replacing employees who quit their jobs costs 100 to 300% of their annual salary. As a manager, the best thing you can do is take a close look at these numbers and make the necessary changes to keep your staff engaged and motivated (Inc.) and The Gallop Poll.
The impact of job dissatisfaction in an organization shouldn't be taken lightly. According to Forbes, only 21% of employees are engaged at work. More than one-third of workers are planning to quit their jobs and find something better. They're doing just enough to receive their pay-checks, but they don't put in the time and effort to do their best work.
Forbes reports that disengaged employees are 15% less profitable and 18% less productive than those who are satisfied with their jobs. This kind of behavior costs companies thousands a year, affecting the bottom line. Job dissatisfaction also negatively affects job involvement and organizational commitment, reported in Frontiers in Psychology.
Job dissatisfaction may also foster bad habits in the workplace, notes the Society for Human Resource Management. Approximately 40% of employees who are unhappy with their jobs play pranks on their colleagues. Another 55% shop online, and 15% take naps while at work. Alcohol consumption and social media usage in the workplace are common, too. With the increase of employees working from home, these risks may also increase.
To put the magnitude of this issue in perspective, the same Gallup report cited earlier estimates that a full 50% of all employees are ""not engaged"" after just six months, and an additional 20% of employees ""actively disengaged,"" meaning they proactively look for ways to undermine employee morale and retention.
Conclusion
So when 70% of your employees are to some degree disengaged, I think it’s safe to say that board directors, C- Level leaders need to build a focused Happiness Supply Chain Ecosystem. I have been saying for some time that people are strategic assets and their happiness is one of the most important foundations to accelerate a company’s growth and sustainability. Happiness Economics is a correlation to productivity and growth.
Yet is happiness a daily conversation in organizations?
Already many businesses have put a Health first as a corporate priority and advanced Mindfulness programs - yet acknowledgment and celebration practices to boost employee engagement, and well being behaviours often are lacking. Most companies do a annual employee satisfaction rating - however once a year is hardly sufficient given the speed of change across complex supply chains and market dynamics.
There are many ways in small ways happiness health can multiply.
One opportunity to appreciate and practice more is that happiness germinates often from the most simplest and least expensive leadership behaviours - simply saying: Thank you everyday to put a smile on an employee’s face.
When you smile, your brain releases tiny molecules called neuropeptides to help fight off stress. Then other neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and endorphins come into play too. The endorphins act as a mild pain reliever, whereas the serotonin is an antidepressant. (Source: Health Benefits of Smiling)
A team of economists performed a study and found that “human happiness has large and positive causal effects on productivity. Positive emotions appear to invigorate human beings, while negative emotions have the opposite effect."" Another study linked decision-making, processing and learning to the release of dopamine triggered by happiness, so smiling can also make you a more creative and efficient worker.
According to research, 89 % of employees agree that employee recognition improves their experience.


It leads to positive business outcomes such as increased performance, a sense of belonging, improved alignment, and a sense of purpose.
Leaders are encouraged to recognize their employees on a regular basis, rather than just on one day of the year during an employee performance review.
However, this can only happen if employee recognition, acknowledgment becomes ingrained in a company's culture.


A smile is contagious as well,  one Swedish study suggests that we can’t help but react with a smile of our own smile when we see someone smiling.
A supply chain that starts everyday with a health and mood check in at the beginning of your day and the end of day, as emotions change, is what we will explore in our next blog on creating a Happiness Supply Chain Advantage. We will also identify all the connectors that can be wired into an organization supply chain ecosystem to ensure happiness is always front and center.
We simply cannot see year over year decreases in global happiness and ignore this increasingly new normal. We must accelerate sourcing leaders that are authentic, respectful of diversity and inclusiveness and value creating an organizational culture that values happiness and ensures it grows and is sustained.
Without happiness supply chain ecosystems carefully architected into process controls/checkpoints - growth, economic productivity gains will continue to erode.
So what are you doing everyday to increase your team’s happiness and reflect on your personal happiness heartbeat?

It can correct spelling, make financial investments, and even compose music; but it cannot alert someone to the fact that they have their t-shirt on inside out without being explicitly ”taught” to do so. More to the point, it cannot discern why this might be useful information to have. And yet a five-year-old, just beginning to dress herself, will notice and point out the white tag at the base of her father’s neck.Most researchers in the AI field are well aware that amid the numerous advances in deep neural networks, the gap between human intelligence and AI has not significantly narrowed, and solutions allowing for computationally efficient adaptive reasoning and decision-making in complex real-life environments remain elusive. Cognitive AI, that is intelligence that would allow machines to comprehend, learn and perform intellectual tasks similarly to humans, remains as elusive as ever. In this blog post, we will explore why this chasm exists and where AI research must go if we are to have any hope of crossing it.Why ‘Mr. AI’ Can’t Hold a JobHow great would it be to work side-by-side with an AI assistant that could shadow us throughout the day, picking up our slack? Imagine how wonderful it would be if the algorithms could truly unburden us humans from the “drudge” tasks of our workday so we could focus on the more strategic and/or creative aspects of our jobs? The problem is, with a partial exception for systems like GitHub Copilot, a fictional ‘Mr. AI’ based on current state-of-the-art would likely receive its pink slip before the workday’s end.For starters, Mr. AI is painfully forgetful, particularly when it comes to contextual memory. It also suffers from a crippling lack of attention. To some, this may seem surprising given the extraordinary large language models (LLM) of today, including LaMDA and GPT-3, which in some situations appear like they could well be conscious. However, even with the most advanced state-of-the-art deep learning models, Mr. AI’s work performance will invariably fall short of expectations. It doesn’t adapt well to changing environments and demands. It cannot independently ascertain that advice it provides is epistemologically and factually sound. It cannot even come up with a simple plan! And no matter how carefully engineered its social skills are, it’s bound to stumble in a highly dynamic world with complex social and ethical norms. It simply doesn’t have what it takes to thrive in a human world.But what is that?Four Key Properties of Advanced IntelligenceTo impart more human-like intelligence to machines, one must first explore what makes human intelligence distinct from many current (circa 2022) neural networks typically used in AI applications. One way of drawing such a distinction is through the following four properties:1. World ModelHumans naturally develop a “world model” that allows them to envision an endless number of short- and long-term “what if” scenarios that inform their decision-making and actions. AI models could become vastly more efficient with a similar capability, one that would allow them to simulate potential scenarios from beginning to end in a resource-efficient manner. An intelligent mechanism needs to model a complex environment with multiple interacting individual agents. An input-to-output mapping function (such as can be achieved with a complex feed-forward network), needs to “unroll” all the potential paths and interactions. The complexity of such an input-to-output unrolled model in a real-life environment would quickly explode in complexity, especially when accounting for tracking arbitrary duration of relevant history for each of the agents. In contrast, an intelligent mechanism that can model each of the factors and agents independently in a simulation environment, can evaluate numerous what-if future scenarios and grow the model by replicating copies of the actors, each with their knowable relevant history and behavior.Key to acquiring a world model with such capacity for simulation is the decoupling between the construction of the building blocks of the world model (an epistemic reasoning process) and their subsequent use in simulation of possible outcomes. The resulting “what-if” scenarios could then be compared in a way that remains consistent even if the simulation methodology changes over time. A special case example of such approach can be found in Digital Twins, where the machine is equipped (through self-learning or explicit design) with a model of its environment and can simulate the potential futures of various interactions.Figure 1. Digital Twin technology creates multifaceted models of complex actors in an interactive setting. Image credit: chesky via Adobe StockIntelligent beings and machines use models of the world (‘World Views’) to make sense of observations and assess potential futures to select the best course of action. In transitioning from a ‘generic’ large-scale setting (like replying to web queries) to direct interaction in a particular setting that includes multiple actors, the world model must be effectively scaled and customizable. A decoupled, modular, customizable approach is a logically different and far less complex architecture than one that attempts to simulate and reason all in a single “input-output function” step.2. Theory of Mind“Theory of mind” refers to a complex mental skill that has been defined by cognitive science as a capacity to understand and predict the actions and beliefs of another person by tracking that person’s attention and ascribing a mental state to them.In the simplest of terms, it is what we do when we attempt to read another person’s mind. We develop and use this skill throughout our lives to help us navigate our social interactions. It’s why we don’t remind our dieting co-worker of the giant plate of fresh chocolate chip cookies in the breakroom.We see traces of the theory of mind being used in AI applications such as chatbots that are uniquely attuned to the emotions of the customer they are serving, based on the reason they opened the chat, the language they are using, etc. However, performance metrics used to train such social chatbots — typically defined as conversation-turns per session, or CPS — merely train the model to maximize the attention from the human, and do not force the system to develop an explicit model of the human’s mind as measured by reasoning and planning tasks.Figure 2. AI system with Theory of Mind capability can modify its output based on end user needs and preferences. Image credit: Intel Labs.In a system that needs to interact with a particular set of individuals, theory of mind would require a more structured representation that is amenable to logical reasoning operations such as those employed in deductive and inductive reasoning, planning, inference of intent, and so on. Moreover, such a model would have to keep track of the varied behavioral profiles, be predictably updateable with the influx of new information and avoid relapsing into a previous model state.3. Continual learningWith some exceptions, the standard machine learning paradigm of today is batched, offline learning, potentially followed by fine-tuning to the specific task. The resulting models are therefore unable to extract useful long-term updates from the information they are being exposed to while deployed. Humans have no such limitation. They learn continuously and use this information to build cognitive models like world views and theories of mind. In fact, continual learning is what enables humans to maintain and update their mental models.The problem of continual learning (also dubbed lifelong and continuous learning) is now garnering much stronger interest in the AI research community, in part due to the practical demands brought by the advent of technologies like federated learning and workflows like medical data processing. An AI system that employs a world model of an environment it operates in, with theories of mind associated with the various agents in that environment, a continual learning capability would be critical to maintain and update historical and current state descriptors for each object and agent.While the industry’s need is very clear, much remains to be done. Specifically, solutions that enable continual learning of information to then be used for reasoning or planning are still in their nascency — and such solutions would be required to enable the model-building capabilities above.4. Late binding contextLate binding context refers to the combination of contextually specific (rather than generic) responses and utilizes the latest relevant information available at the time of query or decision. Contextual awareness embodies all the subtle nuances of human learning — it is the ‘who’, ‘why’, ‘when’ and ‘what’ that inform human decisions and behavior. It keeps humans from resorting to reasoning shortcuts and jumping to imprecise, generalized conclusions. Rather, contextual awareness allows us to build an adaptive set of behaviors tailored to the specific state of environment that needs to be addressed. Without this capability, our decision-making would be greatly impaired. Late binding context is also closely intertwined with continuous learning. For more information on late binding context please see the previous blog, Advancing Machine Intelligence: Why Context Is Everything.Human Cognition as a Roadmap to the Future of AIWithout the key cognitive capabilities listed above, many of the critical needs of human industry and society will not be met. There is therefore a fairly urgent need to apportion more research to the translation of human cognitive capabilities into AI functionality — in particular those properties that make it unique from current AI models. The four properties listed above are a starting point. They lay at the center of a complex web of human cognitive function and provide a path towards computationally efficient adaptive models that can be deployed in real-life multi-actor environments. As AI proliferates from centralized, homogenized large models to the multitude of uses that are integrated within socially complex settings, the next set of properties will need to emerge.ReferencesMitchell, M.

Picture by Alex Knight on Pexels23/08/2022 Reading time: 5 min  Listen  Precisely in order to avoid reaching that fatigue or stress that causes professionals to ‘burn out’ in their work, a new weapon has emerged. We are talking about an application that uses artificial intelligence to detect the cognitive load of workers at each moment of their working day This platform is the result of an international study involving the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), which began when a mixture of “stress and frenzy” at work was detected on a regular basis, which “often causes people to enter a feeling of mental fog”. The development of this platform, called MBioTracker, has been carried out by an international team of scientists from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, in Switzerland) and the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). It provides us with valuable information It consists of a physiological signal acquisition and processing system that incorporates new algorithms and processing methods to monitor cognitive load on the task. This provides valuable information for decision making and can provide for adaptive support for the worker. Researchers use technology to “detect and change” that state of mind that often arises in jobs that require above-average concentration and stress. That is, in high-risk, time-consuming or multi-tasking situations. To do this, a device is worn by the professional to collect data, such as sweating, heart rate or breathing, without interfering with his or her work. Example of the fire-fighter An example of this project is the case of fire-fighters, a profession exposed to situations of exhaustion, mental effort and continuous stress and, therefore, on certain occasions, these professionals may not make good use of tools and techniques, which could put their own life in great danger or that of other people.  As part of the platform’s development and determination of the level of exhaustion derived from the mental effort, a drone pilot, in this case a fire-fighter, was monitored in his task of searching for people in need of help during a forest fire.  After multiple experiments, the authors of this study report a “very satisfactory final system that is able to recognise episodes correctly in 76% of cases and can be autonomous for about fourteen hours”. AI, applicable to different professions This is a system that can be used for other less demanding tasks, such as jobs in heavy industry, where exhaustion during the workday can compromise a person’s safety.  According to its authors, it is a solution that can be applied to any job, with the aim of detecting “how a person is before they burn themselves out”, all thanks to Artificial Intelligence. In short, it is a device that collects data without interfering in the tasks the person performs, being able to monitor up to fourteen hours and find out how they are during their day, to prevent them from becoming so tired or stressed that it prevents them from being able to carry out their work normally. The support of digital tools The example of the MBioTracker platform is just another example of how Artificial Intelligence and Big Data can be used to train algorithms that predict talents and skills, monitor performance, set goals, assess results or show moods and emotions within the workplace. There is a large consensus among experts, according to various studies, that Artificial Intelligence is currently the most innovative area for managing work environments and their workers. This is illustrated by the fact that 40% of HR departments in companies large and small are using AI-enhanced applications.  While most of these companies are American, a growing number of European and Asian organisations are using Artificial Intelligence in their people management. The value of Artificial Intelligence in the workplace A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, “PwC’s Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution”, reveals that more and more global companies are coming to realise the value of Artificial Intelligence in workforce management.  It also highlights that 32% of staffing departments in technology and other companies are redesigning their organisations with the help of AI to optimise “adaptability and learning to better integrate insights from employee feedback and technology”. Meanwhile, an IBM paper, “IBM Talent Business Uses AI To Rethink The Modern Workforce”, highlights that half of the HR managers surveyed foresee and recognise the potential of technology in people management operations, as well as its usefulness in locating and developing talent. Deloitte, in its study “People analytics: Recalculating the route”, concludes that 71% of international companies consider HR analytics to be a top priority for their organisations. The pandemic and work The tough years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been so very present in our lives, have had an impact on all aspects of our lives and, among them, our work facet has been one of the most seriously affected. From the AI at Work Study 2020 report, prepared by Oracle and  Workplace Intelligence, we can extract different enlightening data on the changes that have taken place in people’s mentality and, in particular, in the binomial that is Artificial Intelligence and work. This study, which includes a survey of 14,639 employees, managers, HR leaders, and high-ranking executives in thirteen countries, was entitled “Back in Command: Employees use technology to take back control. Artificial intelligence (AI) as a key tool for career development’, indicating 85% want to rely on technology to define their future, and 82% believe that robots can further their career development more than humans.  In addition, 75% would implement changes in their lives based on robotic recommendations. And 87% of respondents believe that their company should do more to listen to their needs. The study’s findings indicate that workers rely on AI to help them advance their careers and other important milestones easily, yet only 47% of respondents say their organisation currently uses some form of AI in the workplace, and 31% say their company does not even talk about AI. The conclusion from these data is very clear. According to the AI at Work Study 2020, “it is a win-win for companies if they offer Artificial Intelligence to promote the career development and personal growth of their employees”.  Artificial IntelligenceRoboticsTechnological revolution #Word of the weekDigital transformationIndustrial digital transformation Digital transformation: examples What is reskilling and upskilling and how does it work?

That is, in high-risk, time-consuming or multi-tasking situations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo do this, a device is worn by the professional to collect data, such as sweating, heart rate or breathing, without interfering with his or her work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExample of the fire-fighter&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn example of this project is the case of fire-fighters, a profession exposed to situations of exhaustion, mental effort and continuous stress and, therefore, on certain occasions, these professionals may not make good use of tools and techniques, which could put their own life in great danger or that of other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs part of the platforms development and determination of the level of exhaustion derived from the mental effort, a drone pilot, in this case a fire-fighter, was monitored in his task of searching for people in need of help during a forest fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter multiple experiments, the authors of this study report a very satisfactory final system that is able to recognise episodes correctly in 76% of cases and can be autonomous for about fourteen hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAI, applicable to different professions&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is a system that can be used for other less demanding tasks, such as jobs in heavy industry, where exhaustion during the workday can compromise a persons safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to its authors, it is a solution that can be applied to any job, with the aim of detecting how a person is before they burn themselves out, all thanks to Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn short, it is a device that collects data without interfering in the tasks the person performs, being able to monitor up to fourteen hours and find out how they are during their day, to prevent them from becoming so tired or stressed that it prevents them from being able to carry out their work normally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe support of digital tools&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe example of the MBioTracker platform is just another example of how Artificial Intelligence and Big Data can be used to train algorithms that predict talents and skills, monitor performance, set goals, assess results or show moods and emotions within the workplace.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is a large consensus among experts, according to various studies, that Artificial Intelligence is currently the most innovative area for managing work environments and their workers. This is illustrated by the fact that 40% of HR departments in companies large and small are using AI-enhanced applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile most of these companies are American, a growing number of European and Asian organisations are using Artificial Intelligence in their people management.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe value of Artificial Intelligence in the workplace&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwCs Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution, reveals that more and more global companies are coming to realise the value of Artificial Intelligence in workforce management.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also highlights that 32% of staffing departments in technology and other companies are redesigning their organisations with the help of AI to optimise adaptability and learning to better integrate insights from employee feedback and technology.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an IBM paper, IBM Talent Business Uses AI To Rethink The Modern Workforce, highlights that half of the HR managers surveyed foresee and recognise the potential of technology in people management operations, as well as its usefulness in locating and developing talent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeloitte, in its study People analytics: Recalculating the route, concludes that 71% of international companies consider HR analytics to be a top priority for their organisations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pandemic and work&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe tough years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been so very present in our lives, have had an impact on all aspects of our lives and, among them, our work facet has been one of the most seriously affected.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom the AI at Work Study 2020 report, prepared by Oracle and&nbsp; Workplace Intelligence, we can extract different enlightening data on the changes that have taken place in peoples mentality and, in particular, in the binomial that is Artificial Intelligence and work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis study, which includes a survey of 14,639 employees, managers, HR leaders, and high-ranking executives in thirteen countries, was entitled Back in Command: Employees use technology to take back control. Artificial intelligence (AI) as a key tool for career development, indicating 85% want to rely on technology to define their future, and 82% believe that robots can further their career development more than humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, 75% would implement changes in their lives based on robotic recommendations. And 87% of respondents believe that their company should do more to listen to their needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe studys findings indicate that workers rely on AI to help them advance their careers and other important milestones easily, yet only 47% of respondents say their organisation currently uses some form of AI in the workplace, and 31% say their company does not even talk about AI.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conclusion from these data is very clear. According to the AI at Work Study 2020, it is a win-win for companies if they offer Artificial Intelligence to promote the career development and personal growth of their employees.&nbsp;'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/', 'url': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence and work, a binomial full of advantages\xa0 - Telefónica', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/pexels-alex-knight-2599244.jpg', 'datePublished': '2022-08-23T08:00:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2022-08-12T12:37:49+00:00', 'description': 'A professional who enjoys his or her job is essential for any company, and Artificial Intelligence has a lot to contribute to this', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-work-a-binomial-full-of-advantages/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/pexels-alex-knight-2599244.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/pexels-alex-knight-2599244.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 853, 'caption': 'Picture by Alex Knight on Pexels'}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#website', 'url': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/', 'name': 'Telefónica', 'description': 'Telefonica.com', 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#organization'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#organization', 'name': 'Telefónica', 'url': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#/schema/logo/image/', 'url': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/01/telefonica-logo.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/01/telefonica-logo.png', 'width': 500, 'height': 179, 'caption': 'Telefónica'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.telefonica.com/en/#/schema/logo/image/'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interview: Dr Hatim Abdulhussein on artificial intelligence in healthcare


                    August 24, 2022 7:00 am                






We were joined by Dr Hatim Abdulhussein for our latest interview. Hatim is National Clinical Lead for AI and Digital Media Workforce at the Directorate of Innovation, Digital and Transformation at Health Education England (HEE), in addition to his role as a GP.
Hatim shared some of the AI projects he is working on, his views on the adoption of AI in healthcare, the role of regulation and governance, and more.
To begin, Hatim introduced his role, his area of work and his interests.
By background I’m a GP, I work in a practice in North West London.
Over the last year and a half, I’ve been leading Health Education England’s Digital AI and Robotics in Education programme. The real aim of that programme was to learn from the findings of the Topol Review in 2019, around the emerging types of technologies that would impact the workforce within the next 20 years, and to deliver some of the recommendations around education and training for these technologies. Ultimately, if we have safe, ethical adoption of technology, then we can improve patient care.
My role is to understand what technologies are emerging and think about what the workforce impact might be from those technologies. When we talk about workforce impact, it’s about understanding how the way we work will change, and how we might need to change the skills that we have as a result of working with technology.
At the same time, it’s important to reflect on the technologies that we are already using in practice. As a GP, I now use a variety of technologies in my practice, from clinical triage tools to e-consultations to telemedicine tools. So what does that mean for me – how do I need to develop my skills in order to work with these technologies as effectively as possible? There’s still a gap in education and training processes and curricula in this area, so it’s about understanding how we can plug that gap. The first step is to understand what people need to know, what their learning needs are. That’s a key part of our work. Off the back of that, you can start to deliver education and training.
I got interested in this space because I’m very passionate about improving patient care. Technology is one aspect of how we can do that. But I have clearly seen throughout my career as a doctor that although projects can be handled with the best of intentions, workforce impact or workforce preparation aren’t always considered. A lot of the time, technology gets implemented but isn’t successful because that engagement work hasn’t been done.
There are different aspects to the responsibility here. It’s the responsibility of those who are making those decisions to implement technologies, to ensure that they have a good plan for workforce education and training. It’s also the responsibility of the healthcare professionals to ensure that they are digitally literate and able to engage appropriately with changing technologies. And it’s the responsibility of our educators to make sure that the necessary learning exists in the system for people to access.
That’s what drives me within this role, to bring all of those aspects together and best support our system to do that.
The role of AI
A lot of our focus has been on the workforce impact of AI technologies, and the policy towards how we develop the education strategy around AI.
In January, HEE published something called the AI roadmap, which is a stocktake of current AI technologies in the NHS in terms of self-reported data from various datasets like the State of the Nation survey and the Innovation Pipeline. That allows us to understand what technologies are out there and what taxonomy they sit in; for example, are they diagnostic or are they focused on service efficiency? Are they driven towards remote monitoring or population health? The roadmap helps us dig deeper to understand how they will affect the different types of workforce groups. We’ve done a couple of case studies to explore this, one in lung imaging and one on mental health wards, to really develop our understanding of how the technologies in question changed the way that people worked.
The roadmap has been well received, it provides a lot of clarity on the current spread of AI technologies within the NHS. It highlights where we need to go further and it also shows where we need to think more specifically about workforce preparation.
We followed the roadmap with a report called ‘Understanding healthcare workers’ confidence in AI’. That’s a really important piece of work because it allows us to start to etch out the challenges or the barriers that we need to overcome to get to a point where our healthcare workers are confident with AI. It talks about what will drive confidence in AI at a national level, at a local level and for individuals. That’s been a really interesting piece to do with different stakeholders, to bring their expertise together and enhance the conversation in this space. We hope to follow this up with a piece around educational needs as a result.
Education for clinicians 
We need to consider that there are different aspects to our clinical workforce that will have very different needs. Not everyone needs to be a data scientist or an expert in AI or digital health, but there are baseline educational needs that everyone does need to have to be able to work in a digitally thriving, transforming environment.
At the same time, we know that there is a significant shortage in the digital, data and technology workforce. Many of our clinicians who have interest in these areas would be pivotal to driving forward digital transformation in the NHS if they moved into some of these roles alongside their clinical work. So we have to think about how we can help that aspect of the workforce develop their skills in order to work towards more specialist roles around digital and technology. We need to think about what we can put in place to prepare that specialist workforce, and also how we can drive up that future career pipeline.
The aim is to have clear educational programmes that meet the needs for those disparate groups. That includes educational materials that are available for all, to increase your baseline knowledge, and educational materials and opportunities to help drive the careers of those who want to have more specialist roles in these areas.
We’ve seen some that already in terms of the NHS Digital Academy and the Digital Health Leadership Programme that sits within it, and the Topol Fellowship Programme, which I was involved with co-founding a few years ago. These programmes provide some steps in educating clinicians to become part of that specialist workforce.
The baseline skills education has a bit more of a gap, I think. Some of that will involve working with our educational bodies and stakeholders in those areas, to embed this learning into curricula. Perhaps the learning can be included in college or in higher education, to ensure that these skills are embedded as early as possible in people’s careers, so that when they are working in practice they are ready to work effectively with technology and they understand the core concepts around digital literacy and inclusion.
The adoption of AI in healthcare
There’s a fantastic report that was published by my colleagues at The Health Foundation called ‘Switched on’, which looks at public and NHS staff attitudes towards AI. The first thing this report found is that the more familiar a person is with the concepts of AI, the more likely they are to be positive about it. It also looks at different workforce groups and generally speaking, it found that most workforce groups attitudes tended to be negative when this research was done. But again, the more familiar workforce groups – for example, doctors and dentists – tended to be slightly more positive towards AI and data-driven technologies. So that clearly shows that there is a key piece of work that needs to be done around increasing understanding to drive familiarity and ultimately drive confidence and positivity around its adoption.
I think the biggest struggle is for people to see examples of AI in practice. Unless you see it being used, it’s still a term that feels a bit ‘pie in the sky’ for many people. That is really important in terms of being sure that we communicate where it is being adopted and how, and its impact. That will help people to understand that it is very much a real concept and it is being used in practice.
In terms of where it can be used, I think it can definitely help to plug some of the challenges that we have with our healthcare workforce and processes. As a GP, there are many things in my practice that could really benefit from support from AI and data-driven technologies. There are a lot of things that could be made more efficient and productive. AI could be a way to tackle those problems, from managing patient registrations to predicting disease to triaging consultations to the right person at the right time. It could help to free up time for our healthcare workforce to spend on direct patient care.
So if we can start to show some really clear use cases and highlight the benefits in terms of supporting the workforce, particularly in areas such as clinical effectiveness or service efficiency, then I think we should start to see more positive attitudes towards AI.
Regulation and governance 
I think our regulation and governance is absolutely fit for purpose. We have quite clear regulatory bodies here in the UK that have clear responsibilities; the infrastructure is there and there’s a strong understanding amongst these regulators that regulation and governance of AI and data-driven technologies is going to be key to healthcare services in the future.
I’m pleased to say that we’ve had really positive and collaborative experiences with the likes of NICE and MHRA. The work that’s been done to set up the multi-agency advisory service is excellent, because it really becomes a port of call for people to understand the current landscape of how you go about regulating an AI or data-driven technology, and what standards it needs to meet before it can be used in practice. This is useful both for those who are developing these technologies, and those who are implementing them.
I think there’s an understanding that this is important, that it needs to be present and clear, and it is supportive for the people who are trying to drive the uptake of AI in the NHS.
Of course, it’s at an early stage, so we need to be mindful of that. The technology is at an early stage too, and we’ve got some early use cases, so I’d say let’s move forwards with that, and make sure we move everything at the right pace.
Developing confidence in AI
In our report on healthcare confidence in AI, we talk about developing confidence on three levels.
The first level, on a national scale, is having that understanding that an AI technology has the right evidence base, has been looked at from a regulatory and standards perspective, and is robust enough to be used and be effective in practice.
The second layer of confidence is at a local level. At this level, you need to know that it is has that evidence base, but crucially, can that evidence be generalised to your population? We need to be especially careful of that with AI because it’s based on data and that data must be representational of the population that you serve, so local validation is extremely important. It’s also important to make sure that you have the system, culture and processes in place to be able to effectively locally implement something – being confident of those processes within your organisation is going to be key to driving clinician confidence.
The third level of confidence is individual – understanding the impact of the technology’s use on a person or patient. It’s about understanding the impact that the technology can have on your decision-making, the types of biases that you need to be aware of, and ensuring that the information the technology provides is adequately representational. You need to be confident that you can use it to make a decision safely. It’s also about understanding where the liability lies, when you’re using a technology like AI to support your own decision-making, so that you have that protection from a liability perspective.
Finally, there’s user experience. Is it easy to use, does it work well within your existing pathways? If these factors are achieved, then you are going to feel more confident with the technology.
Many thanks to Hatim for taking the time to share his thoughts.

In 2021 alone, $93.5 billion in private investment was poured into the field, more than double the figure of 2020. Women, however, are being left behind at every step of the artificial intelligence (AI) life cycle – the technology powering the digital transformation. This gender gap in AI is self-perpetuating. And it risks us being left with an economic and technological system with a massive underrepresentation of women. Have you read?3 women in AI who are helping bridge the gender equity gapWill AI make the gender gap in the workplace harder to close?We have to fight for a fairer tech industry for womenThe gender gap in AIWomen are not as “online” as men. The pandemic accelerated mobile internet adoption; however, women are 16% less likely than men to use mobile internet across low-and middle-income countries, according to the GSMA data.Then the disparity in the number of women versus men in industry 4.0 exacerbates the lack of entry points for women into tech.Have you read?What is 'Industry 4.0' and what will it mean for developing countries?This huge inequity is a problem that has seen no improvement over the past decade, with the share of female artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science PhDs stuck at 20%.These are pressing problems alone but also lead to ripple effects across the rest of the AI life cycle, particularly in innovation and development. As recent research by the World Economic Forum demonstrates, the percentage of male graduates in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is 400% higher than women graduates (8.2% versus 1.7%). The tech workforce continues to be dominated by men, with only a quarter of all tech jobs held by women and the majority of technical and leadership roles held by men. Specifically, women make up only 22% of AI professionals globally. Only 13.83% of AI paper authors are women, only 18% of authors at the leading AI conferences are women and just 2% of venture capital was directed towards start-ups founded by women in 2019. These numbers are an affront to key principles of diversity and inclusion. But the lack of female participation in this sector is also a detriment for the industry as a whole, which becomes more effective the more gender-diverse it is.COVID-19 threatens to exacerbate this trend further. Women in tech are twice as likely as men to have lost their jobs and 42% of women in tech say they took on most of the household work during the pandemic; therefore, the inequality women experience at work is compounded by the inequality they face at home.The lack of gender diversity in the workforce, the gender disparities in STEM education and the failure to contend with the uneven distribution of power and leadership in the AI sector are very concerning, as are gender biases in data sets and coded in AI algorithm products. These systems replicate patterns of gender bias in ways that can exacerbate the current gender divide by spreading and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.“The lack of gender diversity in the workforce, the gender disparities in STEM education and the failure to contend with the uneven distribution of power and leadership in the AI sector are very concerning, as are gender biases in data sets and coded in AI algorithm products.”— Gabriela I. Ramos Patiño, Assistant Director-General for the Social and Human Sciences, UNESCOAddressing systemic inequalityThe key challenge here is addressing the inequity at every stage of the life cycle. We must legislate equality and promote diversity to combat these issues effectively and efficiently. Concrete policy actions must be put in place to foster women and girls’ full participation in the digital sector while at the same time addressing the entrenched stereotypes and social norms that stubbornly lead to discrimination and even violence against women. Beyond national legislation, we need a global standard — a normative instrument to guide the development and use of AI to ensure that they work for the good of all individuals and particularly women and girls.UNESCO has taken on this challenge.At the request of its members, UNESCO developed the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the first such global standard-setting instrument for AI, which all 193 Member States adopted in November 2021. The recommendation lays the groundwork for a digital transformation that promotes human rights, human dignity, gender equality and environmental sustainability. It achieves this through an interrelated set of values, principles and policy actions to guide AI’s ethical development and use. Critically, the recommendation pushes governments to promote gender equality, the value of “ensuring diversity and inclusiveness” and the principle of “fairness and non-discrimination,” building the ethical ground for a gender-equality imperative in the digital era. Concrete actions to tackle this problem, as included in the recommendation, include: Dedicating funds from the public budgets linked to financing gender-related schemes.Ensuring that national digital policies include a gender action plan.Addressing the issue of wage and equal opportunities gaps at the workplace, which have been a major obstacle to women’s economic empowerment for decades.Encouraging female entrepreneurship, participation and engagement in all stages of the AI life cycle.Investing in targeted programmes to increase the opportunities for girls’ and women’s participation in STEM and ICT disciplines.Eradicating gender stereotyping and ensuring that discriminatory biases are not translated into the AI systems.UNESCO is also developing two innovative tools – Readiness Assessment Methodology and Ethical Impact Assessment – to ensure AI is used to advance the rights of all individuals, including women and girls. Today we stand at a crossroads: the choice between progress and replicating the physical world’s inequalities and discrimination in the digital world. Even though digital technology will become more widely available in the market, the digital gender gap has always existed and will continue to exist unless we change the gendered social norms. We cannot wait another 132 years to close the global gender gap as indicated in the Global Gender Gap Report 2022 and It is now the time for governments and international organizations to catch up to the rapidly expanding industry, especially now with the tools provided by UNESCO to bridge the gender gap in AI.We have an ethical imperative to close this gap and to ensure AI, the future of digital technology, helps to shape a more inclusive, equal and just world.Don't miss any update on Emerging TechnologiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesEquity, Diversity and InclusionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the use of computer systems and software to mimic intelligence, allowing for faster and more accurate processes. 
This field of computer science has come a long way over the past few years, with a growing number of industries now benefiting from it.
Radio broadcasting could be next, with developments in AI potentially affecting the way radio works.
Radio has faced a lot of competition over the decades, with many listeners moving to other platforms, including the recent trend of podcasts. Radio has had to innovate and keep up with trends in order to remain popular and in use. Artificial intelligence could be a way for the radio industry to continue to thrive and reach listeners all over the world.
 The use of traditional radio has diminished since the introduction of online radios, platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Prime Music, and podcasts, particularly among young people.
Despite this, radio is still a form of mass communication that has managed to grow its audience without losing its identity while preserving its conventional route.
How Does AI Work?
AI uses processing algorithms to work through large sets of data. The AI system is capable of studying this data and identifying patterns, learning from it and evaluating its own performance as it works. The longer it has to process data, the more it can learn and, ultimately, the more accurate it can become. You can learn more about this subject and how it can be applied by taking artificial intelligence online courses.
Unlike a human worker, AI doesn’t require breaks, and it’s capable of performing a large number of tasks in a very short space of time. This means it can quickly learn and process data, making analytical tasks much easier.
The goal of AI is to build computer systems that are capable of simulating human intelligence. This way, a computer system will be able to solve more complex problems and understand a wide range of concepts to better understand the data it processes. A wide range of different technologies are used to achieve this aim, and the field is advancing each year.
Using AI in Radio Broadcasting
AI has many different applications across a range of industries and may be used in radio broadcasting too. One potential application is in choosing the kind of music and content that listeners want to hear. While a human DJ can’t be replaced, an algorithm could take over as a producer, selecting the tracks that work best.
In fact, this technology is already in use. iHeartMedia makes use of algorithms to determine what music is played and what content combinations are scheduled. Despite this, the human producer still has the final say in what is broadcast. There are various AI and machine learning solutions that aid with the creation of musical compositions, but the quality of these works is arbitrary, and the audience's preferences must still be taken into consideration when choosing what to play.
Artificial intelligence could also be used to improve signal strength, making it easier for people to listen to their favourite radio shows no matter where they are. AI is used to create an algorithm that can modify the broadcasting strength in real-time in response to various aspects of the signal entering the transmitter.
The future of radio may look very different from today, with new innovations potentially changing how radio broadcasts work. The ultimate aim is to create a better experience for listeners, allowing them to enjoy their favourite broadcasts and bringing radio to a wider audience. AI could be the answer to a lot of problems, and its use in the radio broadcasting industry shouldn’t be overlooked.

AI scientists are studying the “emergent” abilities of large language models

This article is part of our coverage of the latest in AI research.
Large language models (LLMs) have become the center of attention and hype because of their seemingly magical abilities to produce long stretches of coherent text, do things they weren’t trained on, and engage (to some extent) in topics of conversation that were thought to be off-limits for computers.
But there is still a lot to be learned about the way LLMs work and don’t work. A new study by researchers at Google, Stanford University, DeepMind, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill explores novel tasks that LLMs can accomplish as they grow larger and are trained on more data.
The study sheds light on the relation between the scale of large language models and their “emergent” abilities.

What is emergence?
This new study is focused on emergence in the sense that has long been discussed in domains such as physics, biology, and computer science. In an essay titled, “More is Different” (PDF), Nobel laureate physicist Philip Anderson discussed the idea that quantitative changes can lead to qualitatively different and unexpected phenomena.
Inspired by Anderson’s work, Jacob Steinhardt, Professor at UC Berkeley, defined emergence as “when quantitative changes in a system result in qualitative changes in behavior.”
“Since we wanted to provide a more precise definition, we defined emergent abilities as abilities that are ‘not present in smaller models but are present in larger models,’” Rishi Bommasani, PhD student at Stanford University and co-author of the paper, told TechTalks.
To identify emergent abilities in large language models, the researchers looked for phase transitions, where below a certain threshold of scale, model performance is near-random, and beyond that threshold, performance is well above random.
“This distinguishes emergent abilities from abilities that smoothly improve with scale: it is much more difficult to predict when emergent abilities will arise,” Bommasani said.
Scale can be measured in different ways, including computation (FLOPs), model size (number of parameters), or data size. In their study, the researchers focus on computation and model size, but stress that “there is not a single proxy that adequately captures all aspects of scale.”
Emergent abilities in large language models


Large language models are an especially interesting case study because they have shown very clear signs of emergence. LLMs are very large transformer neural networks, often spanning across hundreds of billions of parameters, trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text data. They can be used for a wide range of tasks, including text generation, question answering, summarization, and more.





One of the interesting features of LLMs is their capacity for few-shot and zero-shot learning, the ability to perform tasks that were not included in their training examples. Few-shot learning in LLMs drew much attention with the introduction of OpenAI’s GPT-3 in 2020, and its extent and limits have been much studied since then.


In their study, the researchers tested several popular LLM families, including LaMDA, GPT-3, Gopher, Chinchilla, and PaLM. They chose several tasks from BIG-Bench, a crowd-sourced benchmark of over 200 tasks “that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models.” They also used challenges from TruthfulQA, Massive Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU), and Word in Context (WiC), all benchmarks that are designed to test the limits of LLMs in tackling complicated language tasks.
The researchers also took extra efforts to test the LLMs on multi-step reasoning, instruction following, and multi-step computation.
“GPT-3 is iconic in having introduced the truly distinctive first wave of emergent abilities in LMs with the now well-known few-shot prompting/in-context learning,” Bommasani said. “Here, a task can be specified in natural language with a description and maybe five or so examples of the input-output structure of the task, and the largest models (i.e., the 175B model) could do fairly well on some tasks. In other words, you needed much less task-specific data and could specify the task without having to do fine-tuning/gradient-based methods.”
The findings of the study show that scale is highly correlated with the emergence of new abilities. Each of the LLM families, which come in different sizes, show random or below-random performance on the tasks below a certain size. After that, they see a sudden jump in accuracy and continue to improve as the model grows larger.

Large language models show emergent abilities at scale, where performance on a task remains at random levels until the model’s size reaches a certain threshold. After that, performance jumps and starts to improve as the model grows larger.
“An interesting example is the Word in Context (WiC) benchmark of Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados (2019). On that benchmark, GPT-3 and Chinchilla basically get random one-shot performance but PaLM, which uses about 5x as many FLOPs, finally demonstrates performance well-above chance,” Bommasani said.
The reasons for emergent behavior in LLMs
The presence of emergent abilities in large language models shows that we can’t predict the capabilities of LLMs by extrapolating the performance of smaller scale models.
“Emergent few-shot prompted tasks are also unpredictable in the sense that these tasks are not explicitly included in pre-training, and we likely do not know the full scope of few-shot prompted tasks that language models can perform. The overall implication is that further scaling will likely endow even larger language models with new emergent abilities,” the researchers write.





However, one outstanding question is whether the models are really learning the knowledge required for these emerging skills. Some studies show that when a neural network provides correct results, it is often mapping inputs to output without learning causal relations, common sense, and other knowledge underlying the learned skill.


“In general, how LMs acquire capabilities/skills is not well understood at a conceptual level,” Bommasani said. “In broad strokes, I would say there is (i) evidence that models become more robust in some ways with scale, (ii) that even our best models are not robust/stable in critical ways that I would not expect to be resolved by scale, and (iii) the relationship overall between robustness/stability/causality and scale is not well-understood.”
In their paper, the researchers also discuss some of the limits of scale, including hardware and data bottlenecks. Moreover, they observe that some abilities might not even emerge with scale, including tasks that are far out of the distribution of the model’s training dataset. They also warn that once an ability emerges, there’s no guarantee that it will continue to improve with scale.
“I do not expect all desired behavior to be emergent, but I do expect there is more we will see as we scale (especially in regimes beyond the dense autoregressive Transformers that are text-only English-only),” Bommasani said. “At a higher level, I expect we will continue to see significant surprises in the foundation models paradigm for a while; the progress from Minerva on the MATH benchmark surprising professional forecasters is one concrete recent example.”
Exploring alternatives to scale

As the machine learning community moves toward creating larger language models, there’s growing concern that research and development on LLMs will be centralized within a few organizations that have the financial and computational resources to train and run the models. There have been several efforts to democratize LLMs by releasing open-source models or reducing the costs and technical overhead of training and running them.
In their paper, the researchers discuss some of the alternatives to scale, including fine-tuning smaller models on task-specific datasets. “Once an ability is discovered, further research may make the ability available for smaller scale models,” the authors write, referring to recent research on new fine-tuning methods to improve the accuracy of small-scale LLMs.





“As we continue to train ever-larger language models, lowering the scale threshold for emergent abilities will become more important for allowing research on such abilities to [become] available to the community broadly,” the researchers write.


“The benefits of scale, whether via emergence or not, may incentivize the concentration of resources that one could project will motivate/exacerbate the centralization of power,” Bommasani said. “Historically, it is clear that AI research has benefited immensely from collaboration across academia and industry with strong traditions of open science. In light of the resource-intensive nature of scaling, I believe these must persist with several complementary paths forward: (i) norms to govern access to existing models for researchers, (ii) open collaborations (e.g. BigScience, EleutherAI, Masakhane, ML Collective) to build new models supported by structural changes that support decentralization, (iii) structural resources to provide the necessary compute and data (e.g., the National Research Cloud in the US as a National AI Research Resource).”
What is certain is that large language models will remain a mainstay of machine learning research in the foreseeable future. And as they move into real-world applications, we need to continue studying their capabilities and limits.
“Emergent abilities of LLMs have had a significant impact on NLP, concretely shifting the research in the field to better understand and develop such abilities. They also have sociologically influenced the overall nature of NLP and AI, indicating scale is an important factor in current systems,” Bommasani said. “We should build shared understanding of these abilities as well explore the unrealized potential and ultimate limits of scale.”

I spent hours thinking up weird, funny and abstract prompts to feed the A.I. — “a 3-D rendering of a suburban home shaped like a croissant,” “an 1850s daguerreotype portrait of Kermit the Frog,” “a charcoal sketch of two penguins drinking wine in a Parisian bistro.” Within seconds, DALL-E 2 would spit out a handful of images depicting my request — often with jaw-dropping realism.Here, for example, is one of the images DALL-E 2 produced when I typed in “black-and-white vintage photograph of a 1920s mobster taking a selfie.” And how it rendered my request for a high-quality photograph of “a sailboat knitted out of blue yarn.”Image“Black-and-white vintage photograph of a 1920s mobster taking a selfie.”Credit...Generated by OpenAI's DALL-E 2Image“A sailboat knitted out of blue yarn.”Credit...Generated by OpenAI's DALL-E 2DALL-E 2 can also go more abstract. The illustration at the top of this article, for example, is what it generated when I asked for a rendering of “infinite joy.” (I liked this one so much I’m going to have it printed and framed for my wall.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat’s impressive about DALL-E 2 isn’t just the art it generates. It’s how it generates art. These aren’t composites made out of existing internet images — they’re wholly new creations made through a complex A.I. process known as “diffusion,” which starts with a random series of pixels and refines it repeatedly until it matches a given text description. And it’s improving quickly — DALL-E 2’s images are four times as detailed as the images generated by the original DALL-E, which was introduced only last year.DALL-E 2 got a lot of attention when it was announced this year, and rightfully so. It’s an impressive piece of technology with big implications for anyone who makes a living working with images — illustrators, graphic designers, photographers and so on. It also raises important questions about what all of this A.I.-generated art will be used for, and whether we need to worry about a surge in synthetic propaganda, hyper-realistic deepfakes or even nonconsensual pornography.But art is not the only area where artificial intelligence has been making major strides.Over the past 10 years — a period some A.I. researchers have begun referring to as a “golden decade” — there’s been a wave of progress in many areas of A.I. research, fueled by the rise of techniques like deep learning and the advent of specialized hardware for running huge, computationally intensive A.I. models.Some of that progress has been slow and steady — bigger models with more data and processing power behind them yielding slightly better results.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut other times, it feels more like the flick of a switch — impossible acts of magic suddenly becoming possible.Just five years ago, for example, the biggest story in the A.I. world was AlphaGo, a deep learning model built by Google’s DeepMind that could beat the best humans in the world at the board game Go. Training an A.I. to win Go tournaments was a fun party trick, but it wasn’t exactly the kind of progress most people care about.But last year, DeepMind’s AlphaFold — an A.I. system descended from the Go-playing one — did something truly profound. Using a deep neural network trained to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from their one-dimensional amino acid sequences, it essentially solved what’s known as the “protein-folding problem,” which had vexed molecular biologists for decades.ImageDeepMind announced that its A.I. system AlphaFold had made predictions for nearly all of the 200 million proteins known to exist.Credit...DeepMindThis summer, DeepMind announced that AlphaFold had made predictions for nearly all of the 200 million proteins known to exist — producing a treasure trove of data that will help medical researchers develop new drugs and vaccines for years to come. Last year, the journal Science recognized AlphaFold’s importance, naming it the biggest scientific breakthrough of the year.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOr look at what’s happening with A.I.-generated text.Only a few years ago, A.I. chatbots struggled even with rudimentary conversations — to say nothing of more difficult language-based tasks.But now, large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 are being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games. (I even used GPT-3 to write a book review for this paper last year — and, had I not clued in my editors beforehand, I doubt they would have suspected anything.)A.I. is writing code, too — more than a million people have signed up to use GitHub’s Copilot, a tool released last year that helps programmers work faster by automatically finishing their code snippets.Then there’s Google’s LaMDA, an A.I. model that made headlines a couple of months ago when Blake Lemoine, a senior Google engineer, was fired after claiming that it had become sentient.Google disputed Mr. Lemoine’s claims, and lots of A.I. researchers have quibbled with his conclusions. But take out the sentience part, and a weaker version of his argument — that LaMDA and other state-of-the-art language models are becoming eerily good at having humanlike text conversations — would not have raised nearly as many eyebrows.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn fact, many experts will tell you that A.I. is getting better at lots of things these days — even in areas, such as language and reasoning, where it once seemed that humans had the upper hand.“It feels like we’re going from spring to summer,” said Jack Clark, a co-chair of Stanford University’s annual A.I. Index Report. “In spring, you have these vague suggestions of progress, and little green shoots everywhere. Now, everything’s in bloom.”

Subscribe and listen.In the past, A.I. progress was mostly obvious only to insiders who kept up with the latest research papers and conference presentations. But recently, Mr. Clark said, even laypeople can sense the difference.“You used to look at A.I.-generated language and say, ‘Wow, it kind of wrote a sentence,’” Mr. Clark said. “And now you’re looking at stuff that’s A.I.-generated and saying, ‘This is really funny, I’m enjoying reading this,’ or ‘I had no idea this was even generated by A.I.’”ImageGoogle’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Big tech firms need to do a better job of explaining what they’re working on, without the P.R.Credit...Laura Morton for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere is still plenty of bad, broken A.I. out there, from racist chatbots to faulty automated driving systems that result in crashes and injury. And even when A.I. improves quickly, it often takes a while to filter down into products and services that people actually use. An A.I. breakthrough at Google or OpenAI today doesn’t mean that your Roomba will be able to write novels tomorrow.But the best A.I. systems are now so capable — and improving at such fast rates — that the conversation in Silicon Valley is starting to shift. Fewer experts are confidently predicting that we have years or even decades to prepare for a wave of world-changing A.I.; many now believe that major changes are right around the corner, for better or worse.Ajeya Cotra, a senior analyst with Open Philanthropy who studies A.I. risk, estimated two years ago that there was a 15 percent chance of “transformational A.I.” — which she and others have defined as A.I. that is good enough to usher in large-scale economic and societal changes, such as eliminating most white-collar knowledge jobs — emerging by 2036.But in a recent post, Ms. Cotra raised that to a 35 percent chance, citing the rapid improvement of systems like GPT-3.“A.I. systems can go from adorable and useless toys to very powerful products in a surprisingly short period of time,” Ms. Cotra told me. “People should take more seriously that A.I. could change things soon, and that could be really scary.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are, to be fair, plenty of skeptics who say claims of A.I. progress are overblown. They’ll tell you that A.I. is still nowhere close to becoming sentient, or replacing humans in a wide variety of jobs. They’ll say that models like GPT-3 and LaMDA are just glorified parrots, blindly regurgitating their training data, and that we’re still decades away from creating true A.G.I. — artificial general intelligence — that is capable of “thinking” for itself.There are also tech optimists who believe that A.I. progress is accelerating, and who want it to accelerate faster. Speeding A.I.’s rate of improvement, they believe, will give us new tools to cure diseases, colonize space and avert ecological disaster.I’m not asking you to take a side in this debate. All I’m saying is: You should be paying closer attention to the real, tangible developments that are fueling it.After all, A.I. that works doesn’t stay in a lab. It gets built into the social media apps we use every day, in the form of Facebook feed-ranking algorithms, YouTube recommendations and TikTok “For You” pages. It makes its way into weapons used by the military and software used by children in their classrooms. Banks use A.I. to determine who’s eligible for loans, and police departments use it to investigate crimes.Even if the skeptics are right, and A.I. doesn’t achieve human-level sentience for many years, it’s easy to see how systems like GPT-3, LaMDA and DALL-E 2 could become a powerful force in society. In a few years, the vast majority of the photos, videos and text we encounter on the internet could be A.I.-generated. Our online interactions could become stranger and more fraught, as we struggle to figure out which of our conversational partners are human and which are convincing bots. And tech-savvy propagandists could use the technology to churn out targeted misinformation on a vast scale, distorting the political process in ways we won’t see coming.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt’s a cliché, in the A.I. world, to say things like “we need to have a societal conversation about A.I. risk.” There are already plenty of Davos panels, TED talks, think tanks and A.I. ethics committees out there, sketching out contingency plans for a dystopian future.What’s missing is a shared, value-neutral way of talking about what today’s A.I. systems are actually capable of doing, and what specific risks and opportunities those capabilities present.I think three things could help here.First, regulators and politicians need to get up to speed.Because of how new many of these A.I. systems are, few public officials have any firsthand experience with tools like GPT-3 or DALL-E 2, nor do they grasp how quickly progress is happening at the A.I. frontier.We’ve seen a few efforts to close the gap — Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence recently held a three-day “A.I. boot camp” for congressional staff members, for example — but we need more politicians and regulators to take an interest in the technology. (And I don’t mean that they need to start stoking fears of an A.I. apocalypse, Andrew Yang-style. Even reading a book like Brian Christian’s “The Alignment Problem” or understanding a few basic details about how a model like GPT-3 works would represent enormous progress.)Otherwise, we could end up with a repeat of what happened with social media companies after the 2016 election — a collision of Silicon Valley power and Washington ignorance, which resulted in nothing but gridlock and testy hearings.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, big tech companies investing billions in A.I. development — the Googles, Metas and OpenAIs of the world — need to do a better job of explaining what they’re working on, without sugarcoating or soft-pedaling the risks. Right now, many of the biggest A.I. models are developed behind closed doors, using private data sets and tested only by internal teams. When information about them is made public, it’s often either watered down by corporate P.R. or buried in inscrutable scientific papers.Downplaying A.I. risks to avoid backlash may be a smart short-term strategy, but tech companies won’t survive long term if they’re seen as having a hidden A.I. agenda that’s at odds with the public interest. And if these companies won’t open up voluntarily, A.I. engineers should go around their bosses and talk directly to policymakers and journalists themselves.Third, the news media needs to do a better job of explaining A.I. progress to nonexperts. Too often, journalists — and I admit I’ve been a guilty party here — rely on outdated sci-fi shorthand to translate what’s happening in A.I. to a general audience. We sometimes compare large language models to Skynet and HAL 9000, and flatten promising machine learning breakthroughs to panicky “The robots are coming!” headlines that we think will resonate with readers. Occasionally, we betray our ignorance by illustrating articles about software-based A.I. models with photos of hardware-based factory robots — an error that is as inexplicable as slapping a photo of a BMW on a story about bicycles.In a broad sense, most people think about A.I. narrowly as it relates to us — Will it take my job? Is it better or worse than me at Skill X or Task Y? — rather than trying to understand all of the ways A.I. is evolving, and what that might mean for our future.I’ll do my part, by writing about A.I. in all its complexity and weirdness without resorting to hyperbole or Hollywood tropes. But we all need to start adjusting our mental models to make space for the new, incredible machines in our midst.Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Aug. 25, 2022, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

Parkinson’s disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it relies primarily on the appearance of motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness, but these symptoms often appear several years after the disease onset. Now, Dina Katabi, the Thuan (1990) and Nicole Pham Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT and principal investigator at MIT Jameel Clinic, and her team have developed an artificial intelligence model that can detect Parkinson’s just from reading a person’s breathing patterns.
The tool in question is a neural network, a series of connected algorithms that mimic the way a human brain works, capable of assessing whether someone has Parkinson’s from their nocturnal breathing — i.e., breathing patterns that occur while sleeping. The neural network, which was trained by MIT PhD student Yuzhe Yang and postdoc Yuan Yuan, is also able to discern the severity of someone’s Parkinson’s disease and track the progression of their disease over time. 
Yang is first author on a new paper describing the work, published today in Nature Medicine. Katabi, who is also an affiliate of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and director of the Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing, is the senior author. They are joined by Yuan and 12 colleagues from Rutgers University, the University of Rochester Medical Center, the Mayo Clinic, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston University College of Health and Rehabilition.
Over the years, researchers have investigated the potential of detecting Parkinson’s using cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging, but such methods are invasive, costly, and require access to specialized medical centers, making them unsuitable for frequent testing that could otherwise provide early diagnosis or continuous tracking of disease progression.
The MIT researchers demonstrated that the artificial intelligence assessment of Parkinson's can be done every night at home while the person is asleep and without touching their body. To do so, the team developed a device with the appearance of a home Wi-Fi router, but instead of providing internet access, the device emits radio signals, analyzes their reflections off the surrounding environment, and extracts the subject’s breathing patterns without any bodily contact. The breathing signal is then fed to the neural network to assess Parkinson’s in a passive manner, and there is zero effort needed from the patient and caregiver.
“A relationship between Parkinson’s and breathing was noted as early as 1817, in the work of Dr. James Parkinson. This motivated us to consider the potential of detecting the disease from one’s breathing without looking at movements,” Katabi says. “Some medical studies have shown that respiratory symptoms manifest years before motor symptoms, meaning that breathing attributes could be promising for risk assessment prior to Parkinson’s diagnosis.”
The fastest-growing neurological disease in the world, Parkinson’s is the second-most common neurological disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. In the United States alone, it afflicts over 1 million people and has an annual economic burden of $51.9 billion. The research team’s algorithm was tested on 7,687 individuals, including 757 Parkinson’s patients.
Katabi notes that the study has important implications for Parkinson’s drug development and clinical care. “In terms of drug development, the results can enable clinical trials with a significantly shorter duration and fewer participants, ultimately accelerating the development of new therapies. In terms of clinical care, the approach can help in the assessment of Parkinson’s patients in traditionally underserved communities, including those who live in rural areas and those with difficulty leaving home due to limited mobility or cognitive impairment,” she says.
“We’ve had no therapeutic breakthroughs this century, suggesting that our current approaches to evaluating new treatments is suboptimal,” says Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester and Parkinson’s specialist who co-authored the paper. Dorsey adds that the study is likely one of the largest sleep studies ever conducted on Parkinson’s. “We have very limited information about manifestations of the disease in their natural environment and [Katabi’s] device allows you to get objective, real-world assessments of how people are doing at home. The analogy I like to draw [of current Parkinson’s assessments] is a street lamp at night, and what we see from the street lamp is a very small segment … [Katabi’s] entirely contactless sensor helps us illuminate the darkness.”
This research was performed in collaboration with the University of Rochester, Mayo Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital, and is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, with partial support by the National Science Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.

Robots are becoming more ubiquitous in the workplace but that doesn’t mean people are accepting them.
In a new study by researchers with the University of Central Florida, workers in countries with greater amounts of income and social inequality were found to be more likely to perceive robots and artificial intelligence as job threats.
This means in countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, robots could be met with more open arms than in countries such as Spain or Greece, where there is more income inequality.
The study, which examined countries in Europe, was published recently in the journal Technology, Mind and Behavior.
The study focused on European countries, but study co-author Mindy Shoss, a professor in UCF’s Department of Psychology, says the findings could also help better understand the issue in America.
“The U.S. always ranks pretty high on inequality and societal inequality,” the researcher says. “Given that, I would suspect that there probably are, on average, similar negative views of AI and robot technology in the U.S.”
Shoss says that in highly unequal societies there are greater inequalities in income, health and education, as well as more attention given to where people stand on the social ladder. This leads to anxiety and uncertainty about income, status, and job security.
“Countries that have more people in unequal standing, on average, tend to see these technologies more as a threat,” she says.
The study used data from the regularly conducted Eurobarometer public opinion survey to examine if there was an association between workers viewing AI and robots as threats and country inequality. More than 13,000 respondents from 28 European Union member states were included in their analysis. The data were collected during March 2017.
The researchers found a positive association between income inequality, as operationalized by an economic measure known as the Gini index, and perceptions that AI and robots pose threats of general job loss.
Shoss, who studies organizational psychology, became interested in the research through her work with the hospitality industry and the technology that’s coming to that sector, such as service robots.
“We’re at this point in society where there are companies making AI and robotics and marketing them for the workforce,” Shoss says.
“There’s a lot of potential of these technologies to help make work better by doing dangerous tasks or giving people more flexibility, but there’s also some risk involved in these technologies,” she says. “And the implication from our research is that if you’re going to try to develop robots or AI technology in a highly unequal society, there might be more barriers to getting people to adopt that kind of technology.”
Shoss says that based on these findings, inequalities should be taken into account when designing and implementing technology, including addressing ways advanced technology could improve workers’ jobs or incomes, in order to increase acceptance.
Katherine Ciarlante ’19MS, a doctoral student in industrial and organizational psychology who earned her master’s in the same subject at UCF, was the study’s co-author.
The research was funded by the National Institute Occupational Safety and Health under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Shoss earned her doctoral degree in industrial and organizational psychology from the University of Houston. She joined UCF’s Department of Psychology, part of the College of Sciences, in 2015.

As defined by EY, intelligent automation (IA) refers to the integration of robotics with multiple components from different emerging technologies. These software robots operate as virtual employees, reliably automating manual, repetitive tasks at scale.EY adds that ""when robotic, intelligent, and autonomous systems are integrated, the result is intelligent automation, widening the scope of potential tasks and processes that can be automated. This powerful combination brings transformation across the whole spectrum of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of things.""Within the oil and gas sector, data-driven analytics are driving safety and productivity improvements, but businesses face an uphill challenge to implement automated artificial intelligence (AI) work flows based on a standardized data model in a manner that is integrated with standard work processes.Silos and data sets are seen as the main barriers within organizations and across the energy industry at large, which has led to such initiatives as the Open AI Energy Initiative (OAI), a first-of-its-kind open ecosystem of AI solutions involving Shell, C3 AI, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft.To add more perspective on this initiative, Dan Jeavons, Shell's data science general manager, who has led the initiative’s development, and Christophe Vaessen, Shell's general manager for commercial, EU, Middle East, and Africa, who leads commercialization efforts of Shell’s intellectual propertyto third parties, spoke about technological advancements in their industry.Vaessen told Shell.com, “Digital technology is a key enabler to facilitate the way we are doing business. As an energy company, we have to adapt to remain at the forefront of this transformation. The three previous industrial revolutions have demonstrated that not only the most advanced industries were successful but the ones that were able to partner, develop, and work together effectively were the ones that often stood out. In the OAI platform, we are building an open environment that enables all parties to work together toward a common ambition.”The OAI is an open platform where companies can plug in and commercialize their apps. This includes not only international oil companies but also different sectors, such as cement or mining companies, that are running large operations and looking for digital tools to help with predictive maintenance.As industrial facilities require robust and supportable applications, C3 AI provides a series of apps that provide predictive maintenance and reliability capabilities, while Microsoft provides the base platform.Jeavons added that Shell is “committed to working as part of an ecosystem—bringing multiple players together to move forward in the AI space because no one company can solve the world’s AI problems.”“Furthermore, speed is paramount. The energy transition is forcing us to change more quickly, and the digital transformation of society is also accelerating. Our view is that alliances are critical to accelerating our progress and enabling AI deployment at scale.”As founding members of the OAI, Shell takes a leading role in developing a curated ecosystem of integrated solutions and creating fair value exchange for the companies that build on top of the platform.“The nearest analog to what we’re trying to do with the OAI is to create an Apple App Store for the process industry,” Jeavons added.“We have a standardized data model based on open standards. We have a platform that creates consistency, scalability, and supportability to drive adoption. And, on top of that, we are aiming to build solutions that respect expertise and create fair value exchange.”Shell is focused on further developing predictive-maintenance solutions that can help plant operators take preemptive action to avoid shutdowns based on equipment failure, Vaessen said.“In the medium term, we would like to expand the offer by making it more integrated and include offerings to assist plant optimization, inspection, and sustainability. We want to bring in other elements in the value chain and, therefore, offer a full ecosystem for plant operations.“Partnership for the OAI will be incentivized by the solutions offered, and today, Shell is providing a first wave of solutions. As the platform gains more adopters, its offerings will increase over time. Through collaboration and sharing technology, we are aiming to build an ecosystem where adopters will, together, be developing a fully integrated solution,” Vaessen said.Read the full story here.

The use of artificial intelligence for health in the Africa Region
25th August 2022, Lomé, Togo

 

Background
In June 2021, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners from the Health Harmonization for African (HHA), convened an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technical workshop aimed at assessing the penetration of AI for Health and generating recommendations for the use of AI in health in the African region. The event was under the theme “Health Status Transformation and the Role of AI for health and pandemic preparedness in the African Context ”. This workshop was against the backdrop of the WHO global strategy on digital health  and the WHO AFRO Framework for Implementing the Global Strategy on Digital Health in The WHO African Region . The event brought together participants from Ministries of Health, Ministries of ICT, Academia, the private sector, and Non-Governmental Organizations. In the same year, WHO AFRO launched a digital health survey, which included an AI section. The survey was based on the 2015 WHO Global Observatory on eHealth. The WHO AFRO regional office also generated additional reference materials relevant to AI for health in the context of the African region.
In 2021, WHO headquarters released an AI guidance document entitled “Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health ”. The guidance document was developed to assist WHO Member States in implementing AI for health. WHO has also developed several training programmes aimed at raising AI and its application in health, including a recent course based on the WHO guidance on Ethics and Governance of AI.
It is recognized that the developed world is benefiting from more advanced analysis and use of data. Technologies like AI have the potential to offer new insights and tools to improve clinical decision-making and predictive analytics for health emergency preparedness, mitigate workforce shortages, tailor programs targeting areas of greatest need, improve forecasting of disease outbreaks, and bring efficiencies to health service delivery. Realizing the potential of digital health and AI to achieve development goals will require collaboratively addressing multiple challenges, including strengthening underlying digital infrastructure and digital health systems, working to improve data quality, responsible management and sharing of available data, and eventually trust and utilization of data to inform strategic planning.
Furthermore, the ITU and WHO, through various collaborative activities that include the Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for health , aimed to establish standardized assessment frameworks that can support the evaluation of AI-based methods for health and, through joint capacity-building programmes , have delivered training to enhance and strengthen digital skills for health.
Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented demand for digital technology-based solutions in screening populations, tracking infections, and minimizing direct human contact. Using different technologies at every step has brought efficiencies in tracking and tracing contacts, testing, and case management, to mention but a few. Most importantly, technology has played and continues to play a vital role in protecting medical personnel by limiting direct contact with patients, disinfecting controlled environments, and disseminating public health and emergency messages through telehealth. By leveraging the use of digital technology in Africa’s health sector, different health crises can be managed better, and health care systems can be strengthened through effective and more efficient digital mechanisms.
The African Context 
Africa is, in many ways, poised to make increased use of Digital and AI technologies due to the rapid increase of mobile phone coverage and use . However, significant gaps in the digital health ecosystems of many African countries remain that need to be addressed in order to orchestrate wider utilization and adoption of these technologies . Realizing the full potential of digital technology, including AI, requires strengthening the policy and the regulatory environment, system infrastructure, sustainable financing, security and workforce capacity, and diversity in the stakeholders involved in digital health and technology innovation. While it is critical that Africa is not left out of new advances, it is equally important to approach frontier technologies thoughtfully.
The Ministerial side event on the use of Artificial intelligence in the health sector in the African countries
Following the afore mentioned technical meeting on AI , together with various knowledge generation activities on AI conducted by the WHO AFRO and the USAID, the Regional Office (WHO AFRO) and the ITU, with support from the USAID, will be convening a ministerial side event on the use of AI for health, in the context of the African region. The ministerial side event will bring together high-level government policy-makers across Africa to discuss critical policy dimensions of strengthening the health system through AI and other relevant digital solutions. The meeting will lay the foundation for responsibly developing and adopting frontier technologies such as AI in health systems in Africa. The ministerial side event will take place along the sidelines of the 72nd WHO Regional Committee for Africa . 
Ministerial side event objectives
The objectives of the ministerial side event are to: 

Showcase AI-driven health solutions developed and implemented by the Member States in the African Region.
Identify concrete actions for shaping policy and enabling environments to foster digital technologies for accelerated improvements in health and related development programs.

Ministerial side event expected outputs
 The expected outputs of the Ministerial event include:

Commitments from Ministers of Health, Ministers of ICT, and all stakeholders to foster an enabling environment for the use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the health sector at the national level.
Enhanced adoption on the use of AI and other digital technologies to transform the health sector in the African Region.

Do I need to be an engineer or have a PhD to get a job in AI?Lack of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) talent or the “STEM pipeline issue” is often cited by the tech industry to explain away its lack of diversity without acknowledging the self-selection bias that’s pervasive in this male-dominated industry. Given the proliferation of coding camps and with AI narratives in the media dominated by tech bro’s, it’s easy to assume that all AI roles require engineering expertise or advanced degrees in STEM .While there is a clear need for more investment in critical fields like STEM where women and BIPOC have been historically underrepresented, there is also an urgent need to reduce the barriers for those from non-engineering and non-academic disciplines.As AI adoption grows across diverse industries and functional areas, it is creating new opportunities for those outside the tech bubble to build the future of AI.

One is that despite the hype, many companies are still in the “build and test” phase where they believe they need more technical expertise instead of governance or ethics-related expertise. Another reason is that the “newness” of these roles is leading many hiring managers/recruiters into assigning more value to advanced technical degrees while undervaluing the importance of multidisciplinary expertise and relevant industry experience, which filters out many qualified candidates in the process.The bottom line is this, if we are serious about building and deploying responsible AI solutions, we need to challenge our antiquated ideas about AI expertise and make it easier for with more talented folks with non-(stereo)typical backgrounds to join this space.If you currently work in and/or are recruiting for non-engineering roles in AI, leave a comment or reach out via email (DiversityinAI at gmail dot com).",http://schema.org,,NewsArticle,,Here are 12 AI Jobs that Don’t Require a PhD or an Engineering Degree,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*Rd9IZ3SLf5vJJ_qCd6dz9w.jpeg'],2022-08-23T17:07:43.190Z,2023-04-12T15:52:49.681Z,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mia Shah-Dand', 'url': 'https://miad.medium.com'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",https://becominghuman.ai/here-are-12-ai-jobs-that-dont-require-a-phd-or-an-engineering-degree-92dfdc3d925c,https://becominghuman.ai/here-are-12-ai-jobs-that-dont-require-a-phd-or-an-engineering-degree-92dfdc3d925c,,Here are 12 AI Jobs that Don’t Require a PhD or an Engineering Degree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-23T17:07:43.190Z,92dfdc3d925c,['Mia Shah-Dand'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. AI in Communication – A New Era?
The challenge: Email, SMS, social media and other online services have become indispensable. We are all bombarded with messages, information and advertising. We are no longer masters of our perception and suffer from distraction – increasingly even while we sleep. So we are slipping into an agitated society, where we become more and more agitated about what we perceive. The anxiety is fed by the filter and echo bubbles we build around ourselves to cope with the chaos. The problem is that these provide one-way information, making interpersonal communication difficult in the analogue age and almost impossible in the digital age.
The goal: To overcome this powerlessness in the digital age and to communicate successfully (more successfully), we need to become more digitally fit. This digital fitness will be so important in the future because we are increasingly outsourcing communication to applications that work with artificial intelligence.
Status quo: AI has already found its way into communications in a variety of ways. Privately, we know it from voice assistants on smartphones (e.g. SIRI) or in the home (e.g. Alexa).
But if you speak nonsense into the Alexa box, only nonsense comes out.
AI is generally understood as the ability of machines to mimic or imitate human behaviour. In the field of communications, cognitive AI, i.e. AI or Generative AI that is capable of imitating human behaviour, is most commonly used.
Opportunities for business: In business communications, however, AI is really taking off.
Five examples for business communication with AI

One example of this is speech analysis. By analyzing speech patterns, AI can detect whether a person is emotionally charged or not. This can be helpful in customer conversations, for example, to see whether the customer is satisfied or not. AI can also already be very helpful in translating speech. By analyzing speech patterns, it can detect and correct errors that a human would overlook.
In social networks, AI already plays a major role today. For example, chatbots are increasingly being used to interact with users. Here, too, speech analytics can be used to detect users’ moods and offer them appropriate help.
In marketing communications, it can be used to improve a chatbot’s voice output or make it easier to search for specific information. AI is also being used more and more in social networks, for example to play out personalized advertising. In this context, AI can be used both for content creation and for the analysis and targeting of communication measures.
The creation of personalized content is a key benefit that AI offers. By analyzing user behavior, AI can create content that is tailored to the exact needs of the user. Among other things, it can display messages or advertisements that are precisely tailored to the recipient’s interest.
AI also facilitates the segmentation of target groups and the targeting of communication measures. By analyzing data, companies can find out exactly which target group is interesting for which product or service. This enables companies to target their communication measures specifically at the relevant target groups and thus maximize their impact.

However, the risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence in communication should not be ignored.
2. What are the risks of AI in communication?
One of the greatest dangers is distortion of communication. Distortion is usually caused by a lack of information between the sender and receiver. No technology can help if the artificial intelligence only has one-way access to certain information.
Everyone knows an example of distorted communication from the analogue world. If I’m talking to my friend and he says something that hurts me, I might think he meant it. But in fact he might not have meant it at all. Maybe he was just teasing me. Or maybe he wasn’t in a good mood himself and I misinterpreted his words.
Another example of the distortion of communication in the digital world is the social networking site Facebook. On Facebook, people can create their own profile with all sorts of information about themselves, such as where they work, their favourite music or their political views. Other Facebook users can see this information and draw conclusions about the person. But people can also spread a lot of false information about themselves on Facebook, which can distort communication.
Digital communication is a process in which information is exchanged between many people. In a perfect world, these communication processes would run smoothly and without distortion. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect and communication suffers from distortion.
The most common type of distortion is called “semantic distortion”. This type of distortion occurs when the meaning of a message is misinterpreted. Another common problem is called ‘syntactic distortion’. This happens when a message is misunderstood because it is not phrased correctly.
3. This is how to develop your digital communication with AI
As with any other type of communication, there are some essential rules to follow when communicating digitally. These include:

Be clear and concise: When communicating digitally, it’s especially important to be clear and concise. Since you can’t talk face-to-face, misunderstandings can easily arise. So make sure your message is as clear as possible.
Listen: Good communication is a two-way process. Listening is at least as important as talking. Make sure you understand what the other person is saying before you respond. This will help avoid misunderstandings.
Stay calm: It’s easy to blow up and lose your temper when you’re arguing with someone. But it’s especially important to stay calm in digital communication. Avoid sending nasty or abusive messages – this will only escalate the conflict.
Stay empathetic: Be sensitive to the other person’s needs. Find out what he or she wants to know and focus your communication on that. Ask questions to get feedback and new ideas.
Practice digital fitness daily: Practice digital fitness on a regular basis. Keep up with the latest developments in the digital world and try out new tools and apps. This will keep you fit for the challenges of digital communication.
Personal Growth – Stay open to the world: Be open to criticism and suggestions. Take them seriously and rethink your own position. Be willing to change when it makes sense.

Remember: Change means finding solutions to problems.
4. Conclusion: AI opportunities harbor risks
All in all: AI in communication is one of the most important developments. It allows machines to have human conversations. This can be very useful for companies, for example by reducing the number of customer service representatives. AI in communication is also interesting for individuals, offering a new way to play with exchanges.
The outlook: In the future, it will continue to grow in importance and make many things possible that seem unimaginable today. However, AI in communications is not yet perfect. Nevertheless, AI in communications is already an exciting technology with a lot of potential. In the future, it will get even better and more people will be able to use it.
The most important thing? – People: But technology is only one side of the coin. The people, the users, also need to develop if they are to make effective use of the opportunities, whether privately or professionally. Technology is only a means to an end. It provides tools for practical applications and gives impetus to make current tasks more efficient and productive. But without human cognition, any technology remains soulless and interchangeable.

This trend has led to automating processes that used to be manually done by humans. An example is the usage of chatbots to respond to customers instead of living customer service agents. In most cases, AI implementation boosts efficiency and productivity, so its adoption will unlikely slow down soon. Web developers are also getting in on this trend as artificial intelligence makes their work easier and websites better..What Is Artificial Intelligence?.Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that makes computers simulate human intelligence to perform various tasks. Computers use machine learning and natural language processing to achieve this. This technology is so advanced that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between human and AI interactions. Artificial intelligence systems are built to learn and adapt to human inputs to solve problems..With machine learning, AI systems can improve their performance without receiving new instructions from the developer. Instead, the machine will learn new behaviors from all the data it receives and its interactions with them. Web developers use AI on websites to improve user experience. That is how social media sites personalize user feeds according to the accounts and posts they interact with..Additionally, AI helps web developers behind the scenes to build websites. Some software applications allow them to review page elements, find errors, troubleshoot problems, and optimize page performance. One of such applications is the Safari Web Inspector tool that iOS developers use with Corellium to debug web pages to be accessed via the Safari browser..Benefits of Developing Websites With AI Implementation.As implied earlier, AI can be used in different stages of web development. Here are some ways in which its implementation is beneficial:.1. Improved User Experience.AI can adapt to website user preferences and tailor content to suit their taste. Web developers implement this feature into websites so they can improve every user's experience. On social networks, AI generates suggestions on people or pages users can follow to improve their experience. Consequently, showing them the content they want to see would make them spend more time on the website..2. Better Search Results.Most websites have search features that help people find the information they need. Developers use AI to make websites display search results related to what the searcher wants. Different people might enter the same search query, but results may vary based on the data the AI system has gathered about the user. This data can be location, age, and interests..3. Effective Website Building.Designing websites from scratch can be tedious, but AI can make the process bearable. The backend of web pages contains many lines of code which might need periodic adjustments. Developers can scan the web pages with AI-based software during the building phase to detect and deal with errors. This will optimize the website for the device it will be viewed on..4. Efficient Marketing Strategy.Big data is valuable to e-commerce websites as it helps them conduct proper market analysis to understand customer demand. With AI, websites can find out what users will likely purchase and suggest that item. This feature increases conversions, boost sales and gives the website owner insight on how to improve their advertising efforts..5. Customized Online Store Experience.Similar to the above point, this is exclusive to e-commerce sites. Implementing AI allows the website to tailor product recommendations to user preferences. This allows the user to feel like the store was designed just for them..6. Enhanced Communication.Websites have different designs, and some can be difficult to navigate. AI, in the form of chatbots, has helped with this issue. Chatbots can act as customer support to assist all users who simultaneously visit a website without any delay. Machine learning allows these chatbots to improve their communication with website users over time..Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over Web Development?.This is unlikely to happen because human intelligence still supersedes computers. Also, human wants are diverse and insatiable, so AI might find it challenging to deal with every problem it encounters. However, it is a valuable addition to web development. It helps to simplify complex coding problems and suggest layouts to web designers. These allow websites to be developed faster..What Is the Future of Artificial Intelligence in Web Development?.The role of AI in web development is massive. Its prominence has created business opportunities that would not have otherwise existed. For example, ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft use AI to pair drivers and riders in real-time. Their machine learning algorithm can predict when there will be demand for the service, so drivers can use this information to maximize their income..Now, these companies are amongst the largest in the world. Many enterprises use artificial intelligence to gather online insights to improve their operations and surpass their competitors. With all these benefits, it is difficult to predict that AI will lose its prominence in web development. It is likely to be used more and improved over time..Endnote.Artificial Intelligence is significant to web development in many ways. It makes it easy for web developers to test their web pages while being built and improves the user experience on the website. They also support advertisement efforts as companies can collect valuable consumer data and structure their products or service offerings accordingly..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial intelligence jobs took the longest to fill across tech roles in the railway industry in Q2 2022 according to Railway Technology’s analysis of millions of online job advertisements.
Artificial intelligence job ads at these companies were online for an average of 47 days before being taken offline during the quarter, meaning they took 16 days longer to fill than an average job at the same companies.

The figure for Q2 2022 was an increase compared to the equivalent figure a year earlier, indicating that the required skillset for these roles has become harder to find in the past year.
Artificial intelligence is one of the topics that GlobalData, our parent company and from whom the data for this article is taken, have identified as being a key disruptive technology force facing companies in the coming years. Companies that excel and invest in these areas now are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges.

Mobile jobs took the second longest to fill on average at 32.5 days, while cloud came third among the tech themes tracked by GlobalData and which were linked to at least 100 job ads in the railway industry in each of the past five quarters.

At the other end of the scale cybersecurity related positions were the quickest to fill in the railway industry in Q2 2022 with positions closing during that period having been online for an average of 30 days.
GlobalData's job analytics database tracks the daily hiring patterns of thousands of companies across the world, drawing in jobs as they're posted and tagging them with additional layers of data on everything from the seniority of each position to whether a job is linked to wider industry trends.

Why are we entrusting its development to tech CEOs? - Salon,2022-08-27,Salon,https://www.salon.com,Human-level AI is a giant risk. Why are we entrusting its development to tech CEOs?,"Artificial General Intelligence, commentary, computer science, existential threats, Facebook, Machine learning","Tech CEOs are trying to create “Human-level AI.” Here’s what that means, and why we should fear it.","Tech CEOs are trying to create “Human-level AI.” Here’s what that means, and why we should fear it",Science & Health,,"


Technology companies are racing to develop human-level artificial intelligence, whose development poses one of the greatest risks to humanity. Last week, John Carmack, a software engineer and video game developer, announced that he has raised 20 million dollars to start Keen Technologies, a company devoted to building fully human-level AI. He is not the only one. There are currently 72 projects around the world focused on developing a human-level AI, also known as an AGI — meaning an AI which can do any cognitive task at least as well as humans can.
Many have raised concerns about the effects that even today's use of artificial intelligence, which is far from human-level, already has on our society. The rise of populism and the Capitol attack in the United States, the Tigray War in Ethiopia, increased violence against Kashmiri Muslims in India, and a genocide directed toward Rohingya in Myanmar, have all been linked to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms in social media. Social media sites employing these technologies showed a proclivity for showing hateful content to users because it identified such posts as popular and thus profitable for social media companies; this, in turn, caused egregious harm. This shows that even for current AI, deep concern for safety and ethics are crucial.Advertisement:
But the plan of cutting-edge tech entrepreneurs is now to build way more powerful human-level AI, which will have much larger effects on society. These effects could, in theory, be very positive: automating intelligence could for example release us from work that we prefer not to do. But the negative effects could be as large or even larger.

Would ""artificial superintelligence"" lead to the end of life on Earth?


Oxford academic Toby Ord spent close to a decade trying to quantify the risks of human extinction due to various causes, and summarized the results in a book aptly titled ""The Precipice."" Supervolcanoes, asteroids, and other natural causes, according to this rigorous academic work, have only a slight chance of leading to complete human extinction. Nuclear war, pandemics, and climate change rank somewhat higher. But what trumps this apocalyptic ranking exercise? You guessed it: human-level artificial intelligence.Advertisement:
And it's not just Ord who believes that full human-level AI, as opposed to today's relatively impotent vanilla version, could have extremely dire consequences. The late Stephen Hawking, tech CEOs such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates, and AI academics such as the University of California San Francisco's Stuart Russell, have all warned publicly that human-level AI could lead to nothing short of disaster, especially if developed without extreme caution and deep consideration of safety and ethics.
And who's now going to build this extremely dangerous technology? People like John Carmack, a proponent of ""hacker ethics"" who previously programmed kids' video games like ""Commander Keen."" Is Keen Technologies now going to build human-level AI with the same regard for safety? Asked on Twitter about the company's mission, Carmack replied ""AGI or bust, by way of Mad Science!""

A democratic society should not let tech CEOs determine the future of humanity without regard for ethics or safety.

Carmack's lack of concern for this kind of risk is nothing new. Before starting Keen Technologies, Carmack worked side by side with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, the company responsible for most of the harmful impacts of AI described earlier. Facebook applied technology to society without any regard for the consequences, fully in line with their motto ""Move fast and break things."" But if we are going to build human-level AI that way, the thing to be broken might be humanity.
In the interview with computer scientist Lex Fridman where Carmack announces his new AGI company, Carmack shows outright disdain for anything that restricts the unfettered development of technology and maximization of profit. According to Carmack, ""Most people with a vision are slightly less effective."" Regarding the ""AI ethics things,"" he says: ""I really stay away from any of those discussions or even really thinking about it."" People like Carmack and Zuckerberg might be good programmers, but are simply not wired to take the big picture into account.Advertisement:
If they can't, we must. A democratic society should not let tech CEOs determine the future of humanity without regard for ethics or safety. Therefore, we all have to inform ourselves about human-level AI, especially non-technologists. We have to reach a consensus on whether human-level AI indeed poses an existential threat to humanity, as most AI Safety and existential risk academics say. And we have to find out what to do about it, where some form of regulation seems inevitable. The fact that we don't know yet what manner of regulation would effectively reduce risk should not be a reason for regulators to not address the issue — but rather a reason to develop effective regulation with the highest priority. Nonprofits and academics can help in this process. Not doing anything — and thus letting people like Carmack and Zuckerberg determine the future for all of us — could very well lead to disaster.

US manufacturing is poised for a significant resurgence. The supply chain debacles caused by the pandemic have shown the weakness of an over-dependence on a long supply chain, especially one outside the US.

Further, the rising tensions with China have caused the US to question its dependence on Chinese manufacturing for economic success. These issues have changed the commitment of US manufacturing firms to build locally.

PROMOTED
The problem is—American manufacturing is critically short of the labor it needs to drive that revolution. There simply are not enough skilled workers to do the job, nor enough unskilled workers willing to learn.

Necessity truly is the mother of invention, however. The manufacturing labor shortage has paved the way for widespread deployment of some very exciting innovations in Artificial Intelligence for manufacturing. So potent are these developments that McKinskey predicts they will create some $3.7 trillion in value by 2025.

But before we get into it, let’s take a quick look at the labor crisis that is fomenting the revolution.

Even if every skilled worker in America was employed, there would still be 35% more unfilled job openings in the durable goods manufacturing sector than skilled workers capable of filling them. Deloitte predicts a shortage of more than two million American manufacturing workers by 2030, representing an opportunity cost of $1 trillion dollars per year.

Left unchecked, things will probably get worse, not better. There are still some 40 million Baby Boomers in the workforce—about 25% of the total workforce, many of whom in “old school” manufacturing roles. As Boomers retire, younger workers are avoiding manufacturing jobs in favor of technology, healthcare, and other opportunities where working conditions and compensation are more attractive.
The United States could quickly ramp up immigration from countries where workers are eager to obtain American employment, but that comes with its own set of challenges, and would require more political sorcery than I can imagine possible. Besides, employers may be wary of training new skilled labor only to see their operations shuttered once again during the next lockdown.
In order to keep the machines turning, American manufacturers need to find alternatives to human labor.
AI Can be a Big Part of the Labor Shortage Solution
Part of the solution to this problem, unsurprisingly, is Artificial Intelligence. As with other industries, it is inevitable that many formerly human jobs will be replaced with AI. But instead of worrying about jobs at risk from AI, in this case you should be thinking about how AI can help keep your operations running and your human staff employed.
Here are just a few of the ways that AI in Manufacturing will help mitigate the labor shortage and revolutionize how products are made on US soil:
Robotic Automation 
Robots have been used for decades in fields like automotive manufacturing and steelworks, where they have performed repetitive production floor operations such as heavy lifting and joint welding. However these conventional robots were designed only to execute very narrowly-defined tasks under extremely predictable circumstances.
Today, artificial intelligence applications like Siemens’ Simatic neural processing unit are empowering robot arms to grasp and manipulate objects regardless of their orientation, speed, or placement. That means that robots and “co-bots” (robotic assistants designed to work alongside humans) can be trained to perform a wide variety of assembly line work, just as humans do. Meanwhile, Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), armed with AI functions like mapping, surface anomaly detection, and object avoidance technology, can transport parts and finished goods through warehouses and factory floors in place of loading crews and forklift operators.
Together, these AI-powered robotic innovations can save at least 75% of the labor costs of using humans alone, enable 24 hour continuous production, and help avoid injury from assembly line dangers, heavy materials handling, and repetitive movements. It is no wonder that modern robotics is already driving a reversal of manufacturing fortunes in places like Singapore and South Korea. Why not do the same in the United States?
Additive Manufacturing 
Another area where AI is helping to alleviate the manufacturing labor shortage is in 3D printing. According to the conventional approach, highly-skilled designers and engineers must leverage years of experience and a “best guess” approach to arrive at the best design solution. But AI now empowers a rapid, generative approach to developing complex and highly optimized design solutions that can be produced quickly through 3D printing.
Machine learning in software systems like Autodesk’s Netfabb, for instance, allow manufacturers to input design parameters and request the most efficient, effective, and manufacturable options. Once a design is selected, AI from companies like NNAISENCE use neural networks and digital twins  to predict, monitor, and eliminate defects in the additive manufacturing process, helping to avoid costly delays and mistakes. AI software like Intellegens’ Alchemite can even be used to imagine new and exotic materials suitable for specific manufacturing and product usage needs.
Were all of these incredibly complex functions to be performed by humans alone, they would require much larger teams of highly-skilled engineers and designers, and would often result in inferior results.
Machine Vision
When you picture a manufacturing assembly line, you probably first envision a conveyor belt of products being whisked from one station to the next, whereupon human workers inspect products as they make their way along. In most manufacturing environments, that really isn’t far off from the truth. It is repetitive, labor intensive, and error-prone work, but it is vital to the quality assurance process.
Enter Autonomous Machine Vision (AMV), led by AI companies like Inspekto and Matroid. Using cameras and AI that recognizes the shape, orientation, and condition of assembly line products under various lighting conditions, AMV systems can count and track items, spot defects, and sort products accordingly, as they race by. This eliminates much of the need for human eyes and hands in the QA process.
Machine vision can also be used to support packing, palletization, and cargo loading, saving labor, time and money. Solutions from companies like RobitIQ and Spiroflow can determine the optimal palletizing method, for instance, whereupon a robotic arm grips and places cartons on pallets automatically.
Production Optimization 
When production machines go down, it often requires specialized analysis and repair agents, often dispatched from the maker, costing time and money. Not only can AI from providers like Vanti and 3DS be used to monitor machine and mold wear so that preventative maintenance can be scheduled for an optimal time, but it can also monitor temperature, humidity, and running variances for different products and materials, so that production machines can be optimized based on current conditions.
When something does go wrong, AI can analyze all of the possible reasons and propose the best probable course of action. That’s something that only a highly experienced human maintenance engineer can do in most factories.
But it isn’t just about maintenance and damage control. AI-powered cloud and edge systems like GE’s Brilliant Manufacturing Suite and Siemens’ Mindsphere are working to connect and manage the entire end-to-end manufacturing process from design to demand planning and material inventory, to energy consumption to endgame logistics.
The Need for AI in Manufacturing is Even Greater Than You Think
Imagine anthropomorphic robots with such a broad range of physical function and AI-powered adaptability that they will be able to do almost any manual labor that humans can currently do. When that happens, what difference will the cost of labor in developing countries make as a competitive advantage? AI-powered manufacturers won’t have to recruit and train nearly as many workers. They will worry less about the next pandemic and lockdown. They will avoid many of the single-source challenges that came along with our current supply chain management crisis. And much more.
As Artificial Intelligence systems are exposed to more and more data, they will continually improve, creating a flywheel effect that will put you right out of business if you miss the train. However, this revolution also has the unique power to wholly rejuvenate American manufacturing, perhaps even making it once again amongst the most competitive in the world.
The AI manufacturing revolution is happening right now, not at some unimaginable point on the horizon. This labor crisis is not a passing annoyance. It is part of the new business landscape that we should expect for years to come. Manufacturers who position AI as the key driver of their success will reap the benefits within our current decade.

When Alan Turing came up with the Turing Test in 1950, it was a test of a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Turing proposed that a computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence (AI) if it can create human-like responses to questions.
Thanks to large language models, we’re now at the point where computers can write text on just about any subject we give them — and for the most part, it’s very convincing and human-like.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Tell it to write a sentence on, “Why does Elon Musk like to knit?” and what it outputs is arguably as good as what any human could write:
Some possible reasons why Elon Musk might enjoy knitting could include the fact that it is a relaxing and meditative activity that can help to clear one's mind, and it also allows for a great deal of creativity and self-expression.
Additionally, knitting can be a very social activity, and Elon Musk may enjoy the opportunity to chat and connect with other knitters.

Summarizing complex text
Examples like this are fun, but the bigger value proposition of using large language models is less about writing wacky prose and more about the summarization of complex text. These use cases are exciting across industries. For instance, AI can distill information about potential prospects for sales intelligence purposes, or it can summarize investment documents in finance. 
However, what I’m particularly interested in is summarizing scientific papers for researchers.
The problem is there is an overload of research being published around the world. More than 4.2 million academic research papers were published in 2020. Even within specialized fields of research, there are hundreds of papers published every year — how can a researcher keep on top of it all while pursuing their own research? A paper’s abstract only hints at the research detail within.
When Meta recently open-sourced its language model, OPT-175B, it sounded promising for academic researchers. It’s said to offer better performance than OpenAI’s GPT-3 and uses just 15% of GPT-3’s compute resources to train it.
Putting models to the test
So how does Meta perform on scientific research?
We tested it first on a technical press release, and this was the summary we received:
​​Forward Looking Statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Artelo undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Investor Relations Contact:
Westwicke Partners on behalf of Artelo Biosciences
Mike Piccinino, CFA
It’s not a great start. The model focuses on the investor legalese at the end of the press release, calculating that it is the most important information reader’s need to know. You might argue that it is important, but it’s not what we’re looking for. The investor contact isn’t even correct, it was fabricated by the model!
Next, we tried it on a paper from the Journal of Electronic Materials:
Journal of ELECTRONIC MATERIALS, Vol. 38, No. 7, 2009 DOI: 10.1007/s11664-009-0701-y (cid:1) 2009 TMS Special Issue Paper thermally. The samples were then pulverized and analyzed by XRD, TGA, and XPS. The XRD patterns showed that CaCo2O4+d crystallizes as a calcium-ferrite-type structure, which consists of a corner- and edge- shared CoO6 octahedron network including one-dimensional double chains. The CaCo2O4+d phase has a ﬁnite density of states at the Fermi level. The XPS results showed that CaCo2O4+d has a composition of CaCo2O4+d = (Ca2CoO3)0.62CoO2. The XPS results also showed that CaCo2O4+d has

[Source: Meta OPT-175B]advertisement
At first glance, it appears to have important information, but there’s clearly superfluous information such as the details of the paper that aren’t important to the summary, and I’d more accurately describe the result as paraphrasing a part of the text rather than summarizing all aspects of it.
Small-scale models outperform
So how does a smaller language model compare? Through experience in the field, we designed our Iris.ai IPG model to have just 25 million parameters — as opposed to 175 billion from Meta and OpenAI — but trained it on millions of domain-specific scientific articles. Our research has shown that this model performs very differently on the same paper:
Metallic temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient s with a large thermoelectric power (s=151lv/kat387k) has a finite density of states at the fermi level. In this paper, we report the crystal structure and physical properties of caco2o4+d. We find a new compound caco2o4+d, which exhibits a large thermoelectric power, even though it has a finite density of states at the fermi level. Motivated by the simple guiding principle mentioned previously, we searched for new phases thermoelectric properties related as a thermoelectric material applicable to high-temperature use.

[Source: Iris.ai IPG]advertisement
You can see the sentence structure is slightly more simplistic than a large language model, but the information is much more relevant. What’s more, the computational costs to generate that news article summary is less than $0.23. To do the same on OPT-175 would cost about $180.
The container ships of AI models
You’d assume that large language models backed with enormous computational power, such as OPT-175B would be able to process the same information faster and to a higher quality. But where the model falls down is in specific domain knowledge. It doesn’t understand the structure of a research paper, it doesn’t know what information is important, and it doesn’t understand chemical formulas. It’s not the model’s fault — it simply hasn’t been trained on this information.
The solution, therefore, is to just train the GPT model on materials papers, right?
To some extent, yes. If we can train a GPT model on materials papers, then it’ll do a good job of summarizing them, but large language models are — by their nature — large. They are the proverbial container ships of AI models — it’s very difficult to change their direction. This means to evolve the model with reinforcement learning needs hundreds of thousands of materials papers. And this is a problem — this volume of papers simply doesn’t exist to train the model. Yes, data can be fabricated (as it often is in AI), but this reduces the quality of the outputs — GPT’s strength comes from the variety of data it’s trained on.
Revolutionizing the ‘how’
This is why smaller language models work better. Natural language processing (NLP) has been around for years, and although GPT models have hit the headlines, the sophistication of smaller NLP models is improving all the time. 
After all, a model trained on 175 billion parameters is always going to be difficult to handle, but a model using 30 to 40 million parameters is much more maneuverable for domain-specific text. The additional benefit is that it will use less computational power, so it costs a lot less to run, too.
From a scientific research point of view, which is what interests me most, AI is going to accelerate the potential for researchers — both in academia and in industry. The current pace of publishing produces an inaccessible amount of research, which drains academics’ time and companies’ resources. 
The way we designed Iris.ai’s IPG model reflects my belief that certain models provide the opportunity not just to revolutionize what we study or how quickly we study it, but also how we approach different disciplines of scientific research as a whole. They give talented minds significantly more time and resources to collaborate and generate value. 
This potential for every researcher to harness the world’s research drives me forward.

AI hiring tools can automate almost every step of the recruiting and hiring process, dramatically reducing the burden on HR teams.
But they can also amplify innate bias against protected groups that may be underrepresented in the company. Bias in hiring can also reduce the pool of available candidates and put companies at risk of not complying with government regulations.







Amazon was an early pioneer in using AI to improve its hiring process in 2018. The company made a concerted effort to weed out information about protected groups, but despite its best efforts, Amazon decided to terminate the program after discovering bias in hiring recommendations. 

What is AI bias and how can it impact hiring and recruitment?
AI bias denotes any way that AI and data analytics tools can perpetuate or amplify bias. This can take many forms, the most common being increasing the ratio of a particular sex, race, religion or sexual orientation. Another form may be differences in hiring offers that increase disparities of income across different groups. The most common form of bias in AI comes from the historical data used to train the algorithms. Even when teams make efforts to ignore specific differences, AI inadvertently gets trained on biases hidden in the data.
""Every system that involves human beings is biased in some way, because as a species we are inherently biased,"" said Donncha Carroll, a partner in the revenue growth practice of Axiom Consulting Partners who leads its data science center of excellence. ""We make decisions based on what we have seen, what we have observed and how we perceive the world to be. Algorithms are trained on data and if human judgment is captured in the historical record, then there is a very real risk that bias will be enshrined in the algorithm itself.""

Bias can also be introduced in how the algorithm is designed, and how people interpret AI outputs. It can also arise from including data elements such as income that are associated with biased outcomes or insufficient data on successful members of protected groups.



Recruiters and their AI hiring tools are both held accountable for violating these anti-discrimination laws and guidelines.







Examples of AI bias in hiring
Bias can get introduced in the sourcing, screening, selection and offer phases of the hiring pipeline.
In the sourcing stage, hiring teams may use AI to decide where and how to post job announcements. Various sites may cater more to different groups than others, which can add bias to the pool of potential candidates. AI may also recommend different ways to word job offers that may encourage or discourage different groups. If a sourcing app notices that recruiters reach out to candidates from some platforms more than others, it may favor placing more ads on those sites, which could amplify recruiter bias. Teams may also inadvertently include coded language, like ""ambitious"" or ""confident leader,"" that has greater appeal to privileged groups.
In the screening phase, resume analytics or chat applications may use certain information to weed out potential candidates that may also be indirectly associated with a protected class. They may look for characteristics the algorithm associates with productivity or success, such as gaps between jobs. Other tools may analyze how candidates perform in a video interview, which may amplify bias toward specific cultural groups. Examples include sports that are more often played by particular sexes and races or extracurricular activities more often undertaken by the wealthy.
In the selection phase, AI algorithms might recommend some candidates over others by using similarly biased metrics.
Once a candidate has been selected, the firm needs to make a hiring offer. AI algorithms can analyze a candidate's previous job roles to make an offer the candidate is likely to accept. These tools can amplify existing disparities in starting and career salaries across gender, racial and other differences.



Government and legal concerns
Government organizations like the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have traditionally focused on penalizing deliberate bias under civil rights laws. Recent EEOC statistics suggest that the jobless rate is significantly higher for Blacks, Asians and Hispanics compared to whites. There are also significantly more long-term unemployed job seekers age 55 and over compared to younger ones.

Katherine Jones on AI hype

Last year the EEOC and the U.S. Department of Justice published new guidance on steps companies can take to mitigate AI-based hiring bias. The guidance suggested enterprises look for ways that AI could be taught to disregard variables that have no bearing on job performance. It is also important to recognize that AI can still create issues even when precautions are in place. These mitigation steps are important because enterprises face legal ramifications from using AI to make hiring decisions without oversight.
EEOC chair Charlotte Burrows recommends that enterprises challenge, audit and ask questions as part of the process of validating AI hiring software.


Four ways to mitigate AI bias in recruiting
Here are some of the key ways organizations can mitigate AI bias in their recruiting and hiring practices.
1. Keep humans in the loop
Pratik Agrawal, a partner in the analytics practice of Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm, recommended firms include humans in the loop rather than relying exclusively on an automated AI engine. For example, hiring teams may want to create a process to balance the different categories of resumes that are fed into the AI engine. It's also important to introduce a manual review of recommendations. ""Constantly introduce the AI engine to more varied categories of resumes to ensure bias does not get introduced due to lack of oversight of the data being fed,"" Agrawal said.
2. Leave out biased data elements
It is important to identify data elements that bring inherent bias into the model. ""This is not a trivial task and should be carefully considered in selecting the data and features that will be included in the AI model,"" said Carroll. When considering adding a data point, ask yourself if there is a tendency for that pattern to be more or less prominent in a protected class or type of employee that should have nothing to do with performance. Just because chess players make good programmers does not mean that non-chess players couldn't have equally valuable programming talent.
3. Emphasize protected groups
Make sure to weight the representation of protected groups that may currently be underrepresented on the staff. ""This will help avoid encoding patterns in the AI model that institutionalizes what you have done before,"" Carroll said. He worked with one client who assumed a degree was an essential indicator of success. After removing this constraint, the client discovered that non-degreed employees not only performed better but stayed longer.
4. Quantify success
Take the time to discern what qualifies as success in each role and develop outcomes such as higher output or less rework that are less subject to human bias. A multivariate approach can help remove bias that might be ingrained in measures like performance ratings. This new lens can help to tease apart traits to look for when hiring new candidates.

We all use it every day,"" Professor Whittle said.Creative and emotional work just as exposed to automationA 2019 McKinsey & Co report on automation in Australia laid out just how quickly industries are set to change. The authors said by 2030 as many as 5 million Australians may need to change their occupation because of automation, with WA's East Pilbara, Penrith in western Sydney, Mackay in Queensland, West Coast in Tasmania and Port Pirie north of Adelaide among the most exposed local government areas.Even work that was widely thought to be immune to automation, particularly creative and emotional industries, is quickly proving to be just as exposed.Think you can spot content written by AI?You may not have heard of GPT-3, but there's a good chance you've read its work, used a website that runs its code, or even conversed with it through a chatbot or a character in a game.Read moreJust in the last year, AI systems DALL·E and Midjourney have exploded onto the visual arts scene, using massive data sources to generate convincing images in seconds, and sending a ripple of disquiet through arts and entertainment professions.But Professor Whittle said he was not fearful these rapidly emerging technologies could spell the end for workers.""Even things like DALL·E I don't necessarily see as replacing human creativity but rather augmenting human creativity,"" he said.""A good example of this is that somebody used DALL·E to generate the front cover for Cosmopolitan magazine recently, and it sounds a great story right, the first magazine auto-generated by a machine. Cosmopolitan published what it claims is the world's first magazine cover made by AI in June this year.(Hearst Magazine Media)""But if you look at what was actually done, there was over 100 hours of a human being involved in interacting with DALL·E to ensure the outputs being produced matched the style of the magazine and the creative licence of the magazine.""Still, he said automation would change the nature of work — and that will need to be carefully managed.Time to 'double down' on AI policyCSIRO's Data 61 institute co-designed an AI road map with the federal government last year that identified environmental health and infrastructure AIs as technologies Australia is well placed to take the lead on.The research group's chief executive, Professor Whittle, said the jobs summit was a chance to ""double down on that"".""All of these things are opportunities for the country. I wouldn't say we should sit back and take our time,"" he said. ""We should definitely grab them by the scruff of the neck if we want to take the lead.""Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the government needed to coordinate the change.""There are strong pockets of awareness [in government]. Is it part of a coherent narrative that government is guiding and leading and educating on? I think in the recent past that hasn't been the case,"" Mr McKellar said.""As we go into something like the Jobs and Skills Summit next week, I think this is an opportunity for government to reset that narrative.""We need to be competitive."" An automated hospitality worker is already being experimented with at one cafe in Canberra.(ABC News: Donal Sheil)Australia was one of the first nations out of the blocks with its AI ethics framework, but now countries are moving to introduce laws to regulate automation technologies, and in some instances even outright ban them.The European Union Parliament is debating a wide-ranging AI Act that would categorise technologies depending on the risks they pose to social wellbeing, with more stringent obligations on technologies that could be used to significantly disrupt society.Among the proposed changes is an outright ban on facial recognition software, which in Australia was recently being used by retailers Kmart, Bunnings and Good Guys to monitor customers.As countries move to enforce more responsible AI, Professor Whittle said there was also a responsibility to ensure workers were not left out.""If jobs are going to morph, organisations therefore have a responsibility,"" he said.""If they're introducing those technologies they have to be thinking do they need to be doing some reskilling of their employees at the same time.""'AI will be required in every discipline'Despite the challenges, people who know AI well are more optimistic about the potential improvements it could bring, if the country moves quickly.Professor Whittle said even if the technology was rapidly advancing, it would take time to be adopted by business.""I wouldn't say we can kind of sit back and bide our time, there's definitely a sense of urgency about it, particularly in areas where Australia has the potential to lead,"" he said.The same McKinsey & Co report that detailed Australia's exposure to automation also suggested automation would boost the average salary by as much as $15,000 this decade under the most rapid adoption scenario.Conversely, automation could also cause income inequality to grow by 27 per cent without programs to manage the change. Midjourney's slightly abstract interpretation of ""workers receiving a pay rise thanks to automation"".(Midjourney)Mr McKellar said if government and business don't wrangle with AI policy soon, the country would suffer for it.""It will determine what our place is in the world, it will have that sort of impact,"" he said.""There's a lot riding on it.""Shadow Industry Minister Paul Fletcher said there was nothing ""magic"" about the jobs summit, but that the government must seize the opportunity automation presents.""It is important to make the point this is happening over time, it's not happening overnight, and it has been happening for decades,"" Mr Fletcher said.""Ultimately the economists will tell us the best way to have rising wages is to have productivity improvements across the economy.""The ABC made multiple requests for an interview with Industry Minister Ed Husic.Professor Whittle said the jobs summit would be a chance to progress ideas on reskilling workers and educating boards to understand the risks and benefits of automation.""AI is a bit like maths in a way, it's going to be required in every discipline, and so we need to be training up future workers not just to be experts in health or law or manufacturing, or whatever it is, but to have those underlying digital AI skills as well,"" he said.""There's a wonderful quote … in the past jobs were about muscles, currently they're about brains and in the future about the heart.""Posted 27 Aug 202227 Aug 2022Sat 27 Aug 2022 at 5:05pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesSeven 'megatrends' that will shape our lives in the years ahead — and what it all meansThe world's 'first AI robot rapper' has dropped a new trackConcerns raised about new tech that uses AI, cameras to monitor workplace safetyThink you can spot content written by AI?

IoT is concerned with devices talking with one another via the internet, whereas AI is concerned with machines learning from large amounts of data. This blog will explain why IoT and AI must cohabit.Unlike traditional technology, IoT and machine learning make operational forecasts 20x faster with heightened accuracy. This is the reason why businesses that use AI technology see a growth in their revenue numbers — a validation of which can be seen in the graph below:[Revenues generated by businesses using AI from 2018 to 2025 (estimated)]The role of artificial intelligence in IoT’s revolution has helped in a massive revenue boost which also means in the sale of more connected devices.Advantages of AI-Enabled IoTThe Internet of Things’ artificial intelligence provides businesses and consumers with a number of advantages, including proactive intervention, individualized perspectives, and process systems.Artificial Intelligence is a combination of technologies that empower businesses to perform the tasks of humans much faster, efficiently and accurately. Through Artificial Intelligence solutions, companies can strike that balance to support human efforts through automated means.The following image draws a comparison among different technologies and shows which ones are the most trending.The following are a few of the most common commercial advantages of fusing these two emerging innovations:Also Read- IoT in Construction Industry: Challenges, Solutions, Applications, and Use Cases#Enhanced Safety MeasuresConsidering the recent rise in hacking and data and the destruction of priceless data, security and safety are crucial for a corporation.Your private information is safeguarded and kept out of the hands of unauthorized parties by the AI-powered IoT platform. Machine-to-machine communication is being used by a number of businesses to detect incoming threats and respond to cyber terrorists automatically.IoT sensors, for instance, in the banking industry, instantly alert law enforcement to fraudulent behavior in ATMs.#Thriving Business AnalysisThe balance between producers and consumers must be exact.By enabling you to anticipate when you most need to restock, AI helps to improve stock control and reduce inventory stress. This is useful for business owners who occasionally buy too much stuff only to find that they can’t sell it all.Additionally, it shows how much more accurate it is compared to conventional methods. They may gather information and perform analytics for stock management and the implementation of IoT technologies.#Better Crisis ManagementIt has been discussed how AI and IoT technology may be made secure.When it comes to decision management, which includes dealing with economic loss, staff protection, and cyberattacks, the two are skilled at resolving concerns and responding promptly to prevent repetition.As an illustration, the Japanese company Toshiba, which produces computer hardware and services, ensures worker safety using artificial intelligence (AI) and data from mobile devices.#Productivity of Automated OperationsBy simplifying processes and contributing to the production of precise predictions, IoT implementation increases the efficiency of your company.Investment in the IoT is crucial in today’s market since you could find time-consuming and repetitive tasks thanks to innovation.A good example of this is Google’s improvement in passive cooling performance, which they were able to achieve through the use of AI and IoT.Moreover, you can discover which elements of your established process need to be changed to keep up productivity.Use Cases of AI and IoT in ActionLet’s take a closer look at some businesses that have improved user experience and developed new business models with IoT driven by AI.#Industrial RobotsOne sector that has adopted emerging innovations like IoT, AI, face recognition, machine learning, robotics, and many others in the industry is the automotive industry.Factory robots are becoming smarter thanks to sensors that have been implanted and enable data exchange.The robots can also learn from updated data because they are equipped with artificial intelligence systems. This method improves the production process over time while also saving time and money.#Self-driving VehiclesThe best illustration of how IoT and AI are interacting may be seen in Tesla’s self-driving vehicles.Self-driving automobiles can predict animal and pedestrian activity in a range of circumstances thanks to AI.With each journey, they gather expertise and can determine the state of the roadways, the proper speed, and the climate, for instance.#Retail InsightsIndustrial collects and analyzes a large number of data points from cameras and sensors to monitor consumer behavior and predict when they will appear at the checkout line.In order to reduce checkout times while also increasing cashier performance, the system may suggest dynamic staffing levels.#Digital Thermostat AlternativeSmart device technology powered by AI has a strong track record. According to their work schedules and preferred temperatures, users may monitor the temperature and adjust it from anywhere using a smartphone.In general, IoT and AI technologies can pave the way for cutting-edge services and goods. You must combine AI with additional data from IoT devices if you want to make the most of your network and alter your organization.What Influence Will IoT and AI Have on Modern Businesses?The accuracy and efficiency of data sharing and analysis will increase as a result of the integration of AI and IoT.These technologies will be crucial digital alternatives to accelerate the pace of growth in industries like healthcare, retail, and many others in our linked world where we possess more data than ever before regarding processes and individuals.Also Read- IoT for Eldercare: How Technology Enhancing Seniors LivingThe epidemic caused a significant upheaval in how the world functions. Businesses are now highly aware of the hazards involved with their operations.Furthermore, when AI and IoT are used together, it is possible to create reasonable estimates and projections regarding the risk element present in the issue statement. Due to their capacity to reduce risk, they are even more crucial for modern businesses.Maintaining your consumers’ happiness is one of the most important aims of any business, whether it is B2C or B2B.Moreover, in the year 2022, businesses will be able to give their clients an improved experience by providing them with individualized services thanks to the IoT, which has given them access to a wealth of data on buyer behavior patterns.Gaining more efficiency and expanding is one of any company’s main goals.Any business’s ultimate goal is to increase income and cut expenditures. The majority of sectors are already benefiting from IoT and artificial intelligence, and this trend will continue in the coming years.The connected smart sensors, meters, and other equipment will help businesses not only cut expenses but also maximize their income thanks to the improved efficiency technologies they offer and their capacity to gather data from and monitor the connected equipment.Also Read- Top Use Cases of Artificial Intelligence(AI) in the Finance IndustryModern businesses are entering a new period of potential and growth as a result of IoT devices being enhanced with AI.Combining AI and IoT has the potential to change how choices are made in contemporary businesses.There is a wide range of innovation potential due to the increased importance placed on research into cutting-edge technology.

Why don’t the teams that work on them get along?,,,,"Future PerfectThere are two factions working to prevent AI dangers. Here’s why they’re deeply divided.AI poses present risks and future ones. Why don’t the teams that work on them get along?by  Kelsey PiperAug 10, 2022, 7:30 AM EDTFacebookLinkArtificial intelligence systems are getting more and more impressive. The people who work on ensuring they have good effects are beset by internal squabbling. Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.There are teams of researchers in academia and at major AI labs these days working on the problem of AI ethics, or the moral concerns raised by AI systems. These efforts tend to be especially focused on data privacy concerns and on what is known as AI bias — AI systems that, using training data with bias often built in, produce racist or sexist results, such as refusing women credit card limits they’d grant a man with identical qualifications.There are also teams of researchers in academia and at some (though fewer) AI labs that are working on the problem of AI alignment. This is the risk that, as our AI systems become more powerful, our oversight methods and training approaches will be more and more meaningless for the task of getting them to do what we actually want. Ultimately, we’ll have handed humanity’s future over to systems with goals and priorities we don’t understand and can no longer influence. Today, that often means that AI ethicists and those in AI alignment are working on similar problems. Improving the understanding of the internal workings of today’s AI systems is one approach to solving AI alignment, and is crucial for understanding when and where models are being misleading or discriminatory. And in some ways, AI alignment is just the problem of AI bias writ (terrifyingly) large: We are assigning more societal decision-making power to systems that we don’t fully understand and can’t always audit, and that lawmakers don’t know nearly well enough to effectively regulate. As impressive as modern artificial intelligence can seem, right now those AI systems are, in a sense, “stupid.” They tend to have very narrow scope and limited computing power. To the extent they can cause harm, they mostly do so either by replicating the harms in the data sets used to train them or through deliberate misuse by bad actors.But AI won’t stay stupid forever, because lots of people are working diligently to make it as smart as possible. Part of what makes current AI systems limited in the dangers they pose is that they don’t have a good model of the world. Yet teams are working to train models that do have a good understanding of the world. The other reason current systems are limited is that they aren’t integrated with the levers of power in our world — but other teams are trying very hard to build AI-powered drones, bombs, factories, and precision manufacturing tools.That dynamic — where we’re pushing ahead to make AI systems smarter and smarter, without really understanding their goals or having a good way to audit or monitor them — sets us up for disaster.And not in the distant future, but as soon as a few decades from now. That’s why it’s crucial to have AI ethics research focused on managing the implications of modern AI, and AI alignment research focused on preparing for powerful future systems.Not just two sides of the same coinSo do these two groups of experts charged with making AI safe actually get along?Hahaha, no. These are two camps, and they’re two camps that sometimes stridently dislike each other. From the perspective of people working on AI ethics, experts focusing on alignment are ignoring real problems we already experience today in favor of obsessing over future problems that might never come to be. Often, the alignment camp doesn’t even know what problems the ethics people are working on. “Some people who work on longterm/AGI-style policy tend to ignore, minimize, or just not consider the immediate problems of AI deployment/harms,” Jack Clark, co-founder of the AI safety research lab Anthropic and former policy director at OpenAI, wrote this weekend.From the perspective of many AI alignment people, however, lots of “ethics” work at top AI labs is basically just glorified public relations, chiefly designed so tech companies can say they’re concerned about ethics and avoid embarrassing PR snafus — but doing nothing to change the big-picture trajectory of AI development. In surveys of AI ethics experts, most say they don’t expect development practices at top companies to change to prioritize moral and societal concerns.(To be clear, many AI alignment people also direct this complaint at others in the alignment camp. Lots of people are working on making AI systems more powerful and more dangerous, with various justifications for how this helps learn how to make them safer. From a more pessimistic perspective, nearly all AI ethics, AI safety, and AI alignment work is really just work on building more powerful AIs — but with better PR.)Many AI ethics researchers, for their part, say they’d love to do more but are stymied by corporate cultures that don’t take them very seriously and don’t treat their work as a key technical priority, as former Google AI ethics researcher Meredith Whittaker noted in a tweet:A healthier AI ecosystemThe AI ethics/AI alignment battle doesn’t have to exist. After all, climate researchers studying the present-day effects of warming don’t tend to bitterly condemn climate researchers studying long-term effects, and researchers working on projecting the worst-case scenarios don’t tend to claim that anyone working on heat waves today is wasting time. You could easily imagine a world where the AI field was similar — and much healthier for it. Why isn’t that the world we’re in? My instinct is that the AI infighting is related to the very limited public understanding of what’s happening with artificial intelligence. When public attention and resources feel scarce, people find wrongheaded projects threatening — after all, those other projects are getting engagement that comes at the expense of their own. Lots of people — even lots of AI researchers — do not take concerns about the safety impacts of their work very seriously. Sometimes leaders dismiss long-term safety concerns out of a sincere conviction that AI will be very good for the world, so the moral thing to do is to speed full ahead on development. Sometimes it’s out of the conviction that AI isn’t going to be transformative at all, at least not in our lifetimes, and so there’s no need for all this fuss.Sometimes, though, it’s out of cynicism — experts know how powerful AI is likely to be, and they don’t want oversight or accountability because they think they’re superior to any institution that would hold them accountable. The public is only dimly aware that experts have serious safety concerns about advanced AI systems, and most people have no idea which projects are priorities for long-term AI alignment success, which are concerns related to AI bias, and what exactly AI ethicists do all day, anyway. Internally, AI ethics people are often siloed and isolated at the organizations where they work, and have to battle just to get their colleagues to take their work seriously. It’s these big-picture gaps with AI as a field that, in my view, drive most of the divides between short-term and long-term AI safety researchers. In a healthy field, there’s plenty of room for people to work on different problems.But in a field struggling to define itself and fearing it’s not positioned to achieve anything at all? Not so much.A version of this story was initially published in the Future Perfect newsletter.

AbstractThis study examined the potential effects of artificial intelligence on Turkish education. A qualitative research approach was employed by posing an open-ended question to academics in order to attain this objective thanks to built-in capabilities for conducting complicated computer operations, cloud-based services, and conciliatory accession for agile network connections. This study emphasizes that Turkey is highly fragmented and consists of various business organizations at both the municipal and regional levels. The two main policy documents produced by the Turkish government suggest that colleges play a strong role in national and regional Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for workforce growth, with substantial consequences for AI adoption strategies. These documents include information on three well-known educational entities: The new oriental workgroups, recurrent neural networks, and classroom clustering. Significant aspects of Turkey’s educational AI growth include a strong private education industry and a growing international interest. The investigation results revealed a decline in the level of understanding regarding the methods of using artificial intelligence, indicating the necessity for additional awareness-raising in Turkey.

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is a machine-based technology that uses algorithms to deliver predictions, diagnoses, suggestions, and evaluations. Recently, the educational community has recognized AI’s potential to facilitate learning in various contexts (Hwang et al., 2020). Scientific and technical advances affect not only the evolution of teaching materials and methods but also education, educational models, and the kinds of educational systems and organizations (Onder, 2002). Little is known at this time regarding the implementation of modern educational technology, the management of instructional technology issues, the utilization of existing educational technology results, the maximization of educational resource applications, and the improvement of educational efficacy through a comprehensive educational reconstruction (Arslan, 2020). Therefore, educational technology research is vital.Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is primarily concerned with the development of computers that perform cognitive tasks, typically associated with human minds, especially learning and problem-solving education for all ages should prepare society for the future and help humans achieve self-fulfillment (Sucu, 2019). In the age of artificial intelligence, education is both difficult and an opportunity (Ocaña-Fernández et al., 2019). New learning channels, including learning management systems based on digital textbooks, tailored learning via big data learning analysis, interactive technologies based on voice recognition and speech synthesis, and chatbots driven by natural language processing (NLP), are being created (Ekin, 2022). The majority of AI technologies have educational and instructional uses. Education is necessary for a person’s complete growth (Sulak, 2021). Theoretically, technology, particularly AI, in contemporary education enhances educational material, transforms educational perspectives, and disrupts old educational paradigms.Given that education is required for advancement in many fields, the real influence of AI on education would be substantial. AIEd applications include responding to student inquiries, presenting questions and offering remarks, and evaluating narrative responses (Dogan and Kubat, 2008). According to Kanejiya (2019), AI will alter schooling in the next 4–5 years. Indian firms are using AI to enhance school quality with notable results. A method of feedback and individualized suggestions offered by an AI platform may be utilized to assist students in correcting past errors based on student data (Dalal et al., 2020).Consequently, children’s performance improves with time. It also addresses the teachers’ failure to offer pupils individualized attention and the discrepancies in student learning rates. Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) approaches to offer instructors feedback. For instance, the platform might assist instructors in optimizing their information delivery and correcting knowledge gaps by identifying areas where pupils lack understanding. By emulating their teaching technique, robotic teaching assistants linked to the cloud may make skilled knowledge practitioners in outlying areas more accessible on their own or in real-time cooperation with human instructors (Faggella-Luby et al., 2017).Government support for research and development (R&D), and innovation efforts is vital. Most wealthy nations, as well as a few emerging nations, are spending extensively on R&D and innovation connected to AI. This article demonstrates how education contributes to Turkey’s growing interest in AI and why universities must play a crucial role in this regard. In addition to traditional pedagogy and learning issues, this study focuses on geopolitics as a factor in technological growth (Ma and Siau, 2018). This paper’s concept is founded on three essential principles: interdependence, interconnection, and contention. The crucial connection within the identified networks is the impact of global governance on global education levels.Recent research, particularly in the United States, has addressed the commercialization and purifying of conventional classrooms, schools, and university lecture halls (Kim and Park, 2017). According to this perspective, educational AI might be seen as a component of a wider learning marketplace based on political principles and prioritizing product creation and consumption as a commercial strategy. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the rise of AI in Turkey is facilitated by many factors, such as the convergence of educational policies and geopolitics and the incorporation of learning activities into the corporate practices of the IT sector (Khare et al., 2018). Government and private sector partnerships might be a rivalry (Waltzman et al., 2020). Their work distinguishes between the broad conceptions of ‘politics’ and ‘polarity’—in this instance, the effort to explain human equality in terms of logical and natural social equality.Study questionsNumerous theories have attempted to explain AI as a controversial topic, and it is frequently portrayed negatively; others may describe it as a convincing boon for businesses; and still, others believe it is a technology that threatens the very existence of the human race because it may be able to control and manipulate man; however, AI has directly or indirectly affected our lifestyle and is shaping the future. This has inspired many scholars to consider the intriguing subject of how far technology may disrupt the education business. As a result, this study investigates the future of higher education if AI is accepted, as well as the preparedness of Turkish education to implement AI applications. The following are some of the most pressing inquiries:

What is the recent situation in education in the light of AI?


What is the most probable future scenario for Academic Instruction in Education in the light of AI?


What are the correct actions and measures that must be undertaken in education to make the most possible benefits of AI?

Justification and objectivesThis study focuses on examining the significance and potential applications of AI in education in Turkey. As far as we know, no scientific mapping of the word in issue has been performed in a study using the knowledge at hand. Therefore, it was decided to do this exploratory work to deliver new results in this area of knowledge, eliminate the gap in the literature related to this discipline, and present the results provided here as a starting point for AI-focused researchers. Consequently, this study focuses on the following objectives:

To determine the performance of scientific production indexed in Web of Science (WoS) on “AI and Education”;


To concretize the scientific evolution of “AI and Education” in WoS;


To determine the most significant issues and authors on “AI and Education” in WoS.

Literature reviewWhen AI studies in education are examined today, knowledge-based and data and logic-based AI and its applications can be seen in almost every field. These include personalized education or dialog education systems, exploratory education, data mining in education, article analysis of students, smart agents, chatbots, education for children with special needs, child-assist bot interaction, AI-based evaluation systems, and automatic test creation systems (Velik, 2012). Note that these fields are mostly related to the support of learning. However, AIEd also supports schools and universities in administrative aspects. For example, curricula, staff programs, exam management, cybersecurity, facility management, and security are areas where AI contributes directly to school management and indirectly to teaching (Holmes et al., 2019). With the investments made and technological developments, AI applications are increasing daily in terms of performance and awareness, while costs decrease day by day. Although these applications sometimes remain in the background of our daily lives, they have been integrated, widespread, and inevitable in terms of their effects (Groff, 2013). And this technology is being used effectively in a wide range of fields, from Siri to digital journalism, from stock movement prediction to crime prediction, and from face recognition to medical diagnostics (Holmes et al., 2019). However, the purpose of this study is to reveal how AI, which has already entered the classroom in different ways, contributes to education and within which applications it is used (Luckin et al., 2016). While many people perceive AIEd as the involvement of “robot teachers,” the reality is a little different than what was predicted. AI can be grouped under three headings in terms of its areas of interest. These are data-based, logic-based, and knowledge-based AI approaches. From the 1980s to the 2000s, educational applications of AI were mostly based on a knowledge-based approach (Long et al., 2020). The research areas are mostly under intelligent education systems in the specified period, consisting of three modules: domain, learner, and pedagogical (Woolf, 1990). In a typical learning management system for that day, the domain module has defined the area to be learned, the learner module has defined the knowledge and learning situation of the learner, and finally, the pedagogical module has defined how the learning materials to present the learner with a pedagogical approach which has an adaptable and interactive interface (Fryer et al., 2019).Intelligent Educational Systems (IES), which can be considered the second generation of computer-aided teaching, are among the most used in AIEd. In general, IESs provide personalized learning environments appropriately and are carried out step by step for each student through well-structured subjects such as medicine, mathematics, or physics (Alkhatlan and Kalita, 2018). Virtual teaching is computer-based teaching systems that have separate databases or knowledge structures for determining teaching content, namely what to teach, and teaching strategies, that is, how to teach, and make inferences based on the student’s mastery of the subject in teaching dynamically (Woolf, 1990). The system determines a step-by-step path for the student, using the relevant learning materials and activities according to the student’s success or mistakes. This path is constantly updated regarding difficulty level, tips, or explanations in line with the feedback and adjusted according to the student’s needs. The aim is to enable the student to learn effectively on the specified subject.The Turkish context of artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence in educationDue to its vast power to modify our thinking, behavior, and interactions, AI-enhanced digital technology has become a crucial component of our everyday life. Since its origin, AI has thrived and expanded, especially with the advent of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning (DL) (Chan and Zary, 2019). Intelligent machines and AI date back to the 14th century (Hrastinski et al., 2019). However, the notion of AIEd has existed for around 25 years, with AI being incorporated into the education sector through several routes and ways (Bayne, 2015; Heffernan and Heffernan, 2014; Humble and Mozelius, 2019; Koedinger and Corbett, 2006). Instructors and students in K-12 and higher education use AI-powered apps and resources, such as intelligent robots and adaptive learning systems. AI technologies enable the implementation of individualized learning to meet the unique needs of each learner (Della Ventura, 2018). Since each person is unique and has various learning styles, talents, and demands, it may be difficult to meet the needs of each student using standard educational practices.However, with AI, instructors may respond to the unique demands of each student (Della Ventura, 2018). Consequently, students may be more engaged, independent, and motivated throughout the learning process (Della Ventura, 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Moreover, AI technologies provide chances to boost student engagement in learning challenges.With the increased usage of AI technologies for teaching and learning, instructors may eliminate time-consuming and repetitive duties and deliver rapid replies to students, promoting adaptive and personalized learning (Chan and Zary, 2019). Specifically, hardware developments, such as high-speed graphics processing units and the availability of software libraries have enhanced AI technologies, particularly with the expansion of deep learning research and data analysis methods. In addition, the future development of education will be intimately linked to the future expansion of AI. Future education will become more innovative and thrive as new technologies, and the computing capacities of intelligent computers continue to grow. AIEd research covers several sub-disciplines. Coledam et al. (2014), for example, provided a formative assessment system for learners that was able to produce and evaluate examinations and track their learning progress. Comparing the results of the suggested system to those manually graded revealed that the strategy was successful for grading exams. Eguchi (2016) presented RoboCupJunior and evaluated its efficacy in fostering youngsters’ STEM content and skill development. Lan et al. (2014) developed a unique method for ML-driven learning analytics based on assessing the subject-matter knowledge of learners. Due to the increasing amount of AIEd research publications, it is essential to define and logically debate important points. As noted before, we encounter news or information about AI almost daily. For instance, news articles such as “AI defeated the world champion in a difficult strategic game” are highly intriguing to fans of digital games. Similarly, for sci-fi fans brought into our life by Hollywood productions, at least one film every term, “The Matrix: Reloaded,” is forthcoming. Followed the news with keen curiosity. Alternatively, the news of “Elon Musk’s new smart vehicle” may be seen on every news channel, even local ones, for the new generation of technology enthusiasts who believe that entirely autonomous—electric automobiles will join our lives and pique the curiosity of almost everyone. Lastly, “education by expert systems tailored to our learning pace and style” is highly exciting news for students and instructors who want to study from home, whenever and whatever they like, without attending school.Analysis of artificial intelligence in the context of education in TurkeyThe unique thing about AI, which is found in the international political and business sense rather than the design and creation of the technologies, is the younger population and much of AI usage in the lessons. Indeed, the fast creation and high adoption of Turkish educational features, such as facial recognition, have drawn international attention rather than simply their novelty. This is why the paper examines how governmental policy affects commercial growth by focusing on various educational technologies in Turkey. A review of the subjects mentioned above offers additional value in breaking new ground, particularly because it highlights some of the common assumptions that go along with discussions about new technology. International AI creation is greatly aided by the Turkish specialist who is best known, not as an isolated initiative, or national undertaking, but rather as an interconnected part of many international actors. Similarly, Anderson et al. (2018) believe that Turkey is at the forefront of AI because highly creative and technologically sophisticated countries lead in foreign affairs. A better grasp of contemporary geopolitics appears to be growing regarding national capabilities for AI growth, which helps reinforce Turkey’s status as the world’s leading economic force. Others recommend that the United States and Turkey return to their status before Turkish AI creation to combat this perceived threat. At present, an Istanbul-based research team has unveiled an AI that can predict global trends, international events and offers automated forecasts for foreign policy choices. Not only is Turkey’s invention of AI seen as a threat to strategic stability, but it is also seen. In recent years, a narrative of a worrying Turkey has seen to develop in the media regarding Turkish technological growth. The stronger inclination to conceive Turkish technology as being very different from Western notions increases the perception of the risk to the perceived problem.Numerous nations engage in advancing AI in light of the advantages supplied by applications of AI. In this approach, the implementation of artificial AIEd is anticipated to grow significantly in the future, with worldwide expenditures reaching $6 billion by 2025 (URL-10). China and the United States spend more than half of the world’s education on AI. SquirrelAI, a China-based AI-supported adaptive education provider, develops and continues to work so that each student may be counted as an AI super instructor.Similarly, US-based McGraw-Hil developed ALEKS, an adaptive AI training software. The AI software dubbed Watson, developed by IBM in the United States was implemented in 2010 and began to be utilized not only in schools but also in many commercial domains. In addition to providing students with tailored learning opportunities, this software enhances efficiency by disclosing each student’s learning potential. Similarly, the UK-based AI initiative “third space learning” allows students to teach online alongside an instructor. This saves time and decreases the instructor’s burden. In addition, owing to the program’s feedback, the learning rates of each student can be assessed, and classes may be tailored to each student’s learning level.Similarly, the UTIFEN software, which was developed with learning in mind, was created using adaptive learning concepts. Adaptive learning systems use AI to customize learning to an individual’s specific features, abilities, or requirements. Additionally, since the software is built for mobile education, it gives instruction whenever and wherever it is needed. Examining the research, it is shown that educational outcomes are higher in situations where instructors are less engaged, i.e., in environments where students study online at their own pace and level using an expanded curriculum (URL-1). Sana Labs, a firm established in Sweden, continues to work on individualized education in school. Unlike other organizations, Sana labs continue to work on various subjects, including mathematics, language teaching, and vocational education, instead of focusing on a single topic. Programs that provide individualized learning use the principle of dividing the material to be learned into discrete chunks. Information to be learned in a mathematics course, for instance, is split into a given number of information points (e.g., 2000–5000–1000, etc.). The software identifies weaknesses in key information points and, based on these shortcomings, offers individualized education programs to enhance pupils’ understanding. When a student regularly offers accurate responses, the next missing information point is relocated to the next missing information point, and the student’s knowledge map is updated to ensure that the teaching is completely realized (URL-13).Considering the work of these nations and organizations, it is possible to predict the future efficacy of AIEd. In this respect, discussing AI research undertaken in Turkey’s education sector would be beneficial. In Turkey, education-related AI applications and training are the subjects of several seminars and conferences. Six times, the Education Industry and Technology Institute hosted a workshop on AIEd. In the sixth workshop’s final report, it was said that “Smart Classroom Behavior Management” might be implemented using image processing technology. Due to this system, pupils’ facial expressions and emotional conditions throughout the session may be identified using classroom-mounted cameras that can collect photos at 30-s intervals. These emotional states of the kids might be studied and communicated to the instructor. Consequently, the instructors indicated that due to this feedback, they could determine which portion of the class the pupils were engaged in and which portion of the lecture failed to capture their attention. This system may benefit instructors in finding the optimal instructional teaching.In the same session, it was suggested that attendance control might be implemented by installing image processing technology at school entrances and exits (URL-7). In addition to workshops, the Ministry of National Education seeks to create AI-based educational tools. In this regard, they cooperated with Istanbul Technical University to promote students’ individual growth by creating individualized instructional material. ITU has also provided instructors with advice services by arranging pieces of training on AI (URL-12). In addition, the Ministry of National Education’s General Directorate of Innovation and Educational Technologies has said that different topics would be produced for schools and instructors to use AI applications in education from the beginning of elementary school. The “Artificial Intelligence Education for Children” project has been established in this context. Under the supervision of Manisa Celal Bayar University, research has been planned to give pupils AI training. In addition, it was said that within this project’s scope, several applications would be developed via various games and visualizations, and manuals on AI would be compiled. The Cambridge Professional Education Academy from England, CCS and Pobalscoil Neasain school from Ireland, and IBM Watson will assist the initiative, which has been revealed (URL-5).Artificial intelligence and Learner EvaluationIn sports research, mathematics, and computer science, there is a growing consensus that self-learning algorithms for performance analysis offer exciting applications. Typical applications of these algorithms include research examining the actions of athletes in golf, baseball, soccer, and basketball. Furthermore, it has been shown that self-learning algorithm maps are successful. These examples demonstrate the clear use of AI in developing monitoring systems, including categorization algorithms for real-time analysis and feedback output in each sport. For measuring a student’s physical activity performance, an AI-based learner evaluation might prioritize pattern recognition methods (Chen et al., 2020). Sensors attached to the learner’s body and exercise equipment can collect data from which significant characteristics for each physical activity can be deduced, enabling evaluation of measured physical activity and additional characteristics based on a general pattern recognition methodology incorporating automatic classification algorithms.Unique systems using cutting-edge information and communication technology and sophisticated control techniques enable the quick gathering, transmission, storage, and analysis of sensor data acquired from physical activity. The data collected by these sensors is utilized to develop intelligent procedures based on current machine learning techniques, enabling the independent evaluation of pupils’ motor skills and providing useful feedback (Munir et al., 2022). With the evolution of measuring technologies, the integration of sensors into equipment and instruments is growing. This data might be utilized to automate the analysis of physical activity using machine learning and sophisticated algorithms.Closely monitoring children’s physical activity is enabled by a self-learning system that employs pattern analysis for various school sports activities. Feedback based on objective data enables students to increase their physical activity while avoiding damage (Chiu and Tseng, 2021). In addition, by objectively measuring the physical potential of young athletes, these AI-based evaluations and measures may aid in identifying and selecting talent.Artificial Intelligence Policy of TurkeyTurkey has launched a national AI plan in recent years, garnering international interest. The study document is regularly recognized in the media, particularly geopolitically and commercially, as the primary catalyst for Turkey’s AI advancement. This year, Turkey hopes to become a global innovation powerhouse by being the center of AI. The business strategy’s fundamental objective is to reduce interdependencies and reliance on external technologies to attain AI autonomy (Orman and Sebetci, 2022).Education status within Turkish policy and educational institutions and activities has been accorded a far lower priority, and fewer resources have been allocated to it. Despite many references to the need for foundational training in The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for AI Growth, Turkey’s use of AI is fundamentally dependent on an education system geared toward developing particularly AI. A 2019 action plan supports the focus on AI in Turkey’s strategy for AI Colleges and Universities, which aims to accelerate the use of artistic and creative intelligence in teaching, encourage the training of talent models, strengthen educational governance, and create an artificial networked and lifelong structure. The political platform includes three primary objectives that must be prioritized. The scope of university infrastructures and curricula by 2020, elevating AI research and development to a national priority by 2025 and making Turkey a world-renowned AI destination by 2030, seems particularly important to AI’s overall growth, given the private sector’s specific preference for entrepreneurship and disruption. AI has the potential to be incorporated into both schools and universities. Such organizations are tasked with expanding their support for the study, creating new knowledge, and staff training. All educational institutions are increasingly related to an AI-infused economy, not just in terms of research and growth but also in training certifications, new and innovative initiatives, and the competencies of the future generation. The initiative to enhance the nation’s AI training systems for entrepreneurship, plus construction, education, and cultural interchange’ is more concentrated. We believe that this integrated creativity and education will inspire the future generation of artificial bits of intelligence. The goal of promoting AI as a core subject for all universities and colleges and the designation of the best AI program in Turkey as “first-level” are particularly important. This can be viewed as an endeavor by Turkey’s educators to include AI in more advanced disciplines such as computer science and statistics. Turkish institutions are rising to the challenge by announcing over 50 new AI-related programs. The degree program includes the purpose of defining subjects, often known as “TUBAI” (Cifci, 2021): merging disciplines to focus on an applied field while incorporating “mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, sociology, and psychology.” In addition, the policy advocates a “universal education” that combines training and development possibilities with existing education techniques. The Turkish Research and Technology Foundation (2020) stated at a recent policy conference that developing its own “natural AI capabilities” and getting a ranking of Turkey’s current purpose is “to develop the world’s best natural talent”.In addition, many Turkish nationals who conduct AI research abroad tend to work on development teams. While the Turkish government has recognized national and numerous local “talent programs” schemes to attract AI researchers to the country, it has also supported numerous programs to cultivate Turkish researchers at the local level (Tamer and Övgün, 2020). Incentives, such as “The 10,000 Talents Initiative,” provide academics with substantial incentives to return to Turkey.Innovations in Artificial intelligence and educationIntelligent schooling methodsBefore discussing smart instructional systems, it is important to discuss computer-assisted education, which may be considered an earlier step in the evolution of AI. In terms of applications, we might argue that the 1960s and 1970s were the golden periods of BDI. PLATO, developed by the University of Illinois, is among the most well-known instances of CDI during this period. While accessing the university’s conventional course materials, thousands of students were provided with interactive course materials. This system, created in the 1970s, included relatively new educational technology capabilities, such as user forms, e-mails, instant messaging, remote desktop connections, and multiplayer games, which are still developed efficiently today. Nonetheless, the instructional material and the operation were identical for each student. In other words, he assumed that all students were at the same academic level.In addition, this prompted John Self and William Clancey to work on new strategies for adapting CBL methods to match the unique requirements of each student and for using AI techniques. In his dissertation, Ph.D. student Jaime Carbonell proposed the scholar system, perhaps the first use of intelligent instructional systems. This marked the beginning of the next phase of the project. Intelligent Instructional Systems, regarded as the second generation of computer-assisted instruction, is one of the most popular uses of artificial intelligence in education. Through well-structured disciplines such as medicine, mathematics, and physics, EOSs create tailored learning environments that are suitable and sequential for each student. According to Murray, LESs are computer-based instructional systems with distinct databases or knowledge structures for instructional material (stating what is to be taught) and teaching methodologies, drawing inferences based on the student’s topic competence to give dynamic education. Here, the system generates a step-by-step route for the student, employing the appropriate learning materials and activities based on the student’s successes and failures. This route is continuously updated regarding difficulty level, clues, and explanations based on student input and customized to meet their specific requirements. The objective is to facilitate the student’s mastery of the topic at hand.Variations were expanding a radically new perspective and dimension. The emphasis of the study is precisely on thinking outside the box to add additional previously undiscovered dimensions (Cifci, 2021). It emphasized problem-solving abilities. The cognitive components involve understanding rules, methods, and concepts in terms of problem-solving. Social work students graduating this year participated in a “critical reflection” assignment that utilized a “deep learning” method. Regardless of how they accomplished this, their talent has mostly gone unappreciated in an environment where high curriculum achievement expectations. Teachers are hesitant to assist other teachers in the learning process due to content and evaluation concerns. Bouanna and colleagues (2020) evaluated student data and categorized strategies for keeping them in school. Bayesian Network Classifiers: The J48, Random Forest, and WEKA algorithms were utilized. Sheikh (2020) states that the student dataset has the greatest impact on a continuous assessment in the final semester. The classifiers displayed a substantial advantage over random forests in terms of accuracy and error rates. It was questioned if it is possible to predict the final grade based on forum participation and examined whether the suggested classification technique achieves the same level of accuracy as other traditional classifiers (Ryu and Han, 2017).In contrast to the idea that the Turkish government is attempting to centralize AI development for political reasons, the article describes Turkish policy as hands-off, enabling the private sector to flourish. On the one hand, Turkish AI enterprises have performed rather well on the global stage in terms of product development. On the other side, they have garnered attention for their quick expansion in commercial sectors, such as government use. According to several assessments, it is the most valuable AI startup globally (Ali et al., 2019).MethodologyDataset descriptionThe dataset was collected from two different sources: Istinye University and Yildiz Technical University. There were 7950 records with 10 attributes.We acquired data by using two methods: the first is interviews and focus groups, including speaking with subjects face-to-face on a particular problem or topic. Interviews are normally conducted one-on-one, but focus groups often consist of many people. Both methods may be used to gather qualitative and quantitative data. The data collecting processes are shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Methods of data collecting in qualitative research.Full size imageBy recording student and instructor perspectives on the AI learning process throughout the course of a protracted educational program, AI systems may give students and instructors useful feedback. In addition, the data are used in an ML environment to improve the user experience, which is measured by the length of time people spend interacting with the system. Student interactions with systems throughout the contact process are now included in creating and updating recommendations. As learning tools provided by AI automate procedures and instructors give direct assistance to students in person, teaching will become simpler. AI is seen as a “neutral” tool for the trial-and-error learning technique.We gathered input from students in the target group through interviews and focus groups. Observing their real-time data with our product and documenting their reactions and replies to questions may give important information on which product features to pursue.The second method is surveying which are physical or digital surveys that gather qualitative and quantitative data from students. After that, we chose to run a survey to get feedback from attendees. This gave insight into what attendees liked, what they wished was different, and areas where we improved our research.Data mining in educationThe conventional approach to data analysis is hypothesis-driven, which means it starts with a query and then analyzes the data to find answers (see Fig. 2). First, it can start by knowing the subject’s interests. On the other hand, the question-driven process is valuable in detecting the information when variables are justifiable, but complicated details participate.Fig. 2Main architecture of the proposed system.Full size imageInstead of using standard data analysis, data mining methods analyze previously unknown trends to discover destination relevance and profitability. Data mining is a means of acquiring data, as well as an analytical method for finding models. As of this time, the principles and techniques of data mining are the cutting edges in the database, and as new database technologies emerge, the technology is experiencing a golden age. These are considered valuable uses of data mining techniques as defined in Fig. 3.Fig. 3The architecture process – systematic creation of a system.Full size imageComputer-based educationComputer-based education (CBE) uses computers to teach students the use of computers in education. CBE systems were the first independent applications that ran on a local computer without using AI to address student modeling, flexibility, and personalization. With the broad use of the Internet, new web-based educational systems, including e-learning systems, have evolved. In addition, the expanding usage of AI technologies has spurred the development of innovative adaptive and intelligent educational systems. Numerous prominent CBE systems, such as ITS, a learning management system (Romero et al., 2008), an adaptive hypermedia and multimedia system, and a test and quiz system, are also AIEd systems; hence, there are parallels between CBE and AIEd.Deep learning and recurrent neural networkSeveral learning algorithms have been applied to the spectrum of neural networks in light of the increasing development. Neural networks imitate the operation. A categorization system that employs parallel processing, for instance, utilizes deductions based on deduction rather than experience, similar to the human brain. There are several approaches to discovering neural networks, all too complex for the human mind to comprehend. Cooperation between nodes varies, such as between direct and reverse cooperation. As humans do, these nodes were linked like neurons are, enabling them to communicate information through dendrites and axons. Recurrent neural networks control the information flow in neural networks.Figure 3 shows how the proposed architecture works.Deep learning (DL), which has recently made state-of-the-art progress in advanced science engineering and medical diagnoses, has shown significant potential in text mining and education. DL has become popular in several fields, mainly in processing information, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and control system, and is also widely in classification and segmentation. As a result, DL will not function if there is explicit text included. The DL has shown great results so far. Education researchers have been attempting to extract relevant information from large datasets for many years for a successful mapping of knowledge to predictions that increases the value of the deep learning system (Kim et al., 2020; Tezci, 2009).Due to the recent proliferation of neural networks, several learning algorithms have been applied to the spectrum of neural networks. Neural networks mimic the workings. For example, a classification that uses parallel processing uses deductions based on deduction rather than experience, like the human brain. Neural networks can be found in many ways, all too difficult for the human mind to understand. The cooperation of nodes varies, such as between straightforward and backward cooperation (sequential or convolution) (Lee, 2019). These nodes were interconnected as the neurons would, thereby allowing them to share information as we do through dendrites and axons (Chavlis and Poirazi, 2021). Recurrent neural networks manage the flow of information in the neural networks. Recurrent Neural Networks are related to the tasks such as long-term learning and multi-input transformations that must be held up for a long time while the network is learning and mathematically repeated for computational purposes. This diagram illustrates the Recurrent Neural Networks, which compute a sequence of hidden vectors by feeding a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The system how Machine Learning is enhancing the Future of Education.Full size imageLearner, instructor, and educational work are used to describe AI-based education. AI helps students gather data, evaluate the fundamentals, and visualize, allowing them to devote more time to high-level physical activities, practical and virtual experiences, and educator–student interactions. AI facilitates instructors’ decision-making by providing real-time updates on class status and proposing various solutions to learners’ challenges. It also supports instructors with assessment and efficiently learning management. AI assists instructors by lowering the time they spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to enhancing the quality of work and learning.Educational data mining (EDM) analyzes several forms of educational data using statistical, machine learning, and data mining approach. It focuses on developing tools for evaluating unique educational data to understand how students learn and discover the circumstances in which they obtain superior learning outcomes and a deeper understanding of educational phenomena. There are two forms of EDM research: statistics and visualization and web mining using clustering, classification, association rule mining, and text mining technologies. Concerning the study of models, a method prevalent in cognitive modeling and bioinformatics research but unusual in education research, new kinds of EDM studies would emerge. Thus, EDM approaches may impact education and its significant transdisciplinary sectors, such as AIEd. Numerous universities and other educational institutions have already adopted a variety of AIEd-driven applications, many of which integrate AIEd and EDM techniques to “track” students’ behaviors, such as identifying students at risk of dropping out in order to provide timely support by analyzing data regarding class attendance and assignment submission.Experiments evaluationThe classification was conducted using deep learning. The neural model and the Adam algorithm were implemented sequentially. With this formulation, the loss function was binary cross-entropy. The first two rectification layers began with the use of the activation function. The activation feature was chosen to be sigmoid in the output layer (Zheng et al., 2022). It took 24 neural cells and nine input (variables) to build the first level. The secret units had eight neurons, and the resulting class predicted value had one element. The TensorFlow machine learning library was used to deploy the implementation. The sample set was set at 70–30%; additionally, classifications were carried out in various ways. The table provides a detailed comparison of all of the various approaches. Ten generations of the artificial immune classifiers were performed using the Adaboost Algorithm, cross-generation classifier was used. For this application, it was required that the number of epochs was 300, and the batch size was 28. Parameters may be set to 256, while classifiers like deep learning, achieved a high level of accuracy.As seen in Table 1, the Ensemble model in education was achieved overall with an average of 0.93 precision, 0.95 accuracy, 0.94 F1-score, and 0.24 Kapa statistics.Table 1 Comparison of diff methods.Full size tableThe ultimate conclusion we reached on the current status of Academic Instruction in Education in light of AI developments tends to confirm that there is total satisfaction with what technology has achieved and trust in its possibilities. Moreover, most faculty members have a positive view of technological progress. The final expert judgment on the second study question indicates that the most likely future scenario for Academic Instruction in Education in light of AI breakthroughs is the optimistic scenario. The experts noted that AI tools could actively contribute to a variety of academic aspects, such as improving academic education and students’ learning, promoting academic guidance, enhancing the student assessment and scoring process, activating university and student activities, enhancing programs and quality assurance, providing virtual reality learning, providing additional student support, and making error-based learning less frustrating. Experts recommend equipping faculty members to implement AI products effectively via training courses, conferences, seminars, and internships so that education may get the possible benefits from AI developments. In Fig. 5, distributions of internal assessment percentage of the students concerning results are shown as seen two types of pf uncertainty are studied and illustrated.Fig. 5Distributions of internal assessment percentage of the students concerning results.Full size imageClassifier evaluation techniques metricsThe device’s performance is calculated based on AUC precision, precision, recall, and F1 accuracy. The evaluation metrics are shown mathematically below. Instances of breast cancer that have been successfully detected are referred to as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), mistakenly identified as Breast cancer, False Positive (FP), incorrectly identified as pneumonia or frequent cases, and incorrectly identified as False Negative (FN). Evaluation metrics used in health check systems.Different performance metrics are often used to investigate different models’ performance, such as specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity (Table 2).Table 2 Metrics used for evaluation.Full size tableConclusionFinally, Turkey’s AI strategy is distinguished by the contrast between a statist and a market-based approach; tensions of this sort define and legitimize the educational space. As policy discussions have shown, institutions are crucial in both pieces of research and in producing new generations of technology specialists to maintain an economy focused on AI. Governments around the country or especially in the United States, fund AI initiatives, institutions, and the private sector, all of which follow set pathways. AI policies should be seen in the context of Turkey’s recent history with the government, science, and technology since they are a new concept. However, throughout this period, there is a major interaction between private and governmental groups seeking expansion.Furthermore, in the lack of enabling government regulation, privately owned schools have devised creative approaches to incorporating AI into their non-new education sectors. Claims for ostensibly advanced AI applications focus on a pedagogical commercial growth strategy rather than any specific educational goal. AI development influences the Turkish educational system on two fronts: national and regional governments, who want to make educational institutions more strategic and concerned with the private sector’s bottom line. Higher education research contributes to the advancement of educational research. This method improves the company’s ability to track students’ development. This method also benefits the educational system. Using the experiment, we were able to estimate the candidate’s internal properties precisely. As a result, candidates who score badly on internal assessments will be able to dedicate more time to complete their final exams. Students with a bad academic record are likely to fail. While the predictive model may be used to identify candidates, who are likely to fail, it may also help them, and their parents estimate how well they will perform on exams.AI technology has been proved to assist students by making some learning tasks easier. Language translation in real-time, for example, makes information more accessible to students all across the world. It also aids understanding in students learning a second language. AI can increase efficiency, personalization, and streamline administrative tasks, giving instructors more time and freedom to give understanding and adaptability—human characteristics that robots lack. We have implemented AI techniques on the data gathered from schools and study with the data showing that AI has a promising future in the Turkish educational system.

A qualitative research approach was employed by posing an open-ended question to academics in order to attain this objective thanks to built-in capabilities for conducting complicated computer operations, cloud-based services, and conciliatory accession for agile network connections. This study emphasizes that Turkey is highly fragmented and consists of various business organizations at both the municipal and regional levels. The two main policy documents produced by the Turkish government suggest that colleges play a strong role in national and regional Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for workforce growth, with substantial consequences for AI adoption strategies. These documents include information on three well-known educational entities: The new oriental workgroups, recurrent neural networks, and classroom clustering.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Using AI for business is becoming increasingly prevalent in the enterprise world, and it’s being used for many different operations and tasks. However, it has the biggest impact when used to increase business productivity.




The current generation of artificial intelligence, which is heavily supported by big data and machine learning platforms, is starting to worm its way into the average workplace. When implemented effectively, it has the potential to reduce operational costs, improve output and productivity, and boost employee satisfaction by taking over many rote and undesirable tasks.
Gartner reports that enterprise use of AI has grown over 270% during the past four years. The technology is used for many purposes, from marketing and consumer research to employee experience and staff recruitment. And yet, business productivity stands to benefit the most from its adoption.
Here are the top six reasons why.
1. Predictive Sales
With the help of AI, businesses can focus on leads with the greatest potential for success. How?
In practice, the idea is simple, but it requires the support of advanced algorithms and AI-powered solutions to sift through massive datasets. It’s no secret the average business is amassing huge stores of customer and behavioral data. Putting this information to use can mean the difference between a competitive edge and continued failures.
AI can be used to identify patterns and trends within this data, as well as for image and object recognition, all of which can be used to recognize customers who would be more willing to support the business and its products or services. Imagine knowing whether or not a customer will pull the trigger and buy before they even visit a store or online storefront.Advertisements




The systems analyze customer and market data, historical sales details, common behavioral patterns, and so on. Then, they build customer profiles that help predict, with great accuracy, what a client or consumer might do going forward. (Read also: How AR/VR Will Up the Sales Game.)
2. Reviewing and Extracting Information
A rote and undesirable side of any business involves poring over hundreds of documents, papers, and statistics to create valuable insights. In the past, for example, a business would have to collect, analyze, and notate customer invoices to find popular products.
That’s no longer necessary, as digital reporting systems present this information faster and more effectively. But AI and machine learning tools are the next steps in that evolution. They can unlock hidden insights within that digital content by reviewing and extracting critical information that the human eye might have glossed over.
Simply put, AI can be used to collect information from documents to reduce review times and improve operational efficiencies by informing future decisions and events. The technology is already being put to good use in the legal and management industries to aid in contract intelligence.
As a process, it automates the extraction of relevant information that’s often buried in documents. The result is a more effective review and deployment process with a greater quantity of actionable insights to leverage.
Through an automated document review application that Deloitte developed, one team was able to increase the scope of their contract review process by up to 150,000 documents.
3. Leveraging Smart Chatbots
Customer service solutions require a lot of back-and-forth between agents and customers, especially in the initial stages. AI, or more specifically, smart chatbots, can be deployed to handle many of those low-level communication steps, which takes the stress away from employees.
Chatbots can collect names, account details, and basic information about the problems customers are having. If the chatbot cannot provide direct assistance, that information is then relayed to a human rep, who can take over from there.
AI can also be used to create always-on support solutions that tackle simple tasks and problems after hours. A customer might need help finding a support document or tutorial, for example, and the chatbot can direct them appropriately.
Babylon Health has implemented chatbots seamlessly, using them to collect basic patient information and health symptoms, and then compare that against a database. Afterward, patients are given some information on the next steps they should take, as well as potential causes to their problems.
If the discussion needs to escalate, the chatbot will connect patients to on-call doctors and physicians. (Read also: Top 20 AI Use Cases: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.)
4. Implementing AI Tools
Offering general support through AI tools can boost employee satisfaction, which leads to higher productivity. Automation can be used to replace rote and what would otherwise be considered unproductive tasks, for example, allowing workers to spend time doing what they enjoy more.
These same AI tools can also be leveraged in many unique ways to improve the employee experience. When enmeshed with the internal culture, they can improve employee buy-in and enhance the day-to-day for workers. AI can even be utilized before an employee is hired, by implementing tools that help with the recruitment process.
One tool might recognize when an employee goes above and beyond, for instance, and flag them for a promotion or award. Another might ingest customer reviews to find employees that have been mentioned, by name, consistently.
5. Automated Call Management
AI can also be used for call management to direct calls to the right people. There’s almost no reason to have your workers sitting by the phone waiting for communications to come in.
A forward-facing system can do that, similar to chatbots, to collect basic information from clients and customers and then direct them to the appropriate department or professionals. In fact, this is one of the best examples of automating repetitive work.
It benefits your call service teams, as well, freeing them up to work with elevated concerns, as opposed to answering every call that comes in regardless of priority.
6. Real-Time Operations
Traditionally, it would take time to assess and extract insights from incoming data, especially customer reports. In the past, you would have a team dedicated to doing this, who would review invoices, sales information, and much more. When they did come up with something, it would be essentially delayed.
AI and machine learning can be used to do this much faster, and almost instantly in many cases. The data flowing in is constantly being analyzed and processed to create real-time insights and inform direct action, or creating alerts about suspicious activity or implementing cybersecurity measures. It does this without the same prejudices a human may consciously or unconsciously hold that influence decision-making, although machine bias is a problem that has been recognized and needs to be combatted.
This significantly improves business productivity by allowing you to pivot and make decisions based on contextual and performance data almost instantly. AI for IT operations, or AIOps as it’s called, can help security teams identify and react to events faster than ever. (Read also: MLOps: The Key to Success in AI Enterprise.)
Imagine this same method for dealing with supply chain issues, product and inventory shortages, customer sentiment, dealing with social media posts and strategies and much more.
AI is the Future of Business
AI has a lot to offer the business world. And there are many benefits to go along with its adoption, from more accurate, real-time operations to improved employee satisfaction and better customer service opportunities.
What’s more, the technology will only get better from here on out as more companies realize its potential and unlock new use cases.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in fleet management drastically improves how transportation businesses operate. Combined with machine learning, AI bases data on driver learning behaviors, making tailored predictions. Barrett Young, SVP, Marketing at Netradyne, shares how fleets harness the technology to improve and automate decisions, increase vehicle and driver safety, and reduce vehicle downtime.
Transportation businesses have begun to reap the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate risk in the cab and on the road, better manage costs, and improve overall compliance. The main applications of AI that help power fleet operations are the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Predictive Analytics, and Computer Vision-based automated communication.      
The use of this technology creates safer roads, improves safety culture, and modernizes the trucking industry. The data provided by AI solutions help fleet managers make streamlined decisions to improve driver safety while tracking costs and tracking fleet operations.

Prioritizing Driver and Vehicle Safety  
With an AI-powered fleet safety system in place, fleets detect risky driving behavior and common compliance violations, such as speeding, distracted driving, driver fatigue, and more. This data gives fleet managers insight into drivers’ performance and track where a driver needs to improve or be rewarded.   
Examples of risky driving behavior that are recognized by video safety systems are:




Distracted driving
Following distance to other vehicles  
Hard braking
Speeding



Fleet managers cannot accurately assess a driver’s skill without a reliable safety system giving real-time insight to identify risks. But AI-powered video safety systems learn to detect risky driving behaviors and alert drivers in real-time to make necessary corrections. In addition to alerting drivers when a correction needs to be made, the AI-powered dash cam will also reward a driver for practicing safe driving. This creates a needed balanced safety culture.     
In-cab audio alerts notify drivers to correct dangerous driving behavior and warn of potential accidents in real-time. For example, if a driver is following too close to a vehicle, the driver will be immediately notified and can correct their driving at that moment. There is no need for a fleet manager to review the video at a later time and call the driver into their office. Making it easier to communicate with a driver and track a vehicle’s usage improves a trucking business’s proof of liability and workflow.
Fleet managers need to be able to access reliable data quickly to combat insurance claims, maintain driver compliance, and support drivers when an accident occurs. Machine learning sorts through large quantities of data, so drivers and managers know the impact and cause of an event. Also, ML-based dash cams learn from drivers’ behavior and predict risks around the vehicle by identifying and monitoring road signs, following distance, pedestrians, and other outside influences. 
Improved Vehicle Maintenance Tracking  
AI-based technology utilizes data to gain insights and make predictions. These data-driven predictions help identify potential wear and tear on fleet vehicles. With the ability to access this data quickly, fleet managers can better pinpoint and correct driving behaviors that cause long-term negative effects on vehicles. 
With edge computing, dash cams respond to data in real-time with little lag time. Large amounts of data are processed quickly and can be accessed in remote locations. Edge computing also allows for data to be processed without having to fed to the cloud, adding an extra layer of security. Modern fleet vehicles feature a number of electronic parts and sensors that gather information about a variety of things, including fuel consumption, idling times, location, vehicle utilization, and driving hours, and more.
AI is able to predict issues and identify over-exertion points on a vehicle. Some examples would be AI-powered camera systems monitoring tire tread through miles driven or these systems being used as surveillance to provide evidence if parts are stolen from a vehicle. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, and predictive maintenance enhance efficiency in vehicle care. Trucking companies better manage vehicle maintenance costs by having the advantage of these systems, trucking companies better manage vehicle maintenance costs.\
The Benefits of Reliable Data 
Fleets utilize AI to improve decision-making based on diverse data types. This data is based on learning individual drivers’ behavior as they do their job. This is calculated into a score that helps determine areas the driver is improving and exhibiting risky driving behavior. An example of this would be when AI-powered technology determines that a driver turns at high speeds. Fleet managers are able to access this data and arrange for specific training for that driver. Customizable coaching also gives drivers the power to enhance their skills in their field and, in the long run, creates safer roads.   
Vehicle maintenance issues like fuel consumption can be measured through data provided by AI. Data gathered from how a driver operates a vehicle, road conditions, and how the vehicle operates during service hours can be used to better pinpoint problem areas. Much like how driver data is learned over time making it customized, vehicle data collected can help make better predictions to when and how often a vehicle needs to be serviced. This technology enhances decision-making, saving time and energy for trucking companies.    
Virtual coaching is another way AI enhances decision-making to optimize workflow. Fleet managers have easy access to driver videos and in-cab alerts analyzed by AI technology. By analyzing the driver’s safety risk alerts over the period of one work week, the AI algorithm gives drivers coaching tasks to resolve these behaviors. Since this is all done virtually, managers spend less time reviewing videos, and drivers improve safety more quickly.

Driving Safety and Efficiency
Having an AI-powered safety system empowers fleets to prioritize safety without having to risk a decrease in efficiency and an increase in costs. Remote and automated coaching through the use of AI dash cams can save a company time and increase retention with drivers. With the use of AI and Machine Learning, fleets can enhance vehicle and driver safety, better monitor vehicle maintenance, and streamline work operations. Fleet managers can have a smoother workflow without compromising what’s important for their business and drivers.

With an ageing population and a declining labour force, Japan has an urgent need to improve the efficiency of industry, making gains for sustainability along the way. Personalized manufacturing could provide a solution through the combination of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge laser technology being developed by Yohei Kobayashi and Hiroharu Tamaru, at the University of Tokyo.By using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the complex physics underlying the way lasers cut, weld or drill materials, these researchers hope to make possible internet-based control of laser production systems, so that we can manufacture the things we want, on-demand, from home.

The nineteenth-century industrial revolution, powered by water and steam, saw a giant leap forward in manufacturing and mass production. A second technological jump came through harnessing electricity, while computers and digital innovation enabled a third. The fourth industrial revolution is now underway with the combination of digital and physical technologies to allow production and control on demand: an industrial internet of things.LASER VERSATILITY A crucial component is likely to be so-called cyber-physical systems, where computation, networking, and a physical production process are integrated, with a built-in feedback mechanism allowing for fully automated control. Additive manufacturing, perhaps better known as 3D printing, is a prime example, which often uses lasers for the physical processing part. But lasers can do so much more.Since their development in the 1960s, lasers have offered exciting manufacturing possibilities. The applications are diverse and their properties are near perfect. They can focus a lot of optical energy on a small spot, generating a great deal of heat at a precise point on a target. So, unlike many conventional mechanical and chemical industrial process, laser processing is super-efficient and doesn’t require any additional chemicals.Lasers can be pulsed at extraordinary rates, and the duration of each pulse can be as short as a few tens of femtoseconds (10-15 seconds). This is faster than rate that energy can dissipate, allowing for microscopic processing of materials at scales of less than a millimetre, without causing heat damage. And with the correct choice of laser wavelength, the light can destroy one type of material, while leaving others intact.Furthermore, laser power can be used in a blunt way, such as welding parts together, cutting sheets of metal or drilling holes. Or lasers can be applied more subtly, such as to polish or texture a surface.HIGH-QUALITY DATA Because lasers are electrically driven, they are easier to integrate into computer-control systems, making them ideal for cyber-physical systems. But the array of laser properties that make this wide range of applications possible, also causes a major technical question: how to find the best parameters for a specific job?Traditionally, the solution would be user intuition based on trial and error, but optimizing a laser system in this way can take months, which is simply not viable at the scale required to realize truly useful cyber-physical systems. To complicate matters further, even when the best configuration is identified for a specific system to perform a specific task, what works well for one type of material might not work for another.Researchers at the University of Tokyo are tackling this problem using AI and machine learning. However, “due to the complexity of the laser and light-matter interactions, it wasn’t clear whether even artificial intelligence was powerful enough to offer a solution,” says Hiroharu Tamaru, a professor at the Institute for Photon Science and Technology. “But now we have seen that it can, and it relies on having good data.”High-quality data is crucial because AI machine-learning systems need to be trained.A few thousand to a few tens of thousands of data points are often required for the algorithm to start making useful predictions. “We have constructed an all-automated and autonomous data acquisition system, called the Meister Data Generator,” says Yohei Kobayashi, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Institute for Solid State Physics. “We don’t even need to go to the lab to take data: it keeps working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.”




The Meister Data Generator and smart laser system developed at the University of Tokyo.


The researchers have applied their idea to many laser production processes including, very recently, laser ablation: using a short pulse of light to remove a small amount of material from a surface. In this case, they created a high-quality dataset by firing light pulses of controllable duration at a solid target. A three-dimensional microscope then provided images for the corresponding surface changes at a rate of about one per minute, or a 1,000 data points in a day.This big-data driven approach is proving very fruitful, and the University of Tokyo collaborators at Kyushu University in Fukuoka are already exploiting the method to serve the semiconductor manufacturing industry.TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL Once the data is gathered, a deep-learning algorithm could simulate the 3D topology created after irradiation by multiple laser pulses at arbitrary positions and with arbitrary pulse energies. And the team have applied this system to a variety of materials, including dielectrics, semiconductors, and organic polymers.Currently, the Meister Data Generator system can search autonomously thorough the various laser parameters with advanced algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, which determines the next parameters to test while the experiments are running. Such a high-quality data will have the potential to further change the laser manufacturing processes.And while the practical, real-world potential of this technology is tremendous, Kobayashi and Tamaru are also excited by the implications for basic research. The interaction between light and matter at such high intensities is complex. The physics of laser ablation, for example, needs further clarification before it is completely understood. The strength of the electric field at the focus of the laser can be akin to that holding an atom together, so simple models based on melting and vaporization are of little use. Sophisticated molecular dynamic simulations offer hope, but the processing power required is immense because the physical processes that take place during laser ablation are so varied — the laser pulses are as fast as a few femtoseconds, while melting might take place over microseconds.The massive, high-quality data sets gathered by the Meister Data Generator will be useful in understanding high-intensity interactions of light and matter. And with a better understanding of the fundamental science underlying laser processing comes more control over the technology and a greater potential for it to be even more transformative.

Wondering where AI regulation stands in your state? Today, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) released The State of State AI Policy, a roundup of AI-related bills at the state and local level that were passed, introduced or failed in the 2021-2022 legislative session (EPIC gave VentureBeat permission to reprint the full roundup below). 
Within the past year, according to the document (which was compiled by summer clerk Caroline Kraczon), states and localities have passed or introduced bills “regulating artificial intelligence or establishing commissions or task forces to seek transparency about the use of AI in their state or locality.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



For example, Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and Vermont have passed bills creating a commission, task force or oversight position to evaluate the use of AI in their states and make recommendations regarding its use. Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and Mississippi have passed bills that limit the use of AI in their states. And Baltimore and New York City have passed local bills that would prohibit the use of algorithmic decision-making in a discriminatory manner. 
Ben Winters, EPIC’s counsel and leader of EPIC’s AI and Human Rights Project, said the information was something he had wanted to get in one single document for a long time. 
“State policy in general is really hard to follow, so the idea was to get a sort of zoomed-out picture of what has been introduced and what has passed, so that at the next session everyone is prepared to move the good bills along,” he said. 
Fragmented state and local AI legislation
The list of varied laws makes clear the fragmentation of legislation around the use of AI in the US – as opposed to the broad mandate of a proposed regulatory framework around the use of AI in the European Union. 
But Winters said while state laws can be confusing or frustrating – for example, if vendors have to deal with different state laws regulating AI in government contracting — the advantage is that comprehensive bills can tend to get watered down. 
“Also, when bills are passed affecting businesses in huge states such as, say, California, it basically creates a standard,” he said. “We’d love to see strong legislation passed nationwide, but from my perspective right now state-level policy could yield stronger outcomes.” 
Enterprise businesses, he added, should be aware of proposed AI regulation and that there is a rising standard overall around the transparency and explainability of AI. “To get ahead of that rising tide, I think they should try to take it upon themselves to do more testing, more documentation and do this in a way that’s understandable to consumers,” he said. “That’s what more and more places are going to require.” 
AI regulation focused on specific issues
Some limited issues, he pointed out, will have more accelerated growth in legislative focus, including facial recognition and the use of AI in hiring. “Those are sort of the ‘buckle your seat belt’ issues,’ he said. advertisement
Other issues will see a slow growth in the number of proposed bills, although Winters said that there is a lot of action around state procurement and automated decision making systems. “The Vermont bill passed last year and both California and Washington state were really close,” he said. “So I think there’s going to be more of those next year in the next legislative session.” 
In addition, he said, there might be some movement on specific bills codifying concepts around AI discrimination.  For example, Washington DC’s Stop Discrimination by Algorithms Act of 2021 “would prohibit the use of algorithmic decision-making in a discriminatory manner and would require notices to individuals whose personal information is used in certain algorithms to determine employment, housing, healthcare and financial lending.”  
“The DC bill hasn’t passed yet, but there’s a lot of interest,” he explained, adding that similar ideas are in the pending American Data Privacy and Protection Act. “I don’t think there will be a federal law or any huge avalanche of generally-applicable AI laws in commerce in the next little bit, but current state bills have passed that have requirements around certain discrimination aspects and opting out – that’s going to require more transparency.”

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Many of the top IT pain points can be assuaged by implementing the right software.




The more important tech becomes to business, the more companies rely on their IT departments. As these workers play increasingly crucial roles, they often find themselves facing new challenges as well. The modern workforce is full of pain points for IT professionals.
A 2018 report revealed that 45% of IT workers feel stressed, and that’s before a pandemic disrupted everyone’s workflows. Pressure is rising for IT teams, but there are solutions for all of these problems.
Here’s a closer look at the top 10 IT pain points and how to solve them.
1. Management Doesn’t Understand IT Needs
Perhaps the most common pain point for IT departments is a lack of understanding between them and management. As cybersecurity and digital services play a more critical role in companies, IT teams’ needs grow and shift. Management doesn’t always understand these needs, leading to shrunken budgets, time crunches, or other issues.
Work OSs can help mitigate this problem by providing insight into workloads and requests. Easy-to-navigate tables, charts, and analytics reveal when IT teams may need more time or funding in one area or if one workflow isn’t working. Management can then make more informed, helpful decisions.
2. Communication Is Challenging
Successful IT operations depend on clear communication. IT workers need to inform others about security concerns or software updates, and others need to ask IT about problems they encounter. With one in four Americans now working remotely, that communication isn’t always easy.Advertisements




To solve this problem, companies need clear and organized digital communication services. Finding a work OS that supports live chats and video calls to help aid remote conversations. Similarly, automated request forms ensure nothing gets lost in the noise, letting IT workers respond to any questions.
3. There’s Not Enough Time to Complete All Requests
With only eight hours in the standard workday, IT workers don’t always have enough time to handle everything on their plate. Other departments or management may not understand this crunch and pile requests on already-overworked IT departments. As technology needs keep rising, this becomes a more frequent issue.
With an OS that incorporates your team's projects and calendars, it’s easier for everyone to see what other workers already have on their schedule. This transparency helps distribute tasks more evenly, stopping requests from piling up. Efficiency gains from streamlined workflows also help IT workers complete more in a day.
4. Remote Workers Are Hard to Secure
Cybersecurity has been a relevant concern for years, but the work-from-home revolution has heightened these issues. Personal devices can be a security vulnerability when connected to company systems and data. They’re also harder to secure, since IT workers can’t install and update security solutions on them themselves. (Read also: Cybersecurity Concerns Rise For Remote Work.)
Using a work OS, like monday.com, which is compliant with international security standards and offers controls like session management, can mitigate these risks. Other steps, like adopting zero-trust infrastructure and requiring two-factor authentication, further improve remote worker security.
5. Everyone Thinks They’re an IT Expert
As tech becomes more prominent in work and daily life, people become more accustomed to it. As a result, IT teams often have to deal with other workers who think they’re also tech experts. This, in turn, can lead to complacency and ignorance, creating security risks. (Read also: Computer Science and Information and Communications Technology: What's the Difference?)
One way to manage this problem is to restrict controls, so everyone handles their area of expertise and nothing else. If anyone wants to make an IT-related decision, they’ll have to reach out to IT to do it. Workflow systems that enable this segmentation will prevent risks and ensure experts handle everything they should.
6. The Company Uses Too Many Different Tools
Digital disruption is a popular goal for businesses, but many companies don’t take an organized approach to it. Businesses frequently adopt a wide variety of digital tools that may or may not work together. Having to bounce between them all can slow IT teams down.
The solution here is for companies to look for tools that integrate with existing solutions. monday.com, for example, integrates with dozens of popular tools, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. The more a system supports, the less painful IT’s work will be.
7. Management’s Goals Don’t Align With Operational Goals
Company leaders often have lofty goals for their future IT operations. In many cases, these aspirations are more in line with business buzzwords than what’s relevant for the company. This disconnect can create confusion and frustration for IT teams.
The answer to this misalignment is clearer communication. Managers need a better understanding of IT operations, and IT staff need to showcase relevant and viable ways to improve. More transparent workflows and decision-making processes that involve more stakeholders can help.
8. Estimating Project Times Isn’t Always Easy
IT issues are frequently more complicated than they appear at first. Consequently, it can take far longer to complete a project than workers first thought. This can lead to inaccurate estimates, which disrupt workflows and can disappoint clients or co-workers.
Flexible, adaptive workflows mitigate the impact that unexpected changes have. When teams can see the big picture of everyone’s workload, they can shift responsibilities and projects around to account for anything running long or short. Software that enables real-time updates for these changes further lessens the disruption of these changes.
9. Onboarding New Workers Takes Too Long
Technology has the highest turnover rate of any sector, at 13.2%. With so many IT workers moving in and out of a company, many departments suffer from slow onboarding processes. Getting new workers accustomed to company systems takes time, hindering IT teams’ productivity.
The more straightforward an IT management platform is, the quicker onboarding will be. Work OSs like monday.com simplify workflows to help new hires get the hang of things faster. Performance metrics and progress tracking make it easier for managers to see where new hires are in their professional development and guide them.
10. Expectations Are Rising While Budgets Fall
Amid widespread digitization and rising cybercrime, IT teams are more important to businesses than ever. At the same time, 62% of surveyed organizations plan to tighten their IT budgets in 2021. As a result, many IT workers find themselves having to do more with less.
Outsourcing some processes can help IT teams accomplish more with reduced budgets. Similarly, automation can let smaller IT departments handle more without having to hire extra workers. Having a transparent, easy-to-understand record of all of a team’s responsibilities, accomplishments, and needs could help persuade management to increase budgets.
Better IT Management Starts With Better Software
Working in IT can be stressful, but there are many ways to alleviate that. Embracing software solutions can fix many of these common issues, letting IT teams reach their full potential. When these workers can handle their responsibilities better, the entire company benefits.

A growing range of professionals are becoming increasingly concerned that their job will one day be performed better by a machine.18 Aug 2022Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace ArchitectsNot so long ago, when supermarket cashiers found themselves being supplemented by self-service checkouts, it was widely assumed that only certain menial jobs could be performed by machines. Those which required creativity, complex analyses, and emotional intelligence, it was thought, would remain forever performed by human beings.As you might have noticed from the eruption of AI-generated artworks, empathetic chatbots, and even self-proclaimed sentient machines, the future isn’t quite as easy to predict as we might not-so-long ago have imagined.Architecture is a fairly interesting case. It requires mathematical thinking and physical modelling, which is something that artificial intelligence might seem suited to. It’s also something with huge safety implications, which means the margin for error is wafer-thin. The encroachment of AI into this particular discipline has been multifaceted, with lots of smaller tasks being gradually passed over to machines.How has AI evolved?AI can perform many difference services useful to an architect. Generative design allows for variations on a model to be composed and tested, and design alternatives to be presented for consideration. This element of randomness allows for possibilities to be struck upon that might otherwise never have been examined.AI also allows for more efficient interactions between the various parties collaborating on a construction project. AI-powered designs are far less likely to overlook any key component, whether it’s the architecture itself, or the mechanical, electrical or plumbing plans.Risk factors can be identified and prioritised with the help of AI, and project plans can be devised. Artificial intelligence can be used to assess plans and to determine which different sub-projects will consume the most time, and prioritise the project accordingly.How do architects plan and design their work?The process followed by most architects starts with a schematic, which is presented to clients. The design is then refined and development, through collaboration with structural engineers and landscape plans. Finally, the construction documents will be devised. These can be thought of as instructions that the builders will follow. Materials can then be purchased in bulk. For example, if a plan calls for a certain amount of treated sheet timber, it can be known and ordered accordingly.Can AI ever replace architects?In theory, there’s nothing that could fundamentally prevent an AI from designing a building. However, there are a few practical obstacles to overcome. First, AI would need to become widespread in many of the fields upon which architecture is dependent.The AI would need to be able to not only design the building, but present the design in such a way that human workers would be able to understand and implement. For the time being, we should think of AI as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, human architecture.Comments on this Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace Architects article are welcome.Artificial IntelligenceArtificial IntelligenceInnovation Park Artificial Intelligence, Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg, south west GermanyDesign: MVRDV, Architectsbuilding design render © MVRDVInnovation Park Artificial Intelligence, Heilbronn, GermanyValue of Artificial Intelligence in Real Estateimage source : pixabay.comValue of Artificial Intelligence in Real EstateBuilding ArticlesResidential ArchitectureArchitects Office ListingsArchitectural NewsHouse DesignsComments / photos for the Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace Architects page welcomeCategories Articles designs, buildings Tags Virtual Reality VRStructural Engineers advanced software applicationsTop 10 LED mirror designs to transform bathroom",https://schema.org,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects'}, 'author': {'name': 'Isabelle Lomholt', '@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/#/schema/person/8dce2c492b2489855be6d2e2fd3a77fa'}, 'headline': 'Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Architects', 'datePublished': '2024-07-03T23:05:17+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-07-17T05:18:00+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects'}, 'wordCount': 610, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.e-architect.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects-g180822-p1.jpg', 'keywords': ['Virtual Reality VR'], 'articleSection': ['Articles designs, buildings'], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects', 'url': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects', 'name': 'Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Architects - e-architect', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.e-architect.com/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.e-architect.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/will-artificial-intelligence-replace-architects-g180822-p1.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-07-03T23:05:17+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-07-17T05:18:00+00:00', 'description': 'One of the features of the conversation around artificial intelligence is job anxiety.

The American College of Radiology (ACR) has established the Assess-AI Registry and AI-Lab in an effort help with validating and tracking AI QA for FDA-cleared algorithms.Today, there are more than 340 AI algorithms cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a large number of these are for medical imaging. ""Radiologists want to know AI will be safe and effective for their patients. In other words, they want to make sure it's trust worthy,"" explained Bibb Allen, MD, FACR, chief medical officer of the ACR Data Science Institute and former ACR president. According to Allen, there are lingering concerns that medical imaging AI algorithms may have been validated on datasets that were too small, limited by single center evaluations using specific scanners and settings or with limited diversity in the datasets. Allen said his hospital in Alabama has a much different patient population with a very high rate of obesity and metabolic issues as compared to patients from a hospital in Utah or the West Coast. ""It's not surprising that an algorithm performs well in a test environment,"" Allen explained.He said AI vendors will tell you their products work better than average quality benchmarks based on their testing.""Well that's great, but come and see what will work at our practice in Alabama where we have rampant hypertension and obesity,"" Allen said. He explained there are not standard industry pathways to validate AI to offer assurances that it will work and be trustworthy in all settings. There are variables in patient populations, between males and females, by region, ethnicity and socio-economic levels. ""We are recommending to the end users that they evaluate the models using their own patient data and by using an enriched dataset,"" Allen explained. ""We want them to put in the hard cases so they can say 'OK, the AI found this one, and this was a case that was hard for me.' Equally important is the real-world monitoring.""He said data drift, changes in imaging equipment used, settings on the scanners and software updates might have an impact on the AI software. So, like the scanners themselves, or even the PACS monitors used to read studies, QA needs to be performed to guarantee the AI is working properly. This is especially important when it is relied on for critical findings, computer-aided detection (CAD), when modifying images for things like bone removal, or performing complex qualification that is used to determine patient treatments or next steps. ""The AI is always going to work best the day you plug it in, and then there is going to be some performance degradation over time. So keeping track of that and understanding why it breaks is important,"" Allen said. For example, if you have a portable X-ray system for chest X-rays with a built-in AI pneumothorax detector, it is possible that over time it might not work as well as it used to. ""If you have the data on the AI model's performance in a registry where you track each portable X-ray system, you might recognize that this is not the same X-ray unit as the one you did a software upgrade, and now the model is not performing as well as it used to,"" Allen said. ""The registry can help you figure out what you changed and what you need to do to fix it.""He said AI developers also could use these insights to build better algorithms and understand what technical factors may impact the performance of their AI.These are the goals of the ACR Assess-AI Registry, Allen explained. Like the medical imaging radiation dose index registry and others created by the ACR, he said these are tools to help set baselines and monitor quality over time. And not just for one site or health system, but for all of radiology, because the pooled data will help identify problems and solutions over time. ACR offers radiology AI test platform to evaluate algorithmsThe ACR Data Institute has created a searchable online catalog with information on all the FDA-cleared AI algorithms for radiology. Allen said it is too difficult to test all the AI models that are out there, so this can help narrow the list. The ACR Data Science Institute also has a website called AI-Lab, which allows people test an algorithm on premises or in a secure cloud using their own dataset. Allen said users also can compare one algorithm to another to test their performance. ""Because the models can be brittle and they may not work as well outside of where they were trained, you will want to be able to do an evaluation,"" Allen said. ""AI-Lab allows people to query, retrieve and create a test set and then actually run a model and test the performance. You also can compare one algorithm to another.""Integration into workflow is key to AI adoption""Once an AI algorithm is adopted, it needs to be integrated into the workflow,"" Allen said. ""If you have to go to another computer to use a fracture detection AI, nobody is going to use that."" Allen said it needs to be clear with any AI algorithm that is adopted that it must be integrated into the usual radiologist or clinical workflow or it will never be used. This is where it is important to bring in the hospital IT team so they can coordinate with the AI vendor to ensure this can happen.Creating a team approach to AI Hospitals first need to decide what is needed to get out of using AI, what is needed to support the software and the specific problems that need to be solved. A team should be created with key stakeholders so they all understand issues related to implementation and how the AI needs to be integrated into the workflow so everyone is on the same page. Allen said the level of involvement of the IT department may differ depending on the size of the institution. ""One thing that we worry about is that while places like Stanford, Emory and other big academic institutions can do a lot of stuff with AI in-house because they have researchers and they have all this infrastructure, for most of us, and particularly in community hospitals, many are suffering from the fact that IT teams are maxed out,"" Allen explained. ""They are busy putting out fires and they don't have the bandwidth for a lot of new projects.""He said this issue was the impetus for ACR to build the AI-Lab to make it easier for IT and radiology departments to do validation testing before they implement an algorithm. Hear more of the interview with Allen in the VIDEO: Validation monitoring for radiology AI to ensure accuracy.Editor's note: Allen is also a radiologist at the Birmingham Radiological Group and the radiology residency program director at Brookwood Baptist Health in Birmingham.

He used a service called Midjourney to create images resembling Stålenhag’s spooky style, and posted them to Twitter.Guadamuz says he created the images to highlight the legal and ethical questions that algorithms that generate art may raise. Midjourney is just one of many AI programs capable of churning out art on demand in response to a text prompt, using machine learning algorithms that have digested millions of labeled images from the web or public data sets. After that training, they can conjure up almost any combination of objects and scenes and can reproduce the styles of individual artists with uncanny accuracy.Featured VideoHow A.I.

What is the Future for Managers in the Age of AI? 

Rob Press -
August 19, 2022





Illustration: © IoT For All























In 2020, the World Economic Forum released “The Future of Jobs Report” which made all sorts of astonishing predictions about how artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and automation would alter the workforce over the next five years. The most startling prediction – one that’s been echoed by other industry analysts and futurists – is that 85 million jobs will be eliminated by A, and 97 million new ones will be created. This leaves us with a few burning questions. To begin with, which jobs are going to be eliminated, if any? AI tools are already being used to assist with management tasks such as customer service, HR, and accounting. Let’s explore some of the recent research being conducted in this field and take a look at the skills that may be required of workforce managers in the age of AI.
'AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether.' -Rob Press

Will AI Take Over Management?
As AI has grown more advanced in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, there has been a lot of talk about it potentially taking over roles traditionally held by humans. This is particularly true in the case of management positions, where some people fear that AI will soon be able to do the job better than humans. Thankfully, research indicates that AI is more likely to work alongside us rather than instead of us:
In the 2020 Deloitte Human Capital Trends Report, 64 percent of respondents viewed AI as a means of assisting current roles and making them more efficient.66 percent of respondents of the Deloitte report expected more jobs to be generated and pre-existing jobs to be altered.2021 IDC FutureScape found that only a fifth of companies will gain value from AI management if humans aren’t involved or are replaced.
Markus Schmitt of Germany-based Data Revenue gave CMS Wire the following statement: “Even if 70 percent of the jobs would be taken by AI, it doesn’t necessarily mean that even one manager will lose his job. In this way, AI is no different from any other tool in the workplace, such as email, Excel, or a marketing automation tool. You could argue for each of these tools that they replaced 70 percent of the work for some managers, but it didn’t replace them, it just supported them in getting more done. It became second nature, and no one is questioning it.”
AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether. Human interaction is still required for the tasks we fear will be taken over, so there is no need to fear for the livelihoods of our managers just yet.
The Role of AI in Management
Artificial intelligence is becoming more advanced by the second, but not so advanced that it can make human-like correlations between different tasks and departments in the workplace. Instead, AI is mostly used to speed up, automate, and polish processes to save time and money and eliminate errors. You might have used AI already if your company employs accounting software, CMS, scheduling software, or other efficiency-based organizational tools like staff scheduling software.
Gartner has identified four main areas where AI is currently of use in workplace management:
HR administrative functions (admin HR): Core organizational and employee dataHR service management (HRSM): Policies, case management, organizational procedures, and processesTalent Management: recruitment, onboarding, retention and turnover monitoring, performance dataWorkforce management (WFM): Absence management, time capture, time and attendance, tasks/activities, budgeting, forecasting, and scheduling
According to John Brownridge of Deloitte, the work areas “ripe for disruption” are the large-scale data-based tasks that involve plenty of repetition and that run based on a set of rules. Tasks that directly relate to how an organization generates value, however, like using AI-collected data to make decisions about hiring and firing, are best left to the human brain.
Skills Necessary for Managers in the Age of AI
As AI tools begin to disrupt the workplace across the areas mentioned, managers won’t necessarily be losing their jobs in droves, but they will need to acquire new skills in order to fully understand and make use of machine learning in their day-to-day tasks. There are a few specific skills that will help managers to stand out as ideal candidates in the age of AI:
#1: Emotional Intelligence
According to a Capgemini survey, 74 percent of executives believe that emotional intelligence will become an essential skill. The demand for EI is expected to increase by up to six times as AI grows more prevalent. In the age of artificial intelligence, we need to retain those people who can connect with others and who can display empathy, understanding, and humanity in the workplace. Emotional AI is rapidly advancing in terms of being able to decipher human feelings, but it’s a long way from being able to operate as an emotional being in the workplace.
#2: Human-AI Cooperation
Richard Baldwin, the leading globalization expert, wrote a book, The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work, in which he outlined three action steps for success in the age of AI:
Avoid competing with AI: Understand that it is simply better at processing information at scale.Build skills in human-only areas (emotional intelligence, questioning, strategy, creativity, dexterity, empathy-based social skills).View your humanity as a competitive edge instead of a handicap or disadvantage.
From these points, we can conclude that the best way to stay relevant is to work alongside artificial intelligence, fill the gaps it creates, and see how its capabilities can complement – not compete against – our own.
#3: STEM Skills
The third skill set that managers should be pursuing is one relating to STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). A recent study found a strong link between increased investment in AI and increased demand for STEM skills. Interestingly, firms that transition to AI usually move to a more educated workforce of people who understand the science behind new technologies. These people are considered more adept at being able to work with new technologies.
What Does the Future Hold?
The latest industry research points to a need for managers to reframe the way they view AI disruption. Instead of being threatened, understand that you can gain the skills required to work alongside this technology. You can fill the gaps artificial intelligence cannot fill and use it to your advantage in the workplace.

The most startling prediction – one that&#039;s been echoed by other industry analysts and futurists – is that 85 million jobs will be eliminated by A, and 97 million new ones will be created. This leaves us with a few burning questions. To begin with, which jobs are going to be eliminated, if any? AI tools are already being used to assist with management tasks such as customer service, HR, and accounting. Let&#039;s explore some of the recent research being conducted in this field and take a look at the skills that may be required of workforce managers in the age of AI. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:social-warfare/click-to-tweet {&quot;hasFocus&quot;:true,&quot;tweetText&quot;:&quot;&#039;AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether.&#039; -Rob Pressnn#IoTForAll&quot;,&quot;displayText&quot;:&quot;&#039;AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether.&#039; -Rob Pressn&quot;} --&gt;  &lt;!-- /wp:social-warfare/click-to-tweet --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Will AI Take Over Management? &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; As AI has grown more advanced in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, there has been a lot of talk about it potentially taking over roles traditionally held by humans. This is particularly true in the case of management positions, where some people fear that AI will soon be able to do the job better than humans. Thankfully, research indicates that AI is more likely to work alongside us rather than instead of us: &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:list --&gt; In the 2020 Deloitte Human Capital Trends Report, 64 percent of respondents viewed AI as a means of assisting current roles and making them more efficient.66 percent of respondents of the Deloitte report expected more jobs to be generated and pre-existing jobs to be altered.2021 IDC FutureScape found that only a fifth of companies will gain value from AI management if humans aren’t involved or are replaced. &lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Markus Schmitt of Germany-based Data Revenue gave CMS Wire the following statement: “Even if 70 percent of the jobs would be taken by AI, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that even one manager will lose his job. In this way, AI is no different from any other tool in the workplace, such as email, or Excel, or a marketing automation tool. You could argue for each of these tools that they replaced 70 percent of the work for some managers, but it didn&#039;t replace them, it just supported them in getting more done. It became second nature, and no one is questioning it.” &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether. Human interaction is still required for the tasks we fear will be taken over, so there is no need to fear for the livelihoods of our managers just yet. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; The Role of AI in Management &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Artificial intelligence is becoming more advanced by the second, but not so advanced that it can make human-like correlations between different tasks and departments in the workplace. Instead, AI is mostly used to speed up, automate, and polish processes to save time and money and to eliminate error. You might have used AI already if your company employs accounting software, CMS, scheduling software, or other efficiency-based organizational tools like staff scheduling software. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Gartner has identified four main areas where AI is currently of use in workplace management: &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:list {&quot;ordered&quot;:true} --&gt; HR administrative functions (admin HR): Core organizational and employee dataHR service management (HRSM): Policies, case management, organizational procedures, and processesTalent Management: recruitment, onboarding, retention and turnover monitoring, performance dataWorkforce management (WFM): Absence management, time capture, time and attendance, tasks/activities, budgeting, forecasting, and scheduling &lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; According to John Brownridge of Deloitte, the work areas “ripe for disruption” are the large-scale data-based tasks that involve plenty of repetition and that run based on a set of rules. Tasks that directly relate to how an organization generates value, however, like using AI-collected data to make decisions about hiring and firing, are best left to the human brain. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Skills Necessary for Managers in the Age of AI &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; As AI tools begin to disrupt the workplace across the areas mentioned, managers won’t necessarily be losing their jobs in droves, but they will need to acquire new skills in order to fully understand and make use of machine learning in their day-to-day tasks. There are a few specific skills that will help managers to stand out as ideal candidates in the age of AI: &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #1: Emotional Intelligence &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; According to a Capgemini survey, 74 percent of executives believe that emotional intelligence will become an essential skill.

A lack of cybersecurity experts in government is compounding the problem.,,Opinions,,"As millions of people transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, criminals took advantage of the increased volume of online activity.Scams proliferated, according to the FBI. Human traffickers and drug cartels, long seeking ways to circumvent regulators and law enforcement, refined their money laundering through online marketplaces and cryptocurrencies that afforded anonymity while connecting buyers and sellers, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported.To adapt to these threats, regulators and law enforcement authorities began to turn to artificial intelligence and machine learning to battle bad actors. These tools help officials spot trends and set rules to help banks and other institutions identify and report suspicious transactions.Regulators, law enforcement and banks have similar priorities, though they often consider them through different lenses. Banks want to find bad actors and report them. Policymakers need to create legal guidelines to help banks spot them. Law enforcement investigators recognize that innovative technology provides the best tools for identifying and shutting down human traffickers, drug rings, and other crime syndicates.The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 laid out a framework to stop the exploitation of the data and technology that facilitates cybercrimes. The law has yet to come into full effect as regulators work out details. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules to crack down on financial cybercrimes, and Congress has warned that ransomware victims don’t always report attacks.Regulators need to expedite their rulemaking associated with AMLA, and the SEC should do the same. Likewise, Congress should act to address the lack of consolidated data regarding ransomware and crime involving cryptocurrency and use discussions about the proposed ENABLER Act, which would amend AMLA to fill loopholes.These efforts, while essential, will fall short unless regulators, law enforcement, and the private sector accept that the main vulnerability regarding cybercrime is people.Around 95 percent of cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error, as the World Economic Forum found. A lack of cybersecurity experts is compounding the problem. The private sector needs around 400,000 more of these professionals to tackle new threats.Even if government agencies and financial institutions could hire everyone they needed tomorrow, they would still need AI and machine learning to manage the deluge of cybercrime that is now routine. The massive scale of online activity and the scope of the cyberthreat today is too large for teams of people of any size to handle, even in the public sector. AI and machine learning can take on that work, with three unique benefits for regulators and law enforcement officials seeking to crack down on cybercrime in the post-pandemic era.Finding the ‘unknown unknowns’AI helps officials in the discovery process, finding so-called “unknown unknowns,” or problems that remain hidden from regulators, as well as patterns in data across multiple firms and systems that point to emerging threats and new behavior patterns.Consider how so-called romance scams in Southeast Asia have reportedly escalated in recent years from individuals seducing victims online and stealing their money into sprawling criminal organizations that oversee human trafficking, forced labor, and violence throughout the region.Law enforcement can assemble and pour over the data to discover who was perpetrating these crimes only one case at a time. Multiple jurisdictions and currencies make their job even harder. AI and machine learning, in contrast, augment their domain expertise, helping them connect the subtle clues in numerous data streams to reveal clandestine wrongdoing.Reducing false positivesNinety-five percent of suspicious activity reports are false positives. Banks are inundating the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network with irrelevant SARs, wasting resources that regulators and financial institutions could put to better use in finding real crime. Using broader data sets to capture all known risks and reduce alerts, AI can cut down on false positives by more than 75 percent, discovering crime more effectively so resources can be refocused on other, more genuine threats.A virtuous cycle results, as they discover new crimes, regulators gain more knowledge and opportunities to update their approaches to catch new criminals.Building tools to go after worst offendersAI and machine learning can help law enforcement single out the worst bad actors and gather sufficient evidence against them.Identifying unknown relationships and linkages between entities and people, spotting unusual changes in behaviors across entities, digital tracking of activities, and other investigative technologies help law enforcement pinpoint the most mysterious and elusive bad actors perpetrating the most damaging crimes. Within mountains of data, AI can recognize the genuinely suspicious patterns and inconsistencies that are the telltale signs of drug and human trafficking organizations’ money laundering, for instance.In addition to automatically building new cases with data, over time, machine learning allows AI to gain knowledge from, and improve on, these investigative processes. Officials therefore have a better chance of catching the biggest fish as their AI gains ‘experience in the field.’Mark Tice is the head of the public sector business at SymphonyAI.Share:In Other NewsFederal watchdog investigates Secret Service handling at Trump rallyPresident Joe Biden already had directed an independent review of the security at the rally.Ask Kevin: What’s the legal basis for the Part B late enrollment fee?A reader asks if the enrollment penalty is statutory.Ask Reg: Can I negotiate my federal salary offer?Departments and agencies vary in the latitude they give their supervisors and managers to vary the step they offer to a prospective employee.Ask Kevin: Why am I paying IRMAA on top of my Medicare Part B premium?A reader asks why they are subject to a Medicare Income-Related Monthly Adjustment AmountAsk Reg: How long does it take to be vested for federal pension?A reader asks if their military service counts toward their retirement eligibility.Load More",http://schema.org,,NewsArticle,,Federal government using artificial intelligence to fight cybercrime,"{'url': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/resizer/whLbWOhsqrJyoqBh1xV1Kg-oavM=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/4QKV5VPGBJFSVBHXSXAGN2Y3RM.jpg', '@type': 'ImageObject'}",2022-08-18T18:00:20.260Z,2022-08-18T19:30:33.243Z,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mark Tice'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Federal Times', 'url': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png?d=124'}}","{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/'}",https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/,Opinions,Federal Times,,,,,,,,,/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.federaltimes.com/#publisher,,,,,,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/FederalTimes', 'https://twitter.com/federaltimes']",,,,,,,,,,https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/,,,,,,,,,,,
