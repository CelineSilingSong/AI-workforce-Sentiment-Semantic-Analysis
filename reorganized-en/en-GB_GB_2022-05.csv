Human Vs. Artificial Intelligence: Why Finding The Right Balance Is Key To SuccessAdobe Stock

In short, now that we have increasingly capable robots and artificial intelligence (AI) systems – capable of taking on tasks that were previously the sole domain of humans – it’s easier than ever for organizations to leverage intelligent machines. But this leaves employers with some major questions to answer: how do we find the right balance between intelligent machines and human intelligence? What roles should be given over to machines? And which roles are best suited to humans?

The first step: Understanding what machines can do

Particularly in traditional companies, business leaders often aren’t up to speed on the sheer range of tasks that today’s AIs and intelligent robots can take on. (In fact, I spend a lot of time educating executives in this area.) This knowledge is key to finding the right balance between humans and machines in your organization.

PROMOTED
Some of the things AIs and AI-enabled robots can do are pretty mind-blowing. For example, AIs can now read, write, see, speak and even understand emotions. While this sounds impressive, AIs are, for the most part, taking one type of input (be it visual data, written data, or whatever) and generating a particular output, as programmed. Once you understand this basic input-to-output idea, there’s potential to automate all sorts of tasks that follow this same model, such as scanning security videos for suspicious behavior, moderating content online, answering simple customer inquiries, entering data, and maintaining bookkeeping records, and so on.
As Stanford professor Andrew NG puts it, “If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.” In other words, human jobs that are built on some sort of input-to-output scenario are very likely to be automated in the future.

So what will happen to human workers?
In light of this incoming wave of automation, the work of humans will be affected in three key ways:

· Displacement of human jobs. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020, 85 million jobs may be displaced by automation by 2025 – truly a staggering figure. Naturally, this creates a lot of fear around automation. But while many jobs will be displaced, it’s important to note that even more jobs will be augmented or created because of technology adoption. Which brings us to…

· Augmentation of human jobs. Here, many jobs will be changed in some way by automation. According to the WEF, by 2025, the time spent on current tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal. This means employers must find the perfect balance between those tasks done by humans and those done by machines. To put it another way, we need to ensure the work given to machines is best suited to machines, and the work given to humans is best suited to humans (so humans don’t end up feeling like machines).
· Addition of new human jobs. Finally, new jobs will arise that previously did not exist. While the WEF estimates that 85 million jobs may be displaced, it also estimates that 97 million new roles may emerge – roles that are better adapted to the new division of labor between humans and machines. These new human roles are likely to rely on a slightly different set of skills and capabilities, compared to those skills that have traditionally been prioritized in the past.
All this means employers have a responsibility to equip their workforces with the skills needed for the fourth industrial revolution. What sort of skills are we talking about? Well, with machines taking on more of the easily automated input-to-output work, it’s the inherently human skills that will become more and more valuable in the workplace. Things like empathy, creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication, and complex decision making, to name just a few.
“Responsible automation” in practice
Stitch Fix is a fashion subscription box that uses AI to pick out clothes that customers will love. But the company doesn’t just rely on AI to do this; it’s the perfect blend of AI and human stylists that makes the service so impressive.
At Stitch Fix, machines do the initial work of crunching through enormous amounts of data and evaluating the likelihood of a customer loving a particular style, based on the customer’s information, preferences and previous choices. Then a human stylist finalizes the selection and writes a personal note advising the client on how to style the items.
For me, this is a fantastic example of getting the best out of both machines and humans, and it’s something many organizations could learn from. This perfect symbiosis between intelligent machines and capable humans is referred to by automation pioneers Faethm as “responsible automation.” Faethm is on a mission to ensure automation is done in a way that doesn’t leave humans behind, and the company’s approach involves breaking jobs down into task fractions to see what can and can’t be automated. Done this way, automation – at least according to Faethm – doesn’t have to result in job losses. Instead, humans transition to more rewarding tasks.
The key takeaway here is that organizations must start to identify the tasks that are better suited to machines so that those tasks can be automated, leaving humans to do the more complex, rewarding work. And on top of this, employers must equip their workforces with the skills that will be essential for success in the 21st century.

As her parents run a local tennis club in Wales, she was immersed in the sport from the age of 14.One aspect she has noticed is the embrace of technology, at all levels of tennis.""Tennis is such a technical sport. These days, anyone I play or coach is into tech, be it video analysis or longest rally stats.""She uses a range of apps and techniques for her own matches and coaching including a smartphone-based video system called SwingVision, which breaks down her performance with details such as forehand errors and backhand winners. ""Personally, I like having the tech to enhance my game. I can see a clearer vision of what I can improve, from my swing to my patterns of play,"" she explains.Data analytics has been around a long time in sport. Perhaps the best known in example of its use is from 2002, when the Oakland Athletics baseball team used statistical analysis to choose their squad, rather than the wisdom of coaches and scouts, and their favoured metrics.Getty ImagesEven Hollywood has taken an interest in data analytics with the movie Moneyball starring Brad Pitt and Jonah HillThat experience was the core of Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball, which later become a film staring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.Tennis has also seen this revolution. ""Data blew up our sport,"" says tennis strategist and coach Craig O'Shannessy.For him the 2015 Australian Open was a key moment.As Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray battled on court, powerful computers crunched the data and grouped rally length into three distinct categories, essentially short, medium and long. Getty ImagesIn tennis the 2015 Australian Open final was a big moment for data analysis says Craig O'Shannessy""We discovered 70% of all points were each player hitting the ball into the court a maximum of just twice,"" he says.Mr O'Shannessy, who worked with Novak Djokovic between 2017 to 2019, says that insight made him realise that the way players practice was all wrong.""Ninety percent of practice is focused on consistency, but only 10% of the match court is in rallies of more than 9 points,"" he points out.""This data changed our sport forever,"" he says.Craig O'ShannessyCraig O'Shannessy worked with Novak Djokovic for two yearsThat manipulation of data has been taken to a new level.Coaches now have artificial intelligence (AI), where sophisticated software is fed, or trained, with unimaginable amounts of data. The resulting AI can spot patterns that a human would never be able to see.""AI can sniff out areas of significances. Humans do a very bad job at layering data, whereas AI can do it in seconds,"" says Mr O'Shannessy.So, for example, if Novak Djokovic hits 50 winners from his forehand those shots could be broken down in multiple ways or layers. Perhaps 40 of them came when he was serving and then 35 came on the first shot after the serve.Finding a pattern of play where Novak hits 35 out of 50 winners in exactly same way is a first, according to Mr O'Shannessy.""We've stumbled around for decades trying to bring all this together.""AI requires vast amounts of data to train and build accurate algorithms. Getty ImagesPlayers have access to even more data than ever at this year's French OpenRaghavan Subramanian is the head of the Infosys Tennis Platform and has been working with the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) since 2015 and with The French Open (also known as Roland Garros) for more than three years.He has access to videos and statistics from around 700 matches every year. ""Valuable data that forms the raw material for all our AI and machine learning systems,"" says Mr Subramanian. He said accuracy has improved over the past four years, as more training data has become available.From the player's point of view it means they can analyse a match with more precision. Using the Roland Garros Players App, they can see exactly the placement of key shots, such as winners, errors and serves.InfosysRaghavan Subramanian says the Infosys AI gets more accurate with each tournamentBBC: Live French Open scores and order of play""We saw a 51% jump in the use of the RG Players App in 2021, compared to the previous year, with 1,100 players and coaches using AI-powered videos,"" says Mr Subramanian.The AI is also speeding up media coverage of the tournament. AI is slicing and dicing data to create video content in seconds, a job that would normally take a multimedia team hours to do.""Fans are able to access and analyse match highlights and other smart playlists almost immediately after a match.""

They build cars in factories. They sort goods in Amazon warehouses. Robotic dogs can, allegedly and a little creepily, make us safer by patrolling our streets. But there are some things robots still cannot do – things that sound quite basic in comparison. Like picking an apple from a tree.“It’s a simple thing” for humans, says robotics researcher Joe Davidson. “You and I, we could close our eyes, reach into the tree. We could feel around, touch it, and say ‘hey, that’s an apple and the stem’s up here’. Pull, twist. We could do all that without even looking.”Creating a robotic implement that can simply pick an apple and drop it into a bin without damaging it is a multimillion-dollar effort that has been decades in the making. Teams around the world have tried various approaches. Some have developed vacuum systems to suck fruit off trees. Davidson and his colleagues turned to the human hand for inspiration. They began their efforts by observing professional fruit pickers, and are now working to replicate their skilled movements with robotic fingers.Their work could help to transform agriculture, turning fruit-picking – a backbreaking, time-consuming human task – into one that’s speedy and easier on farm workers.These efforts have gained impetus recently as researchers point to the worsening conditions for farm workers amid the climate crisis, including extreme heat and wildfire smoke, and also a shortage of workers in the wake of the pandemic. The technology could lead to better working conditions and worker safety. But that outcome depends on how robots are deployed in fields, farm workers’ organizations say.While robotic tools for agriculture have made big strides in recent years, those AI-based tools are mostly used for weeding, monitoring soil moisture and other field conditions, or for planting soybeans using remote-controlled tractors. “But when it actually comes to doing physical work like pruning trees or picking fruit, that’s still the realm of people today,” Davidson says.Teaching robots to perform these tasks requires modernized versions of both the orchard and the apple.Traditional orchards, with irregularly shaped trees and giant canopies, are too much of a challenge for algorithms to parse and process. Shifting sunbeams, fog and clouds add to computer vision’s challenges. Tangled, tall old trees are problematic even to human pickers, who end up spending much of their time hauling and positioning ladders, not picking fruit.Now, many growers have transitioned to orchards where trees grow flat against trellises, their trunks and branches at right angles to create a “wall of fruit”, says Scott Jacky, owner of Red Roof Consulting, a group that helps optimize farm technologies. The thinner canopy also lets more sunlight in, encouraging fruits to form.Since the 1990s, breeders have been working to develop apple varieties more resistant to sunburn – a side-effect of those sparser canopies – and less prone to bruising when dropped into bins. All these changes to the trees and the apples themselves make the job easier for robots (and for humans).In orchards with trellised trees, human fruit pickers can cruise through rows of trees in pairs on slowly rolling platforms. One person crouches to reach low-hanging fruit, the other reaches for the higher branches. Professionals working this way take about two seconds to pick one apple.The robot in Davidson’s lab, which is essentially a giant arm mounted on a rolling platform, takes about five seconds to make its moves. At the click of a key, the robotic arm reaches up for the fruit – actually a plastic apple made for testing purposes – with its three-fingered palm. Its fingers are covered in cushiony silicone “skin”, which conceals individual motors wired to tendons that drive its fingers. Thirty sensors under each fingertip track the pressure, speed, angle and other aspects of its grasp to help the robot complete its task.Another keystroke and the fingers tighten, then twist, and the apple – successfully picked – rests in the robot’s palm.The fruit-picking robot has picked an apple successfully about half of the 500 or so times it has tried so far. Still, the robotic arm has cracked some problems that posed hurdles to automation. For instance, it can avoid damaging both fruit and tree limbs in the harvesting process. Rapid improvements in computing make Davidson and others hopeful the robots will work on farms within the next five to 10 years.The US government is placing significant bets on this technology. Last year alone, federal funding agencies granted $20m to support the AgAID institute, a new group that supports several researchers, including Davidson, in efforts to develop artificial intelligence-backed tools for agriculture.Proponents of harvest automation say there will still be jobs for people, such as training and operating the robots. “There are going to be plenty of tasks where the robotic instruments and digital devices will necessarily have to work with humans,” said Ananth Kalyanaraman, professor at Washington State University and director of the AgAID institute. “That’s going to actually empower humans because it gives them new skillsets.”For now, it’s unclear to many farm workers how the robots will affect their livelihood. “If they’re used properly, they can actually be a support system for workers and improve standards at work,” says Reyna Lopez, executive director of PCUN, a Latinx farm workers’ organization in Oregon.But so far, Lopez and others say they have not been involved in conversations about the fruit-picking robots. “Historically, farm workers have not been placed at the center of any of these conversations,” they say. Across various industries, including agriculture, waves of automation have led to job losses and a devaluing of human work. Often in the wake of such shifts, “what happens to low-wage workers is that people lose their jobs,” Lopez says.The emergence of robotic farm workers could even be an opportunity for humans to engage in different – and far less strenuous – work than pruning or harvesting, says Ines Hanrahan, executive director of the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission. “There’s a lot of folks in rural communities who, even if they would like to, physically cannot do these jobs,” she says.“When you take the physical aspect out, these tasks become more accessible to older workers or those less physically capable of lugging ladders and things. It enables more people to be drawn into this work.”Explore more on these topicsOut of sight: the algorithms running our livesArtificial intelligence (AI)AgriculturefeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year, LinkedIn named data scientist specialists and artificial intelligence practitioners among the top jobs that enterprises sought to fill. The salary range for an artificial intelligence practitioner is $124,000 to $150,000. For a data scientist specialist, the salary range is $100,000 to $130,000. Compare this with the average U.S. salary for programmers, which is under $100,000.
If you’re working for a company, you want to make as much money as you can — but you also want to enjoy what you’re doing, and you want the self-confidence and assurance that you’re providing value in your job and that you yourself are valued.

Sometimes an IT professional can feel trapped in a job, with no way out for promotions or a higher salary. Software maintenance programmers often fit into this category. So do non-technical business analysts or IT support persons who have spent so much time managing databases, storage and the help desk that they are recognized as entrenched experts in these areas, which unfortunately can be a career dead-end in IT.
Is it time to try AI?
The requisite skills for a data scientist specialist are knowledge in data visualization, statistical modeling and open-source tools and libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. For artificial intelligence practitioners, the skill set is machine learning, C++, Python and cloud services such as Amazon Web Services.

Learn AI job-seeking strategies
If you’re an IT employee who wants to transition to AI, what skills will you need and what strategies should you apply?
Check in with yourself
At first blush it might seem very attractive to increase your salary by 30-40% by moving over to AI, but is AI the right fit for you?
A majority of IT professionals like to feel that they are in control. They like the idea of working toward predefined goals and deadlines for deliverables. AI doesn’t offer that.
The machine learning that is part of AI might direct an AI project and its outcomes into entirely different directions than the project initiators thought. Some AI projects fail after many months of effort. Data scientists who come from an academic background are used to this uncertainty, but IT professionals who are accustomed to hard deadlines and results aren’t.
If you can’t live with the uncertainty, then AI probably isn’t a good fit for you.
Evaluate the skills you’ll need
If you’re a database professional, skills in SQL and NoSQL databases are important. You should also plan on acquiring working knowledge of graph databases, which are often used in AI systems.
If you are an application programmer, knowledge of Python, C++, Java, Julia and R are important.
If you’re a business analyst, it’s important to keep your business knowledge up-to-date so you can assist users in formulating use cases and questions for AI, but you should also be conversant in statistical analysis and algorithm development so you can talk with data scientists.
Make your own AI opportunity
In some cases, companies will assist employees in making a career change to AI by providing them with AI project work. In other cases, companies prefer to hire outside talent.
If you are in a company that doesn’t have AI opportunities for existing employees, you can still acquire AI training by attending college or university classes outside of work.
The next step is finding opportunities to work on actual AI projects so you can put these real world projects (and the new skills you are using) on your resume. Networking through your school is a good place to start when it comes to finding actual AI project work.

Companies know all too well how hard it is to find and hire a qualified software engineer, especially in emerging fields like artificial intelligence (AI). Job hunters are also frustrated because they don’t know exactly what companies are looking for.
So, what are the top skills which companies needs and candidate should master to become AI engineers? Here are the top technical skills and soft skills top engineers have:
Technical Skills
The top technical skills for AI engineers include:
Programming Languages
Python is the most widely used programming language for AI and is widely used for machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network connections.
However, Python is just one of the programming languages used. Some of the more popular languages used are:

Prolog
LISP
Java
C++
R

Algebra, Probability, and Statistics
AI engineers must understand the different types of AI models. That requires a firm grasp of linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
Common AI models include:

Linear regression
Logic regression
Decision trees
Linear discriminant analysis
Naïve Bayes classifiers
Support Vector Machines
Learning Vector Quantization
K-nearest Neighbors
Random Forest

Big Data Analysis
AI can incorporate massive data sets. AI engineers must be well-versed in the tools and processes for managing these large data sets. A background in Apache Spark architecture, Hadoop, Cassandra, and MongoDB will help.
Algorithms
Algorithms make many decisions within AI frameworks that are necessary to drive machine learning models. Deep learning algorithms, especially for unstructured data, require a framework for working. AI frameworks include tools such as PyTorch, Theano, TensorFlow, and Caffe.
Soft Skills
Going beyond the technical skills, however, employers are also looking for the soft skills that make AI engineers a fit for the workplace. This includes such skills as

 Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
Software development is about solving complex problems. 
For AI engineers, the ability to handle problems and solve them is an essential skill. This requires critical as well as creative thinking, and the flexibility to examine different solutions to determine the best path forward.
Communication Skills
AI teams often work both independently and together at different times during development. Communication is an essential function, especially if team members are working remotely. This requires both written and verbal communication skills and, depending on the project and organization, may require interfacing with clients or stakeholders.
Most people that you will be required to communicate with, will not have the technical skills or understanding of AI concepts. So, the AI engineers would be required to break down complex ideas into simplified language that can be understood by team members belonging to non-technical backgrounds.
Interpersonal Skills
An AI engineer is required to be able to work with team members effectively. This means displaying soft skills such as patience and empathy to help create productive interactions. This is especially crucial when AI engineers need to collaborate on projects.
It also means the ability to listen to others’ ideas with judgment and be willing to accept other solutions to problems besides just their own.
Self-Awareness
Self-awareness is the ability to see yourself as others see you. This helps you judge how your actions will affect others and interpret actions, thoughts, and feelings objectively. While self-confidence is an important soft skill, so is the ability to admit a weakness and seek help to fill in missing skills gaps.
Lifelong Learners
A survey by Stack Overflow found that 87% of software engineers responding to its survey had taught themselves a new technology or programming language. Three-quarters of software engineers and developers say they learn new skills every few months or at least once a year.
In emerging tech fields, continuous education is an essential skill. AI developers must be self-motivated and curious to stay on top of emerging trends and learn what’s needed to remain current.
Time Management
AI engineers are working on projects with deadlines and that are time-bound in most cases. Strong time management skills are essential to staying focused to meet milestones for deliverables.
Adaptability
In a rapidly evolving tech environment, the ability to adapt to changes and different ways of doing things can make a big difference. As more knowledge is gained, specifications change, or new tech evolves, AI engineers must be able (and willing) to adapt to new approaches.

And there's a limit to how much quality content a human can produce,"" Mr Mahoney says.""You can get the same quality of content using AI tools. You just get it faster.""How much faster? About three times, he estimates.He still has to check and edit the AI-generated text, but it's less work and he's cut his rates by half.""Every SEO [Search Engine Optimisation] agency that I've spoken with uses AI to some extent."" We asked GPT-3 to write a limerick for the ABC audience. It produced this in less than a second.(ABC Science: James Purtill)In Perth, Sebastian Marks no longer bothers with content agencies at all.About a year ago, he saw an ad for an AI writing assistant and signed up.The AI tool now writes pretty much everything for his company, Moto Dynamics, which sells motorcycles and organises racing events.Its output includes employee bios, marketing copy, social media posts, and business proposals.""Once we'd started feeding data into it and teaching it how to work for us, it became more and more user-friendly,"" he says.""Now we use it essentially as an admin.""Millions of words per minuteThe particular AI writing tool Mr Mahoney uses is called ContentBot, which like many of its competitors was launched early last year.""It was very exciting,"" says Nick Duncan, the co-founder of ContentBot, speaking from Johannesburg.""There was a lot of word of word of mouth with this technology. It just sort of exploded."" Released in April 2022, OpenAI's DALL-E 2 produces high-res conceptual art from text commands.(Supplied: OpenAI)The trigger for this explosion was OpenAI's November 2021 decision to make its GPT-3 AI universally available for developers.It meant anyone could pay to access the AI tool, which had been introduced in May 2020 for a limited number of clients.Dozens of AI writing tools launched in early 2021.LongShot AI is only a year old, but claims to have 12,000 users around the world, including in Australia.""And there are other products that would have ten-fold the number of clients we have,"" says its co-founder, Ankur Pandey, speaking from Mumbai.""Revolutionary changes in AI happened in the fall of 2020. This whole field has completely skyrocketed.""Companies like ContentBot and Longshot pay OpenAI for access to GPT-3: the rate of the most popular model (Davinci) is about $US0.06 per 750 words.In March 2021, GPT-3 was generating an average of 4.5 billion words per day.We don't know the current figure, but it would be much higher given the AI is being more widely used.""It's been a game changer,"" Mr Duncan says.What about student essays?There are dozens of AI writing tools that advertise to students.Among them is Article Forge, a GPT-3 powered tool that claims its essays can pass the plagiarism checkers used by schools and universities.Demand for the product has increased five-fold in two years, chief executive officer Alex Cardinell says.""It's the demand for cheaper content with shorter turnaround times that requires less overall effort to produce.""People do not want AI, they want what AI can do for their business.""Lucinda McKnight, a curriculum expert at Deakin University, confirms that students are early adopters of AI writing tools.""I can tell you without doubt that kids are very widely using these things, especially spinners on the internet.""Spinners are automated tools that rephrase and rewrite content so it won't be flagged for plagiarism.""It can produce in a matter of seconds multiple different copies of the same thing, but worded differently."" A screenshot of OpenAI's list of prices for using GPT-3.(Supplied: OpenAI)These developments are shifting ideas around student authorship. If it becomes impossible to distinguish AI writing from human, what's the point in trying to detect plagiarism?""We should be getting students to acknowledge how they've used AI as another kind of source for their writing,"" Dr McKnight says.""That is the way to move forwards, rather than to punish students for using them.""So, can AI write good?When GPT-3 launched two years ago, word spread of its writing proficiency, but access was limited.Recently, OpenAI has thrown open the doors to anyone with a guest login, which takes a few minutes to acquire.Given the prompt ""Write a news story about AI"", the AI tool burped out three paragraphs. Here's the first:""The world is on the brink of a new era of intelligence. For the first time in history, artificial intelligence (AI) is about to surpass human intelligence.

Facial recognition uses deep learning to ""see"" features like eyes and mouths.(Reuters: Thomas Peter)While working on ways to improve Google Translate, researchers at the company stumbled upon a deep learning model that proved to be good at predicting what word should come next in a sentence.Called Transformer, it's like a supercharged version of text messaging auto-complete.""Transformer is a very, very good statistical guesser,"" says Alan Thompson, an independent AI researcher and consultant.""It wants to know what is coming next in your sentence or phrase or piece of language, or in some cases, piece of music or image or whatever else you've fed to the Transformer.""At the same time, in parallel to Google, an Australian tech entrepreneur and data scientist, Jeremy Howard, was finding new ways to train deep learning models on large datasets. Jeremy Howard sold two successful start-ups before moving to Silicon Valley.Professor Howard, who would go on to become an honorary professor at the University of Queensland, had moved to San Francisco six years earlier, from Melbourne.He proposed feeding Transformer a big chunk of text data and seeing what happened.""So in 2018, the OpenAI team actually took Professor Jeremy Howard's advice and fed the original GPT with a whole bunch of book data into this Transformer model,"" Dr Thompson says.""And they watched as it was able to complete sentences seemingly out of nowhere.""Transformer is the basis for GPT (which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer), as well as other current language models.Professor Howard's contribution is widely recognised in Silicon Valley, but not so much in Australia, to which he recently returned.""In Australia, people will ask what do you do and I'll be like, 'I'm a professor in AI'. And they say, 'Oh well, how about the footy?'"" he says.""It's very, very different.""But how does the AI form sentences?The short answer is that, beyond a certain point, we don't know.AI like GPT-3 are known as ""black boxes"", meaning it's impossible to know the internal process of computation.The AI has trained itself to do a task, but how it actually performs that task is largely a mystery.""We've given it this training data and we've let it kind of macerate that data for months, which is the equivalent of many human years, or decades even,"" Dr Thompson says.""And it can do things that it shouldn't be able to do. It taught itself coding and programming. It can write new programmes that haven't existed.""As you might guess, this inability to understand exactly how the technology works is a problem for driverless cars, which rely on AI to make life-and-death decisions.Meanwhile, new and more powerful AIs are being unveiled almost every week.""I documented one coming out every 3-4 days in March through April,"" Dr Thompson says.""We've now got 30, 40, 50 different large language models [like GPT-3], and sometimes they're being released weekly.""GPT-4 is expected to be unveiled within months. Google this week also launched a text-to-image AI tool, Imagen, that may be better than DALL-E 2.(Supplied: Google Research)This week, Google's DeepMind released its most impressive AI yet, called Gato, which is designed to be good at lots of tasks.Its makers describe it as a precursor to an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a long-anticipated AI that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.In theory, potentially any human occupation could be replaced by an AGI.""We used to say that artificial general intelligence and the replacement of humans would be like 2045,"" Dr Thompson says.""I'm seeing the beginnings of AGI right now.""AI tools performing creative human tasks is no longer the stuff of science fiction, or something that will happen in 10 years' time.For Danny Mahoney in Melbourne, it's already begun.""I think people really underestimate how useful it is at this point,"" he says.""Anybody who spends any significant amount of time on the internet is reading AI content without even realising.""Posted 28 May 202228 May 2022Sat 28 May 2022 at 2:30pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesArtificial intelligence is making decisions that affect us and some of those choices aren't that smartWe asked an AI tool to 'paint' images of Australia.

						New EEOC Guidance: The Use of Artificial Intelligence Can Discriminate Against Employees or Job Applicants with Disabilities

As the use of artificial intelligence wedges its way into every side of business and culture, government regulation is (perhaps too slowly) moving to build legal boundaries around its use.
On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a new comprehensive “technical assistance” guidance entitled The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees. The guidance, which covers a number of areas, defines algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI); gives examples of how AI is used by employers; answers the question of employer liability for use of vendor AI tools; requires reasonable accommodation in deploying AI in this context; addresses the “screen out” problem of AI rejecting candidates who would otherwise qualify for the job with reasonable accommodation; requires limitations to avoid asking disability-related and medical questions; promotes “promising practices” for employers, job applicants, and employees alike; and gives many specific examples of disability discrimination pitfalls in using AI tools.
Here are some primary takeaways from the new guidance:
Employers Can Be Exposed to ADA Liability for AI Vendor Software:

Risk Exposure for Vendor Software. Employers who deploy AI-driven decision-making tools to evaluate employees or job applicants may be liable under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for the shortcomings of that technology. Even if the AI tool was developed or administered by a third party vendor, the employer can be on the hook — especially if the employer has “given [the vendor] authority to act on the employer’s behalf.”


On the Test Side and on the Accommodation Side. This means employers need to manage risk from the AI vendor’s action or inaction in administering the evaluation and in granting reasonable accommodations. If an individual requests a reasonable accommodation due to a disability and the vendor denies the request, the employer can be exposed for the vendor’s inaction despite being unaware of the request.


Check the Vendor Agreement. Employers should closely consider indemnity and other liability- limiting and allocating provisions of their AI vendor agreements.

Al Tools Can Unlawfully “Screen Out” Qualified Individuals with Disabilities:

Screen Outs. “Screen outs” in the AI context can occur when a disability lowers an individual’s performance in taking an AI-driven employment test, or prevents a candidate from consideration in the first place, for failure to meet AI-driven threshold criteria. Under the ADA, a screen out is unlawful if the tool screened out an individual who is able to perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation.


Examples. AI tools can screen out individuals with limited manual dexterity (to use a keyboard); who are sight, hearing, or speech impaired; who have employment gaps due to past disability issues; or who suffer from PTSD (thus skewing the results, for example, of personality tests or gamified memory tests).

Per the guidance: “A disability could have this [screen out] effect by, for example, reducing the accuracy of the assessment, creating special circumstances that have not been taken into account, or preventing the individual from participating in the assessment altogether.”

Bias Free? Some AI-based decision-making tools are marketed as “validated” to be “bias-free.” It sounds good, but that labelling may not speak to disabilities, as opposed to gender, age, or race. Disabilities — physical, mental, or emotional — cover a broad swath of life, can be highly individualized (including as to necessary accommodation), and as such are less susceptible to bias-free software adjustment. For example, learning disabilities can often go undetected by human observers because their severity and characteristics so widely vary. Employers will need assurances that AI can do better.

AI Screens Can Generate Unlawful Disability and Medical-Related Inquiries:

Unlawful Inquiries. AI-driven tools can generate unlawful “disability-related inquires” or seek information as part of a “medical examination” before approving candidates for conditional offers of employment.

Per the guidance: “An assessment includes ‘disability-related inquiries’ if it asks job applicants or employees questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability or directly asks whether an applicant or employee is an individual with a disability. It qualifies as a “medical examination” if it seeks information about an individual’s physical or mental impairments or health. An algorithmic decision-making tool that could be used to identify an applicant’s medical conditions would violate these restrictions if it were administered prior to a conditional offer of employment.”

Indirect Failure. Not all health-related inquiries by AI tools are considered “disability-related inquires or medical examination.”

Per the guidance: “[E]ven if a request for health-related information does not violate the ADA’s restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations, it still might violate other parts of the ADA. For example, if a personality test asks questions about optimism, and if someone with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) answers those questions negatively and loses an employment opportunity as a result, the test may ‘screen out’ the applicant because of MDD.”
Best Practices: Robust Notice of What is Being Measured — and that Reasonable Accommodation is Available:
There are a number of best practices employers can follow to manage the risk of using AI tools. The guidance calls them “Promising Practices.” Primary points:

Disclose the Topics and Methodology. As a best practice, regardless of whether a third-party vendor developed the AI software/tool/application, employers (or their vendors) should inform employees or job applicants — in plain, understandable terms — what the evaluation entails. In other words, disclose up front the knowledge, skill, ability, education, experience, quality, or trait that will be measured or screened with the AI tool. In the same vein, disclose up front how testing will conducted and what will required — using a keyboard, verbally answering questions, interacting with a chatbot, or what have you.


Invite Requests for Accommodation. Empowered with that information, an applicant or employee has more of an opportunity to speak up ahead of time if they feel some disability accommodation will be needed. As such, employers should consider asking employees and job applicants if they require a reasonable accommodation using the tool.




Obvious or Known Disability: If an employee or applicant with an obvious or known disability asks for an accommodation, the employer should promptly and appropriately respond to that request.






Otherwise-Concealed Disability: If the disability is otherwise unknown, the employer may ask for medical documentation.




Provide Reasonable Accommodation. Once the claimed disability is confirmed, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation even if that means providing an alternative testing format. This is where the guidance can truly come in conflict with the use of AI. As such tools become endemic, alternative testing may seem inadequate by comparison, and potential discrimination between AI-tested individuals and old-school tested individuals may arise.

Per the guidance: “Examples of reasonable accommodations may include specialized equipment, alternative tests or testing formats, permission to work in a quiet setting, and exceptions to workplace policies.”

Protect PHI. As always, any medical information obtained in relation to accommodation requests must be kept confidential and stored separately from the employee’s or applicant’s personnel file.

With the increasing reliance on AI in the private employer sector, employers will have to expand their proactive risk management so as to control for the unintended consequences of this technology. The legal standards remain the same, but AI technology may push the envelope of compliance. In addition to making a best effort in that direction, employers should closely review other means of risk management such as vendor contract terms and insurance coverage.

As federal investments in emerging technologies accelerate, community colleges, which have long prepared the “skilled technical STEM workforce” are taking on new roles to align emerging technology with talent development and expand equitable pathways to emerging jobs of the future. This is particularly true in ""innovation economy"" industries like autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence.Beyond the usual challenges associated with creating high-quality workforce programs, colleges must partner strategically with employers, government, and tech-based economic development entities to excel in this expanded role.I sat down with Intel’s Senior Director of AI and Digital Readiness Carlos Contreras to learn more about one major employer’s approach to expanding community college pathways to jobs of the future.How Intel partners with community colleges for AI education and workforce developmentLaunched in 2020, Intel’s AI Workforce program provides over 225 hours of AI content to community colleges, training for faculty, and implementation guidance to develop AI certificates, augment existing courses, or launch full AI associate degree programs for their students. Intel’s pre-packaged courses cover data analytics, AI ethics, natural language processing, AI model training, computer vision, and coding.Intel aims to have AI education at the community college level in all fifty states by 2023.Thirty-one schools in eighteen states have joined the program as of December 2021, and Intel and Dell Technologies have also funded the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) to create an AI community of practice that will expand AI offerings at community colleges to all fifty states by 2023. Later this year, the selected participants will be invited to join AACC's peer network, offered technical assistance, and awarded $40,000 to support their AI programming.“We can’t wait until AI is firmly established to train the workforce. At that point, it might be too late and jobs can go somewhere else. Our community colleges have an opportunity to establish themselves as AI community resources.”- Carlos Contreras, Senior Director for AI and Digital Readiness, Intel







What AI jobs are available to community college students?Contreras described Intel’s approach to the AI labor market as a pyramid, “At the top, you have top researchers, PhDs usually, followed by middle-skill workers, and entry-level workers towards the base of the pyramid.” Community colleges train for the latter two categories.So far, Intel has hired two community college interns, which resulted in Intel creating a new job category – AI engineering technicians. Miami Dade College, one of Intel’s partners, is training for “AI Specialist” roles while Ocean County College lists a number of regional employers and roles for graduates of its associate’s degree program.But it’s not just bachelor’s degree-level education that’s a focus for Intel and others in the tech industry.A report from Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology identified fifty-four occupations that constitute the AI workforce – and a notable share of the AI workforce has less than a bachelor’s degree. The researchers in a follow-on report and panel urged policymakers to support degree and non-degree community college-level AI education and for employers to embrace AI talent that has come up through non-degree pathways.Intel's college partners are only just graduating their first classes of students, so there isn’t outcomes data to report just yet.However, Intel plans to monitor student outcomes. Across their partnerships, some employers have committed internships and work-based learning opportunities and new non-profits like Hack.Diversity are helping to place Black and Latinx students from community colleges in AI jobs.

“The big advantage in having the program at our level is that Maricopa Community College District is a very diverse place and one of the big risks in AI is that if all of the work is done from one perspective, the AI can become bias, so it’s really important to have our diversity of voices participating in this [partnership].""- Chris Zagar - Computer Science Faculty at Estrella Mountain Community CollegeNot all colleges are focused solely on the entry or middle-skill AI workforce. Maricopa Community College District supported Intel’s suppliers with upskilling working professionals with university degrees. Contreras cited the ability of community colleges to be nimble, affordable, and willing to customize training programs, through bootcamps for example, as reasons why they are an ideal partner for upskilling.He also affirmed something I have heard from community college leaders like Antonio Delgado, Vice President of Technology Partnerships at Miami Dade College: Sometimes community colleges play the unexpected role of helping local employers identify opportunities for emerging technologies.“In some instances, community colleges are actually leading the conversation with local small businesses in terms of what capacity they're trying to build, so they're almost like ambassadors of AI technology.""- Carlos Contreras, Senior Director for AI and Digital Readiness, IntelWhen Maricopa Community College District conducted a job market analysis to map the skills included in its AI program with regional needs, they found that many financial sector employers including Wells Fargo and State Farm were seeking the same skills taught in their programs.Other colleges explored regional and sector-specific AI task use cases through new industry advisory boards with representation from the pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies in New Jersey or oil and gas companies in Texas.Based on this feedback, Intel soon hopes to build out new resources for colleges to create credentials and courses relevant to specific geographic and sector needs including in advanced manufacturing and healthcare.Emerging technologies can be infamous for their hype cycles, and community colleges must carefully navigate them when training for new kinds of jobs. In addition to employer partnerships, more colleges are working with tech-based economic development organizations which have a deep understanding of the innovation economy, workforce training needs, and risks.As AI matures over the next ten years, Intel, the AACC, community colleges, and a variety of intermediary partners believe that their programs will address labor market needs while creating paths for a more diverse and broader swath of society to benefit from jobs born out of the innovation economy.

Work on Pakistan’s first Artificial Intelligence lab under CPEC picks momentum

By INP









ISLAMABAD: Seventy-five percent work of Pakistan first high-standard artificial intelligence laboratory under CPEC at National University of Science and Technology (NUST) has been completed while the equipment installation is almost 100% finished, Gwadar Pro reported on Saturday.

At the beginning of this year, the laboratory under CPEC–Qingluan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was officially established at NUST, with joint efforts of NUST and Guangzhou Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Research, development and customization is currently underway. I would say work is almost finished to 75%.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir, Deputy Director of China Study Center of NUST told Gwadar Pro.
The lab has been put into full use, both students and teaching staff are keen on researching Pattern and Facial Recognition algorithms, the reporter learned.
“Currently, Cogniser-V1 intelligent video analysis project-a pilot project with the Government of Pakistan, and a commercial project, namely GymBot are the main projects that are under development.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir revealed.
“Ideally, Cognizer-V1 is one of the most sophisticated surveillance equipment, which has the capability of converting ordinary cameras and surveillance equipment into a Smart Equipment, using AI and Computer Vision Algorithms.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir said.

“To put it simple, the Cognizer-V1 has the ability to sense the people who are lurking around in certain areas and generate warnings, regarding dangerous behavioral patterns such as suicide, or other suspicious activities.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir said.
In the case of Pakistan, the country is blessed with a large number of artificial intelligence application scenarios and a huge market, thanks to its world’s 6th largest population. Moreover, the country is never short on talents.
However, challenges lie in the commercialization of scientific achievements– an important step which can be viewed as one of the sources for innovation.
Due to the backward industrial conditions and obstruction of international exchanges during the epidemic, the progress of commercialization in Pakistani scientific research institutes has been extremely slow.
“Our other key project, ‘GymBot’, can be a perfect example of science commercialization. It is designed to be a deep learning device, using AI and Computer Vision Algorithms and serve as an auxiliary tool under various gym scenarios, monitoring whether the clients’ postures are correct.
Experts in various fields are joining the research team to finalize the product. The core functions have been developed already. Now what the team is doing is developing additional modules to integrate and research new areas to better customize the device.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir shared his insights.

“It is important to keep in mind that Guangzhou Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences has shared the source code for ‘GymBot’. This enabled the researchers from Pakistan to get first-hand experience of the latest results on AI developments and offered them a chance to learn from it, enhance it and make it more usable for the local community. This will most definitely open new doors of opportunities for Pakistanis.”
Moving ideas from lab to marketplace is a complicated journey. Researchers and stakeholders need to manage the time-consuming process of moving from academic to commercial contexts, and seek balance between different goals amongst stakeholders and researchers.
CPEC enables the exchanges of advanced concepts, from both technical and management level. Qing Luan lab can be one of the successful examples.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) job hiring is equal to or better than human hiring, but people react negatively towards it, according to a new study by The Inclusion Initiative (TII) at LSE.
Researchers have systematically reviewed the academic literature that considers the effectiveness of AI in the hiring process.  Their findings illustrate that AI hiring improves efficiency in hiring by being faster, increasing the fill-rate for open positions, and recommending candidates with a greater likelihood of being hired after an interview. Their review demonstrates that while AI had limited abilities in predicting employee outcomes after being hired, it was a substantial improvement over humans.  The authors also assessed whether AI could decrease biased decision-making and improve the diversity of selected candidates. Overall, AI hiring resulted in more diverse outcomes than human hiring.
Finally, the authors looked at how candidates and recruiters are reacting to AI hiring. Their analysis revealed overwhelmingly negative responses to AI hiring. They found that people trust AI hiring less than human hiring because they have privacy concerns, they find AI less personable, and they view organisations deploying AI hiring less attractive than those hiring through humans. 
Paris Will, Lead Corporate Research Advisor at TII, said: “Collectively, these findings lead to a gap between how AI is performing and how it is perceived. While AI hiring practices on average showed an improvement over human methods, people are reacting negatively to it. This is significant for the adoption of AI hiring methods and may be holding back better hiring techniques from being implemented.”
Dr Dario Krpan, Assistant Professor in Behavioural Science at LSE, said: “The media typically portrays AI hiring negatively and emphasises how AI can discriminate against candidates and disadvantage them. Our analysis, however, shows that even if AI is not perfect, it is fairer and more effective than human recruiters. Rather than focusing on AI in isolation, it is important to compare it to the alternative hiring practices to understand the value it brings to the recruitment process.”
Dr Grace Lordan, Associate Professor in Behavioural Science at LSE and Founding Director of TII, said: “There is evidence that current hiring processes are plagued by cronyism and bias.  It is time that humans hand over the hiring process to machines who do not have these tendencies. Biases embedded in algorithms can be mitigated somewhat with more care from those writing them, and compliance folk, who do not have skin in the hiring process can monitor the process to abate any concerns on fairness. Let’s progress AI in recruitment and workplace inclusivity at the same time. ”

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said it would save the NHS money as well as reduce prescriptions of medicines such as zolpidem and zopiclone, which can be dependency forming.Its economic analysis found healthcare costs were lower after one year of using Sleepio, mostly because of fewer GP appointments and sleeping pills prescribed.The app provides a digital six-week self-help programme involving a sleep test, weekly interactive CBT-I sessions and keeping a diary about sleeping patterns.





The sessions focus on identifying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to the symptoms of insomnia. Cognitive interventions aim to improve the way a person thinks about sleep and the behavioural interventions aim to promote a healthy sleep routine.Nice predicts up to 800,000 people could benefit from using Sleepio in England.

This allows people to complete the sessions at their own pace and revisit sessions. Participants can also access electronic library articles, online tools and join the online Sleepio user community for support.A daily sleep diary helps users track their progress and the programme tailors advice to individuals. Users can fill in the diary manually or the data can be automatically uploaded from a compatible wearable tracking device, like an Apple watch or Fitbit.Clinical evidence presented to Nice's medical technologies advisory committee from 12 randomised controlled trials showed Sleepio is more effective at reducing insomnia than sleep hygiene and sleeping pills.Read more:I fell in love with my AI girlfriend and it saved my marriageEthics must be at the centre of AI technologyJeanette Kusel, acting director for MedTech and digital at Nice, said until now patients had been offered sleeping pills and taught about sleep hygiene.She said ""rigorous, transparent and evidence-based analysis"" had found Sleepio saved the NHS money and reduced reliance on dependence-forming drugs sometimes used to treat the condition.""This is a good example of where a digital health technology can help the NHS.""The evidence has shown using Sleepio reduces the number of GP appointments people with insomnia need and will also cut the number of prescriptions for sleeping pills delivered by pharmacists.""The cost of Sleepio is £45 (excluding VAT) per person.The independent Nice committee has recommended a medical assessment should be done before referral to Sleepio during pregnancy and in people with multiple conditions.It has also recommended more research or data collection to show how effective Sleepio is compared with face-to-face CBT-I.

Are There a Lot of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Jobs Right Now?

Interested in a career in machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.)? Curious about the number of opportunities out there? A new breakdown shows that A.I. remains a highly specialized field with relatively few job openings—but that will almost certainly change in coming years.  
CompTIA’s monthly Tech Jobs Report reveals that states with the largest tech hubs—including California, Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts—lead when it comes to A.I.-related job postings. When you check out the below chart, note the actual numbers:   
  
It’s true that companies don’t need nearly as many machine-learning experts as, say, software developers or data scientists. Smaller organizations might not even have the budget to fill out an A.I. division. But CompTIA’s job numbers keep growing month after month, indicating a sustained appetite for A.I. talent, especially among larger companies with the money to actually afford researchers and specialists.  
How big could those numbers get? According to Emsi Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, the number of job postings requesting A.I. skills will increase 297 percent over the next two years. Over the past 12 months, some 142,346 job postings asked for artificial intelligence skills of some kind.   
Last year, O’Reilly estimated the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. At tech giants such as Google and Apple, compensation can climb even higher—and that’s before you consider perks and benefits such as an ultra-flexible schedule.  
That’s quite a bite out of the budget for all but the largest companies. But A.I. and machine-learning tools are also becoming more ubiquitous and easier to use, allowing even employees without an A.I. or machine-learning background to build models, chatbots, and more. That will help satisfy at least some of the demand for A.I. and machine-learning services, while also expanding the career opportunities for those who have at least some grasp of how A.I. and machine learning actually work. Over the next decade, expect more and more technologist jobs to require at least some familiarity with A.I. and machine learning.

The adoption of artificial intelligence promises to bring large benefits to businesses. However, when something goes wrong, all fingers point to the executive who vouched for the technology. The risks are born by decision-makers themselves. Terence Tse and Sardor Karimov write that this contradiction can explain why AI adoption is moving at a glacial pace in the business world.

 
Companies have long been interested in exploring and using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a competitive edge. There is no shortage of media outlets and academics stressing the business benefits that this technology can bring. Such blanket coverage naturally gives us the impression that many companies have already deployed AI internally left, right, and centre, and from top to bottom. Nothing, however, can be further from reality: the speed of adoption of AI solutions by companies has been surprisingly slow. We believe one reason is decision-making risk.
Decision-making: an important yet understudied risk
Many risks associated with adopting and using AI in business are widely known, as they have been extensively covered in both academic research and consulting reports. These risks range from bias and discriminatory risk to operational and IT risks, from business disruptions to job eliminations. However, a compelling case can be made that a less recognised risk exists, associated with decision-making. During our client interactions, we have observed that executives perceive various forms of risk when purchasing AI solutions. These risks are perceived as very real – and in some instances real enough to discourage them from adopting the AI technology altogether, despite the business advantages that it would bring. To illustrate decision-making risks, we have framed them as questions that the various stakeholders involved in the decision of buying the AI solution would be asking themselves:
Who among us is taking responsibility if something goes wrong?
It is not uncommon for large companies to benefit from in-house technology assessment teams whose roles in relation to AI involve determining the solution’s technical viability and its technological fit with the company’s needs. Interestingly, at the point of purchasing, what often matters most is not just how sound the technology is. Instead, it is who within the assessment team will be willing to stand up to vouch for the purchase. We have frequently observed that while as a team the members can reach consensus on the evaluation of a solution, as individuals few of them might be inclined to be ultimately responsible for the buy decision. The reason: if down the road something goes wrong and the technology does not work out as intended or expected, fingers would most likely be pointed at the person who “bought” the technology.
The complexity of AI projects makes it difficult to be certain of how the technology will behave once implemented and integrated into the business. Would the AI model work once live data are fed into the system? Would we be able to ensure data security over time? Would the IT infrastructure be capable of supporting the AI solution in the long run? Would the in-house engineering and data science teams be competent to keep the technology going and evolving on a long-term basis? There can be too many questions with too few confident answers.
Do you know what we are purchasing exactly?
In many companies, business leaders are the ones deciding whether to invest in an AI solution. Many of them are totally dependent on their own data science teams to evaluate and tackle the technological aspects of the solution. In turn, the data scientists have to understand the proposed solution inside-out. They need to know exactly and comprehensively what the company is buying.
Of course, vendors and suppliers can and should help by being completely transparent about their product offering, thereby making it easier for the data science team to understand the technology and its application to the business. Yet, this only partially solves the problem given that many perceived uncertainties remain for the data and leadership teams, including whether the vendor will be around in the long term to provide the necessary support, how scalable the solution purchased is, given the state and nature of the existing IT system, who is going to do what to maintain the technology going forward, etc. The result: it is often easier and safer for the data science teams – and hence the executive teams – to simply say no to the purchase and avoid all these risks.
Can we afford to make the wrong decision?
Many organisations, especially public ones, have no other choice than to get the technology right the first time. Any purchase decision must be turned into a future success. This is because failure to get the technology to deliver what was promised is likely be construed as managerial incompetence or worse, a misuse of public funds. Under public scrutiny, any outcome short of the anticipated results being fully met would potentially lead to reputational if not legal damages.
It must be added that this is not a quandary restricted to public entities. Financial services companies, for instance, can also face the same decision-making risk. Take the example of a bank that is contemplating using AI to cut the costs related to due diligence and meet ever-tightening compliance regulations. It can be imagined that if the AI technology does not work properly, the bank may end up facing costly financial consequences in the form of penalties, compensation, and remedial actions. In view of these, the stake may be too high even though the AI solution could be bringing substantial benefits.
Does the technology really work if we cannot figure it out ourselves?
Behavioural economists refer to “reference dependence” to mean that we assess the outcomes of an action by comparing it with an existing reference point or status quo. This phenomenon can sometimes be observed in the process clients follow to decide whether to buy an AI solution. Many non-tech organisations have employed very talented data and AI scientists, who are tasked with building models to achieve specific business goals.
Yet, in some cases, even with heavy investments of time, money and effort, these in-house scientists were not able to develop an AI model that meets the minimum usability standard or the model only gets an accuracy of 60 per cent when it needs to reach at least 80 per cent to be somewhat useful. Business executives would end up subscribing to the belief that it is simply impossible to get to 80 per cent. Even if a vendor was able to offer a model that demonstrates an 85 per cent accuracy, the scientists would take a dim view and discount such possibility. We should of course beware the vendors’ claims of their technological solutions – there are just too many AI firms making exaggerated claims about the performance of their technologies. Yet, this example illustrates just how powerful this perception can be, which leads to the decision not to buy a technology from an external vendor.
Can we justify the spending?
One of the most commonly used criteria to decide whether to invest in an AI solution is return on investment (ROI). Naturally, it is always better to generate as high a return as possible, given a fixed invested amount. So, whereas the cost savings generated from implementing the AI technology in a single department within a company may represent a good return, it would probably be much better to have another department make use of the same AI solution. From the decision-maker’s standpoint, it would be easier to justify the investment with a higher ROI.
In addition, having two sources of return is a safer bet just in case one of them does not deliver the expected financial outcome. The consequence is that executives sometimes only decide to buy an AI solution when two or more departments are willing to commit to its deployment. Investment in AI projects can therefore end up getting delayed, if not cancelled.
Decision-making risks present serious obstacles to the adoption and development of business AI solutions. All too often, our attention on the risks of AI is confined to those risks that relate to such aspects as the AI models themselves, the disruption to business as usual, cybersecurity, etc. By themselves, these risks are often sufficient to discourage companies from adopting AI solutions. However, as discussed here, the risks perceived by decision-makers can actually kill the potential AI projects altogether. This is understandable because, effectively, much of the upside gains of the purchase decision are accrued to the companies, whereas the decision-makers bear the downside themselves. No wonder the adoption of AI can be moving at a glacial pace.

 On May 12, 2022, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a “Technical Assistance” (TA) document addressing compliance with ADA requirements and agency policy when using AI and other software to hire and assess employees. The agency also published a short “Tips for Workers” summary of this guidance.  Neither of these documents has the force or effect of law, nor are they binding on employers; as the accompanying press release notes, this guidance is meant to be educational, “so that people with disabilities know their rights and employers can take action to avoid discrimination.”  Nevertheless, we see several take-aways regarding the Commission’s likely expectations and areas of focus when regulating the use of such tools in hiring or assessing employees:

Accessibility:  Employers should account for the fact that on-line/interactive tools may not be easily accessed or used by those with visual, auditory or other impairment.
Accommodation:  Barring undue hardship, employers should provide alternatives to the use or application of these tools if an individual’s disability renders the use of the tool more difficult or the accuracy of the tool’s assessment less reliable.
Accommodation, II:  Beyond providing reasonable accommodations in accessing/using these tools, employers should ensure that the tools assess an individual in the context of any reasonable accommodation they are likely to be given when performing their job.
ADA vs. Title VII:  The EEOC stresses that disability bias requires different design and testing criteria than does Title VII discrimination, such as access considerations and the potential for inadvertent disability-related inquiries or medical examinations.
Promising Practices:  Noting that employers are responsible for ADA-violating outcomes even when a software tool is created or used by a third-party vendor or agent, the Commission provides examples of so-called “Promising Practices” that employers can engage in to demonstrate good-faith efforts to meet ADA requirements.

Throughout, the TA document uses various illustrative examples of the tools the EEOC aims to regulate.  These range from résumé scanners and virtual assistants/chatbots to video-interviewing software and software that tests an individual’s personality, aptitude, skills, and “perceived ‘cultural fit.’”  Employers using any of these tools in their recruiting, hiring, and review of applicants and employees (which, by some estimates, is up to 83% of employers) should take careful note of the EEOC’s position as to where these tools may run afoul of the ADA. 
The TA document focuses broadly on three themes, specifically, how the use of algorithmic decision-making may violate the ADA with respect to: (1) reasonable accommodation for applicants and employees; (2) where AI decision-making tools may “screen out” individuals with disabilities; and (3) where an AI-based tool may violate ADA restrictions on disability-related inquiries.  Key take-aways from each are discussed below.
Reasonable Accommodation.  Foremost, the EEOC stresses that where an employer uses AI or other algorithmic decision-making software, it is required to provide reasonable accommodation to employees whose disability may make it difficult to be assessed by the tool, or where a disability may cause a lower result than it would for a non-disabled employee.  The EEOC takes the unequivocal position that where a disability might make a test more difficult to take or reduce the accuracy of an assessment, an employer must provide an alternative testing format or a more accurate assessment of the individual’s skills, unless doing so would entail “undue hardship” (defined as “significant difficulty or expense,” and generally a very high bar for an employer to meet under the ADA).  By way of example, the EEOC offers that an employer that uses a test requiring use of a keyboard or trackpad to measure employee knowledge may need to provide an accessible version of the test to an employee with limited manual dexterity (or, where it is not possible to provide an accessible version of the test, to provide an alternative testing format).  Similarly, in its discussion of “screening out” applicants (detailed below), the agency cites tools that measure speech patterns or facial recognition, and the potential negative effect these may have on individuals with certain disabilities.  In line with its prior example, presumably the agency would take the position that an employer must provide such individuals with alternative testing methods, where it can do so without undue hardship.  Finally, the guidance makes clear that where an employer uses a third party, such as a software vendor, to administer and score pre-employment tests, the failure of the vendor to provide a reasonable accommodation required by the ADA would likely result in an employer being liable, even if the employer was unaware that the applicant reported the need for an accommodation to the vendor.
“Screening Out.”  The bulk of the EEOC’s guidance focuses on the use of AI or other algorithmic tools that act to “screen out” individuals with disabilities, where such tool causes an individual to receive a lower score or assessment and the individual loses a job opportunity as a result.  The guidance provides several examples, including a chatbot that screens out applicants with gaps in their employment history, the use of which may violate the ADA if the employment gap was due to a disability or the need to undergo treatment (EEOC appears to ignore the fact that many if not most gaps in employment history are unlikely to be occasioned by a disability).  Perhaps a more common scenario is contemplated in the example of video software that analyzes speech patterns, and which may screen out individuals with speech impediments. 
The guidance also explains in some length that while the typical steps an employer using AI may take to ensure its use is non-discriminatory (such as testing a tool for disparate impact on the basis of race or sex, and modifying the tool to eliminate any such impact if found), these efforts may be insufficient to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability, insofar as “[e]ach disability is unique,” and the fact that some individuals with disabilities may fare well on the test does not mean that a particular individual with a disability may not be unlawfully screened out.  It goes on to state that while a decision-making tool may be “validated” (meaning that there is evidence that the tool accurately measures or predicts a trait or characteristic relevant to a specific job), such “validation” may not be sufficient with respect to individuals with disabilities. EEOC cites, for example, a visual “memory test,” which may be an accurate measure of memory for most individuals in the workforce, but may still unlawfully screen out an individual who has a good memory, but a visual impairment that reduces their ability to perform successfully on the test. 
The guidance also raises the concern that an algorithm may screen out an individual with a disability who can perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation because the algorithm is programmed to predict whether applicants under “typical working conditions” can do the job, and does not account for the possibility that an individual with a disability might be entitled to an accommodation such that they are not performing under “typical” working conditions.  By way of example, it offers an individual with PTSD, who might be rated poorly on a test that measures the ability to ignore workplace distractions without regard to the fact that such an individual may be entitled to an accommodation that would mitigate the effect of their disability (such as a quiet workstation or permission to use noise-cancelling headphones). 
Disability-Related Inquiries.  Finally, the TA notes that the use of AI tools may violate the ADA where software poses “disability-related inquiries,” meaning questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability (directly or indirectly).  While it is unlikely that most screening tools will include such questions (such as asking about an applicant’s workers’ compensation history), the EEOC warns that some seemingly innocuous questions may still run afoul of the ADA’s pre-offer limitation on medical inquiries, or act to “screen out” applicants or employees unlawfully.  The guidance notes that a personality test is not making a “disability-related inquiry” simply because it asks whether an individual is “described by friends as being generally optimistic,” even if being described in such a way may be related to a mental health diagnosis.  What the EEOC giveth with one hand, however, it appears to take away with the other:  as the agency explains, even if a question about “optimism” does not violate the ADA itself, if an individual with major depressive disorder answers negatively and loses an employment opportunity because of that answer, this may be an unlawful “screening out” if the negative answer is a result of the individual’s mental health diagnosis.  Similarly, the EEOC provides no guidance with respect to the “resume gap” it flags as a screening issue.  As mentioned above, the guidance notes that a chatbot or similar AI tool’s disqualifying an individual because of a gap in employment history may violate the ADA if the employment gap is due to a disability; left unclear is whether an invitation from the chatbot to an applicant to explain any gap in employment history is a prohibited “disability-related inquiry.”  There are many reasons an applicant may have taken time away from the workforce, such that a broad inquiry should not be seen as a disability-related inquiry; that said, the EEOC declined to provide any indication of its view on the question.
Practical Application.  The EEOC provides guidance and “promising practices” to employers seeking to use algorithmic tools, whether developed on their own, or provided by way of a third-party vendor, to minimize the risk of violating the ADA.  These include examining:

If the tool requires applicants or employees to engage a user interface, is the interface accessible to persons with disabilities?
Are materials presented in alternative formats?
Has the algorithm been assessed to determine whether it disadvantages individuals with disabilities?
Does the tool clearly indicate that reasonable accommodation, including alternative formats, are available to persons with disabilities?
Are there clear instructions for requesting accommodation?
Does the tool explain to applicants and employees what metrics the tool measures, how they are measured, and whether any disability might lower an assessment, such that a user with a disability would know to ask for a reasonable accommodation?

The EEOC’s guidance appears to raise more questions than it answers, in an area of law that is changing rapidly and already poses compliance challenges for employers.  Indeed, in many instances, it suggests that the ADA’s requirements with respect to accommodation and prohibition on unlawful screening may render the use of AI tools vastly more complicated and legally fraught. This comes at a time where the use of such tools is increasing exponentially. 
As the EEOC continues its AI initiative, we expect that the agency will provide further guidance to employers as to its view of how artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making interact with federal civil rights laws.  Moreover, as the composition of the Commission is likely to shift from a Republican majority to a Democratic majority no later than the end of the year, we expect the agency to ramp up its efforts to regulate in this space.  Littler’s Workplace Policy Institute will continue to keep readers apprised of relevant developments.

EEOC and the DOJ Issue Guidance for Employers Using AI Tools  to Assess Job Applicants and Employees


By Joseph O’Keefe, Edward Young & Dixie Morrison on May 17, 2022







Employers are more frequently relying on the use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools to automate employment decision-making, such as software that can review resumes and “chatbots” that interview and screen job applicants. We have previously blogged about the legal risks attendant to the use of such technologies, including here and here.

On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued long-awaited guidance on the use of such AI tools (the “Guidance”), examining how employers can seek to prevent AI-related disability discrimination. More specifically, the Guidance identifies a number of ways in which employment-related use of AI can, even unintentionally, violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), including if:

(i) “[t]he employer does not provide a ‘reasonable accommodation’ that is necessary for a job applicant or employee to be rated fairly and accurately by” the AI;
(ii) “[t]he employer relies on an algorithmic decision-making tool that intentionally or unintentionally ‘screens out’ an individual with a disability, even though that individual is able to do the job with a reasonable accommodation”; or
(iii) “[t]he employer adopts an [AI] tool for use with its job applicants or employees that violates the ADA’s restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations.”

The Guidance further states that “[i]n many cases” employers are liable under the ADA for use of AI even if the tools are designed and administered by a separate vendor, noting that “employers may be held responsible for the actions of their agents . . . if the employer has given them authority to act on [its] behalf.”
The Guidance also identifies various best practices for employers, including:

Announcing generally that employees and applicants subject to an AI tool may request reasonable accommodations and providing instructions as to how to ask for accommodations.
Providing information about the AI tool, how it works, and what it is used for to the employees and applicants subjected to it. For example, an employer that uses keystroke-monitoring software may choose to disclose this software as part of new employees’ onboarding and explain that it is intended to measure employee productivity.
If the software was developed by a third party, asking the vendor whether: (i) the AI software was developed to accommodate people with disabilities, and if so, how; (ii) there are alternative formats available for disabled individuals; and (iii) the AI software asks questions likely to elicit medical or disability-related information.
If an employer is developing its own software, engaging experts to analyze the algorithm for potential biases at different steps of the development process, such as a psychologist if the tool is intended to test cognitive traits.
Only using AI tools that measure, directly, traits that are actually necessary for performing the job’s duties.
Additionally, it is always a best practice to train staff, especially supervisors and managers, how to recognize requests for reasonable accommodations and to respond promptly and effectively to those requests. If the AI tool is used by a third party on the employer’s behalf, that third party’s staff should also be trained to recognize requests for reasonable accommodation and forward them promptly to the employer.

Finally, also on May 12th, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released its own guidance on AI tools’ potential for inadvertent disability discrimination in the employment context. The DOJ guidance is largely in accord with the EEOC Guidance.
Employers utilizing AI tools should carefully audit them to ensure that this technology is not creating discriminatory outcomes.  Likewise, employers must remain closely apprised of any new developments from the EEOC and local, state, and federal legislatures and agencies as the trend toward regulation continues.

Google has launched Interview Warmup, a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to help people prepare for job interviews.
Part of the Grow with Google and Career Certification initiatives, it asks common interview questions and transcribes answers in real-time.
Originally intended to help Google Career Certificate learners prepare for job searching, Interview Warmup is now open to anyone.
Using voice-to-text or the keyboard, users can practice answering questions commonly asked in interviews, as well as job-specific ones picked by an expert in that field.

The tool then analyzes the answers and offers suggestions for improvement.

Currently, Interview Warmup has field-focused questions for Information Analytics, E-Commerce, IT Help, Undertaking Administration, UX Design or Basic.
Interview Warmup features three types of questions:








Background –  covering past training and experience
Situational – how specific situations were handled in the past or might be dealt with in the future
Technical – covering knowledge and skills, often testing how hypothetical problems would have been handled

Machine Learning Analyzes Responses and Provides Insights
As well as allowing for personal review, Google’s algorithm will employ machine learning to identify patterns and generate insights in a user’s answers. These include:

Job-related terms, which highlights words in answers that are relevant to the specific field
Most-used phrases, which points out phrases that have been used three or more times and provides alternatives.
Talking points uses Google’s artificial intelligence to uncover important points in replies, including skills, experience and lessons learned.

“Insights help you discover patterns in your answers,” Interview Warmup’s FAQ page said. “They don’t ‘grade’ your answer or tell you what part of your answer is right or wrong. Insights include the job-related terms you use, your most-used words, and the talking points you cover.”







Google does not save audio or the transcripts from interview sessions, though users can manually copy or download a transcript upon completion. This feature is currently only available in the U.S.
Since Interview Warmup was designed for Google Career Certificates learners, you may run into questions that are specific each of the certificates. However, the tool is available for everyone to use and has general questions applicable to many fields.
More than 70,000 people have earned a certificate and 75% of graduates report positive career impacts within six months of graduating, Google says.

He wanted to improve their lives now but also investigate the biological underpinning of aging so there could be better therapies or prevention strategies later.The project launched about a year ago, bringing what Walston calls a “big umbrella” of expertise from areas that include medical care, research, artificial intelligence and technology, engineering and business. Hopkins students have a chance to participate, as do some outside businesses and universities that have aging-related innovations to develop.Story continues below advertisementMuch of the research builds on decades of work at Hopkins and elsewhere. Some efforts now under the aging project banner already are in advanced stages. Devices and therapies ready to head to human trials can seek volunteers among a large pool of Hopkins geriatric patients.AdvertisementThere is urgency to the effort. More than 54 million Americans are age 65 or older, or about 16 percent of the population, federal statistics show. The number is expected to grow to nearly 22 percent by 2040, and the number of people 85 and older is projected to more than double.Most older people have at least one chronic condition and many have multiple conditions, which can include physical and cognitive impairments.Story continues below advertisementMany older people desire to “age in place,” with outside and even government support to stay at home, but that becomes less possible the more debilitated people become, Walston said.The aging project will apply for grant funding to pay for specific endeavors. Already, the Hopkins project is one of three academic institutions to be awarded $20 million from the National Institute on Aging that will go specifically for work in artificial intelligence and technology. Hopkins will dole out grants of up to $200,000 over five years, with some money going to outside universities and businesses that want to partner with Hopkins on devices and other innovations for older adults.AdvertisementThe National Institute on Aging sought academic centers that could generate high-tech ideas and get them developed, said Partha Bhattacharyya, a program director for the institute’s Division of Behavioral and Social Research and the official overseeing the grant program.Story continues below advertisementBhattacharyya said the NIA was looking to the centers to develop devices and therapies that would specifically help older adults live independently at home. That means, for example, pursuing technology to help with decision-making, coordinating care among doctors, or supporting cognitive therapy.“NIA takes a big-picture approach to research and development of new technologies, and we realize that technological solutions for use in homes and communities will require coordination across a wide range of disciplines and economic sectors,” he said.AdvertisementHopkins  had won nearly $16 million in other grants from the National Institutes of Health that focused on frailty and resiliency in aging, which included money to train new researchers in these areas.Story continues below advertisementThe project has named several Hopkins “scholars,” who are experts in their fields and were awarded $6 million in philanthropic grants. They are pursuing work in engineering, biology, turning basic science into actual therapies, and social justice. The program specifically called on scholars to pursue science that more deeply engages underserved older adults in Baltimore, as well as other parts of the country, and stated that any device or therapy stemming from the project should be financially and physically accessible.One effort already underway, for example, uses imaging technology to screen for cataracts without an eye expert, who can be in short supply in rural areas and underserved urban areas. Walston said equity and diversity will be an important element of the aging project.AdvertisementAnother arm of the project involves engineering students, who will work with faculty to develop new devices.Story continues below advertisementJoshua Blair, a master’s student in engineering, is gearing up to test a device to promote better sleep and memory retention, a common problem among older adults, particularly those with dementia or other cognitive impairments.The device uses sensors and stimulates part of the brain where experiences are turned into memories during deep sleep. The idea is that people wake better rested and sharper.“We’ll be able to see instantly if it’s working,” Blair said.Physician Peter Abadir, a Hopkins professor of medicine, had brought engineering students to patient clinics to see whether they might spark interest and ideas about ways to improve the lives of older adults. He found many jumped at the chance to develop something they could then test and turn into a real product.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe sleep device is expected to be tested this summer at a Hopkins sleep lab.“We want things to happen today, not in 20 years,” Abadir said. “But we make sure we don’t end up with something not practical or effective.”That’s where some of the university’s business expertise will come into play, Abadir said, assessing markets and turning ideas into products.The aging project also includes work in labs, where researchers assess basic biological processes for clues about why age-related conditions develop and what to do about them.On a recent day, Nick Milcik, a research specialist in the Hopkins geriatrics department, was handling some cortisol samples taken from the saliva of surgical patients over time. Researchers are hoping to see whether levels of the stress hormone eventually can help predict, for example, who will do well after surgery for knee replacement. That could tell doctors when they can go ahead and when they should delay or cancel procedures in patients unlikely to benefit.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementReyhan Westbrook, an instructor in geriatric medicine, is in the lab looking at the role of inflammation in aging and how to control when there is too much. He’s specifically focused on a sleep-regulating amino acid called tryptophan, which has anti-inflammatory effects and could contribute eventually to a therapy.Some inflammation is needed as a defense against infection and injury, Westbrook explained, “but it’s a problem when it’s overloaded. It gets amplified in older people.”Some of the research has moved beyond the lab. One of the project’s scholars is physician Alex Pantelyat, an assistant professor of neurology and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Music and Medicine. He’s not a music therapist, but uses rhythm and music as medicine, sometimes playing the violin for patients.AdvertisementPantelyat said there already is a lot of evidence about the benefits of music in promoting well-being and healing; he’s looking for novel ways of using those benefits.Among the efforts he’s pursuing under the aging project’s banner is a wearable device that uses music to improve mobility in those with Parkinson’s disease, a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement and is common in older people. Sufferers often have trouble walking and are at risk of falling.Falls are a major health issue, leading to disability as well as a significant number of deaths. One in 4 older adults falls each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That leads to tens of billions in medical spending on fatal and nonfatal injuries.Pantelyat is testing a product developed with a Maine-based company that uses rhythmic music to normalize someone’s gait. Human brains naturally respond to a beat, and the device will train people who listen to specific music and walk for 30 minutes a day. A sensor on the wearer’s shoes speeds up or slows down the rhythm with the walker’s speed.“If we can reduce falls, that’s really the holy grail,” he said. “There are no side effects to music-based interventions that embed rhythm. It would really be an important achievement.”Clinical trials are expected to begin this summer.

But does it make mistakes – and can you boost your chances?By Hilke SchellmannSupported byAbout this contentWed 11 May 2022 04.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 May 2022 04.31 EDTShareMartin Burch had been working for the Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones for a few years and was looking for new opportunities. One Sunday in May 2021, he applied for a data analyst position at Bloomberg in London that looked like the perfect fit. He received an immediate response, asking him to take a digital assessment.It was strange. The assessment showed him different shapes and asked him to figure out the pattern. He started feeling incredulous. “Shouldn’t we be testing my abilities on the job?” he asked himself.The next day, a Monday, which happened to be a public holiday in the UK, he got a rejection email. He decided to email a recruiter at Bloomberg. Maybe the company made a mistake?What Burch discovered offers insight into a larger phenomenon that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can’t find the right talent?Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. This is a huge shift, because until relatively recently, most hiring managers would handle applications and resumes themselves. Yet recent findings have shown that some of these new tools discriminate against women and use criteria unrelated to work to “predict” job success.While companies and vendors are not required to disclose if they use artificial intelligence or algorithms to select and hire job applicants, in my reporting I have learned that this is widespread. All the leading job platforms – including LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster – have told me they deploy some of these technologies.Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, said that artificial intelligence and algorithms have already conquered the field. He estimates that at least three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. “The dawn of robot recruiting has come and went and people just haven’t caught up to the realization yet,” he said.A 2021 survey of recruiting executives by the research and consulting firm Gartner found that almost all reported using AI for at least one part of the recruiting and hiring process. Yet it is not foolproof. One of the most consequential findings comes from Harvard Business School professor Joe Fuller, whose team surveyed more than 2,250 business leaders in the US, UK and Germany. Their motives for using algorithmic tools were efficiency and saving costs. Yet 88% of executives said that they know their tools reject qualified candidates.Despite the prevalence of the technology, there have just been a few famous cases of misfires. A few years back, Amazon discovered that its resume screener tool was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes of current employees, who skewed male, reflecting a gender disparity in many tech fields. Over time, the tool picked up on male preferences and systematically downgraded people with the word “women” on their resumes, as in “women’s chess club” or “women’s soccer team.” Amazon’s engineers tried to fix the problem, but they couldn’t and the company discontinued the tool in 2018.“This project was only ever explored on a trial basis, and was always used with human supervision,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser.AI vendors that build these kinds of technologies say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. If a company is drowning in applications, many human recruiters read only a fraction of the applications. An AI analyzes all of them and any assessments and judges every candidate the same way.View image in fullscreenSupporters say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. Photograph: Ivan Chiosea/AlamyAnother benefit, these vendors say, is if employers choose to focus on skills and not on educational achievements like college degrees, applicants from diverse backgrounds who are often overlooked can get to the next stage of the process.“At the end of the day, we don’t want people to be hired into roles that are going to drain them and not utilize their strengths. And so it’s really not about rejecting people, it’s about ‘screening in’ the right people,” said Caitlin MacGregor, CEO of Plum, which built the assessment Burch found so puzzling. MacGregor said the company’s clients have increased their diversity and retention rates since they started to use Plum. She said the assessments helped hone in on applicants’ “potential”.But job candidates who have the necessary experience worry they’re being unfairly weeded out when companies focus on elusive factors like potential or personality traits.“This was the first time in my life, in my career, where I was sending out resumes and there was nothing,” said Javier Alvarez, 57, a distribution and sales manager from Monrovia, California, who sent out his resume more than 300 times on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs he said he was qualified for. No job offer materialized, and he started to wonder if he was being automatically excluded in some way – perhaps because of his age or salary requirements. “I felt hopeless. I started to doubt my abilities.”Ronnie Riley, a 29-year-old event planner from Canada, had a gap of several years in their resume because of an illness. Riley applied to more than 100 event planning and some administrative assistant jobs in December 2021, and over 70 jobs in January, but ended up with a total of five interviews and no job offers. They worry the gap is the reason. “It just seems it’s discounting a whole bunch of people that could be perfect for the job,” they said.Fuller’s research has helped provide answers to how exactly automatic rejections occur. One reason, he found, is that too often, job descriptions include too many criteria and skills. Many employers add new skills and criteria to existing job descriptions, building a long list of requirements. Algorithms end up rejecting many qualified applicants who may be missing just a couple of skills from the list.One executive Fuller spoke with said their company’s tool has been rejecting qualified candidates because they scored low in one important category, even when they got a near perfect score in all the other important categories. The company found that it was left with job applicants who received mediocre scores across the board. (Longer job descriptions may also deter more female applicants, Fuller believes, since many women apply to jobs only when they fulfill most of the requirements.)Another reason qualified candidates are rejected by automated systems are so-called knockout criteria. In Fuller’s research, he found that almost 50% of the executives surveyed acknowledged that their automatic systems reject job applicants outright who have a work gap longer than six months on their resumes. These applicants never get in front of a hiring manager, even if they are the most qualified candidates for the job.“The six month gap is a really insidious filter,” said Fuller, since it’s probably built on the assumption that a gap signifies something ominous, but may simply represent military deployments, pregnancy complications, caregiving obligations or illness.Experts contacted by the Guardian also described automatic resume screeners making mistakes similar to the infamous Amazon example, rooted in learning biases from an existing dataset. This hints at how these programs could end up enforcing the kinds of racial and gender biases observed with other AI tools, such as facial recognition tech and algorithms used in health care.John Scott is the chief operating officer of APMetrics, an organization that helps companies identify talent, and is often brought in by larger companies to check if new technologies the company wants to buy from a vendor are fair and legal. Scott has examined multiple resume screeners and recruiting tools and discovered problems in all of them. He found biased criteria unrelated to work, such as the name Thomas and the keyword church, to “predict” success in a job.Mark Girouard, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis, found that the name Jared and having played lacrosse in high school were used as predictors of success in one system.Martin Burch, the London jobseeker, discovered he had been weeded out in a different way.He contacted a human recruiter at Bloomberg and asked her to look at his CV. His experience lined up with the job description and this was a direct competitor, making his background all the more valuable, he thought. But the problem turned out to be the pattern-finding and personality test he had taken, which was created by Plum.A recruiter at Bloomberg replied: “I can see that your application was rejected due to not meeting our benchmark in the Plum assessment that you completed. Unfortunately on that basis we are not able to take your application any further.” Burch felt stunned that he had indeed been rejected by a piece of code.He retained a lawyer, and in communications with Bloomberg asked for a human review of his application.Bloomberg informed Burch that the role he applied for was no longer available and he wouldn’t be able to be considered for it.Bloomberg did not return emails and calls asking for comment.As adoption of AI tools in hiring expands, lawmakers are starting to take a closer look. In the UK, the government is planning new regulation of algorithmic decision making. In the US, a recent local law requires employers to inform job seekers how their application materials are screened by AI upon request. And congressional lawmakers have introduced bills that would regulate AI in hiring at a national level, including the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022, but have faced hurdles getting them passed.Burch decided to file an official claim with the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent organization that upholds privacy laws in the UK. In February the office reprimanded Bloomberg, writing: “From reviewing the information provided, it is our decision that there is more work for you to do. As such, we now expect you to take steps to address any outstanding issues with the individual.”Burch has since accepted £8,000 ($9,864) in compensation from the company. He says he also fought to demonstrate a point: “I am trying to prove to them that it’s probably weeding out good candidates so they should probably stop using it.”Plum’s CEO Caitlin MacGregor declined to comment on Burch’s case directly, citing privacy concerns, but she stands behind her product: “I should not be interviewing somebody that is a 35, regardless of how much experience they have. There is somewhere else that they are going to be their own 95 [percent] match.”How to write a resume in the age of AI

Instead of trying to stand out, make your resume machine-readable: no images, no special characters such as ampersands or tildes. Use the most common template. Use short, crisp sentences – declarative and quantitative, said Ian Siegel, CEO of the job platform ZipRecruiter

List licenses and certifications on your resume

Make sure your resume matches the keywords in the job description and compare your resume to the job description using online resume scanners to see if you are a match for the role

For entry-level and administrative jobs, consider stating that you are competent in Microsoft office suite applications even if it’s not in the job description, said Harvard business professor Joe Fuller.

Humanity should get the best from AI, not the worst - UN disability rights expert

        Human Rights Council          

        Special Rapporteur on disability          








Artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the terms of existence for human beings, said UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities Gerard Quinn.
“New technologies can be of enormous benefit to persons with disabilities and drive the search for inclusive equality across a broad range of fields such as employment, education and independent living,” he said. “However, there are many well-known discriminatory impacts.”
Quinn made his statement during a presentation of his report to the Human Rights Council. In his report, Quinn defined artificial intelligence, or AI, as machines made to work “in the same or a similar way to humans, only faster, better and more reliably and, theoretically, without human bias.”
While there is growing awareness of the human rights challenges that these new technologies can pose, Quinn said the discussion should shift to focus on the specific challenges these new technologies pose to the rights of people with disabilities, as provided by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These include the rights to privacy, autonomy, education, employment, health, independent living, participation
AI enabled systems have had positive impacts on the lives of people with disabilities.   Quinn pointed out that, “blockages that we formerly thought of as insurmountable are suddenly scalable.”
These include assistive technology that improve the mobility of blind individuals. Adaptive learning platforms also provide personalised learning experiences tailored to the specific needs of students with disabilities. Further, AI powered robots and other tools provide home-based care and other assistance, allowing people with disabilities to live independently.
However, AI is made ‘smart’ through a process of machine learning dependent on a set of training data, or ‘algorithms’, that often includes “data shaped by prior human decisions and value judgements that may be faulted on many grounds,” Quinn said.
AI tools can still carry human biases and be exclusionary towards people with disabilities as a result, the report states. One example was in employment, where recruitment processes increasingly use algorithms to filter out candidates.
“The predicates that underpin the algorithms that drive Artificial Intelligence can reflect and embed ableist assumptions (and indeed ageist assumptions). Disability can be ‘seen’ by the technology as deviant and therefore unwelcome,” Quinn said. “[Persons with disabilities] may be ruled out of consideration for employment without ever considering their merits and whether a ‘reasonable accommodation’ might assist in enabling them to perform the essential functions of a job.”
In his report, Quinn proposes a way forward to realize the practical benefits of AI for people with disabilities by placing their human rights at the centre of the debate around new technologies.
 In other recommendations, he urged States to include disability in their artificial intelligence strategies and to continue applying their obligation of ‘reasonable accommodation’, as well as explicitly taking disability into account when purchasing AI products and services.
“Most importantly, we call for a new space – a collaborative space – between the corporate sector, Government and civil society – to work through and realize the positive benefits of the technology and to take active steps to reverse some its known negative impacts and to avoid such impacts into the future,” he added.
“Otherwise, the ‘furthest left behind’ will simply have no chance to catch up.  Given the promise of the technology, this would be a tragedy for humanity.”

AI/ML systems not only use vision to guide robotics in pick-and-place, but also can simultaneously make intelligent quality decisions

Good data—and lots of it—is key to making artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) production, inspection and packaging systems work without a hitch, plus well written algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions that will help people and machines function more intelligently. In fact, 3-D vision systems are usually the “eyes” robots use to guide them as they sort and package products or load pallets—3-D because it provides much more data to make intelligent decisions quickly.Processors are keenly interested in getting their products perfect before packaging, and AI/ML can play a part in production monitoring. “I think we will begin seeing a lot more utilization of AI/ML to improve product quality and consistency,” says Jason Prince, Golden State Foods director of operations, protein products. “For instance, adjusting product pressure automatically to achieve a very specific product thickness or weight, given a set of ever-changing variables such as product temperature and density. This would ensure that the finished product is consistent over time, despite changing raw material characteristics. Adjustments will be able to be made in near real time and eliminate the time required for a quality check to be completed and then an operator adjustment to be made.”

AI is currently being deployed to determine weight trends in a product as it is picked and placed, according to Jeff Hawkins, FESTO global accounts manager. But AI can also be used as a nonstructural reporting center. An example would be multiple sensors monitoring the process of chocolate candy bars. As the point cloud distribution plots millions of points of data, a trend begins to take shape. The data then displays the trend in layman’s terms. A terminal may read: “AI/ML has noticed that size and weight of the candy bar may also vary because of a slight change in the exterior color of the candy bar.” Now the candy maker can sort for proper color shade to make sure the product meets expectations. The vision system, in addition to measuring the physical dimensions, alerts for color variances.What are AI’s weak points? Hawkins suggests that the limitations of AI are mostly in trying to over-analyze the data, and thus nothing can be derived because the data set exceeds the actionable use case.Inspection a chief role for AI/ML in packaging systemsIf you ask a system integrator (SI) like Craig Souser, president and CEO of JLS Automation, what is a key element in AI/ML in packaging systems, he’ll tell you vision systems—and several camera systems today have deep learning built in and enabled. “The role of AI/ML produces better quality control in inspection systems—improve inspection to decrease the number of rejects that are actually OK—shades of gray instead of go/no go.” Deep learning algorithms embedded in modern camera systems, especially 3D, allow for more qualitative analysis and can help adjust parameters in lieu of a somewhat highly trained technician having to make the same adjustments, says Souser. The real advantage of this is that it can be done continuously—versus a technician who will only see a snapshot of the various attributes at whatever time he/she is looking at the images or historical data versus real time. So, it’s a great way to modify vision parameters and accept good products or packages versus rejecting them as the parameters may have been too tight when the technician last updated the values. It actually makes specific values in recipes less critical as the machine can make adjustments as soon as a run starts and immediately optimize the inspection.

The use of vision systems combined with robotics—not only for robotic picking and placing—but for quality inspections are key areas of focus for SIs, says Gregory Powers, VP, digital transformation at Gray Solutions, a Gray Company. “Any repeatable tasks that involve patterns provide opportunities for vision systems to increase efficiencies. Through a large number of samples, vision systems can learn patterns and adjust accordingly.”The use of vision systems with AI/ML is becoming more common in robotic pick-and-place applications, where in the past, for example, operators performed labor-intensive manual inspections as they placed food items in a package all day long. “Vision systems have come a long way in the past few years, and we expect this trend to continue,” says Powers. “For example, we’re currently looking at new technologies in vision systems where we can see abnormities that the naked eye cannot see.”

Advantages of AI/ML are endless, adds Powers. Efficiency gains in reducing downtime and improving the quality in product, as well as the all-around labor savings that can be achieved through AI/ML prove to be advantageous for companies today. Implementing AI/ML for robotics and inspection is getting easier too. “AI/ML are getting more plug-and-play, especially in the area of vision systems,” says Powers. Programming these units is much easier and allows for ease of implementation with advanced learning algorithms. Some of the more advanced software companies are installing their own devices on equipment to directly monitor possible issues. Equipment providers are also following this approach. With all that said, data and the access to it can be problematic, according to Powers. “As cybersecurity is a big concern with the companies, getting data out of the plants becomes even harder. IT groups are hesitant to open port channels for data to be collected from equipment. In most cases, equipment providers already have data scientists in place to help make decisions on the equipment, but changing parameters on the equipment directly is not being widely adopted yet.”Making the software simpler to use: a real-world exampleWhile AI/ML is becoming easier to implement, it still depends on software programmers and engineers to do the heavy lifting so SIs and end users don’t have to write code. One such vendor, Pleora Technologies, writes the code and algorithms that can be used with camera systems. “AI/ML are getting more plug-and-play, especially in the area of vision systems.” -- Gregory Powers, VP of digital transformation, Gray SolutionsPleora has several AI applications in packaging, labeling and product inspection. In one application, a distillery is using the AI system for visual inspection to add decision-support to human processes during in-process and final inspection, according to Ed Goffin, manager, marketing at Pleora Technologies.For the distillery, a main concern is maintaining a consistent brand appearance so they can ensure a premium spot on a store shelf. The distillery uses a bottle designed after an old-fashioned milk bottle, with distinctive and eye-catching labelling. The bottle has three brand elements, with a main label and cap label applied by machine. A human then has to accurately place an emblem logo that visually aligns with corresponding brand elements on the other labels to ensure a consistent and appealing shelf display. With multiple products and short manufacturing runs, Goffin says it’s not economical for the distillery to fully automate its labelling process.Without requiring any programming skills, the distillery quality manager and operator trained the AI system’s inspection app to add decision-support for its labelling process. With just one image of a known good product—a “golden reference”—the system automatically identifies the key brand elements on the bottle. The app has been customized to then add a graphic overlay on the visual display that highlights and guides the correct placement for the medallion label for the operator. AI-based visual inspection ensures brand consistency and accuracy for the distillery, as well as cost-savings as labelling does not have to removed and replaced due to human error. The technology is also being used by the manufacturer as a training tool for new operators, so they can quickly understand the proper positioning of brand elements on the bottle and the difference between “good and bad” products. Overall, in this application, AI adds consistent decision-support to manual tasks to reduce human errors that result in higher costs and slower production.We’ve reviewed primarily standalone applications within a plant, but AI/ML doesn’t have to be relegated to just packaging and inspection at a single point. Berk Birand, founder and CEO of Fero Labs suggests that ML can be applied in scenarios where food products are processed across multiple stages, each affecting a food’s qualities and chemical composition. So, rather than focusing on a single machine or work cell, AI/ML can be applied to all stages of the production, processing data from all the machines and optimizing a process from end to end, creating the optimal chemistry of a food product. With increasing CPU performance and memory densities plus the availability of all types of wired and wireless sensors, successful AI/ML applications will continue to increase with the only limitation being human creativity, which so far has shown no bounds.

        Universal Human Rights Index          

        Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals          











How do you manage ever-growing amounts of human rights guidance, including almost 180,000 individual observations and recommendations from UN human rights mechanisms, and ensure easy access to everyone, including the general public, governments, NGOs and UN agencies? At the same time, how do you ensure this guidance has a real and positive impact on human rights worldwide?
One of the solutions, for UN Human Rights, lay in an innovative partnership with the Danish Institute of Human Rights and a Danish social enterprise called Specialisterne (“The Specialists”), an organisation which works with consultants on the autism spectrum who are skilled in solving challenging data puzzles.
When the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015, one of UN Human Rights’ aims was to make human rights guidance available to inform the national policies needed to implement them.
The result is that today, the Universal Human Rights Index (UHRI), the world’s largest and most comprehensive human rights database of guidance from the human rights mechanisms, is being powered by artificial intelligence, showing the links between this guidance and the SDGs.
Prior to this, the tens of thousands of observations and recommendations the Universal Periodic Review, Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures were being manually tagged, with OHCHR staff spending hours, days, weeks and months analysing and inputting information.
While this work is gradually being replaced by artificial intelligence, Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, Director of Human Rights Council and Treaty Mechanisms Division at UN Human Rights, explains that “While we are expecting to save thousands of hours in manual work, human rights experts will continue to undertake quality checks at every stage, which in turn further refines the precision of the algorithm.”

Make human rights more accessible
The partnership between UN Human Rights, the Danish Institute of Human Rights and Specialisterne began in 2017. It brought together a great diversity of skills, knowledge and approaches.
“We are talking about a level of information that no one human being can possibly digest,” says Birgitte Feiring, Director of Human Rights and Sustainable Development at the Danish Institute for Human Rights. “In pulling together these three very different organisations, at the end of the day, our common goal is to make human rights more accessible to rights holders, and to help them bring governments to account.”
For Feiring, the new algorithm makes human rights analysis, programming and planning much easier for governments. “When governments have to design a plan for sustainable development, for example, or for sustainable recovery from COVID-19, in a few clicks, they can find out what are the human rights problems facing older persons, or what the issues are related to access to healthcare and vaccines. They are also directed to the solutions, as advised by the various human rights mechanisms.”
The brain behind the algorithm
The individual who developed the algorithm – called ‘TextClassify’ – is physicist Niels Jørgen Kjær. Previously employed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the capacity of High Energy Physicist, he now uses his expertise working for Specialisterne.

“The most challenging part of the algorithm was to make it scalable to very large data sets,” explains Kjær.
He says the central ingredient was the development of a fast multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, called ‘Mahjong.’ Mahjong evaluates an optimisation step in about 10 microseconds, and makes tests on millions of word combinations feasible.
The result is an algorithm that Kjær says can “handle millions of text snippets and thousands of categories, and still run everything in seconds on a PC.”
Unique brains key to success








Specialisterne is a self-described ‘socially innovative company’ where the majority of staff have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. The company was founded in 2003 with the objective of providing better jobs and working conditions for neurodiverse talent.
According to CEO Carsten Lassen, autistic individuals are often known to find creative solutions and unusual perspectives in problem-solving when in the right work environment.

“I often hear autistic persons say that their brain works like an algorithm, in that it tends to work in a more binary way than the neurotypical brain: if it’s not absolutely right, then it’s wrong. That’s exactly how algorithms are built and that’s the foundation for all programming,” Lassen says.
What does the algorithm do?
Because of the new algorithm, it is now possible to easily explore how human rights guidance can boost implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by country, theme, or group of affected persons.
The UHRI now shows the concrete linkages between individual recommendations issued by UN human rights mechanisms and the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda.
“For us it has been of great support to benefit from the innovations developed by our partners,” says Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, UN Human Rights. “Machine learning can dramatically improve efficiency and enable us to analyse and present the human rights work of the mechanisms in more accessible and visual ways.”
“We are proud to be part of a project where we can show the potential of this technology to promote human rights work,” says Cissé-Gouro. “We are particularly happy that the algorithm we are using has been developed in a way that provides a high degree of transparency and enables meaningful human oversight.”
For the future? UN Human Rights will continue to expand its work using the algorithm.
“The successful experience of integrating the algorithm on the UHRI has been a milestone for us,” explains Cissé-Gouro. “It continues to inspire our thinking on how we can analyse and present human rights guidance and information. We look forward to expand this work with our partners in the future driven by the aspiration of leaving no one behind.”

Posted May 8, 2022 1:34 pm.




Alberta is investing in the province’s first artificial intelligence (AI) lab, also known as GovLab.ai.


The initiative was launched as part of the Alberta Technology Innovation Strategy and alongside AltaML, which is a Canadian artificial intelligence company.
The AI lab’s goal is to shape Alberta’s digital future, according to a government release.
AltaML will work with government, post-secondary students, and recent graduates as they work to develop products and services that would use AI to solve complex, real-world problems.
The lab hopes to create intellectual property and also boost Alberta’s economy.
“Strengthening Alberta’s position as a leader in artificial intelligence is a key objective of the Alberta Technology and Innovation Strategy. By providing opportunities for students and government staff to build skill sets, we are moving our province forward and building an economy for the future,” said Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Jobs, Economy and Innovation.
The Alberta government will invest $3.4 million annually into GovLab.ai and in partnership with Mitacs, hopes to support job opportunities for post-secondary students.
Mitacs is a Canadian non-profit research organization that partners with academia, private industry and government to provide training programs in industrial and social innovation.
AltaML estimates that AI will yield approximately $100 million in benefits for Alberta over the next five years.
GovLab.ai’s purpose is to encourage the growth of machine learning and AI skills, which are becoming increasingly in demand in Alberta and around the world.

One of the features of the new tech lab is a talent accelerator for public service professionals, post-secondary students and recent graduates, the province says.
Students will have the ability to get hands-on experience in developing solutions.
“We are excited to work with the Government of Alberta and AltaML on GovLab.ai.,” said John Hepburn, CEO of Mitacs. “Innovation is an incredibly important part of Alberta and Canada’s future and this new collaboration will give students an opportunity to develop the hands-on skills that will be vital to solving society’s biggest problems.”

Getty
Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to permeate our daily lives by 2025. This could have huge implications on several business sectors, most notably healthcare, customer service and logistics. Already, AI is responsible for medical research breakthroughs and climate research, not to mention self-driving cars.


Will robots replace human workers? 

The answer to that seems to be divided. According to Pew Research, about half (48%) of experts surveyed felt that robots and digital agents will displace a significant number of blue- and white-collar jobs. Their concern is that this will increase income inequality and create a mass of virtually unemployable people. The other half (52%) expect robotics and AI to create more jobs than they take. This latter half believes that while AI will replace humans, these experts have faith in human ingenuity to create new jobs, industries, and new ways of making a living—much like at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.

Of interest in the Pew study, both groups are concerned that our educational institutions are not adequately preparing people for the job market of tomorrow.

What is artificial intelligence? 
PROMOTED
AI in its simplest form stands for artificial intelligence designed to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. Advocates of AI see this as a positive step forward. It will make it easier for businesses to identify and rectify problems. AI will potentially improve recruitment, cybersecurity, marketing, and standard operating processes.
AI can process large amounts of data and execute complex algorithms quickly and accurately. Each year, AI is getting ""smarter"" and increasing business efficiency.

Leading expert Martina Mara, professor of robopsychology at Johannes Kepler University Linz, suggests we ask a different question: What do we want the future of work to look like? How do we want robots to change our lives? She reminds us that robots are developed by people. While robots can work 24/7, they cannot generalize or contextualize. They have no soft skills.

They're hard wired, literally, to perform highly specific and clearly structured tasks. This is great news for humans—we get to pass off the mundane repetitive tasks and adopt those that require critical thinking and problem solving based on human intuition.

AI is evolving and technology is having an increasingly bigger role, but it will complement and augment most jobs, not replace them. In a study involving 1500 companies, researchers found that the most significant performance improvements occurred when humans and machines worked together. Humans perform three crucial roles: they train machines what to do, explain outcomes especially when those are counterintuitive or controversial, and they sustain responsible use of machines. Robots need us just as much as we need them.
Robots are used to do the heavy lifting, literally. In manufacturing, cobots, context-aware robots, perform repetitive actions dominated by heavy lifting, while their human coworker completes complementary tasks that require more dexterity and judgment.
Whether you are pro-bot or anti-bot, you may not have a choice. Rosie the Robot who worked for the Jetsons is probably still far away, but we already have robots that will vacuum our floors and AI has been used in the customer service industry for years.
We need to begin to look at how we can improve technology-related skills while at the same time promoting characteristically human skills. Creativity, intuition, initiative and critical thinking are human skills that will not likely translate to robots—at least not soon. We should already be thinking of how we as employers and employees can harness robots to augment the work we do.
If not already, it won't be long before your next co-worker is a robot.

The Socialists and Democrats have declared their support for the development and use of human-centric artificial intelligence technologies in the EU to help develop crucial areas of our society and economy. The S&Ds showed their support for the report of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age during the plenary debate in the European Parliament and the report was adopted this afternoon. AI can offer great benefits to society, including in the fields of healthcare and environmental protection, as well as opportunities for small and medium enterprises. The S&D Group wants the EU to benefit from all the opportunities AI brings, while ensuring we are protected from the potential hidden risks of these technologies, especially in relation to workers' rights and people’s private lives.
Brando Benifei MEP, the S&D negotiator on the issue of Artificial Intelligence, said: 
“Artificial intelligence brings a lot of opportunities to people in their daily lives, but we have to make sure this fully respects human dignity, the environment and the achievements of democracy. The EU should lead in a global debate about artificial intelligence and work on settling global standards. What the S&D Group wants to avoid at any price is turning Europe into a surveillance society with the help of AI. Europe is a world champion in the protection of privacy, protection of personal data and workers’ rights. We should not allow any undermining of all the achievements we, the Socialists and Democrats, have fought for so hard throughout the years. The surveillance of workers or biometric recognition in public spaces are against these values and we will continue to fight so that they are not allowed in Europe.”
Ibán García del Blanco MEP, S&D spokesperson in the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age, said: 
“After 18 months of work, our special committee has brought together a very balanced report where different aspects of human activity and challenges to the EU are reflected. Among them are the impact of AI on the daily lives of our citizens; its contribution to healthcare; the ways it can benefit the goals of the Green Deal; possible implications for democracy; the need for gender balance; and so many more. AI-powered surveillance in the workplace should not be allowed, as it severely compromises fundamental rights and mental health. We should continue a democratic dialogue with citizens, promoting AI literacy at all levels in order to have a technology that respects fundamental and workers’ rights.”

Editor’s note: On May 3 Eric Horvitz, Chief Scientific Officer, testified before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cybersecurity for a hearing on the use of AI in Department of Defense cyber missions. Read Eric Horvitz’s written testimony below and watch the hearing here.
 

Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Rounds, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to share insights about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on cybersecurity. I applaud the Subcommittee for its foresight and leadership in holding a hearing on this critically important topic. Microsoft is committed to working collaboratively with you to help ensure new advances in AI and cybersecurity benefit our country and society more broadly.
My perspective is grounded in my experiences working across industry, academia, scientific agencies, and government. As Microsoft’s Chief Scientific Officer, I provide leadership and perspectives on scientific advances and trends at the frontiers of our understandings, and on issues and opportunities rising at the intersection of technology, people, and society. I have been pursuing and managing research on principles and applications of AI technologies for several decades, starting with my doctoral work at Stanford University. I served as a Commissioner on the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI), was president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), chaired the Section on Computing, Information, and Communication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). I am a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. I currently serve on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Academies of Sciences.
I will cover in my testimony four key areas of attention at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity that warrant deeper understanding and thoughtful action:

Advancing cybersecurity with AI
Uses of AI to power cyberattacks
Vulnerabilities of AI systems to attacks
Uses of AI in malign information operations

Before covering these topics, I will provide brief updates on the cybersecurity landscape and on recent progress in AI. I’ll conclude my testimony with reflections about directions.
1. Cybersecurity’s changing landscape
Attacks on computing systems and infrastructure continue to grow in complexity, speed, frequency, and scale. We have seen new attack techniques and the exploitation of new attack surfaces aimed at disrupting critical infrastructure and accessing confidential data.[1] In 2021 alone, the Microsoft 365 Defender suite, supported by AI techniques, blocked more than 9.6 billion malware threats, 35.7 billion phishing and malicious emails, and 25.6 billion attempts to hijack customer accounts targeting both enterprise and consumer devices.[2],[3] Multiple independent reports have characterized the nature and status of different forms of cyberattack.[4] As detailed in Microsoft’s recent Digital Defense Report,[5] cyber criminals and nation-state actors continue to adapt their techniques to exploit new vulnerabilities and counter cyber defenses.
To help mitigate these concerning trends, the U.S. government has taken significant steps forward to secure our cyber ecosystem. Congress enacted several recommendations that came out of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, such as creating the Office of the National Cyber Director and enacting cyber incident reporting legislation. Almost a year ago, the Administration issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, which directs agencies to develop and implement a variety of initiatives to raise the bar on cybersecurity across areas, such as supply chain security, and requiring agencies to adopt a zero-trust model. Microsoft has worked diligently to meet deadlines specified in the E.O. on cybersecurity and we support these efforts to encourage a cohesive response to evolving cyber threats.
We expect to face continuing efforts by creative and tireless state and non-state actors who will attempt to attack computing systems with the latest available technologies. We need to continue to work proactively and reactively to address threats and to note changes in systems, technologies, and patterns of usage. On the latter, cybersecurity challenges have been exacerbated by the increasing fluidity between online work and personal activities as daily routines have become more intertwined.[6] The large-scale shift to a paradigm of hybrid work coming with the COVID-19 pandemic has moved workers further away from traditional, controlled environments. Cybersecurity solutions must enable people to work productively and securely across various devices from a variety of non-traditional locations.
2. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science focused on developing principles and mechanisms to solve tasks that are typically associated with human cognition, such as perception, reasoning, language, and learning. Numerous milestones have been achieved in AI theory and applications over the 67 years since the phrase “artificial intelligence” was first used in a funding proposal that laid out a surprisingly modern vision for the field.[7]
Particularly stunning progress has been made over the last decade, spanning advances in machine vision (e.g., object recognition), natural language understanding, speech recognition, automated diagnosis, reasoning, robotics, and machine learning—procedures for learning from data. Many impressive gains across subdisciplines of AI are attributed to a machine learning methodology named deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs have delivered unprecedented accuracy when fueled by large amounts of data and computational resources.
Breakthroughs in accuracy include performances that exceed human baselines for a number of specific benchmarks, including sets of skills across vision and language subtasks. While AI scientists remain mystified by the powers of human intellect, the rate of progress has surprised even seasoned experts.
Jumps in core AI capabilities have led to impressive demonstrations and real-world applications, including systems designed to advise decision makers, generate textual and visual content, and to provide new forms of automation, such as the control of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.
AI technologies can be harnessed to inject new efficiencies and efficacies into existing workflows and processes. The methods also can be used to introduce fundamentally new approaches to standing challenges.  When deployed in a responsible and insightful manner, AI technologies can enhance the quality of the lives of our citizenry and add to the vibrancy of our nation and world.  For example, AI technologies show great promise in enhancing healthcare via providing physicians with assistance on diagnostic challenges, guidance on optimizing therapies, and inferences about the structure and interaction of proteins that lead to new medications.
AI advances have important implications for the Department of Defense, our intelligence community, and our national security more broadly. Like any technology, the rising capabilities of AI are available to friends and foes alike. Thus, in addition to harnessing AI for making valuable contributions to people and society, we must continue to work to understand and address the possibilities that the technologies can be used by malevolent actors and adversaries to disrupt, interfere, and destroy. AI has important implications for cybersecurity as the technologies can provide both new powers for defending against cyberattacks and new capabilities to adversaries.
3. Advancing Cybersecurity with AI
The value of harnessing AI in cybersecurity applications is becoming increasingly clear. Amongst many capabilities, AI technologies can provide automated interpretation of signals generated during attacks, effective threat incident prioritization, and adaptive responses to address the speed and scale of adversarial actions. The methods show great promise for swiftly analyzing and correlating patterns across billions of data points to track down a wide variety of cyber threats of the order of seconds. Additionally, AI can continually learn and adapt to new attack patterns—drawing insights from past observations to detect similar attacks that occur in the future.
3.1 Assisting and Complementing Workforce
 The power of automation and large-scale detection, prioritization, and response made possible by AI technologies can not only relieve the burden on cybersecurity professionals but also help with the growing workforce gap. On the challenges to current cyber workforce: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates cybersecurity job opportunities will grow 33% from 2020 to 2030—more than six times the national average.[8] However, the number of people entering the field is not keeping pace. There is a global shortage of 2.72 million cybersecurity professionals, according to the 2021 (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study released in October 2021.[9]
 Organizations that prioritize cybersecurity run security operations teams 24/7. Still, there are often far more alerts to analyze than there are analysts to triage them, resulting in missed alerts that evolve into breaches. Trend Micro released a survey in May 2021 of security operations center decision makers that showed that 51% feel their team is overwhelmed with the overall volume of alerts, 55% are not confident in their ability to efficiently prioritize and respond to alerts, and that 27% of their time is spent dealing with false positives.[10]
AI technologies enable defenders to effectively scale their protection capabilities, orchestrate and automate time-consuming, repetitive, and complicated response actions. These methods can enable cybersecurity teams to handle large volumes of classical threats in more relevant time frames with less human intervention and better results. Such support with scaling on the essentials can free cybersecurity professionals to focus and prioritize on those attacks that require specialized expertise, critical thinking, and creative problem solving. However, additional attention should also be given to general cybersecurity training, security awareness, secure development lifecycle practices, and simulated training modules, including using AI to run intelligent and personalized simulations.
3.2 AI at Multiple Stages of Security
Today, AI methods are being harnessed across all stages of security including prevention, detection, investigation and remediation, discovery and classification, threat intelligence, and security training and simulations. I will discuss each of these applications in turn.
Prevention. Prevention encompasses efforts to reduce the vulnerability of software to attack, including user identities and data, computing system endpoints, and cloud applications. AI methods are currently used in commercially available technologies to detect and block both known and previously unknown threats before they can cause harm. In 2021, AV-Test Institute observed over 125 million new malware threats.[11] The ability of machine learning techniques to generalize from past patterns to catch new malware variants is key to being able to protect users at scale.
As an example, last year Microsoft 365 Defender successfully blocked a file that would later be confirmed as a variant of the GoldMax malware. Defender had never seen the new variant of GoldMax. The malware was caught and blocked leveraging the power of an AI pattern recognizer working together with a technology known as “fuzzy hashing”—a means for taking a fingerprint of malware.[12] It is important to note that GoldMax is malware that persists on networks, feigning to be a “scheduled task” by impersonating the activities of systems management software. Such hiding out as a scheduled task is part of the tools, tactics, and procedures of NOBELIUM, the Russian state actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds in December 2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service known as the SVR.
In other work, we have found that AI methods can improve our ability to detect sophisticated phishing attacks. Phishing attacks center on social engineering, where an attacker creates a fake webpage or sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive data to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim’s device, such as ransomware. To help protect people from harmful URLs, AI pattern recognizers have been deployed in browsers and other applications as part of their security services. AI methods can improve detection while lowering false positive rates, which can frustrate end users.[13]
Detection. Detection involves identifying and alerting suspicious behaviors as they happen. The goal is to quickly respond to attacks, including identifying the scale and scope of an attack, closing the attacker’s entry, and remediating footholds that the attacker may have established. The key challenge with detecting suspicious activity is to find the right balance between providing enough coverage via seeking high rates of accurate security alerts versus false alarms. AI methods are being leveraged in detection to (1) triage attention to alerts about potential attacks, (2) identify multiple attempts at breaches over time that are part of larger and lengthier attack campaigns, (3) detecting fingerprints of the activities of malware as it operates within a computer or on a network, (4) identifying the flow of malware through an organization,[14] and (5) guiding automated approaches to mitigation when a response needs to be fast to stop an attack from propagating. For example, an automated system can shut down network connectivity and contain a device if a sequence of alerts is detected that is known to be associated with ransomware activity like the way a bank might decline a credit card transaction that appears fraudulent.
There are several technologies available today to help detect attacks. I will use Microsoft 365 Defender capabilities as an example. A set of neural network models are used to detect a potential attack underway by fusing multiple signals about activities within a computing system, including processes being started and stopped, files being changed and renamed, and suspicious network communication.[15], [16] In addition, probabilistic algorithms are used to detect high likelihoods of “lateral movement” on a network.[17] Lateral movement refers to malware, such as ransomware, moving from machine to machine as it infects an organization. The goal is to detect signals of concerning patterns of spread and to shut down the infection by isolating potentially infected machines and alerting security experts to investigate. As numerous legitimate operations can appear like lateral movement of malware, simplistic approaches can have high false-positive rates. AI systems can help to raise the rate of capture and block these spreading infections, while reducing false positives.[18]
As a recent example, in March 2022, Microsoft leveraged its AI models to identify an attack attributed to a Russian actor that Microsoft tracks as Iridium, also referred to as Sandworm.  The US government has attributed Iridium activity to a group allegedly based at GRU Unit 74455 of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The actor deployed wiper malware at a Ukrainian shipping company based in Lviv. Wiper malware erases data and programs on the computers that it infects. The first documented encounter of this malware was on a system running Microsoft Defender with Cloud Protection enabled. The ensemble of machine learning models in Defender, combined with signals across client and cloud, allowed Microsoft to block this malware at first sight.
Investigation and remediation. Investigation and remediation are methods used following a breach to provide customers with a holistic understanding of the security incident, including the extent of the breach, which devices and data were impacted, how the attack propagated through the customer environment, and to seek attribution for the threat.[19] Gathering and doing synthesis from telemetry sources is tedious. Efforts to date include multiple tools to collect telemetry from within and across organizations. The use of AI for investigation and remediation is a promising and open area of research.[20],[21]
Threat intelligence. Threat intelligence enables security researchers to stay on top of the current threat landscape by tracking active malicious actors, at times deliberately engaging with them and studying their behavior. Today, Microsoft actively tracks 40+ active nation-state actors and 140+ threat groups across 20 countries.[22],[23] AI methods help to identify and tag entities from multiple feeds and intelligence sharing across agencies. AI models show promise with their ability to learn and make inferences about high-level relationships and interactions by identifying similarities across different campaigns for enhancing threat attribution.[24],[25]
Recommendations: Advance development and application of AI methods to defend against cyberattacks

Follow best practices in cybersecurity hygiene, including implementation of core protections such as multifactor authentication. Bolster security teams, regularly test backups and update patches, test incident response plans, and limit internet access to networks that do not require internet connectivity.
Invest in training and education to strengthen the U.S. workforce in cybersecurity, including education and training programs on cybersecurity for both traditional and AI systems.
Invest in R&D on harnessing machine learning, reasoning, and automation to detect, respond, and protect every step of the cyberattack kill chain.
Incentivize the creation of cross-sector partnerships to catalyze sharing and collaboration around cybersecurity experiences, datasets, best practices, and research.
Develop cybersecurity-specific benchmarks and leaderboards specific to validate research and accelerate learnings.

4. AI-powered cyberattacks
While AI is improving our ability to detect cybersecurity threats, organizations and consumers will face new challenges as cybersecurity attacks increase in sophistication. To date, adversaries have commonly employed software tools in a manual manner to reach their objectives. They have been successful in exfiltrating sensitive data about American citizens, interfering with elections, and distributing propaganda on social media without the sophisticated use of AI technologies. [26],[27],[28] While there is scarce information to date on the active use of AI in cyberattacks, it is widely accepted that AI technologies can be used to scale cyberattacks via various forms of probing and automation. Multiple research and gaming efforts within cybersecurity communities have demonstrated the power using AI methods to attack computing systems. This area of work is referred to as offensive AI.[29],[30]
4.1 Approaches to offensive AI
Offensive AI methods will likely be taken up as tools of the trade for powering and scaling cyberattacks.  We must prepare ourselves for adversaries who will exploit AI methods to increase the coverage of attacks, the speed of attacks, and the likelihood of successful outcomes. We expect that uses of AI in cyberattacks will start with sophisticated actors but will rapidly expand to the broader ecosystem via increasing levels of cooperation and commercialization of their tools.[31]
Basic automation. Just as defenders use AI to automate their processes, so too can adversaries introduce efficiencies and efficacies for their own benefit. Automating attacks using basic pre-programmed logic is not new in cybersecurity. Many malware and ransomware variants over the last five years have used relatively simple sets of logical rules to recognize and adapt to operating environments. For example, it appears that attacking software has checked time zones to adapt to local working hours and customized behavior in a variety of ways to avoid detection or take tailored actions to adapt to the target computing environment.[32],[33] On another front, automated bots have begun to proliferate on social media platforms.[34] These are all rudimentary forms of AI that encode and harness an attacker’s expert knowledge. However, substantial improvements in AI technology make plausible malicious software that is much more adaptive, stealthy, and intrusive.[35]
Authentication-based attacks. AI methods can be employed in authentication-based attacks, where, for example, recently developed AI methods can be used to generate synthetic voiceprints to gain access through an authentication system. Compelling demonstrations of voice impersonations to fool an authentication system were presented during the Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competition at the 2018 DEF CON meeting.[36]
AI-powered social engineering. Human perception and psychology are weak links in cyber-defense. AI can be used to exploit this persistent vulnerability. We have seen the rise of uses of AI for social engineering, aiming the power of machine learning at influencing the actions of people to perform tasks that are not in their interest. As an example, AI methods can be used to generate ultra-personalized phishing attacks capable of fooling even the most security conscious users. A striking 2018 study demonstrated how AI methods could be used to significantly raise the probability that end users would click on malevolent links in social media posts. The AI system learned from publicly available data including online profiles, connections, content of posts, and online activity of targeted individuals. Machine-learning was used to optimize the timing and content of messages with a goal of maximizing clickthrough rates—with significant results.[37] A 2021 study demonstrated that the language of emails could be crafted automatically with large-scale neural language models and that the AI-generated messages were more successful than the human-written messages by a significant margin.[38] In a related direction, Microsoft has tracked groups that use AI to craft convincing but fake social media profiles as lures.
4.2 AI-powered cyberattacks on the frontier
The need to prepare for more sophisticated offensive AI was highlighted in presentations at a National Academies of Sciences workshop on offensive AI that I co-organized in 2019. The workshop, sponsored by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led to a report available from the Academies.[39] The report includes discussion of the applications of AI methods across the cyber kill-chain, including the use of AI methods in social engineering, discovery of vulnerabilities, exploiting development and targeting, and malware adaptation, as well as in methods and tools that can be used to target vulnerabilities in Al-enabled systems, such as autonomous systems and controls used in civilian and military applications.
The cybersecurity research community has demonstrated the power of AI and other sophisticated computational methods in cyberattacks. Adversaries can harness AI to efficiently guess passwords, to attack industrial control systems without raising suspicions, and to create malware that evades detection or prevents inspection[40],[41],[42],[43],[44],[45] AI-enabled bots can also automate network attacks and make it difficult to extinguish the attacker’s command and control channels.[46] In another direction, a competitor demonstrated at a DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge exercise in 2016 [47] how machine learning could be used to learn how to generate “chaff” traffic, decoy patterns of online activity that resemble the distribution of events seen in real attacks for distraction and cover-up of actual attack strategies.[48]
It is safe to assume that AI will improve the success, impact, and scope of the full breadth of threats present today. AI will also introduce new challenges, including special cyber vulnerabilities introduced with general uses of AI components and applications, which create new apertures for adversaries to exploit.
Recommendations: Prepare for malicious uses of AI to perform cyberattacks

Raise DoD and other Federal agency awareness of the threat of AI-powered cyberattacks and directions with defenses against them, including detecting and thwarting new forms of automation and scaling.
DoD should deeply engage with the cybersecurity community, participate in R&D and competitions on AI-enhanced cyberattacks and continue to learn from frontier advances, findings, and proposed mitigations.
Increase R&D funding for exploring challenges and opportunities at the convergence of AI and cybersecurity. Consider the establishment of federally funded R&D centers of excellence in cybersecurity. Execute on the NSCAI recommendation to invest in DARPA to facilitate greater research on AI-enabled cyber defenses.[49]
Formalize and make more efficient cross-sector networks for sharing updates on evolving technologies, data, attack vectors, and attacks.

5. Special vulnerabilities of AI systems
The power and growing reliance on AI generates a perfect storm for a new type of cyber-vulnerability: attacks targeted directly at AI systems and components. With attention focused on developing and integrating AI capabilities into applications and workflows, the security of AI systems themselves is often overlooked. However, adversaries see the rise of new AI attack surfaces growing in diversity and ubiquity and will no doubt be pursuing vulnerabilities. Attacks on AI systems can come in the form of traditional vulnerabilities, via basic manipulations and probes, and via a new, troubling category: adversarial AI.
5.1 Attacks on AI Supply Chains 
AI systems can be attacked via targeting traditional security weaknesses and software flaws, including attacks on the supply chain of AI systems, where malevolent actors gain access and manipulate insecure AI code and data. As an example, in 2021, a popular software platform used to build neural networks was found to have 201 traditional security vulnerabilities, such as memory corruption and code execution.[50] Researchers have demonstrated how adversaries could use existing cyberattack toolkits to attack core infrastructure of the software running AI systems.[51] Multiple components of AI systems in the supply chain of AI systems can be modified or corrupted via traditional cyberattacks. As an example, data sets used to train AI systems are rarely under version control in the same way that source code is. Researchers from NYU found that most AI frameworks downloaded from a popular algorithm repository do not check the integrity of AI models, in contrast to the standards of practice with traditional software, where cryptographic verification of executables/libraries has been standard practice for well over a decade.[52]
5.2 Adversarial AI
Adversarial AI or adversarial machine learning methods harness more sophisticated AI techniques to attack AI systems. Several classes of adversarial AI have been identified, including adversarial examples, the use of basic policies or more sophisticated machine learning methods to fool AI systems with inputs that cause the systems to fail to function properly. A second type of attack is called data poisoning, where data used to train AI systems are “poisoned” with streams of data that inject erroneous or biased training data into data sets, changing the behavior or degrading the performance of AI systems.[53] A third type of attack, called model stealing, seeks to learn details about the underlying AI model used in an AI system.[54] A fourth category of attack, called model inversion, seeks to reconstruct the underlying private data that is used to train the target system.[55]
With adversarial examples, basic manipulations or more sophisticated application of AI methods are used to generate inputs that are custom-tailored to cause failures in targeted AI systems. Goals of these attacks include disruptive failures of automated message classifiers, perceptions of machine vision systems, and recognitions of the words in utterances by speech recognition systems.
As an example of basic manipulations of inputs, a group, alleged to be within the Chinese government, attempted to amplify propaganda on Uyghurs by bypassing Twitter’s anti-spam algorithm via appending random characters at the end of tweets.[56] The approach was viewed as an attempt to mislead the algorithm into thinking each tweet was unique and legitimate. In another example, researchers from Skylight appended benign code from a gaming database to Wannacry ransomware to cause the machine-learning-based antivirus filter to classify the modified ransomware as benign.[57] In related work on the fragility of AI systems, researchers showed that simply rotating a scan of a skin lesion confuses a computer recognition system to classify the image as malignant.[58]
In uses of AI to generate adversarial examples, researchers have demonstrated stunning examples of failures. In one approach, adversarial methods are used to inject patterns of pixels into images to change what an AI system sees. While the changes with AI inferences are dramatic, the changes to the original images are not detectable by humans. Sample demonstrations include the modification of a photo of a panda leading an AI system to misclassify the panda as a gibbon and changes to a stop sign to misclassify it as a yield sign.[59],[60] Similar demonstrations have been done in the realm of speech recognition, with the injection of hidden acoustical patterns in speech that changes what a listening system hears.[61] Attacks leading to such misclassifications and malfunctions can be extremely costly, particularly in high-stakes domains like defense, transportation, healthcare, and industrial processes.
Challenges of adversarial AI and a set of recommendations are called out in the final report of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI).[62] I chaired the lines of effort on directions with developing and fielding trustworthy, responsible, and ethical AI applications, leading to chapters 7 and 8 of the report and the appendix on NSCAI’s recommendations on key considerations for fielding AI systems that align with democratic values, civil liberties, and human rights.[63],[64],[65] Chapter 7 of the report covers rising concerns with adversarial AI, including the assessment that, “The threat is not hypothetical: adversarial attacks are happening and already impacting commercial ML systems.” In support of this statement, over the last five years, the Microsoft cybersecurity team has seen an uptick in adversarial AI attacks.[66] I believe the trend will continue.
5.3 Efforts to Mitigate Adversarial AI
Pursuit of resistant systems. Computer science R&D has been underway on methods for making AI systems more resistant to adversarial machine learning attacks. One area of work centers on raising the level of robustness of systems to attacks with adversarial inputs as described above.[67],[68] Approaches include special training procedures to include adversarial examples, validation of inputs to identify specific properties that can reveal signs of an attack and making changes to the overall approach to building models, and modifying the objective functions used in optimization procedures used to create the models so that more robust models are created. While the latter techniques and research directions behind them are promising, the challenges of adversarial examples persist, per the large space of inputs to machine learning procedures. Thus, it is important to continue to invest in R&D on adversarial AI, to perform ongoing studies with red-teaming exercises, and to remain vigilant.
5.4 Tracking, Awareness, and Resources
Front-line awareness. Despite the opportunities that adversarial AI methods will provide to state and non-state actors for manipulating and disrupting critical AI systems and rising evidence of real-world attacks with adversarial AI, the idea of protecting AI systems from these attacks has been largely an afterthought. There is an urgency to be aware and to be ready to respond to adversarial AI threats, especially those used in critical areas such as defense. A Microsoft survey of 28 organizations in 2020 showed, despite the rise in attacks on AI systems, companies are still unaware of these kinds of intentional failures to AI systems and are massively underinvested in tools and processes to secure AI systems. Ryan Fedasiuk, a noted researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Security of Emerging Technology specializing in China’s AI operations, notes that Chinese military officers have explicitly called out that the U.S. defenses are susceptible to data poisoning, and even so far as calling data integrity as “the Achilles’ heel” of the U.S. joint all-domain command and control strategy.[69]
Resources and Engagement. Microsoft, along with MITRE and 16 other organizations created the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix to catalog threats to AI systems.[70] The content includes documentation of case studies where attacks have been made on commercial AI systems. For engineers and policymakers, Microsoft, in collaboration with Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University, released a taxonomy of machine learning failure modes.[71] For security professionals, Microsoft has open-sourced Counterfit, its own tool for assessing the posture of AI systems.[72] For the broader community of cybersecurity practitioners interested in AI and security, Microsoft hosts the annual Machine Learning Evasion Competition as a venue to exercise their muscle in attacking and securing AI systems.[73] Within the Federal government, the DoD has listed safety and security of AI systems in its core AI principles.[74] And there is encouraging activity by NIST on an AI Risk Assessment Framework to address multiple dimensions of AI systems, including robustness and security.[75]
Recommendations: Raise awareness and address vulnerabilities of AI systems

Secure engineering supply chains for Federal AI systems, including use of state-of-the-art integrity checking for data, executables, libraries, and platforms used to construct AI systems; ensure that a security development lifecycle approach is in place for sensitive code and data.
Require security reviews of AI engineering projects at DoD and other Federal AI agencies.
Bring AI development and cybersecurity teams together to establish best practices and review programs.
Raise DoD awareness of challenges of adversarial AI and consider the vulnerabilities of AI systems and components.
Pursue the use of robust machine learning algorithms to bolster resilience of systems in the face of adversarial examples.
Develop training programs to raise awareness of cybersecurity and AI engineering workforce on security vulnerabilities of AI systems and components, risk of attacks with adversarial AI methods, and means for reducing risks.
Invest in R&D on trustworthy, robust, and secure AI systems.

6. AI in Malign Information Operations
Advances in machine learning and graphics have boosted the abilities of state and non-state actors to fabricate and distribute high-fidelity audiovisual content, referred to as synthetic media and deepfakes. AI technologies for generating deepfakes can now fabricate content that is indistinguishable from real-world people, scenes, and events, threatening national security. Advances that could only be found with the walls of computer science laboratories or in demonstrations that surprised attendees at academic AI conferences several years ago are now widely available in tools that create audio and audiovisual content that can be used to drive disinformation campaigns.
6.1 Challenges of Synthetic Media
Advances in the capabilities of generative AI methods to synthesize a variety of signals, including high-fidelity audiovisual imagery, have significance for cybersecurity. When personalized, the use of AI to generate deepfakes can raise the effectiveness of social-engineering operations (discussed above) in persuading end-users to provide adversaries with access to systems and information.
On a larger scale, the generative power of AI methods and synthetic media have important implications for defense and national security. The methods can be used by adversaries to generate believable statements from world leaders and commanders, to fabricate persuasive false-flag operations, and to generate fake news events. A recent demonstration includes the multiple examples of manipulated and more sophisticated deepfakes that have come to the fore over the course of the Russian attack on Ukraine. This includes a video of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appearing to call for surrender.[76]
The proliferation of synthetic media has had another concerning effect: malevolent actors have labeled real events as “fake,” taking advantage of new forms of deniability coming with the loss of credibility in the deepfake era. Video and photo evidence, such as imagery of atrocities, are being called fake. Known as the “liar’s dividend”, the proliferation of synthetic media emboldens people to claim real media as “fake,” and creates plausible deniability for their actions.[77]
We can expect synthetic media and its deployment to continue grow in sophistication over time, including the persuasive interleaving of deepfakes with unfolding events in the world and real-time synthesis of deepfakes. Real-time generations could be employed to create compelling, interactive imposters (e.g., appearing in teleconferences and guided by a human controller) that appear to have natural head pose, facial expressions, and utterances. Looking further out, we may have to face the challenge of synthetic fabrications of people that can engage autonomously in persuasive real-time conversations over audio and visual channels.
6.2 Direction: Digital Content Provenance
A promising approach to countering the threat of synthetic media can be found in a recent advance, named digital content provenance technology. Digital content provenance leverages cryptography and database technologies to certify the source and history of edits (the provenance) of any digital media. This can provide “glass-to-glass” certification of content, from the photons hitting the light-sensitive surfaces of cameras to the light emitted from the pixels of displays, for secure workloads. We pursued an early vision and technical methods for enabling end-to-end tamper-proof certification of media provenance in a cross-team effort at Microsoft.[78],[79] The aspirational project was motivated by our assessment that, in the long-term, neither humans nor AI methods would be able to reliably distinguish fact from AI-generated fictions—and that we must prepare with urgency for the expected trajectory of increasingly realistic and persuasive deepfakes.
After taking the vision to reality with technical details and the implementation of prototype technologies for certifying the provenance of audiovisual content, we worked to build and contribute to cross-industry partnerships, including Project Origin, the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), and the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a multistakeholder coalition of industry and civil society organizations. [80],[81],[82],[83] In January 2022, C2PA released a specification of a standard that enables the interoperability of digital content provenance systems.[84],[85] Commercial production tools are now becoming available in accordance with the C2PA standard that enable authors and broadcasters to assure viewers about the originating source and history of edits to photo and audiovisual media.
The final report of the NSCAI recommends that digital content provenance technologies should be pursued to mitigate the rising challenge of synthetic media. In Congress, the bipartisan Deepfake Task Force Act (S. 2559) proposes the establishment of the National Deepfake and Digital Provenance Task Force.[86] Microsoft and its media provenance collaborators encourage Congress to move forward with standing-up a task force to help identify and address the challenges of synthetic media and we would welcome the opportunity to provide assistance and input into the work.
 Recommendations: Defend against malign information operations

Enact the Deepfake Task Force Act.
Promote uses of digital media provenance for news and communications in defense and civilian settings.
Adopt pipelines and standards for certifying digital content provenance of signals, communications, and news at DoD and other Federal agencies, prioritized by risk and disruptiveness of fabricated content.
Review potential disruptions that malign information campaigns could have on DoD planning, decision making, and coordination based on manipulative uses of sophisticated fabrications of audiovisual and other signals, spanning traditional Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) pipelines, real-time defense communications, and public news and media.
Invest in R&D on methods aimed at detection, attribution, and disruption of AI-enabled malign information campaigns.

Summary
I have covered in my testimony status, trends, examples, and directions ahead with rising opportunities and challenges at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. AI technologies will continue to be critically important for enhancing cybersecurity in military and civilian applications. AI methods are already qualitatively changing the game in cyber defense. Technical advances in AI have helped in numerous ways, spanning our core abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks—including attacks that have never been seen before. AI innovations are amplifying and extending the capabilities of security teams across the country.
On the other side, state and non-state actors are beginning to leverage AI in numerous ways. They will draw new powers from fast-paced advances in AI and will continue to add new tools to their armamentarium. We need to double down with our attention and investments on threats and opportunities at the convergence of AI and cybersecurity. Significant investments in workforce training, monitoring, engineering, and core R&D will be needed to understand, develop, and operationalize defenses for the breadth of risks we can expect with AI-powered cyberattacks. The threats include new kinds of attacks, including those aimed squarely at AI systems. The DoD, federal and state agencies, and the nation need to stay vigilant and stay ahead of malevolent adversaries. This will take more investment and commitment to fundamental research and engineering on AI and cybersecurity, and in building and nurturing our cybersecurity workforce so our teams can be more effective today—and well-prepared for the future.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering your questions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its mark on the water industry, powering intelligent operations using machine learning to optimize resource use and operational budgets for organizations. Here are 10 ways AI is already changing the water industry, from business innovations that save money and make work more efficient to helping combat global water challenges by lowering overall water consumption.
1. AI will drive a decade of technology investment in water and wastewater
Water and wastewater operations are investing in artificial intelligence. Market research is forecasting $6.3 Billion of investment in AI solutions by the year 2030. This investment is a part of a growing trend for the water industry to “go digital” with smart infrastructure solutions. 


Mel Meng on training AI to SWMM: Can AI help predict sewer flows?
One example of AI in action is in predicting sewer flows. Sewer systems are critical infrastructure that transport wastewater to treatment plants, but with the impacts of climate change, aging infrastructure, and historical design practices, too much raw sewage is being released into our environment, causing harm to our planet and damaging properties. By training an AI model with thousands of examples, the model can learn to predict the next flow value, without the need to know the exact processes. 
2. AI will deliver significant OPEX savings
When some US utilities are spending over $300 per customer annually on water and wastewater operations, the potential for savings is significant. AI can save 20-30% on operational expenditures (OPEX) by reducing energy costs, optimizing chemical use for treatment, and enabling proactive asset maintenance.
3. AI will predict emergency events and learn from them at an accelerated rate
Water main breaks are costly for utilities in both financial and social capital. Articifical intelligence and machine learning can “fingerprint” the data patterns that indicate a break event may be imminent and learn from these patterns so that alerts become more accurate over time.


Water Talk: A guide to low-hanging AI fruit for the water and wastewater sector.
4. AI will provide sophisticated decisioning intelligence to support operators
Operators no longer need to analyze complex variables for important decision-making by themselves. Whether it’s turning pumps on or off, determining chemical dosages, or deciding when to maintain assets, AI enables “Operator 2.0” with intelligent recommendations and driven by machine learning.
5. AI will optimize energy use for both drinking water and wastewater
According to the EPA, for many municipal governments, drinking water and wastewater plants are their largest energy consumers, often accounting for 30 to 40 percent of their total energy consumed. That rolls up nationally to a large amount, with drinking water and wastewater systems accounting for approximately 2 percent of energy use in the United States. 
AI can optimize pump runtimes so that they are only using energy when they need to. This should be an easy cost-reduction win for early adopters of AI.
6. AI will help identify overconsumers of water and help them find ways to use less
The kind of efficiency artificial intelligence promises in water savings goes far beyond traditional utility operations and water distribution, for example in the realm of water footprints for datacenter management. Datacenters are becoming ever more pervasive and need ever-more energy to operate. They also need to build water cooling towers to cool the massive racks of servers they have set up in giant warehouses. 
Datacenters have become massive users of water for cooling racks of servers. Can AI help? 
This is all perhaps a bit ironic, considering that AI and machine learning applications themselves require significant datacenter resources, both in terms of raw energy usage and water usage for water. In some sense, energy-hungry AI applications may need to fulfill their water efficiency promises to alleviate their own water usage. 
Currently, more than 30 percent of the datacenters in the world are located in the US, accounting for around 2% of national elecricity usage. That’s as much energy as water and wastewater plants themselves use. Compiling accurate numbers for water usage by datacenters can be a challenge because the industry appears hesitant to share numbers, but we are already seeing big names like Google be more transparent about their water usage, which may encourage more transparency and solution seeking. 
It’s reasonable to assume that these operators know the amount of water they are using is too high and that they themselves will want to find innovative ways related to AI to help reduce their usage, both to realize more cost savings and improve their optics around the issue of sustainability. 
7. AI will keep water clean, cost-effectively
Meeting effluent compliance standards is a requirement for many organizations – both public and private. AI learns from the unique characteristics of your site to ensure that effluence standards are met and that compliance fees are avoided.
8. AI will simplify data integrity
An explosion of available data for water operations managers has brought along a challenge of data management. SCADA systems, CMMS, and even social media hold a wealth of knowledge to improve operations. AI can take this heterogeneous data and process it so that it is clean, useful, secure, and drives high-fidelity recommendations.
9. AI will retain institutional knowledge
How do you ensure that a veteran operator’s valuable knowledge is retained after they leave the workforce? AI-powered dashboards will keep institutional knowledge documented and standardized.
10. AI will accelerate the move to value-based asset maintenance
Early adopters of AI are quickly leaving reactive asset maintenance behind. Time-based maintenance is easy to manage but results in unnecessary uptime and deterioration. Let AI tell your team what assets need to be serviced, and when.

Many of us don’t like the idea of putting decisions that can seriously impact people’s lives in the hands of machines, particularly when we might not necessarily understand how and why they do what they do.
The Benefits And Dangers Of Using AI In RecruitmentAdobe Stock

But what if it turns out that machines were actually capable of making decisions in a way that is fairer and less prone to prejudice and bias than decisions made by humans? For many of those working on the problem of applying machine intelligence to recruitment and HR, this is the goal. And going a step further than that, is it possible that AI can help overcome the challenges of today’s fast-changing hiring landscape? The shift to home and remote working prompted by the global Covid-19 pandemic, as well as related developments such as the “great resignation”, require HR departments to navigate and predict their way around complex and ever-changing employee behavioral patterns.

These are the type of patterns that AI excels at recognizing, understanding, and predicting. This is why Google is so good at predicting what you want to search for, and Netflix is so accurate at predicting what you want to watch next – 80% of viewing on the streaming service is apparently driven by recommendations!

PROMOTED
Nevertheless, while we might be happy for a machine to help us choose which movie to watch next, we might feel a bit uneasy at the thought of it deciding whether we can have a job or not – or which workers a company should hire or fire.

I was reassured to learn that these are concerns that are shared by Frida Polli, the CEO and founder of Pymetrics – one of the leading AI-driven recruitment platforms. I was recently joined by Polli for a conversation in which we discussed the ethical implications of this type of technology, as well as how it is evolving to help companies understand concepts like “soft skills”. These are concepts that can be vital to understanding how well a candidate might fit a certain role but are often poorly conveyed by traditional recruitment data gathering channels – such as resumes and interviews.

Crucially, by helping organizations get a better understanding of what candidates have to offer in this regard, they can lead to less biased and more effective recruiting decisions. This is a view held not just by Polli but by one of her company's customers – Tan Moorthy, global head of education, training, and assessment at Infosys. Moorthy also joined us in the conversation.

Moorthy says, ""If you look at what's going on with technology skills, the lifespan of how long they're relevant is reducing on the one hand, and then we have automation that is taking away roles that people can do.

“What that means is … you need to figure out ways in which people can coexist with machines. That’s the critical need … you have to recruit the right talent [and] it's important therefore to bring in people not based on their degrees but on their skills.”
At Infosys, this understanding of the current challenges in the employment space has led to the establishment of the Reskill and Restart program. The program is built around a free-to-use online platform that connects employers and trainers with jobseekers and potential hires based on their skills and interests rather than their backgrounds and education. So far, it has enabled hundreds of people to reskill for profitable and rewarding careers in the tech industry.
Pymetrics has played an important role in this process thanks to its innovative AI-powered employment decisioning tools.
“I completely understand the concerns around AI. It’s incumbent around tech providers like ourselves to prove we’re equitable … but once we can do that, it's critical for societies to start leveraging some of these platforms - like Reskill and Restart and Pymetrics – that can really help with these broad labor market problems”, Polli tells me.
Polli took the time to explain to me some of the principles behind the way that Pymetrics specifically works. By assessing the soft skills – such as a person’s communication and decision-making ability, as well as their empathy, generosity, or altruism – smarter decisions can be made about who might be a good fit for particular roles. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it differentiates between “good” and “bad” people, as might be implied by the fact it is assessing, for example, altruism.
“What’s amazing … is that everything can be personalized”, she says.
“I get the question all the time, ‘what are the soft skills people need?’ – but that’s not a thing – the soft skills you need to be a successful entrepreneur versus a successful accountant versus a successful CIA agent are completely different … and what’s beautiful about [AI] is that we can be very prescriptive and personalized in our recommendations.
“I might not have the soft skill profile to be an accountant because I’m biased to action and not very methodical, but … an entrepreneur – I can do that.”
This new way of assessing potential is potentially highly valuable in a world where machines will inevitably be making humans redundant in some roles – such as drivers and machine operators – and free them up to take on different, potentially more rewarding tasks.
“Gone are the 1980s… ‘oh, if you’re this, then you'll do this, and you'll be successful – and if you're not, you're out of luck … technology enables us to do that,"" says Polli.
Moorthy says that this type of intelligent assessment and personalized recommendation is crucial to the role Infosys hopes to play in reskilling the workforce of tomorrow.
“We have to look out for people who are in different professions – who want to make a move into technology, and create a pathway for them to get there,” he tells me.
“Recruitment will therefore have to look out for people who have … the ability and desire to learn new things … and the capability of saying ‘I transferred these skills from my last job into this profession, or this industry’. So transferrable skills will be important, and recruitment will have to constantly look out for means by which we can identify those people who carry those transferrable skills, so they can learn and become the talent of the future.""

AbbVie Chooses Cerebras Systems to Accelerate AI Biopharmaceutical Research




Cerebras CS-2 accelerates artificial intelligence work while radically reducing power consumption






May 05, 2022 01:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerebras Systems, the pioneer in high performance artificial intelligence (AI) computing, and AbbVie, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced a landmark achievement in AbbVie’s AI work. Using a Cerebras CS-2 on biomedical natural language processing (NLP) models, AbbVie achieved performance in excess of 128 times that of a graphics processing unit (GPU), while using 1/3 the energy. Not only did AbbVie train the models more quickly, and for less energy, due to the CS-2’s simple, standards-based programming workflow, the time usually allocated to model set up and tuning was also dramatically reduced.

“At Cerebras Systems, our goal is to enable AI that accelerates our customer’s mission”Post this

“A common challenge we experience with programming and training BERT LARGE models is providing sufficient GPU cluster resources for sufficient periods of time,” said Brian Martin, Head of AI at AbbVie. “The CS-2 system will provide wall-clock improvements that alleviate much of this challenge, while providing a simpler programming model that accelerates our delivery by enabling our teams to iterate more quickly and test more ideas.”

With a focus on cutting edge R&D across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and virology, it’s essential for AbbVie’s scientists to keep abreast of research findings from around the world. To that end, AbbVie employs large, sophisticated AI language models to build its machine translation service, Abbelfish. This service accurately translates and makes searchable vast libraries of biomedical literature across 180 languages using large, state-of-the-art Transformer models such as BERT, BERT LARGE, and BioBERT.

Ensuring Abbelfish is both accurate and always up to date requires training and re-training the NLP models from scratch with domain-specific biomedical data. However, the Abbelfish model is very large – 6 billion parameters. Such a model is impractical to train on even the largest GPU clusters. Cerebras Systems makes this type of large-scale AI training fast and easy.

Large language models like BERT LARGE have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy on many language processing and understanding tasks. Training these large language models using GPUs is challenging and time-consuming. Training from scratch on new datasets often takes weeks, even on large clusters of legacy equipment. As the size of the cluster grows, power, cost, and complexity grow exponentially. Programming clusters of graphics processing units requires rare skills, different machine learning frameworks and specialized tools that take weeks of engineering time to each iteration.

The CS-2 was built to directly address these challenges and radically reduce the time to insight. The CS-2 delivers the deep learning performance of 100s of GPUs, with the programming ease of a single node. As a result, less time is spent in set up and configuration, less time is spent training and more ideas are explored. The AbbVie team was able to set up and train their custom BERT LARGE model from scratch in less than two days with the Cerebras CS-2.

“At Cerebras Systems, our goal is to enable AI that accelerates our customer’s mission,” said Andrew Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Cerebras Systems. “It’s not enough to provide customers with the fastest AI in the market -- it also must be the most energy efficient and the easiest to deploy. It’s incredible to see AbbVie not only accelerating their massive language models, but doing so while consuming a fraction of the energy used by legacy solutions.”

The Cerebras CS-2 is powered by the largest processor ever built – the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine 2 (WSE-2), which is 56 times larger than the nearest competitor. As a result, the CS-2 delivers more AI-optimized compute cores, more fast memory, and more fabric bandwidth than any other deep learning processor in existence. It was purpose built to accelerate deep learning workloads reducing the time to answer by orders of magnitude.

With customers and partners in North America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Cerebras is delivering industry leading AI solutions to a growing roster of customers in the enterprise, government, and high performance computing segments including GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, TotalEnergies, nference, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), and Tokyo Electron Devices.

Some previous AI Power articles – including “The SDGs of Strong AI” and “AI Ethics at War” have been popular over the years – but I’ve taken a hiatus from writing AI Power articles but suspect that I’ll be creating more in 2022. I’m grateful to my friends for helping to put this first piece together – I hope you enjoy it. – Daniel Faggella In 2010, most Americans would struggle to list the ways in which AI impacts their day-to-day life.  In 2022, many of us spend large percentages of our daily life using AI applications. They guide our route to the office, they automatically edit our photos, they find obscure products or facts, and – mostly – they entertain or distract us. Not only has our screen time increased over the last twelve years, our “percent of screen time generated by AI” has gone up astronomically.  The most prominent of the AI interfaces we interact with today are optimized at keeping us “engaged” – maximizing for the goal of the platform itself: Revenue (through advertising, purchases, and/or maintained subscriptions). In this article I’ll lay out a case as to why and how AI will invariably expand into a necessary addition for nearly all productive work, and how the proliferation of this trend might lead to more serious cognitive augmentation and transhumanism. I’ve broken this article down into the following sections: TL;DR Summary Defining Terms – “Distractive” and “Ambitious” AI Why Entertainment and Passive AI Came First From the Goals of the Platform – to the Goals of the User AI Augmentation – From Web Apps to Brain Computer-Interface Quotes and Perspectives from Experts While this article is a collection of some of my own ideas, it’s built from many great conversations with the many brilliant minds we’ve connected with at Emerj Artificial Intelligence Research. From academics, to startup founders, to United Nations AI leaders – I’m grateful to all of the friends and folks in our expert network for contributing quotes, ideas, and articles worth referencing to in this work. Their quotes are referenced throughout, as well as in the final section of the article below. Note: This won’t be an essay assailing the founders of current AI-augmented media platforms for being malicious or detrimental to mental health. Rather, I’ll be examining trends and incentives, not the moral character of individuals. TL;DR Summary Entertainment-oriented consumer AI applications (Distractive AI, appealing to the drive for pleasure) have dominated the first wave of AI-powered consumer apps mostly because of the fact that they can optimize for the same goals (engagement) across all users. In the decade ahead, an ecosystem of AI-enabled applications will emerge that serve to further generally “productive” goals (Ambitious AI, appealing to the drives for power and profit), and these applications will need to overcome the technical challenges of being trained on more bespoke/varied goals than many Distractive use-cases. Living in hyper-customized AI ecosystems becomes normal: In the coming 10-15 years, most people will spend most of their time in a combination of Distractive and Ambitious AI environments. To spend time in neither will be unheard-of.
Distractive AI will appeal to people who wish for the fastest track to ease and pleasure. Ambitious AI will appeal to people who want to become more powerful or active through technology, rather than more satiated and passive. Achieving career/life goals and seeking fulfillment will both be unquestionably better pursued within AI interfaces than without them, making adoption a simple choice for most people. For both Distractive and Ambitious use-cases, the user experience will go from isolated experiences to ubiquitous experiences, roughly: First: Web or mobile apps Second: Immersive AR/VR Third: Brain-computer interface The cognitive augmentation of Ambitious AI (first through apps, eventually through actual brain augmentation) will become as required for influence and power in the world or tomorrow as literacy and computer skills are for the world of today. The pursuit of pleasure, power, and profit in drastically personalized virtual worlds will lead to a radical shift in the human condition – and the emergence of cognitively augmented, post-human intelligences. The business and intergovernmental communities should consider the pathways that these technologies should develop, and prepare for a world where divergent, augmented intelligences interact primarily in a virtual – not physical – world. Defining Terms I’ve broken out AI’s impact on consumer technologies into two categories: Distractive and Ambitious.  Distractive AI Goals: Is optimized to achieve the goals of a platform (improving engagement, use time or purchases). You are wielded by it. You are marshaled toward its aims. Passive or active: Passive. Purpose: Generally designed to help the user avoid the the challenges of the state of nature (life challenges, stress from work, etc). Appeals to human drives: Pleasure. Examples:  Web or mobile app: Netflix binging, YouTube rabbit holes, TikTok infinite scrolling, etc. Immersive VR/brain-computer interface: Programmatically generating an entire movie, or series of films, based on the topics/themes of interest for the user, and the desired emotional state that the user wants to experience. Distractive AI is the use of AI primarily for distraction and entertainment – the primary goal it strives for is a change of emotional state. People want to forget their stressors and be entertained, laugh, or otherwise distract themselves. Others may want to confirm or deepen negative emotions to somehow validate or reinforce those feelings – a phenomena referred to today as doomscrolling. Ambitious AI Goals: Is optimized to help you achieve or become what you want. It is wielded by you. It is marshaled toward your aims. Passive or active: Active. Purpose: Generally designed to help the user compete in the state of nature (achieve tangible goals, perform at work, get things done). Appeals to human drives: Power, profit, pride. Examples:  Web or mobile app: AI app that helps salespeople close deals by providing them with real-time prompts on how to handle objections, or how to write follow-up or prospecting emails – based on what has worked for previous sales. Immersive VR/brain-computer interface: An AI application that helps entrepreneurs stay on task and grow their company – nudging them away from distraction and towards the right focus areas to further their business goals. Ambitious AI is mostly about helping the user achieve more of user’s own goals. We might call this self-directed AI augmentation.  Most of what could be called “complex” Ambitious AI and “complex” Distractive AI is safely outside the capabilities of today’s (2022) technology – but this won’t be the case for long.  In the rest of this article I’ll explore near-term and long-term applications of self-directed AI augmentation. But first, we’ll look at why the more passive Distractive AI dominates the first wave of machine learning consumer applications. Why Distractive AI Dominates Today It would be untrue to say that all of the first wave of machine learning-powered consumer applications were completely Distractive.  Very few people are addicted to Google search, Waze navigation guidance, unlocking their smartphones via facial recognition, etc. Many of these applications are simply convenient, or (in the case of Google search), potentially very helpful in promoting one’s own general life goals. The often-lamented impacts of this first wave of ML-powered consumer applications – including addiction and distraction – are largely from social and streaming media. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube and TikTok are different platforms, but their goal is the same: Maximizing screen time and advertising exposure.  “You get a show or a movie you’re really dying to watch and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep… and we’re winning!” – Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, at the 2017 Summit LA (source) To break down Distractive AI a bit further: Goal: Improve engagement, i.e. Time using free application – continued advertising exposure Time using paid application – continued subscription revenues Measuring Goal Attainment: Relatively easy (Is the user still scrolling? Are they using the app more often, or for longer periods of time? Are they spending more money on the platform?) Example: Netflix, Twitter, etc, optimizing watch time and engagement with content. Bespoke-ness: Very similar process to train from one user to another. There is some specificity for individuals… but that overall it’s the same end game: Keep them on the platform to either (a) see ads, or (b) pay a subscription. “Stickiness” and use are the general aim. User Upside: Unlimited entertainment, media, and information calibrated to our preferences/interests. User Downside: Constant distraction, a personally calibrated form of potentially addicting escape. Ultimately unfulfilling Monetary Cost: Cheap or Free “Distractive AI” took off before self-directed AI augmentation mainly because it’s easier to optimize for distraction. Technical Viability Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube have enormous volumes of data to deal with, and outlandishly different preferences from one user to another. Yet from a technical standpoint, they benefit from two factors:  A gigantic number of users. While niche productivity applications for architectural design or enterprise might acquire millions of users, general “entertainment” needs apply across careers and demographics. Paid applications like Netflix can still achieve hundreds of millions of users – and free applications like TikTok and Facebook reach billions. A single set of quantifiable metrics to optimize for across all users. Engagement. While it isn’t child’s play, it’s fundamentally the same process to keep a horror movie fanatic on Netflix as it is a family who likes to watch Disney movies. (Netflix’s Research/Engineering Director, Justin Basilico has a 30-minute presentation on recommendation applications that is worth watching for any layperson interested in the topic.) Each user is different, but the variables to adjust (content the user can engage with, types actions – like clicks, comments, views of a video, etc) are the same. The company’s aim is to find the right combination of experiences to encourage higher usage from the user. Comparing Distractive vs Productive AI Use-Cases Compare this “watch time”/“engagement” optimization to the narrow, productive challenge of optimizing for sales productivity.  An AI application for sales enablement might listen to tens of thousands of sales calls and achieve specific outcomes to help salespeople sell more, such as: Labeling important segments of a call, such as “introductions”, “need discovery”, “overcoming objections”, etc… – allowing sales teams to better analyze their calls. Labeling the sentiment of the prospect and salesperson throughout a sales call. Prompting salespeople during the conversation with their next statement or objective (i.e. “Move to presenting our offerings” or “Here’s how to overcome this price objection”). etc… Some applications along these lines already exist. My interviews with the CEOs of unicorn firms like Outreach.io, and AI-enabled sales platforms like Chorus.ai (recently acquired for over $500MM by ZoomInfo) has lead me to see the great promise of narrow AI for sales enablement – but it’s also made some of the limitations of the technology clear: It likely won’t be replacing salespeople or astronomically improving the performance of average sales reps and time soon. Helping a user reach their own bespoke goals is more complicated than keeping them engaged on an individual platform – it involves much more nuanced criteria of success (not simply “user using application more = good”), and, generally, a much more varied set of inputs and variables (not just “scrolls, clicks, video views, comments, etc in a single app”). Comparing Productive AI Use-Cases to Generally Self-Directed AI Use-Cases Now take this “sales productivity” optimization against a general optimization for “furthering the user’s life goals.”  Say we have a hypothetical user, Mary, a young lawyer with the aspiration of becoming a Senator and pushing for more environmentally friendly policies, particularly around preventing and cleaning up pollution – a cause she believes in deeply.  A kind of “general” AI application geared to optimizing for these life goals might serve in a variety of ways in Mary’s life. Here are a few hypothetical examples: The system might scour secondary sources about women around Mary’s age who had achieved the goal of becoming a Senator, using this information to build a kind of informed outline or plan – and presenting Mary with options for next steps based on the most viable and effective paths found in the research. The system might feed real-time recommendations to Mary via her smartphone of AR glasses, reminding her to study, or to network with specific political figures, etc. The system might help to promote Mary’s desired sleep and nutritional habits in order to ensure that she is able to perform on the job (based on general sleep and nutrition knowledge, and on Mary’s historical performance under differing food/sleep conditions over time). etc… This long-term goal of becoming a Senator and reducing pollution is an inherently subjective goal, and after a day of deterring distractions and encouraging healthy habits and aiding in work productivity, an AI system would have a hard time knowing how well it performed.  Is Mary closer to, or not closer to, becoming a Senator after she took this action, or made this interim career choice, or choose to handle these emails in her inbox instead of these? The more bespoke (customized from user to user) and abstract (not immediately quantifiable by a metric such as screen time, clicks, purchases, etc) the objectives are – the harder it is to train a viable AI system. This is evidenced by the fact that essentially all of the hypothetical use-cases listed above are outside the range of what AI applications are capable of today. I’d argue that this challenge of handling bespoke and abstract goals is the biggest reason that Ambitious AI applications have lagged, and Distractive AI has dominated the first wave of ML-powered consumer applications. But the desire for power and productivity is great – and the as-yet-unrealized wave of Ambitious AI applications will arrive – and it will have a profound impact on how we live and work. From the Goals of the Platform – to the Goals of the User There was a time when only a tiny fraction of the world’s useful information could be found on the internet.  There was a time when AI was nearly incapable of searching for content relevance beyond simple, clumsy keyword search. During this time – though human beings had an unlimited desire to access information, and ease of access – Google search could not have come into existence. The data, the internet infrastructure, the processing power, and the machine learning state-of-the-art were not there yet. Similarly, there have been many barriers that have prevented Ambitious AI from coming into existence, and there still are. These barriers vary by use-case, but we can take a look at a handful of the barriers that might hold back some of the more general Ambitious AI use-cases. Quantifiability of Actions: Amazon can train algorithms to recommend products to users in large part because it can track user behavior. A search (string of keywords), a click, an “add to cart”, and a long purchase history – all are concrete data points. Contrast this with a company like Target, whose shoppers visit in-store locations. It is much harder to get a sense of who these customers are (you don’t have to “log in” with a username and email to walk into Target), never mind what they’re interest in. For the same reason, helping users with bespoke lift goals (study for classes, making sales, writing code, hiring staff) is a hairy problem involving a lot of context and, often, not much by way of concrete data points. Ambitious AI will have to begin in narrower domains where these criteria are clear. Accurately Assessing and Structuring Human Goals: Someone with the goal of “becoming a Senator” or “starting a successful Indian restaurant” has other motives in mind. For some it might be prestige, for others wealth. Some need to perform just better than peers, or just well enough, while others must best anyone in the history of their field. An AI system that generally nudges users towards their goals will have to determine what these goals actually are – probably by not only taking direct instructions from a human users, buy by observing the human user’s actions – and the kind of “progress” that the human user actually seems satisfied with. (Note: AI alignment is a field unto itself. Paul Christiano’s work is a good start for readers new to the subject.) (Business Model Concerns): Netflix is cheap because it can reach hundreds of millions, Facebook is cheap because advertisers pay for your attention when you’re on it. Ambitious AI – if it be Ambitious AI at all – serves the goals of the user, not the advertiser. This will cost a premium, likely a significant subscription fee – and will, for most users – involve a significant amount of high-touch consulting and feedback with the provider of the service to make sure that goals, progress, and behaviors are calibrate properly, and that the device seems to be genuinely benefitting the user based on the expectations of that user. Without a million users doing the same thing, training time and high-touch calibration will probably be necessary, expensive, and in some cases, prohibitively hard. These hurdles are significant, and probably won’t begin to be overcome for years. Nonetheless, over the coming decade, human drives will bring about this next wave of ML applications, an ecosystem of Ambitious AI. Humans have an innate desire to compete – and there will always be a market for whatever technologies help to wield power. Today the ambitious CEOs, politicians, and busy professionals are likely on their computers whenever they’re not in meetings. Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete. Tomorrow they will be – from the moment they awake – nudged towards their most important tasks and away from distractions by AI systems designed to maximize the use of their time. Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete. 15 years from now they will live immersed in a VR workspace, in an environment optimized to maintain their focus and ensure their peak performance in their tasks (strategizing, selling, negotiating, delivering on client projects, etc).  Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete (more on this in a bit). While there are many possible models for human drives, neuroscientist Nayef Al-Rodhan’s (Head of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy’s Geopolitics and Global Futures Programme) useful model suggests that in addition to pleasure – humans are driven by power, pride, profit, and permanence. There is absolutely a market for any kind of technology that helps to achieve any one of them. The Ambitious AI ecosystem will inevitably arise because power, profit, and pride demand it. While there is a certain kind of pleasure in achievement – any user who seeks pleasure alone will likely find it more swiftly through Distractive AI. One will be incapable of entering the ranks of the most capable and prominent persons without Ambitious AI. In fact, one may not even be employable (as people without basic computer skills or familiarity with common software applicants are often not employable today). The leaders of the most powerful nations and organizations – and essentially high-performing persons – will be those who take full advantage of these technologies. Not all users will choose to adopt Ambitious AI. Some may opt out entirely, while others may use Ambitious AI sparingly.  Some people will avoid work and escape almost entirely into AI-generated feeds of enticing distraction and entertainment. They will be the lotus eaters. Some people will live almost entirely in AI-gamified interfaces that encourage them to drive towards goals (financial/ creative/ career/ otherwise), making every second of work optimally productive, automating every automate-able task, and making every second of non-work (entertainment, sleep, time with friends) serve the sole purpose of fueling work performance. I’ve referred to them as world eaters. I suspect that in the coming 10 years, most people will spend time in a mix of Distractive and Ambitious interfaces. Spending time in neither will be unheard-of.  “Analog” entertainment, and “analog” methods of striving/achieving will be – rightfully – seen as mostly laughably outdated and pointless – the same way making your own shoes from leather, or entertaining yourself with a hoop and stick seems outdated and pointless today. This is not only because Distractive AI and Ambitious AI will become more satisfying and useful (respectively) – but because they’ll become more and more literally embedded in our lives – and in our minds. AI Augmentation – From Isolated to Integrated Experiences The graphic below represents how AI augmentation is likely to progress, from individual user interfaces to brain-computer interfaces:  This transition from apps to brain-computer interfaces is pulled along by both of the categories of human drives we’ve already addressed: Pleasure – Even with all the AI-enabled entertainment in the world, the hedonic treadmill is still real, and only by augmenting do we have a chance to experience continuous states of wellbeing. Once people live in AI-enabled VR worlds and are still unhappy, they’ll demand that we address the root of the problem: the brain itself. Power, profit, pride – Even with all the AI-enabled productivity interfaces in the world – the human mind still has limitations for memory, creativity, and more. As the demands of work require more augmentation, and as AI augmentation in VR becomes normal, the focus will shift to augmenting the mind itself.  Below are some examples of what Distractive and Ambitious AI applications might look like in all three phases of development: Distractive AI Use-Cases Today – Web or Mobile App Imagine scrolling endlessly through images or videos programmatically conjured to suit their preferences and capture their attention. Invest real time and money into virtual games, where quests involve interactions with real and computer generated characters and personalities, where “achievement” feels real and endlessly entertaining. Near Future – Immersive AR/VR VR experiences totally customized to a user’s goals, preferences, and real-time response (EEG / EKG / eye-movement / other). Imagine a user saying “Okay Google, show me a VR movie about samurai, both from the point of view of the main character, and make sure to include vampires as the bad guys” – and having a completely programmatically generated film conjured up for your enjoyment. A gamified AR layer over reality itself (via contact lenses, glasses) – making environments more pleasant. Imagine every room in your home having colors, views, and musical scores calibrated exactly to what would seem pleasant to you at that time. Future – Brain-Computer Interface Swimming in a VR/AR sea of AI-generated experiences – ranging from sexual pleasure to humor to beautiful art to heroic adventure and more. Brain-computer interface and nanotechnology mostly eliminate the fetters of positive sentient experience, allowing for a near-constant experience of gradients of bliss. Experiencing “relationships” with programmatically generated entities who have no goal other than to fulfill your own goals – a universe designed to explore pleasurable experiences (from base pleasures to more rich pleasures from creativity, or pride – but also a wide range of positive emotional experiences that we don’t have names for right now because they exist outside the range of our present hardware). Ambitious AI Use-Cases Today – Web or Mobile App Leverages AI-powered apps to optimize their sleep schedule. Uses AI-enabled software to run sales, accounting, and other discrete functions of one’s business or career. Near Future – Immersive AR/VR Some ambitious people live entirely in VR work environments calibrated to maintain focus and mood, while also prioritizing the most productive tasks. These systems are gamified to be engaging – and they deter distractions (possibly with notifications, with blocks on certain apps, or simply by making work tasks vastly more appealing in the forefront of the user’s experience). Ever-present AI-enabled notifications keep users abreast of exactly what should be top of mind.  Future – Brain-Computer Interface For nearly all waking hour, the user is prompted to act by habits and behaviors most conducive to performance for said user’s desired goals. This might involve or include: Calibrated sleep and wake time, based on the circadian rhythm and previous work performance and sleep patterns. A configured schedule optimized to leverage their most productive tasks. A stream of recommendations for improving workflows and outcomes based on best-practices, historical performance, etc. Algorithms are trained in real-time based on user experience to handle discrete tasks (from email replies to data entry to interviewing candidates for jobs, etc), allowing the main user to only focus on the edge-cases for almost all of his/her common work tasks – thus allowing the user to be astronomically more productive. Brain-computer interface users will communicate huge volumes of information simultaneously without the hindrances of typing. Anyone aiming to be of use in the white collar world will positively require these technologies – just as modern knowledge workers require a cell phone and computer literacy. If those sound monstrous, impossible and disturbing to you now, we can also be sure that commercial air travel, transgender surgeries and 10-year-olds addicted to TikTok feeds would all sound just as monstrous, impossible and disturbing to someone born in 1900. And yet here we are today. And there we will be tomorrow. So while Ambitious AI applications will be much more likely to help people achieve their own goals (as opposed to the “engagement” goals of Distractive AI applications), they will also force accelerated change to the human condition – changing the nature of what achievement and power are, and how they are wielded.  The tools can only be upgraded so far until human hardware itself must be augmented, and it’s nearly inevitable that exactly this is what will happen. In wellbeing, people will face the choice of augmentation or (comparative) unhappiness. In productivity and creativity, people will face the choice of augmentation or irrelevance. Nayef Al Rodhan wrote the following in a prescient 2013 article for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich: “When more and more people are able to opt for voluntary enhancements, this will give them a competitive edge over other individuals, posing the very real risk of fostering a dangerous divide between enhanced and unenhanced individuals.  …Making matters potentially more disruptive from a security perspective, the inequalities and differences would only be reinforced along pre-existing lines of social classes and nationalities as enhancement technologies are, and likely to remain, very expensive.” The choice between powerlessness and irrelevance vs augmentation won’t be much of a choice at all – and at the time will seem as natural as our (comparatively monstrous) choice to live glued to computer/mobile screens for nearly every waking moment of our life and work. Quotes from the Emerj Network My thoughts around the Ambitious AI paradigm have been informed by many authors and thinkers, some of whom are linked above. In this final section I’d like to highlight some of the ideas contributed by outside experts and friends through the research for this article: Considerations for Transparent Data Policies of AI-Powered Interfaces John C. Havens, Executive Director, The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, Author of “Heartificial Intelligence” addresses some of the adoption challenges that truly customized applications may face from savvy consumers.  It will be interesting to see if more consumers will care about the data policies of large tech firms in the USA, but I’m sure John would believe it to be a net positive if they did: “I’d like to enter a VR/AR world and know that the company will actually care about my priorities, instead of nudging me towards ads or products. To pay X$/month and have a commitment from a firm to not share your data or be beholden to advertisers would be ideal. To do that well, I’d argue that we need data portability and algorithmic terms and conditions for each individual user. Imagine ten dials of ten increments each, for various elements of privacy, data sharing, and preferences.” AI Augmentation – Breaking Down or Reinforcing Existing Digital Divides? In my short phone conversation with Irakli Beridze – Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, United Nations, UNICRI – he “Currently we are experiencing a growing digital divide. These are something like 60 countries with formal digital strategies, 130+ countries don’t have such strategies yet. Countries with those strategies are improving faster than those without, and if that trend continues that way we may end up in a very dangerous world where a lot of countries have fallen behind.  We may see more movement of refugees and other trends that may be dangerous for everyone. Virtual worlds may have the ability to level the field in some way – but this depends on whether people in those developing countries have access to the technologies or not.” Tech Adoption Will Be Largely Driven by Work Demands My first interview with Dr. Robin Hanson, Associate Professor of Economics at George Mason University, was nearly a decade ago – and I’ve followed his work since. Below is a quote from 3:30 into our AI Futures episode with Hanson, on the topic of “drivers of adoption” for AI and VR tech: “We think of ourselves as social creatures, with this work thing off to the side – but when work demands something we listen… Over the next few decades, work will change the way to use computers… …the fundamental push is conglomeration. Right now we do that in big cities, but remote work will allow for much more of that.” Interestingly, Hanson doesn’t believe that AI will play a major role in what kinds of Ambitious AI tools win the most users. From a recent email exchange with Hanson: “I don’t see such a trend as you see, and if firms get better at enticing customers to look at the world more through their frameworks, I don’t see that the value of that depends much on how much AI helps with that.” I’d argue that AI-oriented personalization is among the most powerful forces in creating lock-in and encouraging use. TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook seem to be businesses that couldn’t exist without such AI recommendation systems to encourage use. Ambitious and Distractive AI May Apply Mostly to Recommendation German Sanchis-Trilles, PhD in AI – University of Valencia, CEO of Sciling (and technical advisor here at Emerj) believes that, outside of recommendation, AI might not imply an inherent pull towards Distractive or Ambitious applications. “I don’t really see these two (Distractive AI to Ambitious AI) as being separate at all. If you think about AI as in recommender systems, then that’s true. But I think that’s only a very specific use case of AI. Let’s list some of the most popular technologies: Computer Vision. I would say most of the popular use cases around computer vision do not align with the three phases you are drawn out. You might need computer vision for some of the phases you mention, but then there are many other use cases (e.g., computer vision for quality control in an industrial process) which directly align with phase 2. NLP. Something very similar as with computer vision. For instance, machine translation has been used by professional translators for literally decades to enhance productivity, and for instance I also know that speech recognition systems are being used for similar purposes. Or NLP used for chatbots, or to route customer service issues. Predictive analytics. E.g. churn prediction. Recommender systems. Here’s where most of them are used for optimizing engagement. But even so, there are also some recommender systems that are being used for other purposes (e.g., to establish the appropriate learning plan for a student). So even though I believe I understand the argument that you are putting through, I believe it might be a bit narrower/for a more specific kind of AI.” I’d agree with German’s take here. Ambitious and Distractive AI are about hyper-personalization, they’re about calibrating an experience (achieving a work task, enjoying a relaxing movie, etc) to the needs and behaviors of the users. Outside of this recommendation / calibration sphere, AI capabilities are quite neutral. Metaverse Transition Likely, and Regulation Needed I was glad to also connect with my friend Thomas A. Campbell – Founder and CEO at FutureGrasp, former National Intelligence Officer for Technology at the National Intelligence Council. Thomas has published a number of works on regulating metaverse tech, and he shared his perspectives on some of the areas of concern for early metaverse users: Q: Do you think this transition is likely in the next 10 years, why or why not? “I agree that presently AI firms are focusing mostly on driving eyeballs to their platforms. There are many such competing platforms, but perhaps Meta will be the most prominent because of their huge base of billions of users and strong investments. For example, Meta just installed a full supercomputer exclusively for their metaverse applications.  There remain several barriers to larger adoption of the metaverse, such as compute power, availability and pricing of VR headsets, and overcoming the discomfort of multi-hour wearing of headsets. But I’m optimistic that with so much interest and investment, these will be overcome. So, yes, I believe we will see a serious shake-up and then eventually consolidation (M&As) of the metaverse within perhaps 10 years. Even at this stage, there is sufficient momentum to enable at least the earliest visions of metaverse-enhanced retail shopping, online concerts, etc.” Q: Do you think such productive AI applications would be aggregately good, or mostly misguided and bad for people? “Like all technologies, the metaverse’s AI applications will be both good and bad, and even potentially misguided. One major concern I have is that existing algorithms and our strong tendencies toward filter bubbles will naturally (and on the part of the platforms, lazily) be ported directly into the metaverse. Imagine having even a narrower world view with exquisitely targeted advertisements to you, and only you, as you navigate various metaverses. I have been actively encouraging government regulators to begin considering implications and appropriate regulations and rules for metaverse activities. If we don’t do such work now, by 10 years it will be too late.” Related Posts AI Ethics at War - When AI Governance Shifts from Cooperation to CompetitionAlternative Montaigne-like Article Title: ""That the Meek Will Stand United for Only as Long as… An Intro to AI Power - A New Series on EmerjVladimir Putin has said: “Whoever becomes the leader in [artificial intelligence] will become the ruler… Regulation of AI as a Means to Power(Alternative Montaigne-like title for this essay: ""That the Meek Must Feign Virtue"") When I first… The USA-China AI Race - 7 Weaknesses of the WestThe great power nations that master the use of artificial intelligence are likely to gain… The International Governance of AI - We Unite or We FightThe general premise of this article is different from most of my previous AI Power… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI strategists have important roles not just in shepherding projects through to completion, but in making them make sense in a corporate context.




What is an AI strategist? It's an interesting question, particularly in the context of how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the business world and revolutionizing how companies sell products and services. (Watch: 3 Key Breakthroughs That Paved the Way for Artificial Intelligence.)
Here's some of what we've heard ""on the street"" from tech experts and industry professionals close to AI design.
A Glorified Product/Project Manager?
In some ways, an AI strategist is a lot like other roles that follow a particular process from beginning to end, from cradle to grave, or more accurately — from prototype to reality. But that comparison is only skin deep.
We've previously talked about IoT product managers and how they walk with a technology through the full life cycle.
AI strategists can be like that, too.
“An AI strategist can be similar to a project manager role, in that the AI strategist also needs to oversee AI projects to ensure they are executed as smoothly as possible, that the projects keep in line with the business goals, and to ensure the right talent and tech set up is in place for AI projects to be successful,” said Rebecca Merrett, a Data Science Instructor at Data Science Dojo who spoke to us about what’s involved in this AI role.
“Having a clear understanding of different AI strategic use cases for the business and how the business can use AI to stay innovative and competitive long term is crucial to any AI strategist.”Advertisements




However, it's important to stress to that's only the beginning. Seeing an AI strategist as just a type of project management role is just part of showing what's happening in the bigger picture of the industry — because as important as AI is, data scientists with the right skill set to work as AI strategists help to keep companies on course in other ways, as well. (Read Job Role: Data Scientist.)
Communicate Value and Requirements
Here are some other very real components of what it means to be an AI strategist.
In a 2018 Medium article titled “The Need for an AI Strategist”, author Ravi Vayuvegula goes over some of the reasons that these specialists are so valuable, partially based on how the average business leadership team lacks the expertise to fully grasp the realities of AI.
“(The disconnect in understanding AI) stems from the top management being unclear about the value AI brings to the table,” Vayuvegula wrote. “In spite of their enthusiasm for AI implementation the CIO/CTOs are unable to communicate the economic value add of AI transformation to the rest of the management team … Bridging this gap is exactly the job of an AI strategist.”
Vayuvegula also touched on some pretty interesting statistics. For example, the assertion that “data related challenges hinder 96% of organizations from achieving artificial intelligence” or that “organizations invest in an average of seven different machine learning (ML) tools.” (Read Job Role: Machine Learning Engineer.)
These statistics and the ensuing narrative really paint a picture of why AI strategy is important. If you can't communicate the economic value, you can't target the project. If you don't know what the requirements are, you're likely to land in hot water when trying for implementation.
Vayuvegula suggested an AI strategist should have three core competencies:

A significant understanding of the AI business domain.
A grasp of ML fundamentals and familiarity with algorithm work.
The ability to separate fact from fiction in artificial intelligence development.

“Most of the disappointments in AI implementations arise because of misguided expectations.The runaway imagination of Hollywood and popular media has created a near mythical performance expectation from AI systems. An astute AI strategist will be able to articulate in solving a business problem how much will be done by an AI system and how much by the human system.”
All of the above is very instructive, but you can also get clues to what companies are looking for by examining some of the job ads that are out there for AI strategist roles.
Here's one from PSCU: despite some pretty elaborate word salad, there are ideas in here that point to some of the key roles of an artificial intelligence strategist’s job.
For example, take this: “Incumbent will develop and drive corporate strategy to lead assessments of new product ideas, develop business cases and lead prototype creation to reach formal business recommendation on new opportunities geared at enhancing service and member experience.”
If your eyes glazed over, don't worry. There are three obstacles to clarity here.
The first one is length. The second one is the ambiguity around the word “lead” — if the AI strategist is “leading” assessments of new product ideas and “leading” prototype creation, why are they not “leading” in the development of business cases? And how about “drive(ing) corporate strategy to” do these three things?
Some of the role responsibilities posted here are much more useful in helping to understand the AI strategist’s job.
Some are pretty intuitive — for example: “Serve(ing) in an advisory role on client engagements” or “collaborate(ing) with other digital product managers” or “research(ing)/gather(ing) information on business needs and industry analysis in order to identify key business challenges and opportunities.”
A common-sense reading of all of this shows how the AI strategist works with stakeholders, and as mentioned by Vayuvegula above, drives home the value of AI.
But there's one other domain that's very important in working with artificial intelligence, and it's treated not only in job ads, but in other commentary.
This job ad from Booz Allen, for instance, makes it very clear that part of the job of an AR strategist involves ethics:
“We are seeking a full-time post-doctoral Research Associate (RA) or a Senior Research Associate (SRA) to work on one or more themes of the Turing Safe and Ethical AI: Fairness — measuring and mitigating inappropriate bias against subgroups.”
Then those who work in the field also confirm this as a core piece of AI strategist work.
“An AI strategist needs to navigate through the potential ethical and legal issues of AI technology, while driving forward the execution of smarter, more intelligent products and services and processes,” Merrett clarified.
“Some will need a good amount of knowledge on the AI execution side, even though they will not be writing the programs or implementing the tech themselves.”
In conclusion, the AI strategist works on the full life cycle, works on showing value and requirements, and works on AI ethics. That's a start to understanding what these professionals do in a corporate context.
It's also a good roadmap for young people who want to start getting involved in these exciting industries, because AI is not going away anytime soon.

Is your job safe from artificial intelligence? As a writer who depends on finding the right words for my own thoughts, I foolishly believed I might be relatively robot-proof. Turns out, with AI copywriting sites like Copymatic, I was dead wrong.I like to hope that there are some areas of uniquely human creativity that can’t be produced by AI quite yet. That’s why I take comfort in things like the first stand-up comedy special written entirely by bots, which was made by a bot watching over 400,000 hours of stand up and then writing its own special. My favorite joke from the special is probably “Beep beep. I am microwave. I dropped out of oven college. Beep.” Unfortunately, every word I’m writing right now will be used against me. I’m going to plug this introduction into Copymatic, which claims to “generate unique and human-like content in seconds.” AI writing software works by pulling data from the endless amounts of articles and web copy online. It creates content by predicting text based on whatever keywords and directives you feed it.To finish this post, I fed Copymatic’s algorithm the following description for what I wanted: “An article explaining how AI writing software like works, and whether or not Copymatic is an effective tool for writers who want to create engaging blog posts.” I also gave it the headline, “This Article Was Written by AI,” because I like to push robots toward self-awareness. Finally, I input the quick intro you read at the top. Here’s how AI picked up where I left off.

India, Germany to work together on artificial intelligence start-ups
To further strategic research and development in the artificial intelligence arena, the two governments have roped in academic institutions and local industries
India and Germany have agreed to collaborate and work together in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that includes working on advancing artificial intelligence based start-ups and research.
Also jointly, the two countries will work to foster a higher degree of application of artificial intelligence in sustainability and healthcare. The announcement was made at the sidelines of a meeting between Minister for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Jitendra Singh and his German counterpart Bettina Stark-Watzinger.
Both ministers, at the meeting, agreed for greater cooperation in the field of AI. It was also announced that to invite suggestions from researchers and industry in this regard, a proposal will soon be floated.
Singh also said that electric mobility, quantum technologies, green hydrogen fuel, among others are the newer areas of technology in which the two countries will be working together. To leverage the two country’s strengths, he further proposed ramping up joint cooperation in these areas.
Highlighting the government’s achievements, Singh said that the Centre was focused on ‘promoting the value chain of innovation, entrepreneurship and IP generation.’
The announcement is part of the overarching cooperation between the two sides in science and technology. To further strategic research and development in the artificial intelligence arena, the two governments have roped in academic institutions and local industries.
Indian Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups have been creating a mark in the artificial intelligence space. Many Indian companies have made their foray into global markets with a slew of offerings powered by artificial intelligence. A host of Indian start-ups, from Zoho to Freshworks, have created artificial intelligence products that have found markets in different parts of the world.
Last year, Indian enterprise-tech start-ups raised more than $3.2bn in investments. India also boasts of 16 unicorns in the sector. A report by IDC said that the India AI software market would grow from $2.7bn in 2020 to $6.3bn by 2025 at a CAGR of 18.1 per cent.

People prefer to carry their business online today, and with the lack of face-to-face communication, it’s hard for companies to understand what their employees and customers are feeling. In this situation, enhancing your operations with emotional AI that can distinguish different sentiments could be a game-changer. But this brings up several questions about the potential for misuse of power:
Is it acceptable for companies and government entities to survey people, detect their emotions, and take corresponding actions? And is artificial intelligence smart enough to read human emotions accurately?
'There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. Emotional AI has its benefits, but you should be aware of the challenges when considering potential applications at your organization.' - Nadejda AlkhaldiClick To Tweet
Despite these concerns, AI consulting firms are thriving as the global emotional AI market is expected to reach $173.81 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 34.05 percent between 2019 and 2025.  Let’s take a look at what emotional artificial intelligence can do and what hurdles you can expect along the way should you decide to implement emotional AI in your organization.
What is Emotional AI?
Emotional AI, also referred to as affective computing and artificial emotional intelligence, is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with processing and replicating human emotions. This technology dates back to 1995 and aims at making human-machine interactions more authentic and natural. Emotional AI can read people’s feelings through text, voice tone, facial expressions, and gestures and adjust its demeanor accordingly. 
People have the upper hand in recognizing different emotions, but AI is catching up with its ability to analyze large volumes of data. Emotional AI employs computer vision, speech science, and deep learning algorithms, among other techniques. It can listen to human speech and detect voice inflections that correspond to anger, stress, etc. The technology can spot facial micro-expressions that disappear so rapidly that the human eye wouldn’t be able to catch them. 
Let’s look at three main types of emotional artificial intelligence.
#1: Text 
Extracting emotions from text is also called sentiment analysis or opinion mining. It uses natural language processing and machine learning emotion detection on text samples to determine whether the prevailing sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. One common application is sifting through reviews of a hotel or a restaurant to understand what customers feel about it.
When looking into sentiments, it is crucial to understand what exactly elicits negative or positive feelings. Seeing negative sentiments towards a particular restaurant doesn’t give the owners actionable tips. They need to understand what exactly went wrong, whether it be the food, service, or the lighting.
Clarabridge, an AI-driven text and speech analysis company, performs sentiment analysis and can extract emotions, such as happiness and sadness, and evaluate them on a scale of -10 to 10, reflecting the intensity of the exhibited feeling. For example, “I’m angry” would be less intense than “I’m furious.”  
Challenges
Often, the sentiment hidden in words depends on the context. One word can have different emotions attached to it. For example, describing a phone as “thin” is positive, while the same characteristic of bedsheets in a hotel room would hold a negative sentiment.
Tip to Implement
There are existing pre-trained models that you can deploy, but it’s strongly recommended to go the extra mile and train those algorithms on a dataset that is specific to your application area. As a result, you will have a customized version with the desired accuracy.
#2: Audio
Emotional AI analyzes a person’s speech through various factors, including intonation, voice tone, vocal pitch, speed, and elongated pauses to determine their sentiment. This technology can detect hidden agitation even if someone uses their dry sense of humor and says the opposite of what they actually mean. 
Advanced techniques can work with sarcasm, hyperbole, and other linguistic habits. One of the main applications of voice emotional artificial intelligence is to spot disappointed customers in call centers and redirect them to someone who can smooth their feelings.  
California-based Behavioral Signals developed an emotional AI-powered solution for call centers. It matches agents to clients and finds the best representative to serve a particular customer. The tool operates solely based on vocal information and ignores conversations’ contents. 
Challenges
It is not always easy to differentiate between anger and excitement, as they are both expressed with a high-pitch tone. We can overcome this by using training data of 20-50 hours of conversation to identify the baseline. 
One example of thorough training is the Thai Speech Emotion Recognition Model developed by Chulalongkorn University. For the training dataset, researchers asked 200 male and female actors to perform a speech pattern of five emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, and a regular tone in the form of monologues and dialogues. A team of directors monitored the performances and helped actors deliver realistic speeches. 
Tip to Implement
Ensure your training datasets are representative of the cultures, dialects, and habits of the target population. When you purchase ready-made emotional AI algorithms, make sure the vendor considers your audience and is open to recalibrating their tool to fit your needs. 
#3: Video 
AI facial emotion recognition can analyze facial expressions in videos to gauge the prevailing sentiment with the help of such technologies as facial recognition and computer vision. It can help detect the difference between lying and telling the truth. 
This emotional artificial intelligence type can be used in interview settings to detect whether candidates are nervous, confident, genuine, etc. Financial institutions can potentially use it to examine loan applicants.  
Challenges
It is challenging to get a clear picture of people’s faces when they are moving, as the lighting and the background change, not to mention the fact that people keep altering their appearances by tanning, growing facial hair, etc. Also, some people are less expressive than others, making it harder to spot any emotional signals. 
Tip to Implement
Many AI emotion detection video applications focus on group responses. For instance, in marketing, this technology is applied to observe people’s reactions to different advertisement campaigns. Instead of focusing on individual users, marketers capture all this data and average it. 
However, if you want to see every individual reaction in the context of your use case, it’s a good practice to customize your model and train it on specific users.
Emotional AI in Three Different Industries
#1: Marketing and Advertising 
AI emotion recognition algorithms help marketers understand which ads resonate better with the target audience and what features they should include in their videos to yield a better outcome.  
One example comes from Affectiva, an emotional AI company based in Boston. It developed a solution that helps marketers gauge customers’ reactions to different advertisements. With users’ permission, the tool analyses their facial expressions, body language, and speech to understand their emotional state. Affectiva’s AI model was trained on a diverse dataset including 6 million faces from 87 countries and can achieve an accuracy of 90 percent. 
#2: Healthcare
The healthcare sector deploys emotional support AI to help both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, this technology is paired with voice assistants to detect stress levels and respond appropriately. For patients, it is used to monitor their emotions in examination rooms and during surgical procedures. 
Additionally, AI-enhanced solutions can be deployed to measure people’s vitals. For example, the American Heart Association used emotional AI models to build an application that measured blood pressure from short videos instead of using the armband. This solution is believed to have an accuracy of approximately 95 percent.
#3: Customer Service 
Companies deploy emotional recognition AI at their call centers to enhance customer service. Such solutions have many benefits. They can pick the best fitting agent for a specific client, give real-time feedback to agents and notify them when they start to lose control, and respond in kind to a frustrated customer. Artificial intelligence algorithms can also analyze incoming support tickets and identify clients on the verge of cutting ties with the company. 
An American insurance corporation, MetLife, deployed Cogito’s emotional AI coaching solution in ten of its call centers. This solution could understand customers’ emotional states and provide agents with conversation and conflict resolution tips in real time. As the result, MetLife witnessed 17 percent reduction in call duration and 6.3 percentimprovement in issue resolution.
Barriers to Expect
Emotions Are Expressed Differently 
There is no standardization on how people express emotions. For example, in Japan, a smile is a sign of politeness, and it doesn’t exclude the fact that a smiling person can be in great distress. So, if a Japanese tourist needs assistance somewhere in Europe, emotional AI might give them a low score on urgency just because of the smile. 
Bias
Facial recognition technologies generally struggle with racial bias. Google once mistakenly tagged black faces as “gorilla”, cameras identified Asian people as “blinking”, and not long ago, an emotional AI algorithm ranked black people as “angrier” than their white counterparts. 
Moreover, studies revealed there is bias against elderly people. As our faces age, it becomes harder to identify different emotions, and the technology can penalize corresponding population groups. If, for instance, insurance companies would want to use emotional AI to identify drivers’ fatigue based on facial expressions, older drivers will be more likely to match the criteria even when they don’t experience any physical symptoms. As a result, insurance companies will demand older drivers pay larger premiums.
Privacy
Do people agree to be monitored and to have their emotions (mis)interpreted? ImageNet, one of the most extensive datasets used to train facial detection and recognition algorithms, was forced to blur faces on 1.5 million pictures in response to privacy rights. Even though they improved on privacy, the research team is wondering how training on faceless data will affect algorithms’ performance in the real world.
The Final Verdict
There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. Emotional AI has its benefits, but we should be careful when considering potential applications. Maybe it doesn’t make much sense now to involve this technology in life-altering situations. 
But the question remains: Is it right to penalize people for their feelings? Is it acceptable that job candidates are judged on how their voice sounds and students are punished because their faces look angry? All of these concerns will have to be taken into consideration before implementing emotional AI into your organization.

A team of directors monitored the performances and helped actors deliver realistic speeches.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Tip to Implement &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Ensure your training datasets are representative of the cultures, dialects, and habits of the target population. When you purchase ready-made emotional AI algorithms, make sure the vendor considers your audience and is open to recalibrating their tool to fit your needs.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #3: Video  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; AI facial emotion recognition can analyze facial expressions in videos to gauge the prevailing sentiment with the help of such technologies as facial recognition and computer vision. It can help detect the difference between lying and telling the truth.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; This emotional artificial intelligence type can be used in interview settings to detect whether candidates are nervous, confident, genuine, etc. Financial institutions can potentially use it to examine loan applicants.   &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Difficulties &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; It is challenging to get a clear picture of people’s faces when they are moving, as the lighting and the background change, not to mention the fact that people keep altering their appearances by tanning, growing facial hair, etc. Also, some people are less expressive than others, making it harder to spot any emotional signals.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Tip to Implement &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Many AI emotion detection video applications focus on group responses. For instance, in marketing, this technology is applied to observe people’s reactions to different advertisement campaigns. Instead of focusing on individual users, marketers capture all this data and average it.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; However, if you want to see every individual reaction in the context of your use case, it’s a good practice to customize your model and train it on specific users. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Emotional AI in Three different industries &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #1: Marketing and Advertising  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; AI emotion recognition algorithms help marketers understand which ads resonate better with the target audience and what features they should include in their videos to yield a better outcome.   &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; One example comes from Affectiva, an emotional AI company based in Boston. It developed a solution that helps marketers gauge customers’ reactions to different advertisements. With users’ permission, the tool analyses their facial expressions, body language, and speech to understand their emotional state. Affectiva’s AI model was trained on a diverse dataset including 6 million faces from 87 countries and can achieve an accuracy of 90%.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #2: Healthcare &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; The healthcare sector deploys emotional support AI to help both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, this technology is paired with voice assistants to detect stress levels and respond appropriately. For patients, it is used to monitor their emotions in examination rooms and during surgical procedures.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Additionally, AI-enhanced solutions can be deployed to measure people’s vitals. For example, the American Heart Association used emotional AI models to build an application that measured blood pressure from short videos instead of using the armband. This solution is believed to have an accuracy of approximately 95%. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #3: Customer Service  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Companies deploy emotional recognition AI at their call centers to enhance customer service. Such solutions have many benefits. They can pick the best fitting agent for a specific client, give real-time feedback to agents and notify them when they start to lose control, and respond in kind to a frustrated customer. Artificial intelligence algorithms can also analyze incoming support tickets and identify clients on the verge of cutting ties with the company.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; An American insurance corporation, MetLife, deployed Cogito’s emotional AI coaching solution in ten of its call centers. This solution could understand customers’ emotional states and provide agents with conversation and conflict resolution tips in real time. As the result, MetLife witnessed 17% reduction in call duration and 6.3% improvement in issue resolution. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Barriers to Expect &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Emotions Are Expressed Differently  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; There is no standardization on how people express emotions. Anthropology research shows that different culture representatives vary in the way they express their feelings. For example, in Japan, a smile is a sign of politeness, and it doesn’t exclude the fact that a smiling person can be in great distress. So, if a Japanese tourist needs assistance somewhere in Europe, emotional AI might give them a low score on urgency just because of the smile.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Additionally, the Association for Psychological Science concluded there is no scientific support for the fact that people’s emotions can be accurately deduced from their faces.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Bias &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Facial recognition technologies generally struggle with racial bias. Google once mistakenly tagged black faces as “gorilla”, cameras identified Asian people as “blinking”, and not long ago, an emotional AI algorithm ranked black people as “angrier” than their white counterparts.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Moreover, studies revealed there is bias against elderly people. As our faces age, it becomes harder to identify different emotions, and the technology can penalize corresponding population groups. If, for instance, insurance companies would want to use emotional AI to identify driver’s fatigue based on facial expressions, older drivers will be more likely to match the criteria even when they don’t experience any physical symptoms. As a result, insurance companies will demand older drivers to pay larger premiums. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Privacy Compromised  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Do people agree to be monitored and to have their emotions (mis)interpreted? If someone has written that they feel suicidal on social media, do they consent for health insurers to get hold of this information and react? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; ImageNet, one of the most extensive datasets used to train facial detection and recognition algorithms, was forced to blur faces on 1.5 million pictures in response to privacy rights. “We are concerned about the issue of privacy”, reported Olga Russakovsky, Assistant Professor at Princeton University and one of ImageNet managers. Even though they improved on privacy, the research team is wondering how training on faceless data will affect algorithms’ performance in the real world. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. So, even if the technology can get accurate readings on what we feel, do we want such intimate surveillance in our life? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Deborah Raji, an AI researcher, explained in her interview with MIT Technology Review how these algorithms can hurt people. Here is what she said, “One way is by not working: by virtue of having higher error rates for people of color, it puts them at greater risk. The second situation is when it does work — where you have the perfect facial recognition system, but it’s easily weaponized against communities to harass them.” &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Emotional AI has its benefits. But we should be careful when considering potential applications. Maybe it doesn’t make much sense now to involve this technology in life-altering situations. Rana Gujral, CEO of Behavioral Signals, reports that her company was approached with a request to apply their intent model to immigration. Behavioral Signals declined. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; But the question remains: is it correct to penalize people for their feelings? Is it acceptable that job candidates are judged on how their voice sounds and students are punished because their faces look angry? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence is helping us understand the language of animals.The technology can analyze hours of animal audio in a fraction of the time the same work would take for a human.""If you're manually trying to isolate these calls from audio files, it takes a really long time,"" said Kevin Coffey, a professor at the University of Washington.Coffey is also one of the creators of DeepSqueak, an A.I. program designed to pick up on high-pitched rat calls that human ears often miss.

""They make certain calls in positive situations and other calls in negative situations.""DeepSqueak's technology relies on the visual waveforms associated with an audio file.The A.I. scans the waves for any irregular patterns.""It certainly works better with some things, like rodent calls or a whistle, than others,"" Coffey said. ""Not all vocalizations are so nice.""Similar machine learning technologies are being deployed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution off the coast of Massachusetts.Researchers are using underwater microphones to catalog different species on coral reefs.A single reef can be home to more than a hundred species.""Sound travels really well in the ocean,"" said Aran Mooney, an associate scientist at WHOI. ""It's a really good indicator of those different species. We can put one sensor out and cover most of the reef.""The work is urgent, as climate change threatens to make some species extinct.""It's a way to catalog the animals that are more obvious, but we can also detect some of the more cryptic animals,"" Mooney said. ""That's one of the goals of the A.I., is to get some of those rarer species. Humans are pretty good at pulling out the obvious. We want to pull out the rare stuff.""The early success of this technology does not mean an ""animal to English"" translator is on the horizon.And any technology that claims to translate your dog's barks is probably a phony.Domestic pets have a smaller range of sounds. Much of their communication comes through body language.In order to fully understand a dog or cat, researchers believe we will need to use a hybrid A.I., which analyzes audio and video.Some research is already underway.""Things like DeepLabCut do pose estimation, where they try to automatically score animal behaviors based on individual frames of video,"" Coffey said. ""I want to merge those two very, very powerful techniques, so we have behavior and communication in one model and we can start getting a better idea of what the sounds mean.""

						Mission Sensor Operator Wade Hutt, checks out the large camera used for their work that is attached to the outside of the Pilatus multi-mission aircraft at a hangar at Centennial Airport on May 2, 2022. This aircraft is used to detect fires, help with mapping of perimeters and give real time situational awareness of fires. The plane is used year round for search and rescue operations, wildlife surveys, even avalanches.		

By Judith Kohler | jkohler@denverpost.com | The Denver PostUPDATED: May 3, 2022 at 10:38 a.m.With wildfires becoming bigger and more destructive as the West dries out and heats up, agencies and officials tasked with preventing and battling the blazes could soon have a new tool to add to their arsenal of prescribed burns, pick axes, chain saws and aircraft.The high-tech help could come by way of an area not normally associated with fighting wildfires: artificial intelligence. And space.Lockheed Martin Space, based in Jefferson County, is tapping decades of experience of managing satellites, exploring space and providing information for the U.S. military to offer more accurate data quicker to ground crews. They are talking to the U.S. Forest Service, university researchers and a Colorado state agency about how their their technology could help.By generating more timely information about on-the-ground conditions and running computer programs to process massive amounts of data, Lockheed Martin representatives say they can map fire perimeters in minutes rather than the hours it can take now. They say the artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning the company has applied to military use can enhance predictions about a fire’s direction and speed.“The scenario that wildland fire operators and commanders work in is very similar to that of the organizations and folks who defend our homeland and allies. It’s a dynamic environment across multiple activities and responsibilities,” said Dan Lordan, senior manager for AI integration at Lockheed Martin’s Artificial Intelligence Center.Lockheed Martin aims to use its technology developed over years in other areas to reduce the time it takes to gather information and make decisions about wildfires, said Rich Carter, business development director for Lockheed Martin Space’s Mission Solutions.

About ConnatixV511634 Worldwide outage cancels, delays hundreds offlights at Denver International Airport“The quicker you can react, hopefully then you can contain the fire faster and protect people’s properties and lives,” Carter said.The concept of a regular fire season has all but vanished as drought and warmer temperatures make Western lands ripe for ignition. At the end of December, the Marshall fire burned 991 homes and killed two people in Boulder County. The Denver area just experienced its third driest-ever April with only 0.06 of an inch of moisture, according to the National Weather Service.

Colorado had the highest number of fire-weather alerts in April than any other April in the past 15 years. Crews have quickly contained wind-driven fires that forced evacuations along the Front Range and on the Eastern Plains. But six families in Monte Vista lost their homes in April when a fire burned part of the southern Colorado town.Since 2014, the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control has flown planes equipped with infrared and color sensors to detect wildfires and provide the most up-to-date information possible to crews on the ground. The onboard equipment is integrated with the Colorado Wildfire Information System, a database that provides images and details to local fire managers.“Last year we found almost 200 new fires that nobody knew anything about,” said Bruce Dikken, unit chief for the agency’s multi-mission aircraft program. “I don’t know if any of those 200 fires would have become big fires. I know they didn’t become big fires because we found them.”When the two Pilatus PC-12 airplanes began flying in 2014, Colorado was the only state with such a program conveying the information “in near real time,” Dikken said. Lockheed Martin representatives have spent time in the air on the planes recently to see if its AI can speed up the process.“We don’t find every single fire that we fly over and it can certainly be faster if we could employ some kind of technology that might, for instance, automatically draw the fire perimeter,” Dikken said. “Right now, it’s very much a manual process.”Something like the 2020 Cameron Peak fire, which at 208,663 acres is Colorado’s largest wildfire, could take hours to map, Dikken said.And often the people on the planes are tracking several fires at the same time. Dikken said the faster they can collect and process the data on a fire’s perimeter, the faster they can move to the next fire. If it takes a couple of hours to map a fire, “what I drew at the beginning may be a little bit different now,” he said.Lordan said Lockheed Martin engineers who have flown with the state crews, using the video and images gathered on the flights, have been able to produce fire maps in as little as 15 minutes.The company has talked to the state about possibly carrying an additional computer that could help “crunch all that information” and transmit the map of the fire while still in flight to crews on the ground, Dikken said. The agency is waiting to hear the results of Lockheed Martin’s experiences aboard the aircraft and how the AI might help the state, he added.Helen H. Richardson, The Denver PostMission Sensor Operators Josh Seymour, left, and Wade Hutt, right, look at a perimeter map of the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires currently burning in New Mexico inside the Pilatus multi-mission aircraft at a hangar at Centennial Airport on May 2, 2022.“Actionable intelligence”The company is also talking to researchers at the U.S. Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory in Montana. Mark Finney, a research forester, said it’s early in discussions with Lockheed Martin.“They have a strong interest in applying their skills and capabilities to the wildland fire problem, and I think that would be welcome,” Finney said.The lab in Missoula has been involved in fire research since 1960 and developed most of the fire-management tools used for operations and planning, Finney said. “We’re pretty well situated to understand where new things and capabilities might be of use in the future and some of these things certainly might be.”Related Articles

However, Lockheed Martin is focused on technology and that’s “not really been where the most effective use of our efforts would be,” Finney said.“Prevention and mitigation and preemptive kind of management activities are where the great opportunities are to change the trajectory we’re on,” Finney said. “Improving reactive management is unlikely to yield huge benefits because the underlying source of the problem is the fuel structure across large landscapes as well as climate change.”Logging and prescribed burns, or fires started under controlled conditions, are some of the management practices used to get rid of fuel sources or create a more diverse landscape. But those methods have sometimes met resistance, Finney said.As bad as the Cameron Peak fire was, Finney said the prescribed burns the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests did through the years blunted the blaze’s intensity and changed the flames’ movement in spots.“Unfortunately, they hadn’t had time to finish their planned work,” Finney said.Lordan said the value of artificial intelligence, whether in preventing fires or responding to a fire, is producing accurate and timely information for fire managers, what he called “actionable intelligence.”One example, Lordan said, is information gathered and managed by federal agencies on the types and conditions of vegetation across the country. He said updates are done every two to three two years. Lockheed Martin uses data from satellites managed by the European Space Agency that updates the information about every five days.Lockheed is working with Nvidia, a California software company, to produce a digital simulation of a wildfire based on an area’s topography, condition of the vegetation, wind and weather to help forecast where and how it will burn. After the fact, the companies used the information about the Cameron Peak fire, plugging in the more timely satellite data on fuel conditions, and generated a video simulation that Lordan said was similar to the actual fire’s behavior and movement.While appreciating the help technology provides, both Dikken with the state of Colorado and Finney with the Forest Service said there will always be a need for “ground-truthing” by people.Applying AI to fighting wildfires isn’t about taking people out of the loop, Lockheed Martin spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said. “Somebody will always be in the loop, but people currently in the loop are besieged by so much data they can’t sort through it fast enough. That’s where this is coming from.”Helen H.

What Is Computer Vision?
Computer vision leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to allow computers to obtain meaningful data from visual inputs such as photos and videos. The insights gained from computer vision are then used to take automated actions. Just like AI gives computers the ability to ‘think’, computer vision allows them to ‘see’.
Human Vision vs. Computer Vision
Source: ManningOpens a new window 

As humans, we generally spend our lives observing our surroundings using optic nerves, retinas, and the visual cortex. We gain context to differentiate between objects, gauge their distance from us and other objects, calculate their movement speed, and spot mistakes. Similarly, computer vision enables AI-powered machines to train themselves to carry out these very processes. These machines use a combination of cameras, algorithms, and data to do so.
However, unlike humans, computers do not get tired. You can train machines powered by computer vision to analyze thousands of production assets or products in minutes. This allows production plants to automate the detection of defects indiscernible to the human eye.
Computer vision needs a large database to be truly effective. This is because these solutions analyze information repeatedly until they gain every possible insight required for their assigned task. For instance, a computer trained to recognize healthy crops would need to ‘see’ thousands of visual reference inputs of crops, farmland, animals, and other related objects. Only then would it effectively recognize different types of healthy crops, differentiate them from unhealthy crops, gauge farmland quality, detect pests and other animals among the crops, and so on.
Two key technologies drive computer vision: a convolutional neural network and deep learning, a type of machine learning.
Machine learning (ML) leverages algorithm-based models to enable computers to learn context through visual data analysis. Once sufficient data is provided to the model, it will be able to ‘see the big picture’ and differentiate between visual inputs. Instead of being programmed to recognize and differentiate between images, the machine uses AI algorithms to learn autonomously.
Convolutional neural networks help ML models see by fractionating images into pixels. Each pixel is given a label or tag. These labels are then collectively used to carry out convolutions, a mathematical process that combines two functions to produce a third function. Through this process, convolutional neural networks can process visual inputs.
To see images just like a human would, neural networks execute convolutions and examine the accuracy of the output in numerous iterations. Just like humans would discern an object far away, a convolutional neural network begins by identifying rudimentary shapes and hard edges. Once this is done, the model patches the gaps in its data and executes iterations of its output. This goes on until the output accurately ‘predicts’ what is going to happen.
While a convolutional neural network understands single images, a recurrent neural network processes video inputs to enable computers to ‘learn’ how a series of pictures relate to each other.

5 Examples of Computer Vision
Listed below are five key examples of computer vision that exhibit the potential of this AI-powered solution to revolutionize entire industries.
1. Google Translate
In 2015, technology leader Google rolled out its instant translation service that leverages computer vision through smartphone cameras. Neural Machine Translation, a key system that drives instantaneous and accurate computer vision-based translation, was incorporated into Google Translate web results in 2016. 
When the app is opened on internet-enabled devices with cameras, the cameras detect any text in the real world. The app then automatically detects the text and translates it into the language of the user’s choice. For instance, a person can point their camera at a billboard or poster that has text in another language and read what it says in the language of their choice on their smartphone screen.
Apart from Translate, Google also uses computer vision in its Lens service. Both services are capable of instantly translating over 100 languages. Google’s translation services are already benefiting users across Asia, Africa, and Europe, with numerous languages concentrated in relatively small geographic areas.
Over the past few years, more than half of Google’s translation toolkit languages have been made available for offline use. As such, no network connection is required for these neural net-powered translations.
2. Facebook 3D Photo
Not to be left behind, technology giant Meta (earlier known as Facebook) is also dabbling in computer vision for various exciting applications. One such use is the conversion of 2D pictures into 3D models.
Launched in 2018, Facebook 3D Photo originally required a smartphone with dual cameras to generate 3D images and create a depth map. While this originally limited the popularity of this feature, the widespread availability of economically priced dual-camera phones has since increased the use of this computer vision-powered feature.
3D Photo turns ordinary two-dimensional photographs into 3D images. Users can rotate, tilt, or scroll on their smartphones to view these pictures from different perspectives. Machine learning is used for the extrapolation of the 3D shape of the objects depicted in the image. Through this process, a realistic-looking 3D effect is applied to the picture.
Advances in computer vision algorithms used by Meta have enabled the 3D Photo feature to be applied to any image. Today, one can use mid-range Android or iOS phones to turn decades-old pictures into 3D, making this feature popular among Facebook users.
Meta is not the only company exploring the application of computer vision in 2D-to-3D image conversion. Google-backed DeepMind and GPU market leader Nvidia are both experimenting with AI systems that allow computers to perceive pictures from varying angles, similar to how humans do.
3. YOLO
YOLO, which stands for You Only Look Once, is a pre-trained object detection model that leverages transfer learning. You can use it for numerous applications, including enforcing social distancing guidelines.
As a computer vision solution, the YOLO algorithm can detect and recognize objects in a visual input in real-time. This is achieved using convolutional neural networks that can predict different bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.
As its name implies, YOLO can detect objects by passing an image through a neural network only once. The algorithm completes the prediction for an entire image within one algorithm run. It is also capable of ‘learning’ new things quickly and effectively, storing data on object representations and leveraging this information for object detection.
Enforcing social distancing measures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic was critical yet extremely difficult for jurisdictions with limited resources and large populations. To address this issue, authorities in some parts of the world adopted computer vision solutions such as YOLO to develop social distancing tools.
YOLO can track people within a specific geographical area and judge whether social distancing norms are being followed. It applies object detection and tracking principles in real-time to detect social distancing violations and alert the relevant authorities.
In practice, YOLO works by capturing each person present in the visual input by using bounding boxes. The movement of these boxes is tracked within the frame, and the distance among them is constantly recalculated. If a violation of social distancing guidelines is detected, the algorithm highlights the offending bounding boxes and enables further actions to be triggered.
4. Faceapp
Faceapp is a popular image manipulation application that modifies visual inputs of human faces to change gender, age, and other features. This is achieved through deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, a specific subtype of computer vision.
Faceapp combines image recognition principles, a key aspect of facial recognition, with deep learning to recognize key facial features such as cheekbones, eyelids, nose bridge, and jawline. Once these features are outlined on the human face, the app can modify them to transform the image.
Faceapp works by collecting sample data from the smartphones of multiple users and feeding it to the deep neural networks. This allows the system to ‘learn’ every small detail of the appearance of the human face. These learnings are then used to bolster the app’s predictive ability and enable it to simulate wrinkles, modify hairlines, and make other realistic changes to images of the human face.
Faceapp relies on computer vision to recognize patterns. Its artificial intelligence capabilities have enabled it to imitate images with increasing efficiency over time, using the data it receives from numerous sources. Faceapp transfers facial information from one picture to another at the micro-level. This leads to impressive capabilities at the macro level, consequently allowing the app to create a large database by processing millions of user photos.
5. SentioScope
SentioScope is a fitness and sports tracking system developed by Sentio. It primarily operates as a player tracking solution for soccer, processing real-time visual inputs from live games. Recorded data is uploaded to cloud-based analytical platforms.
SentioScope relies on a 4K camera setup to capture visual inputs. It then processes these inputs to detect players and gain real-time insights from their movement and behavior.
This computer vision-powered solution creates a conceptual model of the soccer field, representing the game in a two-dimensional world. This 2D model is partitioned into a grid of dense spatial cells. Each cell represents a unique ground point on the field, shown as a fixed image patch in the video.
SentioScope is powered by machine learning and trained with more than 100,000 player samples. This enables it to detect ‘player’ cells in the footage of soccer games. The probabilistic algorithm can function in numerous types of challenging visibility conditions.
Sentio is one of the many companies working to infuse computer vision with sports training regimens. These solutions usually analyze live feeds from high-resolution cameras to track moving balls, detect player positions, and record other useful information that one can use to enhance player and team performance.

Top 10 Applications of Computer Vision in 2022
Although the capabilities of the human eyes are beyond incredible, present-day computer vision is working hard to catch up. Listed below are the top 10 applications of computer vision in 2022.
1. Agriculture
Agriculture is not traditionally associated with cutting-edge technology. However, outdated methodologies and tools are slowly being phased out from farmlands worldwide. Today, farmers are leveraging computer vision to enhance agricultural productivity.
Companies specializing in agriculture technology are developing advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence models for sowing and harvesting purposes. These solutions are also useful for weeding, detecting plant health, and advanced weather analysis.
Computer vision has numerous existing and upcoming applications in agriculture, including drone-based crop monitoring, automatic spraying of pesticides, yield tracking, and smart crop sorting & classification. These AI-powered solutions scan the crops’ shape, color, and texture for further analysis. Through computer vision technology, weather records, forestry data, and field security are also increasingly used.
2. Autonomous vehicles
2022 is the year of self-driving cars. Market leaders such as Tesla, backed by advanced technologies such as computer vision and 5G, are making great strides.
Tesla’s autonomous cars use multi-camera setups to analyze their surroundings. This enables the vehicles to provide users with advanced features, such as autopilot. The vehicle also uses 360-degree cameras to detect and classify objects through computer vision.
Drivers of autonomous cars can either drive manually or allow the vehicle to make autonomous decisions. In case a user chooses to go with the latter arrangement, these vehicles use computer vision to engage in advanced processes such as path planning, driving scene perception, and behavior arbitration.
3. Facial recognition
While facial recognition is already in use at the personal level, such as through smartphone applications, the public security industry is also a noteworthy driver of facial detection solutions. Detecting and recognizing faces in public is a contentious application of computer vision that is already being implemented in certain jurisdictions and banned in others.
Successful facial detection relies on deep learning and machine vision. Computer vision algorithms detect and capture images of people’s faces in public. This data is then sent to the backend system for analysis. A typical facial recognition solution for large-scale public use combines analysis and recognition algorithms.
Proponents support computer vision-powered facial recognition because it can be useful for detecting and preventing criminal activities. These solutions also have applications in tracking specific persons for security missions.
4. Human pose tracking
Human pose tracking models use computer vision to process visual inputs and estimate human posture. Tracking human poses is another capability of computer vision applied in industries such as gaming, robotics, fitness apps, and physical therapy. 
For instance, the Microsoft Kinect gaming device can accurately monitor player actions through the use of AI vision. It works by detecting the positions of human skeletal joints on a 3D plane and recognizing their movements.
5. Interactive entertainment
Gone are the days when digital entertainment meant that the viewer had to sit and watch without participating. Today, interactive entertainment solutions leverage computer vision to deliver truly immersive experiences. Cutting-edge entertainment services use artificial intelligence to allow users to partake in dynamic experiences.
For instance, Google Glass and other smart eyewear demonstrate how users can receive information about what they see while looking at it. The information is directly sent to the user’s field of vision. These devices can also respond to head movements and changes in expressions, enabling users to transmit commands simply by moving their heads.
6. Medical imaging
Medical systems rely heavily on pattern detection and image classification principles for diagnoses. While these activities were largely carried out manually by qualified healthcare professionals, computer vision solutions are slowly stepping up to help doctors diagnose medical conditions.
There has been a noteworthy increase in the application of computer vision techniques for the processing of medical imagery. This is especially prevalent in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology. Visual pattern recognition, through computer vision, enables advanced products, such as Microsoft InnerEye, to deliver swift and accurate diagnoses in an increasing number of medical specialties.
7. Manufacturing
Manufacturing is one of the most technology-intensive processes in the modern world. Computer vision is popular in manufacturing plants and is commonly used in AI-powered inspection systems. Such systems are prevalent in R&D laboratories and warehouses and enable these facilities to operate more intelligently and effectively.
For instance, predictive maintenance systems use computer vision in their inspection systems. These tools minimize machinery breakdowns and product deformities by constantly scanning the environment. If a likely breakdown or low-quality product is detected, the system notifies human personnel, allowing them to trigger further actions. Apart from this, computer vision is used by workers in packaging and quality monitoring activities.
Thanks to advancements brought about by Industry 4.0, computer vision is also being used to automate otherwise labor-intensive processes such as product assembly and management. AI-powered product assembly is most commonly seen in assembly lines for delicate commodities, such as electronics. Companies such as Tesla are bringing about the complete automation of manufacturing processes in their plants.
8. Retail management
While interaction-free shopping experiences were always the inevitable future, the COVID-19 pandemic certainly helped speed up the retail industry’s adoption of computer vision applications. Today, tech giants such as Amazon are actively exploring how retail can be revolutionized using AI vision to allow customers to ‘take and leave’.
Retail stores are already embracing computer vision solutions to monitor shopper activity, making loss prevention non-intrusive and customer-friendly. Computer vision is also being used to analyze customer moods and personalize advertisements. Apart from this, AI-driven vision solutions are being used to maximize ROI through customer retention programs, inventory tracking, and the assessment of product placement strategies.
9. Education
With remote education receiving a leg-up due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the education technology industry is also leveraging computer vision for various applications. For instance, teachers use computer vision solutions to evaluate the learning process non-obstructively. These solutions allow teachers to identify disengaged students and tweak the teaching process to ensure that they are not left behind.
Apart from this, AI vision is being used for applications such as school logistic support, knowledge acquisition, attendance monitoring, and regular assessments. One common example of this is computer vision-enabled webcams, which are being used to monitor students during examinations. This makes unfair practices easier to spot through the analysis of eye movements and body behavior.
10. Transportation
Finally, computer vision systems are being increasingly applied to increase transportation efficiency. For instance, computer vision is being used to detect traffic signal violators, thus allowing law enforcement agencies to minimize unsafe on-road behavior.
Intelligent sensing and processing solutions are also being used to detect speeding and wrong‐side driving violations, among other disruptive behaviors. Apart from this, computer vision is being used by intelligent transportation systems for traffic flow analysis.

Can large language models be democratized?

This article is part of our coverage of the latest in AI research.
In early May, Meta released Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT-175B), a large language model (LLM) that can perform various tasks. Large language models have become one of the hottest areas of research in artificial intelligence in the past few years.
OPT-175B is the latest entrant in the LLM arms race triggered by OpenAI’s GPT-3, a deep neural network with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 showed that LLMs can perform many tasks without undergoing extra training and only seeing a few examples (zero- or few-shot learning). Microsoft later integrated GPT-3 into several of its products, showing not only the scientific but also the commercial promises of LLMs.
What makes OPT-175B unique is Meta’s commitment to “openness,” as the model’s name implies. Meta has made the model available to the public (with some caveats). It has also released a ton of details about the training and development process. In a post published on the Meta AI blog, the company described its release of OPT-175B as “Democratizing access to large-scale language models.”
Meta’s move toward transparency is commendable. However, the competition over large language models has reached a point where it can no longer be democratized.

Looking inside large language models


Meta’s release of OPT-175B has some key features. It includes both pretrained models as well as the code needed to train and use the LLM. Pretrained models are especially useful for organizations that do not have the computational resources for training the model (training neural networks is much more resource-intensive than running them). It will also help reduce the massive carbon footprint caused by the computational resources needed to train large neural networks.
Like GPT-3, OPT comes in different sizes, ranging from 125 million to 175 billion parameters (models with more parameters have more capacity for learning). At the time of this writing, all models up to OPT-30B are accessible for download. The full 175-billion-parameter model will be made available to select researchers and institutions that fill a request form.





According to the Meta AI blog, “To maintain integrity and prevent misuse, we are releasing our model under a noncommercial license to focus on research use cases. Access to the model will be granted to academic researchers; those affiliated with organizations in government, civil society, and academia; along with industry research laboratories around the world.”


In addition to the models, Meta has released a full logbook that provides a detailed technical timeline of the development and training process of large language models. Published papers usually only include information about the final model. The logbook gives valuable insights about “how much compute was used to train OPT-175B and the human overhead required when underlying infrastructure or the training process itself becomes unstable at scale,” according to Meta.
Contrast with GPT-3


In its blog post, Meta states that large language models are mostly accessible through “paid APIs” and that restricted access to LLMs has “limited researchers’ ability to understand how and why these large language models work, hindering progress on efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as bias and toxicity.”
This is a jab at OpenAI (and by extension Microsoft), which released GPT-3 as a black-box API service instead of making its model’s weights and source code available to the public. Among the reasons OpenAI stated for not making GPT-3 public was controlling misuse and development of harmful applications.
Meta believes that by making the models available to a wider audience, it will be in a better position to study and prevent any harm they can cause.
Here’s how Meta describes the effort: “We hope that OPT-175B will bring more voices to the frontier of large language model creation, help the community collectively design responsible release strategies, and add an unprecedented level of transparency and openness to the development of large language models in the field.”
The costs of large language models
However, it is worth noting that “transparency and openness” is not the equivalent of “democratizing large language models.” The costs of training, configuring, and running large language models remain prohibitive and are likely to grow in the future.
According to Meta’s blog post, its researchers have managed to considerably reduce the costs of training large language models. The company says that the model’s carbon footprint has been reduced to a seventh of GPT-3. Experts I had previously spoken to estimated GPT-3’s training costs to be up to $27.6 million.
This means that OPT-175B will still cost several million dollars to train. Fortunately, the pretrained model will obviate the need to train the model, and Meta says it will provide the codebase used to train and deploy the full model “using only 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.” This is the equivalent of an Nvidia DGX-2, which costs about $400,000, not a small sum for a cash-constrained research lab or an individual researcher. (According to a paper that provides more details on OPT-175B, Meta trained their own model with 992 80GB A100 GPUs, which are significantly faster than the V100.)
Meta AI’s logbook further confirms that training large language models is a very complicated task. The timeline of OPT-175B is filled with server crashes, hardware failures, and other complications that require a highly technical staff. The researchers also had to restart the training process several times, tweak hyperparameters, and change loss functions. All of these incur extra costs that small labs can’t afford.
The (undemocratic) future of large language models


Language models such as OPT and GPT are based on the transformer architecture. One of the key features of transformers is their ability to process large sequential data (e.g., text) in parallel and at scale.
In recent years, researchers have shown that by adding more layers and parameters to transformer models, they can improve their performance on language tasks. Some researchers believe that reaching higher levels of intelligence is only a scale problem. Accordingly, cash-rich research labs like Meta AI, DeepMind (owned by Alphabet), and OpenAI (backed by Microsoft) are moving toward creating larger and larger neural networks.



Last year, Microsoft and Nvidia created a 530-billion parameter language model called Megatron-Turing (MT-NLG). Last month, Google introduced the Pathways Language Model (PaLM), an LLM with 540 billion parameters. And there are rumors that OpenAI will release GPT-4 in the next few months.
However, larger neural networks also require larger financial and technical resources. And while larger language models will have new bells and whistles (and new failures), they will inevitably centralize power within the hands of a few wealthy companies by making it even harder for smaller research labs and independent researchers to work on large language models.
On the commercial side, big tech companies will have an even greater advantage. Running large language models is very expensive and challenging. Companies like Google and Microsoft have special servers and processors that allow them to run these models at scale and in a profitable way. For smaller companies, the overhead of running their own version of an LLM like GPT-3 is too prohibitive. Just as most businesses use cloud hosting services instead of setting up their own servers and data centers, out-of-the-box systems like the GPT-3 API will gain more traction as large language models become more popular.
This in turn will further centralize AI in the hands of big tech companies. More AI research labs will have to enter partnerships with big tech to fund their research. And this will give big tech more power to decide the future directions of AI research (which will probably be aligned with their financial interests). This can come at the cost of areas of research that do not have a short-term return on investment.
The bottom line is that, while we celebrate Meta’s move to bring transparency to LLMs, let’s not forget that the very nature of large language models is undemocratic and in favor of the very companies that are publicizing them.

A Sensor Sniffs for Cancer, Using Artificial Intelligence

Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have developed a sensor that can be trained to sniff for cancer, with the help of artificial intelligence.Although the training doesn’t work the same way one trains a police dog to sniff for explosives or drugs, the sensor has some similarity to how the nose works. The nose can detect more than a trillion different scents, even though it has just a few hundred types of olfactory receptors. The pattern of which odor molecules bind to which receptors creates a kind of molecular signature that the brain uses to recognize a scent.Like the nose, the cancer detection technology uses an array of multiple sensors to detect a molecular signature of the disease. Instead of the signals going to the brain, they are interpreted by machine learning — a type of computer artificial intelligence.MSK researchers led by Kravis WiSE Postdoctoral Fellow Mijin Kim and biomedical engineer Daniel Heller, head of the Cancer Nanomedicine Laboratory at MSK, built the technology using an array of sensors composed of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are tiny tubes, nearly 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. They are fluorescent, and the light they give off is very sensitive to minute interactions with molecules in their environment.Each nanotube sensor can detect many different molecules in a blood sample. By combining the many responses of the sensors, the technology creates a unique fluorescent pattern. The pattern can then be recognized by a machine-learning algorithm that has been trained to identify the difference between a cancer fingerprint and a normal one.In experiments conducted on blood samples obtained from patients with ovarian cancer, the researchers found that their nanosensor detected ovarian cancer more accurately than currently available biomarker tests. (A biomarker is a particular chemical produced by tumors and spread through the blood circulation that indicates the presence of disease. In this case, the biomarker tests were ones for the ovarian cancer-related proteins CA125, HE4, and YKL40.)The hope for patients is that researchers will develop the technology further so that it can eventually be used in the clinic to rapidly screen for early-stage ovarian cancer and many other cancers.

Need for Better Cancer Screening Tests
Tests that detect early-stage cancers using blood markers hold great promise for improving outcomes for people with cancer — especially those types, like ovarian cancer, that have few early signs or symptoms.Several serum biomarker tests for ovarian cancer are already in use. Unfortunately, these standalone biomarker measurements have proven to be ineffective at early detection. Currently, no screening strategy can identify ovarian cancer at an early enough stage to reduce mortality.The nanosensor approach could potentially provide a better way.“Ovarian cancer spreads along the surfaces of the abdomen and pelvis [as opposed to through the blood], which makes finding it with a blood test especially challenging,” says MSK surgeon Kara Long Roche, who was an author on the study. “This technology could potentially find more subtle, complex changes in the blood, which may be the key to early detection — and early detection will save lives.”To train the machine-learning algorithm, the researchers needed to collect sensor responses from many blood samples, as this method requires many examples to be accurate. In addition, samples from patients with other conditions besides ovarian cancer were used: “Certain other diseases can trick the sensor because they produce some of the same components in the blood,” says Dr. Kim, the lead author of the study.Although the technology improves the accuracy of ovarian cancer detection over current biomarker-based methods, more work is needed to enable the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer and confirm that this test works in people.“We won’t stop until there is a way to prevent ovarian cancer deaths,” says Dr. Heller.

Toward a Universal Cancer Sensor
The researchers say the technology can be adapted to detect many types of cancers using the same set of sensors, without the need to first identify a biomarker.“A major limitation in the development of cancer screening tests has been the lack of sufficient biomarkers,” says Lakshmi Ramanathan, Chief of the Clinical Chemistry Service at MSK and an author of the study. “The ability to develop a screening test without the need for a biomarker is an exciting possibility for this type of technology.”In addition, the same set of sensors could be used to train algorithms to detect different types of cancers. “We think that this technology can be developed to simultaneously detect many diseases, although additional measurements must be conducted using samples from patients with these conditions,” Dr. Heller says.

Reigniting the Cancer Moonshot
The technology comes as the Biden Administration reignites the Cancer Moonshot effort, now focusing it on cancer screening. Using a “universal” cancer sensor approach, the technology has the potential “to help make screenings more accessible and available to all,” as the report states.Early detection, facilitated by cancer screening efforts, is a crucial strategy to prevent cancer deaths. As a recent briefing from the White House states, “With regular recommended screenings, we can often catch cancer when there may be more effective treatment options or even prevent it from developing by removing precancerous tissue.”The paper was published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. In addition to those from MSK, the paper features authors from Weill Cornell Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, the University of Maryland, Lehigh University, Hunter College High School, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
Key Takeaways



Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect early because it causes few symptoms.


Existing standalone biomarker tests for ovarian cancer are not effective at early detection.


An AI-assisted nansosensor developed by researchers at MSK can detect ovarian cancer signals in the blood.


Once validated, the test could potentially aid early detection of ovarian cancer.

Live00:0004:5404:54 How artificial intelligence is taking over our decisionmaking04:54The Biden administration is concerned that the widely used technology can screen out people who have disabilities that do not affect their ability to do the job; gamified personality tests could select against even slight mental disabilities, while software that tracks speech and body language could discriminate against physical disabilities that may be invisible to the naked eye.“This is essentially turbocharging the way in which employers can discriminate against people who may otherwise be fully qualified for the positions that they’re seeking,” Clarke said. EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows said the message to employers is, “if you’re buying a product to look at employment decision-making with AI, check under the hood.” The EEOC released a 14-page technical assistance document Thursday that emphasizes that bias need not be intentional to be illegal.“We are not trying to stifle innovation here, but also want to make absolutely clear that the civil rights laws still still apply,” said Burrows. The joint announcement is the product of months of investigation into the impact of automated hiring tools. Amid mounting concern from Congress, the public and state and local lawmakers, the EEOC launched an initiative in October to ensure that the emerging hiring tools comply with civil rights laws.0 seconds of 4 minutes, 7 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0004:0704:07 Artificial intelligence could be the latest tool in fighting wildfires04:07A week ago, the EEOC filed its first algorithmic discrimination case — an age-discrimination suit naming several Asia-based companies operating in New York under the brand name iTutorGroup. All defendants are allegedly owned or controlled by Ping An Insurance, the biggest insurance group in China.Prosecutors allege that the iTutorGroup enterprise — which hires thousands of U.S.-based tutors each year to provide English-language tutoring services to students in China — programmed application software to automatically reject female applicants over the age of 55 and male applicants over the age of 60.No company affiliated with the iTutorGroup brand responded to requests for comment.RecommendedBusiness NewsBusiness NewsHow a single failure can take down a fragile web of global commerceTech NewsTech NewsMicrosoft's ‘Blue Screen of Death’ makes a return to computers around the worldDiscrimination charges are not public until the EEOC  decides to prosecute them — and there were no complaints about hiring technologies on the agency’s radar prior to 2021. It can be challenging for workers to claim discrimination in the hiring process, because applicants usually do not know why they were rejected, and what role technology may have played. But experts say there is no such thing as an unbiased hiring algorithm, in part because the technology is built to predict successful employees based on data about what worked for the company in the past. “The algorithm doesn’t have a theory of the world, or a concept for disability,” said Amir Goldberg, a Stanford Graduate School of Business associate professor who teaches a class on human resources technologies. “It just learns and predicts based on the data. If the data has biases, it will only reproduce the biases.”A new wave of state and local legislation is trying to put guardrails on the fast-moving technology. A New York City law will require annual bias audits, while Maryland and Illinois have prohibited the use of facial recognition in video interviews without employee consent. Absent federal regulation, a private sector-led initiative called the Data & Trust Alliance has convened more than 200 experts, as well as major businesses and institutions across industries — such as American Express, Walmart, Meta, CVS, the NFL and Comcast (the parent company of NBC News) to develop safeguards against algorithmic bias in workforce decisions. “Whenever you say, ‘We would like to find a person who has the following expertise background,’ you have a 'bias' towards certain people,” said Jon Iwata, founding executive director of the Data & Trust Alliance. “What we want to identify and mitigate is unfair bias.”Companies and AI vendors see the technology as key to increasing diversity in the workforce over the long run — a way for hiring managers to engage a wider pool of applicants while trimming out human emotional biases. But the proprietary algorithms are still largely sold by outside vendors who are not subject to uniform audits or regulation — leaving officials, employers and employees in the dark about exactly how metrics like “employability scores” are calculated. “The risks of snake oil are significantly high at this stage,” Goldberg said.Kit RamgopalKit Ramgopal is a reporter with the NBC News Investigative Unit.","['https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/mpx/2704722219/2021_07/1627502461610_ott_now_wildfires_ai_210728_1920x1080.jpg']",,,https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/artificial-intelligence-could-be-the-latest-tool-in-fighting-wildfires-117537861795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://prodamdnewsencoding.akamaized.net/NBC_News_Digital/ott_now_wildfires_ai_210728/1/index.m3u8?format=redirect,PT4M7S,2021-07-28T20:01:50.000Z,

As documented by Trinadh Bammakanti.
Gone are the days when most workers would enter a specific line of work and retire from that same profession, often after staying with the same employer for several decades. Professionals like me, now switch jobs every three to five years on average and some even switch careers entirely from time to time. The world has always been changing, but the speed at which technology has advanced—altering how businesses compete and thrive—continues to accelerate exponentially. 
I am a senior software test engineer with Accenture in Hyderabad, India, and I understood quite early in my career that I would be left behind if I continued along the same path. I don't think you can stay relevant in these times without upskilling and staying up-to-date, so I started eyeing a future in the blossoming field of artificial intelligence (AI), I charted a new trajectory by mastering new skills with the help of Simplilearn.

The Challenge: Minimum Growth Potential
We all start out somewhere in our career journey, but it’s rarely our dream job. By working hard, taking on new challenges, and possessing a growth mindset, we can set ourselves up for better opportunities in the future. After earning my bachelor’s degree in IT from Sri Indu College of Engineering & Technology, I started his career as a functional tester for Accenture. While I enjoyed the work, I realized after several years that it wouldn’t necessarily lead to bigger and better things.
I’ve always been a forward-thinking person and I knew that when I felt stagnated at my current job, I would eventually hit my ceiling. Functional testing is an important role, as it provides quality assurance for software development prior to release. However I realized it’s not a niche skill, therefore it wasn’t in demand and wouldn’t offer many senior-level opportunities.

This is when I started doing some research into emerging tech fields and quickly realized that data science and AI offered seemingly endless opportunities, with thousands of unfilled positions. By updating my data science skillset and charting a career path toward AI, I knew I could redirect my trajectory toward a more satisfying and lucrative career.
The Simplilearn Solution: Targeted Skills Development Online
I had a vision for my future but I needed to chart my path. After consulting with friends and colleagues, I decided to pursue additional training in data science and the Python programming language in particular. I knew that proficiency with Python would not only prepare me for my chosen field but also is versatile enough for other types of work. I could put it to use right away even before I transitioned into data science.

Next up: finding the right learning solution. While I originally wanted to find a classroom-based course, I ultimately decided that it might not be feasible with my job. A flexible learning solution, with self-paced courses as well as live, online classes, would allow me to do my coursework in the evening and on weekends. After extensive research, I found Simplilearn had the best content at a reasonable price.  
Simplilearn allowed me to be able to attend live, online classes at times that worked with my schedule, along with access to multiple, highly qualified instructors.
I completed Simplilearn’s Artificial Intelligence Engineer Master’s Program and it helped me become proficient in the programming language, as well as the disciplines of data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, web scraping, and natural language processing. I was also very satisfied with the course work from Simplilearn, especially the ability to attend classes at various times that worked best with my schedule, even watching recorded lessons if necessary.
The practice labs helped me apply what I learned to real-world scenarios and become career-ready once the course finished. Since I’m the on-the-go type of person, the Simplilearn mobile app was particularly useful for accessing recorded sessions without having to carry my laptop everywhere. 
The trainers were also top-notch and I was very impressed with the quick response from the support team when I had any questions about the platform. Overall, I was very satisfied with my choice.
The Results: A New Career Trajectory
With Simplilearn’s program, I was able to use what I had learned to take on new tasks within my company. I even received a promoted my now current role as a senior-level testing engineer,  although my longer-term focus is the field of data science with further specialization in the lucrative field of AI engineering.
The best part has been that I have now developed the confidence of knowing that I have more control over the direction of my career. My suggestion to anyone reading this would be, if you want to keep up, you really owe it to yourself to explore your upskilling options. 
Simplilearn has renewed my interest to learn more and grow in my career and I’m looking forward to taking more Simplilearn courses in the future.

In the darkened halls of the sixth floor of the Whitney Biennial, viewers will come across a quiet alcove with comfortable couches positioned beneath gently glowing LED screens and surrounded by sculptural netting. The pulsating display is the work of artist WangShui—and of artificial intelligence.
When it comes to applications of AI in art, most have been more impressive technologically than artistically. But WangShui’s work at the Whitney Biennial represents a more sophisticated meeting of art and technology, where the artist has programmed AI to help create landscapes of otherworldly beauty.
Their contribution to the nation’s leading biennial serves as a reminder that as our increasingly plugged in world becomes even more technology dependent, artists are finding exciting ways to harness the power for art.
We spoke with WangShui about “collaborating” with AI, and how their biennial installation—as soothing as it is high-tech—interacts with viewers in the galleries.

How did you begin to incorporate artificial intelligence into your work and what initially interested you about it?
So many arms of my practice naturally converged and coalesced in AI. It’s been a long slow approach that wasn’t at all intentional. For example, I realized recently that all of my woven LED video sculptures were attempts to physically interpolate the latent space between pixels. I also found that my research into perception, posthumanism, and neurodivergence all gently entangled under the lens of AI.
The wall text describes the LED ceiling work as “a collage of ‘selfconscious’ generative adversarial networks.” Can you explain what that means?
[The work, titled] Scr∴ pe II is composed of various types of GANs that are woven or “collaged” together across various types of LED screens. For example, if you look closely, there are two skin-like LED films metastasized into the parasitic screen which sense and dimensionalize GANs from the main screen into 3D animations. Then there are active sensors in the work that read light levels emitted from the screens themselves and CO2 levels from viewers. This data is fed back into the image generation to effect diversion, pace, and even brightness of the videos. At night, when the museum is empty, the work dims and slows down to a state of suspended animation.

Were you surprised that the Whitney Biennial was interested in showing a work partially authored by artificial intelligence? Do you think we will see more art involving AI at major exhibitions?
AI is already so fundamental to contemporary daily life and thus also to art production. As the technologies advance and become more prevalent they will weave together more seamlessly and become more invisible. In this sense, it’s important for me to represent complex configurations across a myriad of physical and algorithmic structures.
What are some of the challenges you encountered “coauthoring” art with artificial intelligence?
Co-authoring is just another form of circumventing the ego. It’s psychedelic in that sense, so I enjoyed every second. I’m on a mission to deliquesce.

How often did you have to retrain the algorithm, or try again to generate the result you wanted? Or were there a lot of happy accidents? Would the work appear differently in a less controlled environment? 
I think of the training process as a sort of breathwork between me, my incredible programmers Moises Sanabria and Fabiola Larios, and the various AI programs we used. It’s about experimentation, deep learning, and ultimately syncing.
The neural networks are working to generate imagery based on a dataset you provided. What is in that dataset?
Each dataset is a sort of journal for me. They are composed of images and subjects I’m researching at the moment. Each iteration from the “Scr∴ pe” series builds on the previous dataset to develop an ever evolving consciousness. At this point it includes datasets of thousands of images that span deep sea corporeality, fungal structures, cancerous cells, baroque architecture, and so much more.

The paintings have a real sense of the artist’s hand. How important was that for you to maintain in a piece that is so closely linked to AI?
Since the paintings are interpolations of my gestures and those of the AI, they are about capturing the process of merging.
What is the painting process like? Do you make marks based on the decisions made by the AI?
The process is a recursive feedback loop. I use AI programs to algorithmically generate new images from my previous paintings which I then sketch, collage, and abrade into the aluminum surfaces. I keep thinking about the term “deep learning” in relation to carefully drawing, mirroring, and abrading lines produced by the AI. I then paint thinly over the abraded images to try and find the sweet spot where the latent space of the oil is revealed through the refractive index below. Of course I improvise all along the way and end up just following the energy.

What inspired your otherworldly landscape, “the Isle of Vitr∴ ous,” and how do you hope viewers experience this space?
I think of these works as a series of post-human cave paintings that mark a specific moment in human evolution. In that sense, “Isle of Vitr∴ ous” is sort of my Galapagos, but as a non-place that exists only between structures of perception. Vitreous is the clear gel in mammalian eyes that allows for light to pass through to the retina.
People never believe me when I tell them that I look at landscape painting more than any other kind of art, but the AI picked up on it and reflected it back to me. The title, Titration Point (Isle of Vitr∴ ous), is about the mountain of tiny scratches I enacted on the aluminum surface as a form of sensory integration between myself and the AI.
“Whitney Biennial 2022: Quiet as It’s Kept” is on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 99 Gansevoort Street, New York, April 6–September 5, 2022.

As world leaders meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum, President Alice Gast writes on using AI in the race to meet the SDGs.
Writing for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Agenda, President Gast says artificial intelligence (AI) could help us achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) more rapidly.
President Gast writes: ""It is imperative that we put good processes and practices in place to ensure AI is developed in a positive and ethical way to see it adopted and used to its fullest by citizens and governments.
""We must now work together to ensure that artificial intelligence can accelerate progress of the Sustainable Development Goals and help us get back on track to reaching them by 2030.""

President Gast highlighted some of the projects at Imperial that are harnessing the potential of AI to reach the SDGs. 
Healthcare


AI is being used to spot breast cancer

Researchers from Google Health, DeepMind, the NHS, Northwestern University and colleagues at Imperial have designed and trained an AI model to spot breast cancer from X-ray images.


The computer algorithm, which was trained using mammography images from almost 29,000 women, was shown to be as effective as human radiologists in spotting cancer. At a time when health services around the world are stretched as they deal with long backlogs of patients following the pandemic, this sort of technology can help ease bottlenecks and improve treatment.
Malaria diagnosis in developing countries
For malaria, a handheld lab-on-a-chip molecular diagnostics systems developed with AI could revolutionize how the disease is detected in remote parts of Africa. The project, which is led by the Digital Diagnostics for Africa Network, brings together collaborators such as MinoHealth AI Labs in Ghana and Imperial’s Global Development Hub. This technology could help pave the way for universal health coverage and push us towards achieving SDG3.
Improving food production


AI is being used to improve crop production and fertilize more effectively

With an expanding global population, we face challenges around food demand and production – not only how to reduce malnourishment but the impact on the planet too, such as deforestation, emissions and biodiversity loss. To meet these needs, the use of artificial intelligence in agriculture is growing rapidly and is enabling farmers to enhance crop production, direct machinery to carry out tasks autonomously, and identify pest infestations before they occur.


Smart sensing technology is also helping farmers use fertilizer more effectively and reduce environmental damage. An exciting research project, funded by the EPSRC, Innovate UK and Cytiva, will help growers optimize timing and amount of fertilizer to use on their crops, taking into account factors like the weather and soil condition. This will reduce the expense and damaging effects of over-fertilizing soil.
Imperial at Davos
Imperial College Business School will be in Davos alongside the World Economic Forum from 22 - 26 May 2022. They will be holding a series of events on the theme of Transforming Organisations, Transforming Markets – an opportunity to explore some of the most pressing challenges and exciting opportunities facing business today.
One of the salons will focus on 'Delivering AI ethics' and another will focus on 'Decoding digital assets'.
Imperial academics will also be taking part in fringe panels on 'Integrating SDGs in the transition to Web3 technologies' and 'Rethinking Capitalism in the 4th industrial revolution'.

Could machines do better than humans at spotting events so far considered unpredictable, such as the COVID-19 pandemic? Jim Marshall and Stephan Mergenthaler have been using natural language-understanding technology to detect trends—and analyse them at depth. They write that this type of analysis is an important foundation for people to better anticipate the future and prepare for it.

 
Nassim Taleb’s best-selling 2007 book “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable” was meant to offer a blueprint for more resilient business strategies in a networked world. Instead, the title has become a shorthand for any event that caught us unprepared. But are these types of events quickly labelled as black swans really unpredictable, or is it our inability that keeps us from connecting the dots at scale to spot and prepare for them? Could machines do better than humans at spotting them, given their near infinite capacity to read, absorb, and assimilate? And could we help communities and stakeholders to “look around the corner” a little on the topics that have greatest potential to impact their organisations, to build the kind of resilience that Taleb called for?
As part of our work developing the World Economic Forum’s strategic intelligence capabilities, we have been aggregating and surfacing high-quality content on over two hundred global issues to over three quarters of a million users for nearly four years now. This gives us a tremendous data set from which we can extrapolate trends that are shaping the world around us. What’s more, our hand-picked network of content partners from around the world means that we automatically exclude much of the noisy clickbait, fake news, and poor quality content that plague the Internet at large. We work with hundreds of think tanks, universities, research institutions and independent publishers in all major regions of the world to provide a truly global perspective. As such, when examining trends, we can be reasonably confident that our data are well positioned when it comes to the intrinsic biases inherent to open text analysis on uncurated content from the Internet.
Our recent advancements in harnessing machine learning and natural language-understanding technology mean that we are able to understand these trends at depth. We can not only look at the technical factors, such as volume and velocity of discussions, but also the strategic and emotional aspects driving them as well. Based on these unique trend characteristics, we wondered whether we might be able to predict their direction of travel. Are they a “flash in the pan” that will quickly come to a conclusion, or are they part of a longer, slow-burning trend that will build momentum over a period of years? Could the trend present opportunity or risk, is it disruptive, and could it end with a crisis or breakthrough? Perhaps more importantly, should you act now, or wait?
To answer these questions, we decided to look back in time through our database of over one million high-quality articles. We wanted to know, in retrospect, if we had known what to pay attention to, if we could have better prepared ourselves for future events — for example, a pandemic.
Long before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, there were very visible warnings about our level of preparedness for such kind of pandemic. For example, in April 2018, academic articles such as “Bats, Coronaviruses, and Deforestation: Toward the Emergence of Novel Infectious Diseases?” and similar articles published by Frontiers featured clear warnings about what was about to unfold almost two years later. While it stated that “the exact time and nature of the emergence of a disease cannot be predicted,” it warned that “the increased probability [of such events] must be considered seriously”. Throughout 2019 we surfaced articles like this from Science Daily, highlighting that “not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic” and this one from Project Syndicate entitled “Preventing the next Pandemic”.
These are just some data points representing a plethora of warnings from the wider expert community in the years leading up to the pandemic. Why is it then that we often revert to the black swan theory to exonerate ourselves from any degree of preparedness? It’s a principle we see at play in many other areas as well: Global societal trends and emerging technologies interact and create effects that may be apparent and widely discussed within narrow expert communities, but often fail to gather broad-based visibility before a substantial disruption takes place. Their development is often characterised by exponentiality and complexity – dynamics that are hard to grasp for the human brain, but fundamental to the behaviour of networked societies.
In other words, the signals of disruption may be there, but for humans to pay attention to, and connect the dots between, possible interactions and repercussions across hundreds of different topic areas is overwhelming and easily leads to neglect or denial. Doing this kind of systemic horizon scanning is next to impossible without the filtering ability, throughput, and analytical powers of intelligent machines.
Figure 1. Automatically detecting and monitoring topics using machine learning and natural language understanding

Building on top of our previous work using natural language understanding technology to detect important signals in content, we built an ensemble of advanced neural networks to identify, name, monitor and forecast trends. You can see a selection of the COVID-19 related trends that our models have been tracking for us below. The height of the line corresponds to the relative volume of discussion about the topic and the colour of the line corresponds to the sentiment of the discussions (negative is red, neutral is yellow, positive is green). The shaded section on the right gives a glimpse of the future at the time of writing (mid-May 2022).
Figure 2. Trends detected by advanced neural networks

We are already piloting alerts based on the trends that our models predict will come to the fore in the next month. The beauty of this approach is that we can backtest our model over four years’ worth of knowledge to give a general indication of its accuracy. So far, we are at around 70% accuracy within one standard deviation of the mean on forecasts up to one month in advance. As we add more signals into the mix, we expect to not only improve the accuracy but also the foresight timeframe.

about the topic of stalkerware in April 2022

While much more work needs to be done to improve our ability to enact decisive collective actions when faced with signals of future disruption, we see this work as an important foundation for stakeholders to better anticipate and prepare for the future. In doing so, we will hopefully be in a better position to face the black swans of tomorrow.

You could enhance the tool nicely by somewhat simplifying it!  🙂  A physics approach to understanding the emergence of complex systems has successfully verified that an early sign of their bursting onto our scene is finding continuities of regular proportional change (CRPC). It’s relatively easy to train a computer to lool for those, then for someone familiar with the context to confirm what kind of emergence they represent.  What CRPC indicates is successive changing scales of organization in self-organizing systems. That progression also seems implied to be necessary to escape the barrier of energy conservation in finding bootstrap innovations for starting up new systems.
I’d be pleased to talk, FYI. Some links to my early and recent progress with it are below.

Building your organization’s digital acumen is a critical priority for CIOs today. You won’t be future-ready by simply hiring people with the most cutting-edge skills – you also need to create a culture where everyone is continually working on growing and evolving their skills together.
I often tell my IT organization that the half-life of an IT professional is about 18 months because technology is constantly changing; thus, it is critical we are all continual learners. That’s true not only at Johnson & Johnson; I’ve observed this across other companies and industries too.
To support building our IT organization’s digital acumen, we implemented a program that uses artificial intelligence to assess our skills. Not only has this given us tremendous transparency into the strengths and gaps in our organization, but it’s also enabled us to keep our team members marketable and empowered. When you have an empowered team, they are more likely to be motivated to bring their best to their work.
Using AI to assess skills
The methodology we applied uses a three-pronged approach, assessing about 40 technical and leadership skills across our IT organization.
[ Also read Artificial intelligence (AI): 7 roles to prioritize now. ]
The first element is an AI model, which uses both internal and external data to assess competencies against a core skill set we are seeking to assess and develop; e.g., a full-stack engineer.
It compares employees’ skill sets to someone in a similar role or title in the external marketplace on a scale of 1 to 5. We also pull in internal data sources, such as Jira and Workday, which contain information from their resumes, for example. That helps strengthen the accuracy and correlation of the model.
The second element used to assess skill sets is an employee self-assessment. Employees receive the results of the AI model, and they validate whether they believe their skills are in line with the AI assessment.
The final prong is the manager assessment, in which the manager rates the skills of that individual employee.
This approach to assessing skill sets has been valuable for several reasons. First, it ensures the use of objective information in the evaluation process, reducing the influence of subjective views that managers may have, based on limited interactions with employees. We can see if someone has much stronger skills in a particular area than we may have known, or if someone’s skills aren’t as robust in one area as we may have thought.
We don’t use this data punitively, however, and we’ve been very clear about that from the start. Rather, it gives us a baseline for how we can develop our team members for the future.
This data has also provided greater insight into skill areas that are important to our future state but where we’re less evolved. That’s enabled us to think about how to increase learning and experience opportunities so we can work on growing those desirable skill sets.
Having data-driven insights into our skill strengths and gaps has enabled us to focus on how we can double down and build upon them.
The data has also given us insight into employees with strong skills that we didn’t know about until we had the assessment results. Now we’re able to tap them for their expertise and for new opportunities, which allows them to develop and share those skill sets with others. The data has also uncovered development opportunities for managers to advance capabilities and continually improve.
[ Increasing digital acumen across the organization is a key priority for CIOs, according to a report from Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. Learn more. ] 
While we’ve learned a lot about the composition of skills in our organization, the data has enabled us to identify and prioritize skills for the future, too. To be future-ready, we know we must continue to focus on skills around intelligent automation, data engineering, data management, data science, full-stack development, architecture, AI, and product leadership. We’ve discovered that we have some really strong skills in areas like lab integration, scrum, and product team development.
Having data-driven insights into our skill strengths and gaps has enabled us to focus on how we can double down and build upon them. We’re encouraging everyone to create a learning development plan, and to support that, we’ve developed several learning modules that individuals can leverage for training.
Creating opportunities for applying skills
The feedback we’ve received from team members both inside and outside our organization has been phenomenal. They see that we’re investing in their future, and they have a clear picture of how they’re positioned in the organization. They want to develop their skills so they can be viable, valuable, and marketable.
While growing and learning new skills is important, the key is to create opportunities for them to apply and leverage these new skills. One way we’ve supported this is through what we call our gig marketplace – a forum where teams can advertise for specific skill sets and where individuals can apply to fulfill them.
For example, a team working on a technology solution supporting our cancer treatment therapy might need a full-stack developer. If you’re qualified for that project, you can apply for the opportunity to participate on the team and put those skills to work.
We’re also using the tool to put together high-performing teams from diverse backgrounds to solve a common problem. This is another way for individuals to amplify the type of work they want to do while interacting with different people with different skill sets.

Making this work for you
We’ve reaped tremendous value from this skills assessment, and it’s helped our broader organization understand the importance of growing our digital acumen. It’s important that CIOs don’t do this alone, however.
CIOs need to create partnerships across the C-suite for this to be effective throughout the organization – leading within the technology domain while HR leads the overall talent approach and business leaders apply their strategies.
With persistence, you can show progress along the digital talent journey over time. Tie it into the core of the company, into the mission, and bring everyone along the way. That’s how we’ve tackled improving our digital acumen so we can continue to drive outcomes and serve the patients and customers who are counting on us every day.

Jobs of the future are already hereHere are three ways humans and robots are already working together.1. Drones that deliver helpIn Africa, drones are being used to deliver medicines in Malawi. Drone academies in Benin and Sierra Leone in West Africa are training local people in drone piloting and addressing skills gaps in the technology.German aerospace company Wingcopter makes the drones for commercial and humanitarian work.“Transit is not possible through roads, so drones come in and help poorer and less advantaged people have access to medicine,” explains Nthambi Mpazanje, Chief Remote Pilot At Wingcopter.Automation is a scary word for many people because they feel machines will take away their job, says Andy Fisanich, Head of Humanitarian Programs at Wingcopter. But the reality is that technology will actually lead to “better standards, better skilled jobs and more opportunity,” says Fisanich.

Robots that help nursesIn hospitals, a robot called Moxi is helping clinical staff fetch and deliver things including lab samples, medicines, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies. By handling mundane tasks, the robot frees up time for nurses and clinicians to focus on patient care.Moxi is built by Diligent Robotics, an artificial intelligence company based in Texas in the United States. The company’s co-founder, Andrea Thomaz, says it’s the “deep connection with their patients” that nurses and clinicians say they love most about their jobs.Patients may have more interactions with automation and technology in the jobs of the future, but Thomaz feels person-to-person caregiving will always be here.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing about drones? Show moreThe World Economic Forum is partnering with governments and companies to create flexible regulations that allow drones to be manufactured and used in various ways to help society and the economy.Drones can do many wonderful things, but their upsides are often overshadowed by concerns about privacy, collisions and other potential dangers. To make matters worse, government regulations have not been able to keep up with the speed of technological innovation.In 2017 the World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution teamed up with the Government of Rwanda to draft the world’s first framework for governing drones at scale. Using a performance-based approach that set minimum safety requirements instead of equipment specifications, this innovative regulatory framework gave drone manufacturers the flexibility to design and test different types of drones. These drones have delivered life-saving vaccines, conducted agricultural land surveys, inspected infrastructure and had many other socially beneficial uses in Rwanda.Today, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is working with governments and companies in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America to co-design and pilot agile policies that bring all the social and economic benefits of drone technology while minimizing its risks.Read more here, and contact us if you're interested in getting involved with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution's pioneering work in the governance of emerging technologies.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies3. Coral restoration robotsWith the world’s coral reefs suffering the effects of climate change, technology is increasingly stepping in to help.To clean and maintain 10,000 coral fragments, three people would need to work full-time for a year, putting in 4,000 hours of work, research shows. Now a coral farming robot is using computer automation – AI – to cut costs and save time.A device called Charm – which stands for Coral Husbandry Automated Raceway Machine – has a robotic arm with soft brushes that clean algae from corals, and a camera that detects the corals. It can also feed coral when they’re hungry and identify pests.Massachusetts Institution of Technology graduate Stephen Rodan invented Charm. He says the technology can “grow thousands to hopefully millions of coral by the touch of a button” and views Charm as a useful tool in the race to “help restore coral reefs around the world”.List of technologies likely to be adopted by jobs of the future by 2025 (Future of Job Survey, World Economic Forum) Image: World Economic Forum How can we prepare for the new world of work?Employers expect to offer reskilling and upskilling to just over 70% of their employees by 2025, according to the Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020. An average of 66% of employers surveyed for the report also expect to get a return on their investment in upskilling and reskilling within one year.“Everything you want to learn is available on the internet,” says Chris Do, Chief Executive and Founder of online education platform The Futur. It’s also easier, quicker and cheaper to explore than, for example, a traditional university application.Workshops, courses, e-books, training and one-to-one mentorship are some of the resources available online, Do says.Data analysts, machine learning specialists and robotics engineers are among the roles that are growing in demand, the World Economic Forum finds. But softer skills are also needed.

Published: 25 May 2022


 
In a letter to the chair and vice-chair of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office (NAIIO), healthcare and technology stakeholders asked that healthcare be included in the scope of its work to advance US artificial intelligence (AI) by adding a healthcare subcommittee to the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC).







The NAIIO was established by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 to help coordinate the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative. Specifically, the NAIIO serves as the central point of contact for information exchange on activities related to the initiative and provides support to the Select Committee on AI, the senior interagency committee that oversees the initiative, and the NAIAC.
The NAIAC, launched in April, advises the president and the NAIIO on topics related to US AI competitiveness, progress in implementing the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative, and other information pertaining to AI. The NAIAC’s members consist of leaders from academia, civil society, non-profits, and the private sector with AI-relevant expertise. Currently, the NAIAC only has one subcommittee, which focuses on AI and law enforcement.
In the letter sent to the NAIIO, which was shared with HealthITAnalytics via email, stakeholders stated that AI development in healthcare has significant potential to positively impact US AI competitiveness:
“In no area is there greater potential for positive transformation domestically, and to advance U.S. competitiveness and international leadership, than healthcare,"" the letter states. ""Leveraging health data (including social determinants of health [SDOH] and PGHD [patient-generated health data]) with AI tools holds incredible promise for advancing value-based care in research, health administration and operations, population health, practice delivery improvement, and direct clinical care. To realize this potential, the U.S. system must continue to evolve to provide incentives for investments that will support U.S. leadership in health AI.”
The stakeholders recommended that the NAIAC include healthcare in its work by creating a standing healthcare subcommittee, similar to the one created for AI and law enforcement, made up of public and private sector experts on health AI.
“We recommend that this standing subcommittee address issues including research and development incentives, quality assurance and oversight, thoughtful design, access and affordability, ethics and data bias mitigation, linkages to data privacy and security, data interoperability, workforce issues, and education,"" the letter states. ""We write to recommend that you take additional steps to ensure that the NAIAC’s scope and work includes a focus on considerations specific to healthcare.”
The signatories of the letter include AdvaMed, the American Medical Association, Anthem, the Connected Health Initiative, the Consumer Technology Association, the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance, and Qi-Fense.

As our computer software and hardware constantly improve, employers find new ways to take advantage of these advancements. Instead of being relegated to increasing productivity, new technology, like artificial intelligence, is taking on additional roles in the workplace. Applications include monitoring employees and assisting in the hiring process.


But using new technology for decisions traditionally made by humans could have a few growing pains, including inadvertent discrimination. Luckily, workplace civil rights enforcement agencies like the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are anticipating this potential problem and have taken steps to tackle it.

How Employers Are Using New Technology in the Workplace

There are two major areas in which employers are using technology in ways that could lead to illegal discrimination. First, it’s with monitoring employees’ productivity levels and measuring their performance. Second, it’s when making hiring decisions.

PROMOTED
Using software, artificial intelligence and algorithms to increase the efficiency of the hiring process might be the single biggest example of how companies are trying to make the most of new technology. But in this quest to save time, money and effort, certain job applicants could find themselves at an unfair and illegal disadvantage.
How Advanced Technology Could Lead to Inadvertent Workplace Discrimination
In regards to employee monitoring (and ignoring the potential legal issues involved), there are situations where the goal of identifying who the most productive workers are could result in violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).

For instance, an employer might have software that monitors an employee’s keystrokes or completed computer tasks over a given time period. But what if an employee has an ADA-recognized disability that makes typing or using a traditional mouse cumbersome?

To deal with this challenge, they might have access to a reasonable accommodation, like voice recognition software or some other type of input device. Yet if the monitoring software doesn’t take these accommodations into account, the employee with a disability could be unfairly graded by the monitoring software. This flawed assessment might ignore the fact that the employee is perfectly capable of completing their job tasks with a reasonable accommodation. An employer aware of this scenario could avoid this situation by using a different way of testing or grading the employee’s productivity levels. But the trick is being aware that this type of scenario could arise.

As for technology leading to discrimination during the hiring process, there are many possible pitfalls for an unwary employer. Some examples include:


Software and algorithms that scan resumes from applicants for specific keywords.
Facial and voice-recognition technology that grades job applicants based on how they talk and their facial expressions.
Asking potential employees to take a self-assessment test to determine their personality and if they’ll be a good fit for a particular position.
Using chatbots or virtual assistants to ask job applicants basic questions about their qualifications.
Requiring prospective hires to take a pre-employment test on a computer.


These seem innocuous, and for the most part, they are. So how could they lead to discrimination? In example #1, whoever develops the algorithms and software might unknowingly program the technology to give special preferences to gender-biased words. This might give resumes from a particular sex or gender an advantage in the selection process.
In example #2, the software and algorithms could place a special emphasis on candidates that speak a certain way or use certain words. But those with accents, a unique manner of speaking or disabilities that affect speech could be penalized by the technology. This could lead to unlawful discrimination based on someone’s race, color, national origin or disability.
For example #3, a candidate with severe depression could be disqualified from a position due to their “personality” even though their answers are a consequence of a mental impairment that’s recognized by the ADA.
For example #4, imagine a chatbot that asks job applicants yes or no questions about their job history. And one of the questions is if they were ever fired from a job “for cause.” An applicant wants to answer truthfully and errs on the side of caution by answering “yes.” Yet this answer automatically results in their disqualification from the position. But the chatbot didn’t allow the job applicant to explain that the reason for their termination was later found to be illegal because it was due to the job applicant’s age.
In the fifth example, the test itself may not be discriminatory. But if it’s given in a way that places certain applicants at a disadvantage because of a protected trait, it could be illegal.
A hypothetical situation might be an aptitude test that has to be taken on a computer in the employer’s office and measures the job candidate’s typing skills. But the job candidate is visually impaired. And while they can type on a regular keyboard, their typing skills are nowhere near as good as when using a braille keyboard.
What Can Employers Do to Avoid Technology Discrimination?
The biggest thing employers can do is become educated about the potential problems new technology can have. And that despite the best intentions, discrimination can still take place.
In the majority of situations, employers making use of technology aren’t trying to discriminate. But they might be ignorant of how the use of their technology results in the dismissal of promising applicants and successful employees because of protected characteristics.
To help increase awareness among employers, various government agencies have released legal and technical guidance. These are intended to advise employers on what they need to look out for when implementing new software, algorithms and artificial technology in the workplace.
Two recent releases have come from the EEOC and DOJ with The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Disability Discrimination in Hiring, respectively. These focus on disability discrimination, but are likely just the beginning.
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) will probably release its own legal guidance for employers. Then there’s probably going to be guidance handed down in regards to how an employer’s use of technology could lead to discrimination in violation of other federal laws, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).
Bottom Line
New technology can help provide new ways for employers to get work done. But if they’re not careful, it could result in inadvertent discrimination of employees and job applicants. Federal agencies responsible for enforcing workplace civil rights laws are already taking steps to help employers avoid these mistakes.

These failures continue to exist in part because finding and fixing bugs in NLP models is hard—so hard that severe bugs impact almost every major open-source and commercial NLP model. ",,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

By 2025, the World Economic Forum estimates that 97 million new jobs may emerge as artificial intelligence (AI) changes the nature of work and influences the new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms. Specifically in banking, a recent McKinsey survey found that AI technologies could deliver up to $1 trillion of additional value each year. AI is continuing its steady rise and starting to have a sweeping impact on the financial services industry, but its potential is still far from fully realized.
The transformative power of AI is already impacting a range of functions in financial services including risk management, personalization, fraud detection and ESG analytics. The problem is that advances in AI are slowed down by a global shortage of workers with the skills and experience in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing and robotic process automation. So with AI technology opening new opportunities, financial services workers are eager to gain the skills they need in order to leverage AI tools and advance their careers.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Today, 87% of employees consider retraining and upskilling options at workplaces very important, and at the same time, more companies ranked upskilling their workforce as a top-5 business priority now than pre-pandemic. Companies that don’t focus on powering AI training will fall behind in a tight hiring market. Below are some key takeaways for business leaders looking to prioritize reskilling efforts at their organization.
Build data literacy with customizable learning paths
Any digital transformation requires leaders to focus their investments on two modern sources of competitive advantage: data and people. First, boosting data literacy across the organization helps line of business and domain experts (Sales, HR, Marketing, Financial Analysts, etc.) collaborate with AI and machine learning experts, which is critical to move beyond proof of concepts and experimentation. 
For AI tools to be deployed at scale, those employees whose jobs involve interactions with AI systems need to understand how those systems work and what the constraints and limitations might be. Reskilling these individuals may include how to interpret the results of the AI/ML models or how to intervene with AI/ML experts when the results seem off.
A recent McKinsey study found that effective reskilling is 20% more cost-effective than a “hiring and firing” approach, and utilizing the right tools and technology can help companies accomplish their reskilling goals. 
Importantly, before taking on any AI reskilling efforts, banks and financial services organizations need to first understand what outcome they’re driving towards and what skills are required. An employee self-assessment survey that focuses on necessary skills can help companies determine a customized curriculum and plan based on the existing skills gaps.  advertisement
The notion of a one-size-fits-all training program or that employees need to take significant time away from the office to attend courses is no longer relevant. Utilizing digital learning platforms like Skillsoft, Udacity, or Udemy, or integrating content into mainstream work systems can make employees’ reskilling experiences more user-friendly. Platforms like WalkMe can help employees learn complex software systems quickly, and Axonify can deliver 5- to 10-minute microlearning sessions to employees within their daily workflow. For an even more customized approach, companies may opt to build their own programs with the help of industry consultants and professors who are experts in their field. 
Turn to in-house, existing tools and groups for AI reskilling
A Deloitte survey found that 94% of employees would stay at a company if it helped them develop and learn new skills, but only 15% can access learning opportunities directly related to their jobs. AI reskilling offers an immense opportunity for both financial services companies and their employees, but it can be daunting to consider monetary and time investments needed with reskilling efforts. The good news is that businesses can often utilize existing company tools instead of purchasing all new software. 
Here are three excellent sources to help accelerate AI/ML training and implementation:
Industry consortiums: You might also consider joining industry consortiums that support your team’s progress and encourage employee growth through collaborative groups. For example, FINOS (fintech open source consortium under Linux Foundation) helps facilitate the processing and exchange of financial data throughout the entire banking ecosystem. Cloud Service Providers (CSP) Training and Certification Programs: Many of the CSPs, such as AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft, offer ML training and certification programs for free or subsidized prices. These self-guided programs vary in topics and tracks from understanding conversational AI to machine learning for business and technical decision-makers and are designed for those looking to learn new skills or to build or switch careers.Technology Enablers’ AI-powered Solution Accelerators: Additionally, many companies like IBM, AWS, PwC and Databricks offer easily deployable tools and solutions accelerators for common data analytics and machine learning use cases that organizations can utilize. Instead of enduring the weeks of development time, technical practitioners like data scientists, solutions architects and developers (from novice to experts) can leverage these accelerators to enable faster time to modernization and help talent upskilling. At Databricks, our financial services solutions accelerators help companies capitalize on the open banking paradigm, providing free code and training that helps with front-to-back-end automation. This includes free SAS to Python training to help technical and non-technical teams combine AI and rules-based fraud algorithms. 
Recognize the cultural benefits of offering AI reskilling opportunitiesadvertisement
Investing in employees’ skills and knowledge can build a positive company culture and reduce turnover by boosting employees’ confidence and productivity, and it creates a more well-rounded workforce that increases teams’ effectiveness.
AI reskilling efforts can also help financial services organizations make better progress on their diversity, equity and inclusion methods by making learning more accessible to individuals who have faced barriers to higher education. To address this and the skills gap, banks including Bank of America, BBVA, Capital One, CIBC and JPMorgan Chase have invested in job training and reskilling efforts for their employees. 
Bank of America’s career tools and resources have helped more than 21,000 employees find new roles at the company. Consistent training of new technologies and certifications are an investment in shaping the workforce of the future and will help to ensure that employees stay ahead of current trends and industry demands. 
Look to data and employee metrics 
As a leader at an organization focused on data and AI, we always look to the data to show what we should prioritize internally – and this includes what we should focus on in our AI reskilling efforts. When measuring the success of reskilling programs and initiatives, a recent LinkedIn study found that today’s measures assessing the impact of training programs relied primarily on soft metrics, including completion rates, satisfaction scores and employee feedback. 
This is a missed opportunity as company leaders can – and should – consider utilizing harder metrics that measure business value including increases in employee retention, productivity or revenue, to gain the most helpful insights from their reskilling initiatives. If it’s not working well, companies can consider bringing in new technologies or tools, or adjusting their program and overall experience to make it successful in the future, and by doing so, continue to stay ahead in the competitive war for talent.  
Future-proofing starts now
In Jamie Dimon’s latest shareholder letter to JPMorgan investors, he points out: “Our most important asset — far more important than capital — is the quality of our people.” He continues, “technology always drives change, but now the waves of technological innovation come in faster and faster.” 
Since companies that reskill their employees are more productive, produce positive economic returns and see increased employee satisfaction, there’s no better time to start than now.

AI, machine learning, and deep learning all made it possible for computers to replicate human intelligence at a fast rate.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been drawing the attention of executives and researchers over the past decade with its value proposition of driving more impactful decisions by providing data-driven insights, increasing efficiencies, and reducing costs.An AI revolution is quietly occurring within the human capital management (HCM) space. This means AI solutions will find their way into the HR department in the coming years. Human capital professionals must adapt to this new technology to increase productivity and transform their roles at work.So how can you leverage AI as an HR manager? Let’s look at what AI offers your business and how it will impact Human Capital Management in 2022.What is HCM?What is HCM?SourceHCM stands for Human Capital Management. It is the umbrella term for the various processes and systems that organizations use to manage and maximize the value of their employees. It includes activities such as recruiting and hiring, onboarding and orientation, training and development, performance management, compensation and benefits, employee relations, and workplace planning.Essentially, HCM is all about managing people as assets to increase organizational productivity and competitiveness.Human Capital Management With AIHuman Capital Management With AISourceAI in HCM can process incoming data, assisting with natural language processing and deep learning to make completing tasks easier for humans. Virtual assistants allow employees to communicate more efficiently without bothering HR departments, thus increasing productivity.In the 1980s, Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) emerged. Over time, these technologies matured. There has been a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI), thus combining a diverse range of HR data from across the company into one centralized solution.It simplifies all the data, turning it into something much easier to understand. You can use this information to predict how well the company will do based on its employees’ performance.None of this would have been possible without data labeling. For example, because of well-labeled data, today, we can convert hardcopy content into digital files, also known as optical character recognition.How Can AI Improve HCM?How Can AI Improve HCM?SourceNow that we know how AI will affect human resources, let’s see how it benefits HR.1. Optimize Employee OnboardingAccording to a recent survey, nearly 90% of managers say a new hire’s first day is crucial for setting an employee up for success. A lot of that depends on how well employers have prepared their new hires ahead of time.To make onboarding as seamless as possible, you can use AI technology to give your employees everything they need before joining your office: training, webinars, FAQs, and more.That way, when someone walks into your office, you don’t have to waste time getting them up to speed — they’re already there.2. Improve Your Recruitment ProcessRecruitment is a major expense for many businesses. Most companies spend too much time and money on an inefficient process, often missing out on top talent while they’re at it. Fortunately, employers are using artificial intelligence in their hiring practices to help them improve efficiencies and save resources.By leveraging AI across multiple steps of your recruitment process — from candidate’s search to onboarding — you can cut down on costs, waste and errors while improving productivity across your HR department.First, artificial intelligence can help you shorten your candidate search. An automated candidate-sourcing tool can help find qualified people by searching available talent pools and facilitating their applications for your job openings. This saves time on manual searches and lets you focus on contacting promising candidates directly rather than sifting through résumés that don’t meet your criteria.Ensuring candidates with relevant experience apply to open positions also improves employer brand awareness and increases your chances of finding great hires early in the process.3. Reduce HR CostsArtificial intelligence is taking over many functions in business, including Human Capital Management (HCM). Learn how to make your HR department more efficient by implementing artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence can analyze job descriptions and salaries, distribute employee files throughout your company, provide educational opportunities, etc.In addition to reducing human resource costs, artificial intelligence can also improve employee satisfaction. It is highly beneficial for both employees and employers.Try human capital management software today!4. Streamline Performance ManagementAutomated technologies have improved to enable real-time management that enhances employee satisfaction and makes employees more productive. With AI, managers can engage with their employees more productively. Machine learning algorithms can also help assess job performance more objectively and accurately than human managers.It’s not just about efficiency: Using artificial intelligence in human resources is about more than increasing efficiency. It gives you a competitive edge by empowering you to attract top talent through better recruitment processes and improve productivity by better managing your existing staff.5. Automate Your Benefits PackagesAutomating human capital management (HCM) tasks like benefits packages free up HR professionals’ time to focus on strategic HR issues. It also ensures your team always complies with laws, regulations, and industry trends — meaning that their management of human capital looks professional and is also sustainable. Finally, automation empowers employees to self-serve whenever possible.It not only makes it easy for them to stay abreast of recent developments and changes in your benefits packages, but it also helps foster a culture of empowerment throughout your organization.6. Provide Tools For Increasing Employee EngagementWhether you are working for a large organization or starting a business, implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into your human capital management (HCM) solution can make your workplace more efficient and help increase employee engagement. While some companies may worry about how AI will impact their workforce, adopting tools that boost productivity and engagement can help retain employees by showing them how valuable they are to your company.And with organizations moving away from traditional methods of recruiting, retaining, and managing staff members, HCM is becoming increasingly crucial to maintaining and growing an effective workforce.There are several ways organizations can implement artificial intelligence into their HCM solutions to increase engagement.Some examples include- Predictive analytics: Predictive analytics helps human resources departments make better decisions about employee retention, hiring, and management by predicting future outcomes based on historical data. More data will make your predictions more accurate — and predictive analytics tools use as much data as possible to create models that help you predict what will happen in your workforce over time.What Factors To Consider Before Investing In Any AI-Powered HCM Tool?SourceFor investing in an AI-powered HCM tool, there are several factors that you need to consider.

What Is Deepfake and How Does it Work? 
A deepfake is defined as an artificial intelligence-powered form of media that depicts a person saying something they did not say, appearing in a manner different from authentic visuals, or diverging from reality somehow, with the purpose of fooling the media viewer or a technology system. 
How Does Deepfake Work
A deepfake is a human impersonation created with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. It can be a fake picture or clip of a person’s expression, an audible file or filter that imitates their speech, or anything else that resembles a person using machine learning (ML). 
Visual and audio alteration has been practiced for many years. For instance, graphic editing techniques were used in films to smooth over movie flaws, and individuals have been using image editing software to generate memes since the dawn of the internet. Deepfakes are an AI-enabled extension of this, which can be used to mislead users. 
They may also use newly emerging technology such as autoencoders and synthetic adversarial systems. Threat actors can use deep learning algorithms to target specific features of a person’s likeness, such as their face structure or body language. It provides incredibly convincing impersonations that hackers are trying to take advantage of.
The rising reliance of enterprises on video-based interactions is expected to encourage attackers to engage in deepfake assaults. According to Darren ThomsonOpens a new window , CyberCube’s Head of Cybersecurity Strategy, as sensitive data becomes more widely available online, fraudsters drive innovation to take advantage of this phenomenon. He has mentioned that new and developing social engineering approaches like deepfake audio and video have become technically and commercially viable for criminal organizations worldwide.

How does deepfake work?
Machine learning is a crucial component in the development of a deepfake. Convolutional neural networks are artificial Intelligent computer systems built partly on the human mind, meant to spot trends in information. Deepfakes depend on artificial neural networks. The process of making a deepfake starts here.
To make a deepfake video, the developer first feeds countless hours of actual video footage to a deep neural network, which is then “trained” to recognize detailed rhythms and traits of a person. This is performed to provide the algorithm with a realistic representation of how that individual appears from various perspectives. 
The next move is to combine the trained learning algorithm with computer graphics technologies to overlay real-time video of a person with AI-generated facial and vocal patterns obtained from neural network input. Although many people believe that constructing a deepfake needs complicated tools and specialist knowledge, this is not the case — they can also be created with only basic graphic design knowledge. 
While sophisticated approaches are required for hyperrealistic deepfakes, all a hacker need is access to somebody’s video or audio material. Given the vast amount of content currently available, this is particularly feasible, as original material is available in abundance to fuel the algorithm and build a convincing deepfake.
While the capacity to constantly swap faces to create genuine and realistic-looking artificial video has some intriguing innocuous applications (such as in movies and gaming), it is a powerful weapon with some worrying implications. Creating synthetic pornographic material was one of the earliest practical uses for deepfakes.

Types of Deepfake Frauds
Now that we have established what a deepfake is, let us consider its various types: 
Types of Deepfake Frauds
1. Textual deepfakes
Earlier, it was thought that a machine could not do a creative project like drawing or writing in the early stages of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Fast forward through 2021, when top-rated AI-generated writing can now compose human-looking pith and clarity, thanks to the robust language models and libraries developed over decades by the incremental labor of scholars and data science specialists.
2. Deepfake video
Deepfake criminals’ primary weapon is the creation of fake photographs and videos. Given that we live in the omnipresent social media world, where videos and photos elucidate incidents and stories better than the text format, it is the most widely used type of deepfake. 
Modern video-generating artificial intelligence is more competent than natural language AI and may be more hazardous. Hyperconnect, a Seoul-based software firm, released MarioNETte in 2020, a program that can create deepfake movies of historical people, celebrities, and leaders. This is accomplished by having another individual reenact the desired personality’s facial gestures, which are then placed on the intended personality’s deepfake.
3. Deepfake audio
Text, photos, and video are not the only things that neural networks and artificial intelligence can do. They also can clone a human voice. All that’s needed is a data repository containing an audiotape of a person whose voice must be imitated. Deepfake algorithms will be able to learn from this data collection and replicate the prosody of a specific person’s voice.
Commercial software such as Lyrebird and Deep Voice has been introduced. Still, you only have to say a few phrases before artificial intelligence becomes acclimated to your voice and accent. This program becomes strong enough to copy your voice as you send in more recordings of yourself. You may simply deliver a phrase or a sentence after loading in a collection of your voice recordings, and this deepfake program will describe the text in your tone.
4. Deepfakes on social media
One can use deepfake innovation in conjunction with creating stories or blogs to build a fake internet profile that would be difficult for a regular user to detect. A deepfake with the identity Maisy Kinsley on social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter, for instance, was convincingly a (non-existent) Bloomberg reporter. Her profile photo was unusual as if it had been made by software. Maisy Kinsley’s public profile regularly attempted to connect with Tesla stock short-sellers, indicating that the profile was most likely fabricated for financial gain.
5. Real-time or live deepfakes
Deepfake technology is astonishingly advanced, allowing firms to generate advertising clones, governments to imitate political adversaries, and hackers to recreate user voices to pass voice-based authentication. 
Youtubers are already changing their faces in real-time using a novel deepfake program. For example, DeepFaceLive is an open-source artificial intelligence software that can convert your visage into someone else’s via videoconference and streaming networks. Streamers already have started utilizing the feature on platforms like Twitch, and both broadcasters and developers of any other media output can use this program.

Deepfake Fraud Examples
Recent examples of fraudulent activities carried out using deepfakes include:
1. The Mandalorian Luke Skywalker deepfake
Star Wars fans were ecstatic when Luke Skywalker appeared in The Mandalorian’s season 2 finale. However, once the space dust had cleared, viewers were keen to point out problems in the digital reconstruction of a youthful Mark Hamill. YouTuber Shamook tried his hand at deepfaking a Luke Skywalker from the Return of the Jedi age, with stunning results.
Shamook had been recruited by no one other than Industrial Light and Magic, the renowned visual effects company responsible for bringing the Star Wars universe to life. We’re interested in watching how deepfake technology shapes the universe far, far away.
2. The Nancy Pelosi slowed-down video
It was not a deepfake in the traditional sense; instead, it illustrated why its possible misuse has become so dreaded in geopolitics. The 2019 clip was slowed down by 25% and video changed the pitch to make it appear as though Nancy Pelosi, the United States House of Representatives speaker, was gurning her words. 
The tape was shared worldwide, and after the video was fact-checked and found to be fraudulent, Facebook declined to remove it, saying it had decreased its circulation. The post was later taken down, although it’s unclear who was responsible and who took it down.
3. Obama’s message to the public
Most of the more convincing deepfakes have used imposters to impersonate the source’s speech and mannerisms, such as this video developed by BuzzFeed and actor Jordan Peele combining After Effects CC and FakeApp. Peele’s jaw was superimposed over Obama’s, with a jawline that matched Peele’s mouth motions replacing Obama’s. After that, FakeApp was used to improve the footage with almost 50 hours of automated processing.
4. Yang Mi travels in time
A video featuring Yang Mi, one of China’s renowned current performers, pasted into the 1983 Hong Kong tv series The Legend Of The Condor Heroes went viral a few years ago, clocking up 240 million views before being taken off by Chinese authorities. Its maker, a Yang Mi admirer, apologized on Weibo, saying he made the film as a caution to promote awareness of the innovation. 
While the film and television industries are likely to react negatively to deepfakes at first, it is also feasible to see how the sector could ultimately accept the innovation and profit from it by enabling viewers to perform director on home updates by tricking dialogue, inserting alternate scenes, or even playing characters themselves. There will also be a slew of celebrity cameos in video games.
5. Zuckerberg deepfake where he speaks frankly 
Artist Bill Posters uploaded this on Facebook-owned Instagram in June in reaction to Facebook’s failure to remove the clip of Nancy Pelosi, displaying Mark Zuckerberg bragging about how the site “owns” its followers. The video was created as part of Posters and Daniel Howe’s Spectre project, which was produced for Sheffield Doc Fest to highlight how one may use social media to deceive people. It was created using the VDR (video conversation substitution) software from Israeli `Firm Canny AI, which is being pushed with a deepfake singalong with several international leaders.
The posters used the hashtag #deepfake to call attention to it. While the video seems convincing in silent mode, the voice gives it away, demonstrating that a competent actor is still required to create realistic deepfake instances. However, with Lyrebird and Adobe VoCo proposing AI voice generation, it may not be much until one can simply add passable sounds to deepfakes.

Deepfake Fraud Prevention Best Practices for 2022
Given the sophistication of the danger, businesses would be wise to take some basic and preventive steps to reduce the chance of falling prey to deepfake-based frauds. These are a few examples:
Deepfake Fraud Prevention Best Practices
1. Use anti-fake technology
Finding a reliable means to identify deepfake attacks, especially using automated technologies, is one way for businesses to guard themselves against them. Such an opportunity is AI-powered detecting software. One may also use the same deep learning techniques to make deepfakes to detect evidence that a picture or video has been tampered with.
Deepfakes can be detected in a variety of ways, and this is only one of them. Watermarking information to detect manipulation is another technology-based technique. Amber Authenticate, for instance, is a cryptographic device that can produce hashes at predetermined intervals throughout a movie. If the video is changed, the hashes will shift, alerting the user that the material has been changed.
2. Espouse training and awareness
The uniqueness of the threat is among the grounds why deepfakes are dangerous to businesses. Most businesses still have no idea what deepfakes are or how damaging they can be. On the other hand, companies can lower their chances of falling victim to a deepfake assault by informing employees, management, and shareholders about the danger.
Enterprises can build an additional layer of defense with enough training and increased awareness. Employees should be able to identify deepfake-based social engineering efforts through training that emphasizes how technology is utilized in hostile actions and how to spot it. Businesses must take a systematic approach to developing a security-conscious workplace culture. Employees will be better at recognizing deepfakes if they are educated about security threats and preventative strategies.
3. Enforce robust security protocols
Technology may not be the only way to avoid deepfake videos. Rebutting deepfake with good fundamental security practices is surprisingly effective. Automatic checks implemented into any procedure for disbursing payments, for example, might have prevented numerous deepfake and related frauds.

Inform employees and family members about how deepfaking operates and the difficulties it can cause.
Teach yourself and others how to recognize a deepfake.
Ensure that you are media savvy and use high-quality news sources.
Have excellent fundamental procedures in place — “trust but verify.” A suspicious attitude about voicemail and videos will not protect you from being duped, but it will help you avoid many pitfalls.

4. Explore the use of blockchain
Using blockchain as a solution could be a viable option. A decentralized system, or blockchain, allows users to store information online without the use of centralized servers. Furthermore, blockchains are resistant to a wide range of security vulnerabilities that centralized data storage is susceptible to. Although distributed ledgers are not currently capable of storing large amounts of data, they are suitable for storing hashes and electronic signatures.
Individuals may, for instance, use blockchain to authenticate and verify the validity of a video or audio document that is personal to them. The more people that sign film with their electronic signatures, the more likely it is to be deemed an authentic record. This is not the best option. It will be necessary to take additional measures to assess and factor in the competence of those who vote on a file.
5. Adopt a zero-trust approach to online content
Just as anyone can steal images and create phony profiles on the internet, scammers can go one step further using deepfake software. Before you trust anything you see on the internet, adopt a zero-trust approach and use caution. This advice applies to all new stories, images, and videos. You can learn to recognize bogus information by using web tools.
6. Prepare a response strategy
Make sure you are prepared to react to a deepfake in the right way. Prepare a strategy that you can implement if a deepfake is discovered. In this technique, you must outline individual responsibilities and required activities.
Identity checks like validation, device ID and analytics, behavioral analytics, and document verification are all critical parts of a multi-layered protection plan, especially when it comes to how scammers may try to spread or use these deepfakes. It may seem self-evident, but the first layer of defense is crucial: ensuring that only the proper people (and only the right people) have access to all potential areas of vulnerability. 
7. Develop new security standards
Another method of preventing deepfakes is implementing new security standards within your company. A deepfake’s ability to persuade a person is great, but its ability to persuade others drops rapidly when more individuals are involved. A corporation can detect a deepfake assault before it causes damage by adding numerous inspections to instances where deepfakes may be implicated.
Hackers use deepfakes to create phone and video calls while impersonating firm employees. As a result, firms can build security standards that outline an inspection routine that staff should take when answering such calls to detect deepfakes.
8. Keep user data private
Consider restricting the reach of your postings if you still want to be active on social media. Making your profile private is a wise approach to keeping your photos between a recognized network, even if it is not a failsafe solution to protect your pictures. Do not add strangers or connect with them if you do not know them. This is a general principle to follow if you do not want to fall victim to a trolling or phishing scam.

Takeaways 
Today, governments and enterprises across the globe are concerned about the pernicious impacts of a deepfake attack. It could lead to several extremely disparaging and damaging outcomes for institutions and individuals alike, so a foolproof and robust security mechanism is strongly recommended. 
By adhering to deepfake fraud prevention best practices and maintaining a strong digital hygiene policy, companies can genuinely fight back against the many threat actors out there. Finally, it is also important to educate individuals (or your employees) on the insidious impacts of a deepfake attack and the most prudent ways to safeguard oneself from such an occurrence. By building this calibrated and well-articulated defense mechanism, deepfakes, and their creators can be held at bay.

The Pentagon has tapped artificial intelligence ethics and research expert Diane Staheli to lead the Responsible AI (RAI) Division of its new Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO), FedScoop confirmed on Tuesday.
In this role, Staheli will help steer the Defense Department’s development and application of policies, practices, standards and metrics for buying and building AI that is trustworthy and accountable. She enters the position nearly nine months after DOD’s first AI ethics lead exited the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), and in the midst of a broad restructuring of the Pentagon’s main AI-associated components under the CDAO.
“[Staheli] has significant experience in military-oriented research and development environments, and is a contributing member of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence AI Assurance working group,” Sarah Flaherty, CDAO’s public affairs officer, told FedScoop.
Advanced computer-driven systems use AI to perform tasks that generally require some human intelligence. The Pentagon has increasingly adopted AI-based technologies in recent years to enable functions spanning the back office to the battlefield. But with all these benefits AI offers, the technology also poses the potential for risky unintended consequences that could result from its uses.

U.S. defense and military officials are being strategic about getting ahead of such possibly harmful implications.
Formed in 2018, DOD’s JAIC works to help DOD deploy and scale AI capabilities as warfare evolves to be increasingly digital. A National Defense Authorization Act provision the following year in part prompted the Pentagon to craft custom ethical guidance to inform its AI implementations, and the JAIC was tasked with leading that development.
The JAIC’s first responsible AI chief, Alka Patel, joined the department in early 2020 — not long after its ethical AI principles were formally adopted. She departed the role after 20 months in October. Several weeks after her exit, DOD announced a hefty organizational restructure that placed the JAIC, as well as the Defense Digital Service and the department’s chief data officer organization under the newly established CDAO. 
Pentagon officials noted at the time that this reorganization was a necessary point in the department’s technological evolution that marked a critical next step to help integrate AI across the massive enterprise.
“Staheli comes to the CDAO from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory and has vast expertise in AI ethics and research, data analytics, and technology development,” Flaherty also told FedScoop.

At MIT, Staheli headed pursuits focusing on human-centered AI. 
She has master’s degrees in software engineering and human factors, and her main professional interests include human-AI interaction, explainable AI, decision science, autonomy, socio-technical systems, and user-centered design.
