			Tommie Expert: Generative AI’s Real-World Impact on Job Markets		

Posted on May 28, 2024Updated June 13, 2024 By Manjeet Rege, PhD and Hemachandran K., PhD 




Generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) is now an increasing concern throughout the world, with numerous sectors buzzing about its potential and the associated concerns about job displacement. This introductory examination will look at what gen AI is, its capabilities, and the causes for these developing worries. We will specifically look at how gen AI affects men and women differently, as well as if it has a disproportionate influence on people of color and minorities.


Understanding generative AI


Gen AI, a subclass of artificial intelligence, specializes in creating content, images, music and having human-like conversations. Computer-generated art and music have their origins in the mid-20th century, though the earliest examples were quite primitive. From the late 20th to the early 21st century, the field advanced much thanks to the advent of neural networks and deep learning. PixelCNN and WaveNet enable the generation of complex data sequences such as natural language and audio waveforms, whereas transformer-based architectures such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) have significantly improved the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.


Generative AI at work


In practice, gen AI is altering several industries with its diverse applications. In manufacturing, it improves design efficiency, predicts maintenance requirements, and guarantees strong quality control. It aids in the production, optimization and testing of software code. Financial services gain from its ability to develop investment plans, produce compliance documentation and improve client-investor interactions. Gen AI is critical in the media and entertainment sectors for content production, event highlighting and content management, enhancing both creative and decision-making processes.


As gen AI evolves, it is critical to consider its possible influence on diverse demographic groups to ensure that benefits are delivered equally while limiting any negative consequences on the workforce and society. The purpose of the article is to look beyond the initial enthusiasm about gen AI and objectively assess how it is affecting labor markets, positively and negatively. By examining its practical influence, we want to gain a better grasp of the potential and challenges that lie ahead in this new era of artificial intelligence.

Impact on job markets


The introduction of generative AI has significant consequences for labor markets across a variety of industries. This technology has the potential to increase efficiency and create new possibilities, but it also poses considerable dangers of job displacement, particularly in certain industries and positions.



Job displacement



The influence of AI on jobs highlights worries about job displacement, underlining the critical need for retraining. It emphasizes the importance of responding to technological advancements through continuing education, highlighting AI’s dual function in undermining existing professions while also increasing the need for new skills for future employment. Generative AI, in particular, excels at automating non-routine cognitive processes, creating a disruption risk across a wide range of vocations. According to a recent Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI has the potential to automate up to 300 million full-time jobs in the U.S. and Europe. Furthermore, a McKinsey analysis predicts that by 2030, generative AI would automate 29.5% of the hours performed in the U.S. economy, up from 21.5% now.




Figure 1: With generative AI added to the picture, 30% of hours worked today could be automated by 2030 (2).


Furthermore, a Forrester projection indicates that, while generative AI may result in the loss of 1.5% or 2.4 million U.S. employment by 2030, it is projected to affect or transform a considerably bigger chunk of 6.9% or 11.08 million jobs. This suggests a tendency toward work augmentation rather than outright replacement, emphasizing generative AI’s transformational rather than purely disruptive potential.



Vulnerable industries and roles



The industries and positions most vulnerable to the impact of generative AI include:



Clerical and administrative work: Generative AI can automate tasks such as data entry, document processing and customer service, jobs often overlooked by women.
Financial services: Roles such as investment analysis, compliance, and client-investor communication are all automated based on AI.
Software development: Generative AI can assist in code generation, optimization and testing, potentially impacting software engineering jobs.
Media and entertainment: Content creation, editing and management tasks can be streamlined by generative AI tools.




Differential impact on men versus women



The effect of generative AI on employment markets is not gender neutral. According to research, this technology’s displacement may have a disproportionate impact on women.



According to the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, 58.87 million women in the U.S. workforce work in occupations that are heavily reliant on generative AI technology. In comparison, the comparable figure for males is six out of 10, totaling over 48.62 million (10).
The International Labor Organization (ILO) predicts that 7.8% of women’s occupations in high-income nations might be automated, totaling around 21 million jobs. In comparison, 2.9% of employment in high-income nations held by males, or around 9 million positions, have the potential to be automated, as indicated in Figure 2.





Figure 2: International Labour Organization graph on jobs with automation potential (9)


Women are disproportionately concentrated in white-collar, cognitive positions that are susceptible to generative AI automation, with an estimated 79% of working women employed in at-risk occupations (3). Men, on the other hand, are more evenly parted across white-collar and blue-collar professions, and thus are less subjected to the disruptive effects of generative AI overall. Professions where higher proportions of women may be employed such as clerical work, health care, and teaching, are among the most susceptible to the automation affected by generative AI.


Without appropriate regulation, reskilling efforts, and a practical approach to changeover management, the increasing usage of generative AI has the potential to impair current gender discriminations in the labor market.

Demographic impacts of gen AI



Disproportionate impact on minorities and underrepresented groups



The advent of generative AI raises the possibility of extremely affecting minority and marginalized groups in the labor market. According to a McKinsey analysis, Blacks are overrepresented in positions that are at high risk of automation, with 24% working in such roles compared to 20% for whites (4). This gap underlines the possibility that generative AI will have a more severe impact on Black communities, exacerbating existing racial inequities.



Exacerbation of existing inequalities



The effect of generative AI on employment markets has the capacity to exacerbate existing inequality, markedly among women. According to a Euronews research, 79% of working women work in jobs with a high risk of automation, compared to 66% of males (3). This gender imbalance shows that the advent of generative AI may impair the current gender partition in the workforce.


A Worth Magazine report observed that, while the contrasts in generative AI acquaintance between men and women were less risky, men were still slightly more likely than women to work in jobs with “high exposure” (12.6% versus 11.2%) and “low exposure” (32% vs. 27.1%), while women were more likely than men to work in jobs with “moderate exposure” (61.6% vs. 55.4%) (5). This shows that women may be more susceptible to the disruptive impacts of generative AI in the labor market.



Risk of bias and inadequate diversity



The creation of generative AI systems includes the inherent danger of bias and inadequate diversity, potentially aggravating unfair imbalances in the workforce (6). Without broad participation in AI system design and development, biases that disproportionately affect minorities and marginalized groups are more likely to persist.


According to the McKinsey report, overcoming these difficulties will need a collaborative effort to guarantee that generative AI systems are built with inclusion, justice, and diversity in mind (4). This involves ensuring that the data used to train foundation models is objective, legitimate, and devoid of racial, ethnic, gender, and other biases. Additionally, improving and developing the pool of minority tech talent will aid to ensure that generative AI is developed and steered into the future by a miscellaneous talent base with various experiences and viewpoints.


The Euronews article also highlights the need of participatory design, which expects all stakeholders in generative AI applications, comprising end users and those affected by new uses, to be involved in the building of new AI products. This approach can assist to reduce the vulnerability of bias and lack of diversity in the creation of generative AI systems.

Strategies for mitigation and adaptation



Reskilling and upskilling the workforce



As generative AI continues to disrupt the job market, reskilling and upskilling the workforce will be important to cut down the disproportionate effect on minorities and marginalized groups (4). It is essential to provide workers with training and educational prospects to aid them gain new skills and amend to the changing employment landscape, especially those in high-risk jobs. This will enable workers to transition to roles that are less sensitive to automation while still leveraging the potential of generative AI to foster their productivity and value (5).



Policy and regulatory approaches



Policymakers and regulators must take positive measures to guarantee equal access and division of the advantages of generative AI. This encompasses enacting regulations that promote corporations to engage in reskilling and retraining programs, particularly for employees from underrepresented populations. Furthermore, legal frameworks should be created to address concerns of bias, transparency, and accountability in the development and deployment of generative AI systems. These strategies can assist to reduce the danger of aggravating current disparities in the labor market.



Diverse and inclusive AI development teams



Promoting diversity and inclusion in teams progressing general AI systems is necessary to reduce bias and ensure technology aid all sectors of society. By bringing together people from diverse backgrounds, with several experiences and perceptions, the development process can better address the needs and interests of underrepresented groups. This method can help design more equitable and inclusive AI applications that benefit all stakeholders.


Conclusion


This article offers an examination of how generative AI technology reshapes sectors, covering both potential and difficulties. As this technology improves, its promise to improve efficiency and creativity becomes obvious. However, it also offers major dangers of employment displacement, particularly for women and minority groups. The disproportionate concern on these populations emphasizes the critical need for comprehensive policies and reskilling efforts to decrease inequity. Positive efforts are required to ensure that the advantages of generative AI are distributed equitably, avoiding intensifying existing gaps and providing a workforce equipped for future technological landscapes. Maintaining diverse perspectives in AI research and deployment is also critical for excluding possible biases and creating an inclusive digital economy.

One of the most powerful features of language-based generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, or AWS Code Whisperer is the ability to create computer code.

After all, code is just another language – one that’s designed to be understandable by both humans and machines – and LLMs like GPT-4 are able to analyze, sequence and predict it just as they can with natural languages.


Automation, auto-complete and procedural generation of code have been part of the software engineering workflow for many years. But generative AI goes a step further by potentially automating the entire process, from code design to testing and debugging.

Does this mean that software developers are now redundant? Well, No! Human expertise will still be essential for creative problem-solving challenges and overcoming problems with AI that will likely be around for some time. Instead, I believe humans will leverage generative AI to speed up their work and help them develop new, more efficient solutions, making their skills even more valuable in business and industry.

PROMOTED
So, here’s an overview of how I believe the role of programmers and software engineers will evolve as these tools play an increasingly big role in their day-to-day activities.

Automated Code Generation
Software engineering can often involve repetitive, time-consuming tasks such as refactoring existing code, standardizing code structures and creating documentation.
With generative AI, code to carry out basic functions such as sorting lists or reading and processing data from APIs can be generated in seconds, dramatically reducing the time spent on these mundane but necessary tasks. This means developers can focus their time on more creative elements of their work, such as strategic design and creative problem-solving.
It can also suggest more streamlined ways to structure code and detect when sections of code may be redundant or use more resources than is necessary, helping programmers to create more efficient software.

While most AI-generated code is currently created through natural language processing, it’s also becoming possible to create code from images. For example, there are tools that make it possible to sketch up the outline for a tool or application as a visual representation, such as a flow chart, and have it converted into executable code.

Overall, I believe this will lead to software engineers spending less time writing code and more time creating solutions.
Faster Testing and Debugging
Testing and debugging are a vital but often time-consuming element of software development. Generative AI tools, particularly those such as Github Copilot, OpenAI Codex and AWS Codewhisperer that are fine-tuned for coding tasks, are great for automating test cases and identifying potential bugs before they cause problems. They can analyze code to predict where bugs are likely to pop up and assist in debugging by suggesting fixes on the fly.
Already, many developers are finding that this can reduce development cycles and help create more reliable and trustworthy software. It can even explain why bugs are occurring in natural human language, helping to educate coders to become better at their craft.
Coding Generative AI Applications 
Of course, generative AI applications are useful for many people besides coders – and it will most likely be coders who will be responsible for making them available to everyone else!
Generative AI lets us create tools and applications that provide customized experiences with a high level of personalization, meaning that software tools used by everyone from doctors and lawyers to artists and designers will become more powerful, easy-to-use and flexible.
Coders with machine learning expertise will be essential when it comes to fine-tuning and customizing generative AI models for specific industries and niche use cases. As more professionals become aware of the transformative potential of generative AI on their workflows, coders with the ability to integrate generative AI functionality into “traditional” software platforms and packages will find themselves very much in demand.
The Changing Role Of Software Engineers
As is true of many other professions, the fundamental role of software engineers, coders and developers will evolve as intelligent, generative tools become increasingly omnipresent.
Instead of laboriously writing code line by line, they may find their roles within organizations and society shifting to become more supervisory and strategic.
Coders will learn new and emerging skill sets like prompt engineering, allowing them to move beyond the traditional workflows of code generation and build using the new technologies that are becoming available.
This will mean developing the ability to critically evaluate and assess code generated by machines while also identifying tasks where human intervention remains essential.
There will also be a need to understand issues like AI ethics, security and regulation, to ensure they’re working in a way that’s both responsible and compliant with emerging ethical and legal frameworks.
Putting all of this together, we can conclude that these roles are likely to be transformed in profound ways. Beyond simply creating new ways to go about day-to-day tasks, it will require a rethink of the aptitudes, skillsets and personality traits that make a great software developer. Get it right, and it is likely they will become more productive, more efficient and more critical than ever to the business success of their organizations.

The ministry is seeking to work with a specialist provider to help fulfil an exploratory exercise to help understand how and where AI could play a role in triaging information

The Ministry of Justice is seeking to work with a supplier – on a pro bono basis – to continue exploring possible uses of generative artificial intelligence in triaging documents and information.
The MoJ’s Justice Digital team has issued a commercial notice seeking potential suppliers interested in supporting the ministry in delivering a “proof-of-concept process to explore methods for human-in-the-loop triage through GenAI”.
The ministry ultimately intends to work with one single provider on a project intended to help “understand if GenAI tools would be of any benefit to the triage system”.
The scope of the proof-of-concept process will include experimenting with the use of generative AI to fulfil two functions: “to automatically digitise and codify incoming documents including hand-written notes; and synthesise and triage that information against policy requirements to complete a first pass at eligibility checks to make faster and more informed decisions – but leaving the actual decision to the human”.

This exploration will use “a limited number of redacted example cases” and “no access to sensitive or personal data and no access to MoJ systems will be required”, according to the procurement notice.
The MoJ outlines that the aim of the of the exercise “is not to build a production-ready tool… [but] to help accelerate existing work, test and prove different solutions/tools, share learning to help inform future work and designs, and transfer skills back into the team throughout”.
The notice adds: “Justice Digital will be sharing with other teams the progress made to date with using AI Large Language Models. Throughout the duration of this project, Justice Digital will share the knowledge within internal teams who can carry on building on top of the deliverables, but also with the wider teams that that are interested in using these new tools.”
While the ministry may not have immediate intentions to implement an AI triage tool, potential partners are instructed that “we require tools and solutions explored to align to our standards and preferences… to enable ease of future development should we progress from the foundations identified in the exploration”.
Potential suppliers – who will not be paid for their work – have until 31 May to express their interest, with the MoJ’s chosen partner expected to work with the ministry over a two-month engagement, expected to begin next month.

In brief
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help improve work processes, yet they also carry the risks of liability, penalties, and reputational damage. Companies deploying AI must understand their responsibilities and obligations under the current regulatory frameworks within the EU and the anticipated requirements of the EU AI Act. Particularly for the HR department, it is prudent for HR managers to implement the following basic principles regarding AI.

Introduction of standardized AI rules
Before implementing AI, companies need to carefully plan their AI strategy and introduce internal company guidelines on AI. These guidelines should be set out in a corporate-wide AI policy and should include, among others, the following rules:

The use of AI should only be permitted following the completion of AI introductory training. Employees should only be allowed to continue using AI after completing AI training courses as prescribed by the company.
Employees may only use AI systems approved by the company and only for business purposes.
AI may only be used for certain tasks, e.g., creating tables and texts, revising presentations, summarizing articles, and creating LinkedIn posts.
Employees should ensure that end products or work results produced by AI are clearly labeled as being generated by AI.
Employees should not input business secrets, confidential information and personal data into the AI system.
Employees must check AI-generated content for accuracy and compliance with applicable laws. If they are unclear about whether the content is compliant, employees must seek the opinion of the legal department.
Employees using AI are required to consult with the legal department before publishing AI-generated content to ensure compatibility with IP rights, personal rights, and trademark rights.

Compliance with data protection
AI should only be used in the workplace if the company implements a comprehensive data security strategy. To be compliant with data protection laws, companies must take the following steps before implementing AI systems:

The company must assess the types of data categories that AI can process and ensure that the processing is based on a specific legal basis. For non-sensitive data, processing can usually be justified on grounds of legitimate interest. However, when processing sensitive data (e.g., health data, data on trade union membership, information on the origin or sexual orientation, etc.), the processing must be based on a regulation provided by law or a collective agreement (e.g., on the basis of payroll obligations or to fulfill reporting obligations to authorities) or alternatively be based on a works council agreement.
Furthermore, data processing via AI must serve a specific and legitimate purpose (e.g., organizing working timetables and shift schedules, organizing employee absences) and may only take place if necessary to achieve that purpose.
The company must also inform employees about the data that is being processed, the purpose of the data processing, the means used for the data processing, and the legal basis for the processing.
Depending on the technical capabilities of the AI system, the company must also carry out a data protection impact assessment. This is particularly necessary if the impact of AI on the workforce is difficult to assess.
When transferring employee data to third parties (e.g., the AI software is not hosted on the company’s local servers or if the company allows group companies to access employee data), the company is also obliged to agree terms with third parties on protecting customer and employee-related data. There are further obligations to consider when transferring data to third countries.
If AI systems enable automated decision-making in HR management, the company must ensure that the automated decision-making process is only a preliminary process and that the final decision is made by a human being.

In addition, employees can submit requests to the company for information about their personal data being processed. If necessary, employees can escalate their concerns to the data protection authority.
Compliance with the co-determination rights of the workforce

A company must obtain the works council’s consent via a works council agreement before implementing AI models.
Where there is no competent works council, a company needs to obtain the individual contractual consent of the employees if the AI system is invasive.
Where there is a competent works council, companies must proactively inform the works council about the following before using AI for the first time: the data categories of the processed employee data,.the software used, the specific programs installed, any evaluation and processing procedures (e.g., the possibility of linking, duplicating, changing data), and any recipients of this data.
Furthermore, the works council has a right to be consulted and advised on the health effects of the AI system on the workforce. The works council can also request access to the AI system.

Risks of non-compliance
Penalties: Employees can initiate a complaint against their employer for breaches of data protection obligations. If the data protection authority confirms the existence of violations, this may trigger administrative fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover, whichever is higher.
Damages and discrimination cases: Employees have the right to sue for damages if there are data protection violations and discriminatory AI results and to initiate discrimination proceedings before the authorities and courts.
Injunctions: In the event of non-compliance with co-determination rights, the works council can enforce the deactivation of the AI system via a court ruling, in some cases even via a preliminary injunction.
Reputational damage: Companies will not only be exposed to financial and legal risks. As proceedings before administrative authorities and courts are open to the public, it can also trigger reputational damage.
Recommendation
Several steps must be taken before implementing any AI systems to leverage their potential while ensuring HR compliance. These steps will also help organizations to prepare for their obligations under the EU AI Act. Not only is it necessary to introduce clear AI guidelines, but it is also vital to create awareness within the workforce regarding AI. This is the only way to prevent or at least reduce liability, penalties, and reputational damage. In addition, early engagement with the works council on the potential implementation of AI will help accelerate the implementation process of AI.

Could Artificial Intelligence Create Real Liability for Employers? Colorado Just Passed the First U.S. Law Addressing Algorithmic Discrimination in Private Sector Use of AI Systems (US)
By Gabrielle Martin on May 28, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, Colorado, Discrimination, Employment Law



On May 17, 2024, Colorado became the first U.S. state to pass a law aimed at protecting consumers from harm arising out of the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems. Senate Bill 24-205, or the “CAIA,” is designed to regulate the private-sector use of AI systems and will impose obligations on Colorado employers, including affirmative reporting requirements. The CAIA, which will take effect on February 1, 2026, applies to Colorado businesses that use AI systems to make, or that are used as a substantial factor in making, employment decisions.
While President Biden has released an executive order on the development and use of AI, there is no comprehensive federal legislation regulating the use of AI systems. Despite signing the bill into law, Colorado Governor Jared Polis released a signing statement expressing his reservations with the CAIA and encouraging the legislature to improve upon the law before it takes effect. Colorado employers should monitor for guidance on and amendments to the CAIA, in addition to preparing for compliance.
What Employers Need to Know
The CAIA imposes a duty of reasonable care on developers (i.e., creators) and deployers (i.e., users) of high-risk AI systems to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. Although the law does not exclusively regulate employers, high-risk AI systems include AI systems that make, or are a substantial factor in making, employment-related decisions.  The law provides a narrow exemption for businesses with less than fifty employees that do not use their own data to train the AI system.
Under the CAIA, “algorithmic discrimination” means any condition in which the use of an AI system results in differential treatment or impact that disfavors a consumer or group of consumers on the basis of characteristics protected under federal law or Colorado law, including age, color, ethnicity, disability, national origin, race, religion, veteran status, and sex.
The law creates a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care if a deployer takes certain compliance steps, including:

Risk-management policy and program.  Deployers must adopt a risk-management policy and program meeting certain defined criteria. The risk-management policy and program must be regularly reviewed and updated, as well as reasonable in consideration of various listed factors.
Impact assessment.  Deployers must also complete annual impact assessments for high-risk AI systems.  An impact assessment must include, at a minimum, a statement of the purpose, intended use, and benefits of the system, an analysis of whether the system poses known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination and a description of how the deployer mitigates those risks, a summary of the data processed as inputs and outputs of the system, an overview of the categories of data, if any, the deployer used to customize the system, any metrics used to evaluate the performance and known limitations of the system, a description of transparency measures taken, including any measures taken to disclose the use of the system to consumers and a description of the post-deployment monitoring and user safeguards provided concerning the system.
Notices. The CAIA also requires deployers to provide various notices to consumers (i.e., Colorado residents). Prior to using an AI system to make employment-related decisions, employers must inform applicants that an AI system will be used and disclose the purpose of the system, the nature of the decision(s) the system may make, and a plain-language description of the system. Additionally, for an applicant adversely affected by the decision of an AI system, the employer must provide the principal reason(s) for the adverse decision, an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data used by the AI system, and an opportunity to appeal the adverse decision. A covered employer must also post in a “clear and readily available” manner on its website a notice of the types of AI systems that are currently deployed, the known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination, and the data collected and used by the deployer. Finally, deployers must disclose to Colorado’s attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination within their AI systems within 90 days after the discovery.

The law provides an affirmative defense in an enforcement action by the attorney general if a deployer (i) discovers and cures a violation as a result of feedback, adversarial testing or red teaming (as those terms are defined by the National Institute of Standards or Technology (NIST)), or an internal review process, and (ii) the deployer is otherwise compliant with the NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework or another internationally recognized framework for artificial intelligence management. Colorado’s attorney general has the exclusive authority to enforce the CAIA.
Although the CAIA is the first of its kind in the U.S., the law shares structural similarities to the Artificial Intelligence Act recently adopted by the European Union.  Acknowledging industry opposition, Governor Polis expressed in the signing statement his hope that the CAIA will be significantly improved upon before it takes effect and emphasized that “Colorado remains home to innovative technologies.” Colorado employers should continue monitoring for guidance on or amendments to the CAIA, as well as preparing for compliance.

KINGSTON, R.I. – May 28, 2024 – If you’ve heard the term deepfake, you may have some notion of how artificial intelligence can be used in communications. Earlier this year, a robocall purportedly of President Joe Biden discouraging voters from participating in the New Hampshire state primary prompted swift investigation by election officials as well as action by the Federal Communications Commission. More recently, TikTok announced its intention to label AI-generated content as the technology becomes more universal.
But how are professional communicators and public relations firms utilizing generative AI? And what are the ethical considerations for doing so? That’s what a new study from researchers at the University of Rhode Island, along with industry partner and independent public relations agency MikeWorldWide, aims to discover. The study, made possible through a $10,000 grant from The Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication at Penn State, will explore the drivers and barriers to the adoption of AI technology as well as perceptions of its ethical use.
“There is a lot of emerging technology available in the space of generative AI,” says Ammina Kothari, director of URI’s Harrington School of Communication and Media. “But when we talk about generative AI in the space of public relations, the types that apply very directly are things like image generation and cloning of voices.”
From a business perspective, she says, it’s much more cost-effective to utilize these types of technologies than creating a campaign that would involve purchasing images or hiring actors or photographers and paying for a shoot or recording session. However, ethical concerns remain.
“Use of AI technology in creative work is a growing trend and one I don’t think any company can completely avoid these days,” said Joon Kim, URI assistant professor of public relations and communication studies. “But an important question is what firms disclose to their clients and how they communicate about its use.”
Kothari and Kim agree that it is important that clients understand what they are paying for. There are also concerns about how an artist’s work may be co-opted by generative AI platforms. The two also note the similarity between tools and how the tools collect data to generate output.
“By their nature, PR and ad campaigns should be unique,” says Kothari. “So, if you are replacing what is – essentially – a very human contribution, and companies are using the same or similar tools, how do you differentiate?”
“AI will drive an array of evolutions for the public relations industry, from reporting, gathering insights and curating content,” says Bret Werner, president of MikeWorldWide and a URI alumnus. “However, what makes a successful PR strategy is its inherent understanding of connecting with audiences, which cannot be lost. By leveraging our own client partners and employees, we’ll unearth the industry’s view, acceptance, and concerns around this technology wave we find ourselves on.”
Research will commence this summer with a field study that will include in-depth interviews and research on industry use of generative AI tools, its challenges and ethical issues surrounding its use, which will help form the basis of a broader survey of public relations practitioners. Additionally, the team will develop and field a second survey of public relations clients and potential clients to ascertain their understanding of generative AI and perception of its use for strategic communication.
Study findings will provide a fuller picture of AI use in the public relations industry and client perceptions and uncover any disconnect between the two. Additionally, knowledge gained as to challenges and ethical issues surrounding its use will provide practitioners with insights that will help to pave the way for more effective, ethical, and transparent communication.

Large language models (LLMs) are the latest example of that. These powerful subsets of AI are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.According to a report by LinkedIn, 55% of its global members may experience some degree of change in their jobs due to the rise of AI.Knowing how AI and LLMs will disrupt the job market is critical for businesses and employees to adapt to the change and remain competitive in the rapidly growing technological environment.This article explores the impact of AI on jobs and how automation in the workforce will disrupt employment.Large Language Models: Catalysts for Job Market DisruptionAccording to Goldman Sachs, generative AI, and LLMs can potentially disrupt 300 million jobs shortly. They have also predicted that 50% of the workforce is at risk of losing jobs due to the integration of AI in business workflows.LLMs are increasingly automating tasks previously considered the sole domain of human workers.  For instance, LLMs, trained on vast repositories of prior interactions, can now answer product inquiries, generating accurate and informative responses.This reduces the workload of human staff and allows for faster, 24/7 customer service. Moreover, LLMs constantly evolve, going well past customer services and being utilized in various applications, such as content development, translation, legal research, software development, etc.Large Language Models and Generative AI: AutomationLLMs and generative AI are becoming increasingly prevalent, which could lead to partial automation and the potential displacement of some workers while creating opportunities for others.1. Reshaping Routine TasksAI and LLMs excel at handling repetitive tasks with defined rules, such as data entry, appointment scheduling, and generating basic reports.This automation allows human workers to focus on more complex tasks but raises concerns about job displacement. As AI and LLMs become more capable of automating routine tasks, the demand for human input decreases, consequently triggering job displacement. However, jobs that require a high degree of human oversight and input will be the least affected.2. Industries at Automation RiskSectors with a high volume of routine tasks, like manufacturing and administration, are most susceptible to AI and LLM automation. Due to their ability to streamline operations like data entry and production line scheduling, LLMs are a risk to jobs in these sectors.SourceAccording to the Goldman Sachs report, AI automation will transform the workforce with efficiency and productivity while also putting millions of routine and manual jobs at high risk.3. Potential Loss of Low-Skilled JobsThe impact of AI on the low-skilled workforce is expected to grow in the future. ​The skill-biased nature of AI-driven automation has made it more difficult for those with less technical knowledge to grow in their employment. This is because automation widens the gap between high and low-skilled workers.Low-skilled workers can only retain their jobs through high-quality education, training, and reskilling programs. They may also face difficulty transitioning to newer, higher-paying, and high-skilled jobs that use AI technologies.This becomes more evident as the latest McKinsey report predicts that low-wage workers are 14 times more likely to need a job switch. Without upskilling or transitioning to new, AI-compatible roles, they risk being left behind in a rapidly evolving job market.4. Role of AI and LLMs in Streamlining ProcessesA significant shift occurs within the business landscape due to the growing adoption of AI and LLMs. A recent report from Workato reveals a compelling statistic: operations teams automated a remarkable 28% of their processes in 2023.AI and LLMs are game-changers, reducing operating costs, streamlining tasks through automation, and improving service quality.The Future of Work in the Age of AIWhile AI is inevitable, with enough resources and sufficient training, employees can use AI and LLMs to increase productivity in their daily routine tasks.For instance, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) states that customer support agents using a generative AI (GPT) tool increased their productivity by around 14%. This shows the potential of collaboration between humans and machines.While AI undoubtedly changes the job market, its integration should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.  The true potential lies in the collaboration between human intuition, creativity, and empathy combined with AI's analytical prowess.Reskilling For LLMs and Generative AIWhile GPT could generate texts and images, its successors, like GPT-4o, seamlessly process and generate content across text, audio, images, and video formats.This shows that the new multi-modal LLMs and AI technologies are evolving rapidly. Reskilling becomes essential for both modern organizations and workers to survive due to the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of jobs. Some of the important skills include:Prompts Engineering: LLMs rely on prompts to guide their outputs. Learning how to create clear and concise prompts will be a key factor in achieving their true potential.Data fluency: The ability to work with and understand data is essential. This covers collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, influencing your interaction with LLMs.AI literacy: Foundational knowledge about AI, including its capabilities and limitations, will be essential for effective collaboration and communication with these powerful tools.Critical thinking and evaluation: While LLMs can be impressive, assessing their outputs is important. Assessing, updating, and analyzing the LLM's work is essential.Ethical Implications of AI in the WorkplaceThe presence of AI in the workplace has its pros and cons, which must all be carefully considered. The former, of course, increases productivity and reduces costs. However, if adopted detrimentally can also have adverse effects.Here are some ethical considerations that need to be part of the larger narrative:Algorithmic Bias and Fairness: AI algorithms have the potential to reinforce biases found in the data they are trained on, which could result in unfair recruitment decisions.Employee Privacy: AI relies on vast amounts of employee data, raising concerns about potentially misusing this information, which could lead to unemployment.Inequality: The increased use of AI in workflows presents challenges like inequality or inaccessibility. Initiatives like upskilling and reskilling programs can help reduce AI's negative impacts on employees across organizations.Workplace paradigms are shifting as a result of AI and LLMs integration. This will greatly impact the future of work and careers.For further resources and insights on AI and data science, explore Unite.ai.

However, America may begin to pull away with the opportunities on the strength of three differentiators: its broader base of private-sector tech companies, that sector’s momentum in AI innovation and Washinton’s relatively lighter touch with technology regulation compared with the more cautious climates in Brussels and London. These are among the key insights ascertained from a reading of a McKinsey Global Institute report posted May 21.“Amid tightening labor markets and a slowdown in productivity growth, Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand spurred by AI and automation,” the McKinsey experts write. “Our updated modeling of the future of work finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, and other high-skill professions [will] rise, while demand for occupations such as office workers, production workers, and customer service representatives [will] decline.”Projecting that as much as 30% of current hours worked may be automated by the end of this decade—thanks largely to generative AI—McKinsey advises watching for shifts in employment demand to soon enough become the new normal. Here are five highlights from an online summary of the full report. 1. Demand will change for a range of occupations through 2030, including growth in STEM- and healthcare-related occupations, among others. Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand spurred not only by AI and automation but also by efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging population, infrastructure spending, technology investments and growth in e-commerce, the May 21 report states. More: ‘Our analysis finds that demand for occupations such as health professionals and other STEM-related professionals [will] grow by 17% to 30% between 2022 and 2030.’2. Automation boosted by generative AI will force millions of occupational transitions by 2030.  McKinsey’s economic modeling suggests that roughly 20% of hours worked could be automated even without gen AI, “implying a significant acceleration,” the authors write. By 2030, they project, Europe could require up to 12 million occupational transitions, affecting 6.5% of current employment. In the United States, required transitions could reach almost 12 million, affecting 7.5% of current employment. ‘Unlike Europe, this magnitude of transitions is broadly in line with the prepandemic norm.’3. Organizations will need a major skills upgrade. The occupational transitions noted above herald substantial shifts in workforce skills in a future in which automation and AI are integrated into the workplace, the authors remark. Demand for social and emotional skills could rise by 11% in Europe and by 14% in the United States, they add. ‘Underlying this increase is higher demand for roles requiring interpersonal empathy and leadership skills. These skills are crucial in healthcare and managerial roles in an evolving economy that demands greater adaptability and flexibility.’4. Retraining will be key to supplying needed skills and adapting to the new work landscape. Executives surveyed by McKinsey for the May report tend to worry they won’t be able to find the right skills by 2030. More than 25% of respondents believe failing to capture needed skills “could directly harm financial performance and indirectly impede efforts to leverage value from AI.” To acquire the skills they need, McKinsey points out, organizations have three main options—retraining, hiring and contracting. ‘Executives are looking at all three options, with retraining the most widely reported tactic planned to address the skills mismatch. On average executives so inclined said they would retrain 32% of their workforce.’5. Enhancing human capital at the same time as deploying technology could boost annual productivity growth. Organizations and policy makers have choices to make. The way they approach AI and automation, along with human capital augmentation, will affect economic and societal outcomes, the McKinsey report authors comment. “Making full use of the advantages on offer from technology,” they emphasize, “will require paying attention to the critical element of human capital.” The authors conclude: ‘In the best-case scenario, workers’ skills will develop and adapt to new technological challenges. Achieving this goal in our new technological age will be highly challenging—but the benefits will be great.’The executive summary includes a link to a PDF of the full report.  Related reading:The only thing to fear from AI in healthcare is fear of AI in healthcare itself Large language models, other GenAI options stimulating tech purchasing in healthcare GenAI-focused market researchers: ‘The payer–provider divide is wide and has dangerous implications’ Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

Leadership is important, but so is efficiency — and cost-cutting.Listen to this article · 8:40 min Learn moreShare full article307VideoCreditCredit...Steph RamplinBy David StreitfeldReporting from San FranciscoMay 28, 2024Leer en españolAs artificial intelligence programs shake up the office, potentially making millions of jobs obsolete, one group of perpetually stressed workers seems especially vulnerable.These employees analyze new markets and discern trends, both tasks a computer could do more efficiently. They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions — and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine?Finally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable.The chief executive is increasingly imperiled by A.I., just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites.This is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an A.I. leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise.A.I. has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put $29 billion last year into generative A.I. and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership.“In struggling companies, you’ll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,” said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, “the change delivered by A.I. in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.”Chief executives themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect — or maybe just fatalistic.EdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc., surveyed hundreds of chief executives and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called “a small monetary incentive” to do so.The response was striking. Nearly half — 47 percent — of the executives surveyed said they believed “most” or “all” of the chief executive role should be completely automated or replaced by A.I. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age.When Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of M.I.T.’s Computer Science and A.I. Lab, first saw the 47 percent, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely.“My first instinct is they would say, ‘Replace all the employees but not me,’” he said. “But I thought more deeply and would say 80 percent of the work that a C.E.O. does can be replaced by A.I.”That includes writing, synthesizing, exhorting the employees. More subtly, A.I. — if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising — will democratize the job of top management even while scaling it back.“There used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,” Mr. Agarwal said. “Then the calculator came along and was the great equalizer. I believe A.I. will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be C.E.O.”Working for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase “robot-boss” was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support.“Remember,” the robot-boss says, “my photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don’t try to get away.”Many science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42 percent said they would be “comfortable” taking orders from a computer.Long before the current A.I. boom, Jack Ma, then the chief executive of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years “a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best C.E.O.” He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger.The Chinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an “A.I.-driven rotating C.E.O.” named Tang Yu in 2022. “We believe A.I. is the future of corporate management,” said the company’s founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon’s move into the “metaverse-based working community.”Tang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon’s management team, but the company announced last month that she had won “the coveted title of ‘China’s Best Virtual Employee of the Year’” at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon’s A.I. employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says.On the other side of the world, the upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an A.I. humanoid C.E.O., Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was “devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization’s best interests.”Executives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend — if only to deny it — but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a “contact us” prompt received no reply.A.I. experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression.“We’ve always outsourced effort. Now we’re outsourcing intelligence,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global A.I. practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that “while you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership.”For one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. “A.I. may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,” said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. “At what point does it become culpable for a mistake?”“Never” was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline’s site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives — including a chatbot.The judge ruled against the airline and in favor of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company’s arguing that its own A.I. could not be trusted did not bode well for A.I. management teams. Air Canada declined to comment.Much of the discussion over the last year about A.I. in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs — without, of course, letting their jobs become A.I. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers.Now the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers.“Someone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,” said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. “In that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.”The pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It’s just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn’t have a person at the other end of it.“Some people like the social aspects of having a human boss,” Ms. Moore said. “But after Covid, many are also fine with not having one.”David Streitfeld writes about technology and the people who make it and how it affects the world around them.

Sinequa Augments Companies with Release of New Generative AI Assistants




Combining Sinequa’s Search with GenAI provides the ultimate AI Assistant and virtual coworker






May 30, 2024 07:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK & PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AI-powered search provider Sinequa announced today the availability of Sinequa Assistants, new enterprise-grade generative AI assistants that seamlessly integrate with all enterprise content and applications to augment and transform knowledge work. Sinequa’s new generative AI Assistants empower employees to work more efficiently, effectively and creatively, allowing them to accelerate and improve decisions, devote more time to strategic initiatives and drive business success.


“By 2027, GenAI will augment 30% of all knowledge workers’ tasks, from 0% in 2023.”Post this

Generative AI (GenAI) is poised for rapid adoption. According to Gartner, “By 2027, GenAI will augment 30% of all knowledge workers’ tasks, from 0% in 2023.” (1) As organizations have grappled with how to reliably use generative AI in business, Sinequa’s Assistants demonstrate that combining search with GenAI in a technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables the next generation of AI-augmented knowledge work. Sinequa’s unique Neural Search is the perfect complement to GenAI and provides the foundation for Sinequa’s Assistants. Its capabilities go far beyond RAG’s conventional search-and-summarize paradigm to intelligently execute complex, multi-step activities, all grounded in facts to augment the way employees work. Assistants automate tedious tasks and streamline work processes with added insights for better results, improved quality, and a more satisfying work experience.


Unlike other AI assistants or copilots that lack secure access to the full scope of all enterprise content, Sinequa’s Assistants leverage any and all company content and knowledge to generate contextually-relevant insights and recommendations, while ensuring privacy and data governance. Optimized for scale with three custom-trained small language models (SLMs) for the best relevance at low cost, Sinequa Assistants ensure accurate conversational responses on any internal topic, complete with citations and full traceability to the original source.


Sinequa Assistants work with any public or private generative LLM, including Cohere, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure Open AI, Mistral and others, allowing companies to choose which LLMs best meet their needs while controlling costs. The Sinequa Assistant framework powers a range of ready-to-go Assistants along with tools to define custom Assistant workflows so that customers can use an Assistant out of the box, or tailor and manage multiple Assistants from a single platform. These Assistants can be tailored to fit the needs of specific business scenarios and deployed and updated quickly without code or additional infrastructure. Some of the domain-specific Assistants available include:



The Augmented Scientist empowers research teams to converse with scientific content from an ever-increasing number of data sources to speed up clinical trials, drug development and streamline Research & Development (R&D) processes.



The Augmented Engineer empowers design teams with a unified view of projects, products, and parts and the ability to construct and search across a digital thread.



The Augmented Lawyer gives lawyers and paralegals powerful self-service research capabilities across all case files and information through a time-saving AI search.



The Augmented Asset Manager empowers financial asset managers and advisors to leverage valuable insight from contracts, portfolio history and documents.



All of the Assistants are powered by Sinequa’s search platform, combining the most accurate and performant hybrid search technology and three custom SLMs. A flexible Assistant framework makes it easy to define custom workflows informed by search and combine that with any generative AI model, whether commercial, private, or open source.


“To better capitalize on the feedback following production incidents in our refineries, we implemented JAFAR (Jenerative AI for Availability REX), a new search app designed to streamline information retrieval in TotalEnergies' knowledge databases. Powered by Sinequa's search engine/RAG combined with generative AI, JAFAR enhances decision-making by analyzing documents and providing recommendations,” said Aude Giraudel, Head of Smart Search Engines, TotalEnergies. (2)


While most companies are still experimenting with basic search-and-summarize RAG, Sinequa has gone much further with Assistants that take RAG to the next level. Sinequa’s Assistants execute multi-step workflows to accomplish complex tasks with reasoning, incorporating RAG as needed to fully leverage corporate knowledge. This ensures that the Assistant responds accurately, transparently, and securely, with the most up-to-date information, including inline citations to original sources and immediate traceability – and access – to those sources.


“Sinequa has been investing in Artificial Intelligence and leading Enterprise Search for the last 20 years thanks to our unmatched connectivity and scalability on enterprise content. Having pioneered the use of LLMs in search with our custom-trained SLMs, Sinequa is perfectly positioned to take search and RAG to the next level with the release of Sinequa’s Generative AI Assistants. This is an exciting time as our Assistants augment the way we work, empowering knowledge workers to deliver higher quality work in less time, and with greater confidence and lower mental stress. At Sinequa we are proud to support our customers in their GenAI transformation,” said Jean Ferré, CEO and Co-Founder of Sinequa.


As part of this paradigm shift and the unveiling of Sinequa’s virtual assistants, Sinequa has also launched a new brand identity and company website to reflect this new era of work augmented by Assistants informed by search and Sinequa’s role in advancing AI in the enterprise. AI is fundamentally transforming how work gets done, and represents a new world of opportunity for augmenting employees and businesses. For more information, visit www.sinequa.com.

Skip Ad                  Ad   “They obviously looked at my resume,” Brown said.She received an email from what she thought was Synterex, a well-known clinical and regulatory consulting firm specializing in agile methodology, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies.It stated, “We reviewed your resume for the Junior Recruiter at Synterex. We think you could be a good fit for the opportunity.”After filling out a few screening questions, she received an offer of $30 per hour and health benefits to work from home.Brown needed the money; she has a child and her husband had just suffered a severe stroke.“I was vulnerable at that time. It was hard for me. I was looking for a job,” Brown said.All she had to do was cash a check for nearly $5,000 to pay for a home office which could include a laptop. Even better – she received a follow-up letter that stated, “If you are able to work for the company for a period of 12-16 weeks, the materials automatically become yours.”She took the check to a local bank but got some bad news.“The bank figured out right away this was a scam,” Brown said. “The public needs to be aware of work-at-home scams.”INCREASE IN A.I. SCAMSAccording to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, nearly 15,000 people reported being victims of employment scams in 2022, with losses totaling more than $52 million.“It’s a lucrative scam,” Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said. The ITRC has seen a 545% increase in reports in January 2024 compared to December 2023. Velasquez said the quality of the fake checks and letters has improved because of artificial intelligence.“It doesn’t take any time, and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles. So, it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those A.I. generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails.Crooks use A.I. to scrape your personal information, then create and send a targeted attack.Another part of the scam can include links within the offer letter asking victims for more information. Clicking those links can download malware or steal your private information to use against you or sell on the dark web.HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELFAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, there are ways to protect yourself:Verify the job ad.Visit the official company website and apply there instead.Google the company with words like “scam,” “review,” or “complaint.”If a company sends you a check, asks you to deposit it, and return part of the money, it’s a scam.Synterex Statement:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be. It is disheartening, to say the least, to see applicants who are excited about the potential to work for these companies have their time and resources stolen, or worse. That’s why we are always working to elevate our digital security measures to combat this type of threat.”Download the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.Follow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW©2024 Cox Media Group",NewsArticle,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/05-29-2024/t_f3088088dc4148e8a5b5e680bc33559e_name_file_960x540_1200_v3_1_.jpg', 'height': 540, 'width': 960}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Boston25News.com Staff'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Boston 25 News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.boston25news.com/pf/resources/images/sites/cmg-tv-10020/station-logo-small.png?d=856', 'width': 270, 'height': 60}}",‘I was vulnerable’: Artificial intelligence work-from-home job scams targeting victims,2024-05-29T11:33:18.713Z,2024-05-29T11:33:18.859Z,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/i-was-vulnerable-artificial-intelligence-work-from-home-job-scams-targeting-victims/LLV2FQUE2ZHGPOM72K7IBE6LHY/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employers and job seekers are increasingly turning to generative AI (genAI) to to automate their search tasks, whether it’s creating a shortlist of candidates for a position or writing a cover letter and resume. And data shows it can improve the chances at getting that job or finding the perfect talent match.
For human resources and hiring managers who are seeing an increase in responsibilities, genAI can create a short list of potential candidates in seconds — and automate much of the onboarding process.
For job seekers, genAI tools like ChatGPT can not only become creative companions in crafting narratives and emails to potential employers, but even assist applicants in passing assessment tests.
 
 
 













 
 

“Recruiters and hiring managers are keenly aware that candidates are in on the AI game. If you type ‘write a software engineer cover letter’ into the ChatGPT tool, you will get a cover letter in less than one minute. The same is true if you request a specific resume. Presto, you will have a resume on the spot,” said Paula Bratcher Ratliff, CEO of Women Impact Tech, a non-profit community for women in technology fields.

The darker side to using AI in hiring is that it can bypass potential candidates based on predetermined criteria that don’t necessarily take all of a candidate’s skills into account or they can contain hidden biases based on how they were trained by their creators. And for job seekers, the technology can generate great-looking resumes, but often they’re not completely truthful when it comes to skill sets.
“The use of AI in talent acquisition is particularly prevalent in tech hubs and innovative industries where the demand for skilled professionals is high,” said Rick Hammell, founder and CEO of Helios, a workforce management platform startup. “The benefits and potential problems associated with using AI to find talent have global implications.”
 
 
 













 
 

Hammell and others see genAI offering improved recruitment outcomes, better candidate matching, and enhanced diversity and inclusion efforts. The challenges, however, include algorithmic bias, data privacy issues, and transparency.
“The need for transparent and ethical AI practices are concerns that organizations across different countries must address to ensure fair and unbiased hiring processes,” Hammell said.
GenAI aids job seekers with research, resumes, cover letters and more
A survey by Resume Builder updated earlier this month found that 18% of US workers used ChatGPT in their job search over the past year. The majority (75%) used it for research, but almost as many (73%) used it for resume creation. They also used the AI-powered bot for interview preparation (69%) and cover letter creation (62%), and more than half (51%) used it to create email communications.
 
 
 













 
 

The primary reasons job seekers used ChatGPT were to improve the quality of their application materials (88%), to appear more professional (76%), and to save time (65%).
Job seekers can leverage AI tools, from professional photo builders, interviewing techniques, best practices, and mock interview tools to simulate real interview situations, according to Ratliff. 
Some of the AI-tools that can be used to format your resume, include:MyPerfectResume: Professionally written content.ResumeGenius: Extensive library of templates.Enhancv: AI-powered resume analysis.Resumaker.ai: Targeted keyword optimization.Kickresume: LinkedIn data import option.Rezi: Real-time content analysis.
 
 
 













 
 

Resume Builder’s survey of 1,000 US workers actively engaged in a job search within the past year also found that ChatGPT users are more likely to negotiate higher salaries and get more frequent interview requests than those who did not use the tool.
About one-third of respondents (29%) said they did not get hired because the employer became aware of their use of ChatGPT in the hiring process. However, 55% said they their prospective employer “praised” their use of the technology in the job search process.
“My guess is that some employers think ChatGPT promotes lying or cheating, while others see the efficiency and better application materials. It really shouldn’t matter if someone is using ChatGPT, as long as they use their experiences to create the information for applications. If they are using it to pass assessments, that isn’t right,” Julia Toothacre, Resume Builder’s resume and career strategist said in a report.
 
 
 













 
 

Not surprisingly, younger job seekers were more likely to use the chatbots, with 24% of 18- to 24-year-olds, 21% of 25- to-34-year-olds, and 25% of 35- to-44-year-olds saying they used the tool. Only 9% of 45- to 54-year-olds used ChatGPT in the hiring process. Men were also more likely to say they used ChatGPT than women (25% vs. 10%), according to Resume Builder’s report.
“The numbers related to age discrepancies in ChatGPT use aren’t surprising for a few reasons,” the report stated. “First, younger generations have historically been more likely to embrace new technologies. Second, there are a lot of people on social media right now sharing their ChatGPT hacks for job searching, so I think it’s something that younger generations are learning about more rapidly. They are likely frustrated with the hiring process and want to try anything they can to get ahead of the competition.”
Gartner’s 2023 survey of nearly 3,000 job candidates from 13 countries in 24 industries and spanning 21 job functions found an even higher percentage of job seekers using genAI tools in their search. Among the 38% of respondents to the Q3 2023 survey who used generative AI, 43% reported using it to generate text for their resumes, and 42% used it to craft their cover letters.
 
 
 













 
 

Gartner
The Gartner survey also found:

Overall, those who used generative AI said it was responsible for a significant percentage of the final work.
A third of candidates try to optimize their resume for AI technologies.
Additionally, a third of candidates believe AI can introduce bias into the hiring process, while a similar number believe it can reduce bias.

Gartner
In some cases, employees also trust AI over their human managers to offer them career advice. Nearly half of Gen Z employees surveyed by an outplacement services firm Intoo indicated they’d trust a chatbot like ChatGPT for advice over their manager, who many said don’t support their career development.
GenAI automation helps overwhelmed hiring managers
On the hiring side, companies are adopting genAI to streamline their talent acquisition process. A recently published survey of 113 HR leaders by Gartner revealed HR technology as their top budget priority for the third consecutive year. Technology for “talent management” rose from seventh place last year to third this year.
 
 
 













 
 

A recent survey of 1,000 HR managers performed by payroll automation provider Sage showed that 95% of respondents have experienced a workload increase over the last year, and 91% noted an increase in their responsibilities. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents also believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize their work processes by reducing time-consuming tasks and ultimately easing burnout, according to the Sage survey.

Women Impact Tech’s Ratliff said there are many advantages to using AI in the hiring process. Some of the most advantageous uses are to screen resumes and schedule interviews. “These tasks used to take up the majority of a recruiter’s time. With continued talent shortages in IT, specifically, time to hire, it can be costly,” she said.
“Top talent will be employed by the most efficient companies. Thus, companies use AI to create job descriptions and postings and match the candidates whose skills best align with those job descriptions,” Ratliff continued. “In addition to screening resumes and sourcing candidates across various social media sites and job boards, we’re seeing a trend in automating communication.  GenAI can help create templatized emails for personalized candidate outreach.  We’re even seeing a growing trend in chatbots conducting preliminary interviews.”
 
 
 













 
 

One of the most promising outcomes of AI-supported hiring practices is the potential to mitigate bias, Ratliff said, because both conscious and unconscious human bias can significantly impact decision-making when hiring talent. 
“By concealing demographic information such as name, age, race, and gender, AI algorithms can help create equal opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups, considering that women currently make up only about 28% of the workforce,” she said. “However, there have been instances in top tech companies where the machine learning specialist who built the candidate screening system favored male candidates.”
In one instance, an AI algorithm disqualified women from the hiring process by ‘learning’ that the most common resumes were men, simply based on the statistics of more applicants being male than female. “We’ve made significant strides since these earlier AI tools, but employers must ensure the quality of the data used to train AI models to avoid such biases,” she said.
 
 
 













 
 

Betsy Summers, a principal analyst in Forrester Research’s Future of Work practice, said while properly trained AI can mitigate discrimination, she also agreed with Ratliff that the tech can often exacerbate problems of bias because “it’s an algorithm built by humans with biases, and learns from human supplied data.”
Summers pointed to “an alarming data point” from a study by The Society for Human Resource Management that revealed only two in five employers say their vendor is very transparent about the steps taken to ensure AI tools protect against bias.
While AI tools simplify arduous tasks for hiring managers and others, the objective should never be to eliminate human judgment from the process, Ratliff said. Instead, the focus for the tech should be to expedite hiring times and support recruiters in making the most informed decisions possible. 
 
 
 













 
 

“A recruiter’s role is pivotal in this process, as their judgment is irreplaceable,” she added.
More HR vendors and others are now offering AI-powered platforms to automate the creation of potential job candidate lists for hiring managers who are tasked with culling from lists of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of job candidates.

HR technology company Phenom, for example, sells an AI-enabled hiring platform that creates a shortlist of job candidates for recruiters and hiring managers. Its technology, which the company claims is used by 200,000 hiring managers, creates a candidate list based on skills, experience, and location using “fit” scores, an assessment to evaluate a candidate’s suitability for a specific role and company.
 
 
 













 
 

“It streamlines interview scheduling for hiring teams, interviewers, and candidates through automation. It additionally enables hyper-personalized interactions with candidates, employees, and alumni through generative AI,” said John Harrington, senior director of product marketing at Phenom.
For job seekers, Phenom’s tool uses a semantic search engine that scans career websites to help candidates identify relevant job opportunities through context-driven algorithms, according to Harrington.
Startup Eightfold AI recently announced its AI-powered applicant tracking system (ATS) that handles the recruitment process for companies from end-to-end. The tool is also aimed at streamlining the recruitment process, enabling organizations to quickly identify and secure top talent through AI-powered recommendations. The Eightfold Talent Tracking tool also generates job descriptions, recommends job-posting platforms, and handles pre-onboarding integrations.
 
 
 













 
 

Iffi Wahla, CEO of startup Edge, a network that connects companies with remote talent around the world, believes AI bot tech — including OpenAI’s new ChatGPT-4o — will be used more often by companies to screen candidates. It will also increasingly be used by job seekers to write resumes, fill out applications, and prepare for interviews. And users of AI tech, he said, are likely to get more frequent interview requests than those who don’t use it.

Wahla believes that use of genAI by job seekers will leap from Resume Builder’s 18% figure last year to 50% of candidates this year. From 70% to 80% of Edge’s prospects who are registered with his talent network admit to using AI to help them craft resumes and other materials, Wahla said.
The Edge talent network’s AI-powered platform is currently serving the medical, dental, and insurance industries, helping them find talent to fill open positions while also automating onboarding processes. It can also handle remote workforce management for HR, functions like benefits administration, payroll management, and vacation oversight to ensuring legal compliance and handling taxes.
For companies, the time spent onboarding new employees after adoption Edge’s platform was reduced by 70%, Wahla said. The AI handles user questions, so there’s not as much back and forth with the recruiters or hiring managers, and it can also walk new employees through the steps of onboarding.
 
 
 













 
 

Job seekers, use genAI judiciously
What may be an issue is when chatbots craft resumes that aren’t particularly honest about the job seeker’s actual skills, embellishing on their talents because that’s what the AI was trained to do.
“Job seekers should definitely use AI to help them with the job search process, but it needs to be utilized with caution,” said Resume Builder’s Toothacre. The problem, she explained, is that AI is pulling its information from what is online, and not all advice and information is accurate.
Not all hiring managers and executives are enamored with the idea that AI is crafting a job applicant’s online persona and skill set.
“Any applicant using ChatGPT or other generative AI to pass assessments or write a cover letter would be a hard pass for me. I think it’s totally fine to use for interview practice or to generate ideas. But any time you are substituting the work of an AI for your own organic work, that’s where it crosses a line for me,” Andre Kazimierski, CEO of house painting business Improovy, told Resume Builder.
Job seekers need to make sure that whatever AI drafts for them, it makes sense for their experience and job function. “AI can sound too generic at times, so this is where putting your eyes on it is helpful,” Toothacre said. 
She is also concerned about the use of AI to complete assessments. “Skills-based assessments are in place to ensure you are qualified and check your knowledge. Using AI to help you pass those assessments is lying about your experience and highly unethical.”
There’s plenty of evidence that genAI can improve resume quality, increase visibility in online job searches, and provide personalized feedback on cover letters and resumes. However, concerns about overreliance on AI tools, lack of human touch in resumes, and the risk of losing individuality and authenticity in applications are universal issues that candidates need to be mindful of regardless of their geographical location, according to Helios’ Hammell.
“Encouraging a balanced approach that combines AI assistance with personalization and creativity is essential for job seekers navigating the global job market,” Hammell said.
Forrester Research’s Summers said many recruiters and HR functions have been leveraging AI for at least a decade, automating processes, personalizing action recommendations based on machine learning, and analyzing language for sentiment. But genAI represents a “huge change,”  she said.
“And based on our data, the broader HR function didn’t prioritize AI in the past, which sets them up for a steep learning curve,” Summers said.
According to a Forrester survey in 2021, only 28% of HR professionals reported that AI was in their list of priorities. Only 19% of HR leaders were confident in their function’s AI capabilities, and only 32% of them said they were investing in skill development for their teams on AI and automation. 
“Building AI confidence and capability doesn’t happen overnight, so HR has to make up for the lack of prioritization,” Summers said. “The biggest impediment to incorporating AI into recruiting use cases is the mismatch between how AI works and what recruiters expect from their technology. AI learns and improves over time, with adoption and use. But expecting recruiters to enroll in that new way of interacting with technology is a tall order.”

How California and the EU work together to regulate artificial intelligence



Tuesday, May 28, 2024
| Sacramento, CA 

















Gerard de Graaf, senior envoy for digital to the U.S. and head of the European Union office in San Francisco, speaks in Brussels on April 3, 2019.Nuno Rodrigues/European Union



By Khari Johnson, CalMatters
While the federal government appears content to sit back and wait, more than 40 U.S. states are considering hundreds of AI regulation bills. 
California, with its status as a tech-forward state and huge economy, has a chance to lead the way. So much so, in fact, that the European Union is trying to coordinate with the state on AI laws. The EU opened an office in San Francisco in 2022 and dispatched a tech envoy, Gerard de Graaf, to better communicate about laws and regulations around AI. 
We are living through what de Graaf calls “the year of AI.” De Graaf and deputy head of the EU office in San Francisco Joanna Smolinska told CalMatters that if California lawmakers pass AI regulation in the coming months, the state can emerge as a standard bearer for the regulation of AI in the United States. In other words: California’s laws could influence the future of AI as we know it.
Last month, de Graaf traveled to Sacramento to speak with several state lawmakers key to AI regulation: 

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat, is author of a bill that requires businesses and state agencies report results of AI model tests in an effort to prohibit automated discrimination 
Democratic State Sen. Scott Wiener from San Francisco is author of a bill to regulate generative AI 
Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an East Bay Democrat, is author of a bill that would require online platforms put watermarks on images and videos generated by AI sometimes referred to as deepfakes ahead of elections this fall 
And Sen. Tom Umberg, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was referred to by Politico as the “California’s chief gatekeeper for AI rules.” 

The meeting to discuss the bills was at least the sixth trip de Graaf or other EU officials made to Sacramento in two months. EU officials who helped write the AI Act and EU Commission Vice President Josep Fontelles also made trips to Sacramento and Silicon Valley in recent weeks.
This week, EU leaders ended a years-long process with the passage of the AI Act, which regulates use of artificial intelligence in 27 nations. It bans emotion recognition at school and in the workplace, prohibits social credit scores such as the kind used in China to reward or punish certain kinds of behavior and some instances of predictive policing. The AI Act applies high risk labels for AI in health care, hiring, and issuing government benefits.
There are some notable differences between the EU law and what California lawmakers are considering. The AI Act addresses how law enforcement agencies can use AI, while Bauer-Kahan’s bill does not, and Wicks’ watermarking bill could end up stronger than AI Act requirements. But the California bills and the AI Act both take a risk-based approach to regulation, both advise continued testing and assessment of forms of AI deemed high risk, and both call for watermarking generative AI outputs.
“If you take these three bills together, you’re probably at 70-80% of what we cover in the AI Act,” de Graaf said. “It’s a very solid relationship that we both benefit from.”
In the meeting, de Graaf said they discussed draft AI bills, AI bias and risk assessments, advanced AI models, the state of watermarking images and videos made by AI, and which issues to prioritize. The San Francisco office works under the authority of the EU delegation in Washington D.C. to promote EU tech policy and strengthen cooperation with influential tech and policy figures in the United States.
Artificial intelligence can make predictions about people including what movies they want to watch on Netflix or the next words in a sentence, but without high standards and continuous testing, AI that makes critical decisions about people’s lives can automate discrimination. AI has a history of harming people of color, such as police use of face recognition, deciding whether to grant an apartment or home mortgage application. The technology has a demonstrated ability to adversely affect the lives of most people, including women, people with disabilities, the young, the old, and people who apply for government benefits.
In a recent interview with KQED, Umberg talked about the importance of striking a balance, insisting “We could get this wrong.” Too little regulation could lead to catastrophic consequences for society, and too much could “strangle the AI industry” that calls California home.

Coordination between California and EU officials attempts to combine regulatory initiatives in two uniquely influential markets.
The majority of the top AI companies are based in California, and according to startup tracker Crunchbase, for the past eight months, companies in the San Francisco Bay Area raised more AI investment money than the rest of the world combined.
The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, is the European Union’s best known legislation for privacy protection. It also led to coinage of the term “the Brussels effect,” when enforcement of a single law leads to outsized influence in other countries. In this case, the EU law forced tech companies to adopt stricter user protections if they wanted access to the region’s 450 million residents. That law went into effect in 2018, the same year that California passed a similar law. More than a dozen U.S. states followed suit.
Defining AI
Coordination is necessary, de Graaf said, because technology is a global industry and it’s important to avoid policy that makes it complicated for businesses to comply with rules around the world. 
One of the first steps to working together is a shared definition of how to define artificial intelligence so you agree on what technology is covered under a law. De Graaf said his office worked with Bauer-Kahan and Umberg on how to define AI “because if you have very different definitions to start with then convergence or harmonization is almost impossible.”
Given the recent passage of the AI Act, the absence of federal action, and the complexity of regulating AI, the Senate Judiciary staff lawyers held numerous meetings with EU officials and staff, Umberg told CalMatters in a statement. The definition of AI used by the California Senate Judiciary committee is informed by a number of voices including federal agencies, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the EU.
“I strongly believe that we can learn from each other’s work and responsibly regulate AI without harming innovation in this dynamic and quickly-changing environment” Umberg told CalMatters in a written statement.
The trio of bills discussed with de Graaf in April passed their respective houses this week. He suspects questions from California lawmakers will get more specific as bills move closer to adoption. 
California lawmakers proposed more than 100 bills to regulate AI in the current legislative session. 
“I think what is now the imperative for the Legislature is to whittle the bills down to a more manageable number,” he said. “I mean, there’s over 50 so that we focused particularly on the bills to these assembly members or senators themselves.” 
State agency also seeks to protect Californians’ privacy
Elected officials and their staff aren’t the only ones speaking with EU officials. The California Privacy Protection Agency — a state agency made to protect people’s privacy and require businesses comply with data deletion requests — also speaks regularly with EU officials, including de Graaf.
Most states with privacy protection laws rely on state attorneys general for enforcement. California is the only state with an independent agency with enforcement authority to audit businesses, levy fines, or bring businesses to court, said agency executive director Ashkan Soltanti, because key elements of the EU’s privacy protection law influenced the formation of California’s privacy law. De Graaf and Soltani testified about similarities between definitions of AI in California and the EU in an assembly privacy committee hearing in February.
“The roots of the agency were inspired at great length by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),” Soltani said. “There’s an interest and a goal, and in fact, our statute directs us to where possible, make sure that our approach is harmonious with frameworks in other jurisdictions, not just states but internationally as well.”
Soltani was hired when the agency was created in 2021. He told CalMatters international coordination is a big part of the job. After hiring staff and attorneys, one of his first orders of business was joining the Global Privacy Assembly, a group of 140 data privacy authorities from around the world. California is the only U.S. state that is a member of the group.
Alignment is important for setting the rules of the road for businesses but also for consumers to protect themselves and their communities in a digital world where borders blur.
“They don’t think whether they’re doing business with a California company or a European company or an Asian company, particularly if it’s all in English, they just think they’re interacting online, so having consistent frameworks for protection ultimately benefits consumers,” Soltani said.
Like California lawmakers, the California Privacy Protection Agency is in the process of writing rules for how businesses use AI and protections for consumers, students, and workers. And like the AI Act, draft rules call for impact assessments. Its five-member board will consider passing rules into law in July.
The last day of the legislative calendar year for California lawmakers to pass a bill into law is Aug. 31.

By definition, artists and designers are creative people. They work in these jobs because they have talent and skills that they love to share with the world.

So, it isn’t surprising that many of them are cautious or distrustful about the impact generative AI will have on their professional lives.


However, like writers, architects, and other creative professionals, many find that it creates opportunities to work more efficiently and even enhance their creativity.

Generative AI is transforming most industries, and the creative fields of art and design are certainly no exception. But by embracing it, artists, designers, illustrators and animators could find themselves spending more of their time on the aspects of their work they are passionate about and less on the routine and mundane elements they'd rather skip over.

According to research by Goldman Sachs, generative AI has the potential to automate 26 percent of the tasks carried out by professional artists and designers.
This is likely to include things like recoloring, editing images to remove backgrounds and unwanted features, enhancing image quality, adapting visuals to fit different style templates, creating multiple variations of existing work for use in different jobs, and generating design elements such as icons, fonts and textures.
It will still be up to the artist or designer to put visual assets together in a way that’s personal to them, but by augmenting their skills in this way, artists will be able to work more quickly and make better use of their time.

Generative AI functionality is also quickly being incorporated into creativity tools and software platforms, like Photoshop and AutoCAD. This makes these tools more user-friendly and intuitive, meaning artists and designers spend less time working out how to get the software to do what they want and more time creating.

For businesses, this will mean quicker project completion, while freelancers will fit more work into their schedules, allowing them to take on more work or offer lower prices to their clients.

Enhancing Creativity
Generative AI can be great for sparking the imagination. Artists and designers staring at a blank page and wondering how to get started may find it useful for suggesting initial concepts, sketches, characters or color palettes. Unusual or unexpected ideas generated in this way could encourage them to take their creativity in new directions and explore uncharted territory!
It can help to overcome “creative block” and think about new ways to approach creative briefs and challenges.
It can give artists and designers an idea of how their work will change if they employ different styles or techniques, allowing them to experiment with new aesthetics and expand their skill sets.
It can even act as a personalized art critic, offering feedback and suggestions on how work can be improved or altered in order to better align with project goals.
While generative AI can’t replace human creativity – and neither would we want it to – it can be used in ways that make us think about what it is that specifically makes work “human”, enabling us to focus on expressing those elements of our work.

New Forms Of Collaborative Art And Design
Generative AI opens the doors to entire new artforms and genres of art. Memories of Passers By I, by Mario Klingemann, became one of the first pieces of entirely AI-generated art to be exhibited publicly when it was unveiled in 2019. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create a never-ending stream of unique portraits.
More recently, the New York Museum of Modern Art acquired a piece titled Unsupervised Machine Hallucinations by Refik Anadol, which uses generative AI to reinterpret existing works in the museum’s collection.
And the artist Sougwen Chun received acclaim for her project Drawing Operations, for which she built an AI-powered robotic arm that collaborates with her during drawing sessions, learning from her movements and contributing its own strokes in order to create collaborative works of art.
As technology progresses, we can expect to see museums and galleries develop increasingly immersive and interactive experiences, blurring the boundaries between the real and the virtual, as well as artists and audiences. Imagine installations that adapt, depending on who is viewing them, to create personalized experiences, incorporating technologies like augmented and virtual reality alongside generative AI.
Just as the invention of photography gave rise to impressionism, followed by movements such as cubism, surrealism, and pop art, artists working in traditional mediums will have their own response to the arrival of the AI age, creating entirely new artistic frontiers.
It probably isn’t going too far to say that the convergence of human and machine creativity may mark the start of a new chapter in the field of art and design. Rather than stifling human imagination and ingenuity, I believe that it will stoke them, leading to new art forms, genres and movements and forcing us to reassess the age-old question of what exactly constitutes art!

How Will The Roles Of Artists And Designers Change?
Well, let’s start with how they will stay the same. Artists and designers will continue to be responsible for bringing creative visions, concepts and ideas into the world, infusing them with meaning, emotion and relevance.
Nevertheless, they are likely to see their roles change, with the focus shifting toward providing creative direction, conceptualization and critical thinking.
As with other professions, they are likely to need to learn new skillsets in order to work alongside machines effectively and safely. This will include prompt engineering, in order to get the most out of the new tools that are available.
They are also likely to need an understanding of the principles of AI ethics. Particularly, where the line is drawn when it comes to authorship and preserving the essential human aspects of art. But also around IP issues, AI bias and transparency.
Ultimately, while they will embrace new technical skills and adapt to new workflows, the essence of their roles – to channel human perspectives, experiences and feelings into captivating works of art – will remain unchanged.
This is why I believe that the dawn of the AI era doesn’t mark the end of human creativity but the start of a hugely exciting new chapter.

The share of Singapore job postings mentioning GenAI is 4.3 times higher than the United States, 4.7 times higher than the United Kingdom and 6.5 times higher than Australia. It is early stages but Singapore may be establishing itself as a hub for GenAI expertise,&rdquo; said Callam Pickering, APAC Senior Economist at Indeed.  Pickering said, &ldquo;While we are clearly very early in the emergence of these tools, particularly as they relate to job creation, this will be a trend to watch closely over the months and years to come.&rdquo; Job postings in April Singapore job postings on Indeed were up 0.4% compared with a month ago.

Postings remain healthy for every sector, even those with sizable declines Job postings in around a third of occupational categories increased over the past three months, led by strong gains in nursing (+34%), medical information (+33%) and beauty &amp; wellness (+32%). Other strong performers included cleaning &amp; sanitation (=25%) and architecture (+21%).By comparison, postings declined considerably in areas such as personal care &amp; home health (-30%), production &amp; manufacturing (-19%), human resource (-19%) and marketing (17%). Perhaps surprisingly given the increased demand for nurses, we observed a 17% decline in job postings for physicians &amp; surgeons.   Pickering said, &ldquo;Singapore&rsquo;s labour market remains incredibly tight, with strong competition for talent across most occupational categories. In April, we saw a modest rise in job postings, which has defied the broader downward trend over the past year. Nevertheless, job posting volumes are elevated across every sector, providing ample opportunity for jobseekers from every background and experience level. Overall, unemployment in Singapore remains low and skill-shortages are common. Recruitment is still very challenging but owing to a 9.6% decline in job postings over the past year we can conclude that it isn&rsquo;t as difficult as it was a year ago.&rdquo; ","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HR TechnologyGenerative AI is redefining every fabric of work: Oracle’s Deepa SinghalIn an exclusive conversation with People Matters, Oracle's Deepa Singhal talks about the new innovations that are going to shape the future of HR. 







 

The adoption of AI in HR functions continues to animate the discussion around the future of HR technology. From the significant gains in productivity to the potential to boost workplace innovation, it is becoming central to the conversation on impactful HR.

However, integrating AI comes with challenges like employee resistance and data privacy concerns, which require robust data governance and gradual implementation strategies to ensure smooth adoption and effective change management.Also Read:
The evolving role of HR in the AI era

In this extensive interview, Deepa Param Singhal, Vice President, Applications, Oracle India, shares how companies can begin their journey and which innovations are likely to shape the future of HR.
1. How do you see emerging technologies like Generative AI transforming the landscape of Human Resources? What are some key priorities for the HR function?
Generative AI is redefining every fabric of work to enhance human creativity and productivity such as data-driven decision-making, automating internal processes and optimising operational efficiency. The adoption of Generative AI in human resources and recruitment functions has the potential to lead to massive productivity gains. 
Many organisations across industries are transitioning from outdated HR frameworks to cloud-based applications to minimise the burdens of manual record-keeping and data management. For instance, Generative AI is streamlining HR functions when integrated into cloud-native HR solutions, such as payroll processing and candidate screening, leading to increased efficiency and a strategic focus on employee development. Additionally, sectors such as business services, financial services, education, retail, and healthcare are among those that are majorly impacted by the advent of Generative AI. 
However, the integration of technology into HR operations comes with challenges, including employee resistance and data privacy concerns, which organisations must address systematically. Robust data governance measures are critical to address privacy and security concerns. Gradual implementation phased rollouts and effective change management can help prepare the workforce for AI integration. 
2. According to the McKinsey report, Generative AI has the potential to boost worker productivity by up to 50%. How do you envision this improvement in productivity playing out in real-world HR scenarios?
Generative AI is enabling employees, managers, and HR leaders to be more efficient by saving time and allowing them to focus on more meaningful, strategic initiatives that drive greater business value. o   Given its immense capability to evolve the efficacy of work, its adoption has the potential to accelerate India's growth trajectory. 
Generative AI's primary impact can be felt in administrative tasks, where it can enhance efficiency by automating mundane routine tasks like reporting, data management, and record-keeping. It also helps recruiters and hiring managers to effectively identify the right candidate from the talent pool and author job descriptions that resonate with the top talent. 
HR professionals can also leverage generative AI tools use cases such as goal creation, performance summaries, craft targeted recruitment plans, and generate job descriptions for perfect matches, with plans to deliver hundreds more use cases in the future. When it comes to reskilling and learning programs, Generative AI can create hyper-personalised training modules according to an individual's learning pace, ensuring the successful implementation of the program and massive productivity gains.
3. Given the flux in the macro-economic environment and increased change in the skill landscape, What strategies do you recommend for building a talent pipeline that thrives?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing the way we interact with the world. This presents both opportunities and challenges for organisations that want to reap the benefits of AI technologies. This big shift will demand organisations develop a more Generative AI–literate workforce. To stay on top of the talent market, organisations must start developing excellent talent management strategies that allow them to reward the experiences of AI–literate workers they hire and hope to retain in the future.
To build a resilient talent pipeline, organisations should embrace agile recruitment strategies, enabling organisations to adjust to evolving market conditions and skill demands. CHROs should prioritise the continuous assessment of their current and future skill needs to identify gaps and anticipate emerging requirements. Additionally, upskilling and reskilling initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring that the workforce remains adaptable and equipped with the latest skills. 
4. How is Oracle synergising workforce excellence using the power of Generative AI, and what specific initiatives or technologies are driving this synergy?
Oracle is committed to ongoing research and development to enhance its AI capabilities continually. This dedication to innovation ensures that Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications solutions stay at the forefront of AI technology, enabling HR teams to leverage the latest advancements to drive efficiency and effectiveness. The partnership between Cohere and Oracle brings generative AI solutions to enterprises.
Oracle reached out to its customers to ask them how willing they were to adopt some of these features. Surprisingly, about 87% of them said they're very eager to adopt Generative AI features. NASSCOM estimates that about 4,16,000 people are working in AI and data science in the country, but there is demand for another 2,13,000. This is the adoption rate at which Generative AI is spreading, and it all starts with customers. Oracle's leading AI infrastructure and comprehensive portfolio of cloud applications create a powerful combination for customer trust. 
By integrating generative AI across its portfolio of cloud applications—including ERP, HCM, SCM, and CX—Oracle enables customers to take advantage of the latest innovations within their existing business processes.  We have been in the AI field for a long time now. All our applications already had AI. 
For our Fusion Cloud HCM portfolio, we have developed innovative capabilities with embedded AI, ML, and data analytics capabilities that are built into all our offerings. For example, Oracle ME is a recent innovation that is a cloud-enabled solution, and it brings all employee engagement and employee success activities onto a single-multidimensional platform, giving step-by-step instructions to help employees navigate HR processes. 
Within the Oracle ME, Oracle Grow simplifies the path to growth by integrating learning, skill development, and career mobility, amplifying both individual and business success. Moreover, we are constantly working toward adding more capabilities to help business leaders and HR leaders amid the fast-evolving market dynamics. Last week, Oracle launched a new AI-powered Skills solution within Oracle Grow, part of the Oracle ME employee experience platform, to help leadership teams maximise talent potential and align upskilling with business priorities.Also Read:

5. Finally, what advice would you give to HR professionals and business leaders looking to leverage technology to drive excellence in their organisations?
The HR landscape has been rapidly evolving, and there are several trends that are likely to outperform in 2024 and beyond. When it comes to driving excellence in their organisations there's a whole other set of practices for HRs that have emerged. Before selecting or implementing a technological solution, CHROs should deeply understand the unique challenges and pain points associated with organisational processes. While implementing new tools, they should prioritise user-friendly interfaces to ensure a high adoption rate and maximise the benefits of technological investments.

These new professions consist of the AI Prompter, an expert who creates language links for AI systems to meet intricate human demands. With its spread into various areas, the number of AI Prompters will never stop growing, calling us to approach new times through comprehension and control of AI. Hence, looking forward to this article, let us have a look at Is AI Prompter is the Next Hot Job..&nbsp;Brief overview of the rise of AI and its impact on the job market.AI has altered our livelihoods and employment, creating immense differences and leading to labor displacement. This has consequently led to the fact that the traditional job market is rapidly changing and the most important skills are changing or being completely replaced by new ones thus making it necessary for employees to upskill or reskill. Nonetheless, there have been very heated debates on the subject surrounding morality and laws in relation to the use of AI at work..The role of an AI Prompter.AI Prompt Engineering is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the development and improvement of cues to facilitate effective communication with AI models. For this reason, AI prompts are important intermediaries between machine learning and human purposes. They serve as signals that enable AI models to understand data and provide responses that are very similar to what human beings would do.In artificial intelligence, AI Prompts Engineering entails developing and enhancing prompts to support efficient conversation between human beings and artificial intelligent (AI) systems by generating suitable inputs that yield desired outputs or answers relevant to a given scenario. These textual cues are meant to bridge human intent with machine understanding.This way, AIs learn how to achieve more accurate, suitable, and closer-to-life results. AI Prompt Engineering is crucial for numerous AI applications, including natural language processing, chatbots, and text synthesis..A rush in AI jobs.Companies are currently seeking prompt engineering as one of the best tech AI prompter jobs available for them to help AI models be educated and adjusted in order to fully utilize the new vast language models capable of yielding misleading answers.The increase in demand for workers who know and can work with AI tools is a dramatic part of it. LinkedIn data provided to TIME show that references to “generative AI” have increased. Since last year's tally, while listings tagged with “GPT” grew by half between 2021 and 2022. Some of these job listings can be posted for anyone- even those who do not hold degrees in computer science or technology.The extent of how large the field of prompt engineering will be is not known yet, but many companies and industries are starting to hire employees in this area. For instance, Anthropic is a startup AI company funded by Google; they pay their “prompt engineer and librarian” in San Francisco up to US$335 thousand per year. “Must possess a creative hacker spirit and enjoy cracking riddles,” as per what the job advert reads. Klarity, an automated document reviewer, offers up to US$230 thousand for the post of a machine learning engineer..Essential skills that a prompt engineer should have.Here are the skills that AI prompter should know:Understanding linguistics requires an in-depth understanding of human language if one is to work with language models effectively. In order to design machine readable prompts which can succeed in areas they don’t specialize on, the prompt creators must comprehend intricate elements from language varieties such as slang, phraseological units (idioms) as well as proverbs A prompt maker able to establish a connection with an underlying pre-trained LLM (language model) contributes significantly to the enhancement of capacity, response time and hence accuracy of the said model.Furthermore, prompt engineers should keep abreast of recent developments in LLM technology so that they can always have better prompts than anyone else.Engineers and other professionals with domain expertise can craft prompts that are not just grammatically correct but, more importantly, aligned with the industry's specific needs. For instance, legal prompts are expected to be exact, unambiguous, and without any form of ambiguity. Conversely, prompts for creative design should facilitate curiosity and exploration of new concepts. Prompt engineers must have adequate knowledge of security engineering to easily use LLM systems without fear of adversarial attacks such as prompt injection. In addition, they must know how to detect vulnerabilities that appear from prompt testing and develop systems that can be applied to solve malicious attacks without loss of precision and consistency..The Possible Future of Prompt Engineering in the AI Job Market.In the AI tech jobs realm, prompt engineering is increasingly becoming famous. Most experts argue that prompt engineering is the next big thing when it comes to AI development, given that human beings need interactions and control of sophisticated systems. In order to come up with effective prompts, prompt engineers have to constantly adapt themselves by acquiring new skills as AI models become more complex over time..Criticism of Prompt Engineering.Prompt engineering is necessary because it helps AI systems to comprehend human language and communicate with humans effectively, despite the fact that some scholars feel that this technique may cause bias in the development of artificial intelligence networks even though some people are pessimistic about prompt engineering due to its potential for introducing biases into AI systems.Ensuring that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provide meaningful results in all sectors is critical and thus requires prompt engineering. The latter is constantly being refined through the development of fresh ideas and equipment to enhance these questions.Early research stipulated that AI could impose significant loss of work in a number of sectors, with such areas as law and finance being at the forefront. Despite the timidity that was in the air, AI is also expected to positively influence the job market..Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, said Business Insider that conversations about AI had pointed on the platform over the past year.""Professionals and employers alike are rapidly adopting AI and generative AI across a broad range of industries. The pace of adoption is notable, especially compared to what we've seen in the past with the rise of technologies like cryptocurrency and virtual reality,"" he said.The global user profile revealed an increased usage of terms like “ChatGPT”, “prompt engineering”, “prompt crafting” and “generative artificial intelligence” by LinkedIn during the period under review. On Wednesday, it was disclosed that mentions of ‘generative artificial intelligence’ and its related products increased by 60% between January and September 2022. In the last five years alone, there has been an increase of over three times in the number of firms having a “Head of AI” position, representing a 13 percent growth since December 2022..Adzuna, the job search engine, also noticed that several new job titles were emerging last year because AI was booming in generative technologies.""Prompt engineers are our hot take as the job for 2024,"" James Neave, Adzuna's Lead of data science, told BI.""This job didn't even exist before generative AI came into the spotlight, and now companies are clamoring to hire people skilled in making the most of the new technologies. At the moment, job openings for this role are quite small, but we see that growing as more companies look to unlock generative AI gains,"" he said.According to Adzuna data shared with BI. There are several adverts for prompt engineers in the UK that were active in October compared to none last year..Conclusion.In conclusion, the interactions between individuals and machines, as shown by the dynamic characteristics of the Artificial Intelligent Prompter, represent a developing union. As well the capacity of AI rises, so does the necessity for human intervention that captures this growth. The AI Promoter occupies this radical innovation changing the way we will interact with AIs; it is shaping the path of AI communication and ensuring that it remains a resource for human advancement.",,,,https://media.assettype.com/analyticsinsight/2024-05/f23bef6f-5f66-41c0-9097-0e7cd67f03d2/Is_AI_Prompter_the_next_hot_job.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true,2024-05-31T16:51:38Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What concrete steps can organizations take to build an “AI Culture” that fosters innovation and responsible implementation?
Shalini Lal: The first step in building an AI culture is building widespread AI literacy. This does two important things. First, it sends a wide signal about the importance of this technology in our future. Second, so much of building an AI culture is around the ‘discovery’ of AI’s potential to solve problems.

Given how widespread the applications of AI to business are likely to be, a wide-spread approach to AI literacy matters.
And this is true at the very top of the organization as well. Research shows that when an organization’s board has more people who are AI literate, the organization does better in both value discovery and implementation success. So this is an important first step.
Next, we need at least one small team of technology specialists who love using their imagination to create ‘what can be’. These are people who are quick to learn. Who are quick to build. And can infuse the rest of the organization with a sense of promise.

The world of AI is iterative. And it’s a world that is changing each day. You are looking for that special blend of action and imagination where new projects come up and are completed in weeks.
And of course, none of this is likely to happen without the organizations’ leadership believing in the importance of making an early start. You need believers at the very top.

2. How will the rise of Generative AI like GPT-4.5 and Microsoft Copilot fundamentally transform different work areas (e.g., design, coding, research)?
Jaspreet Bindra: I believe that Generative AI (GenAI) will transform most of all what we do, is how we work. It will completely change it – the same way that Microsoft Word or Excel, PowerPoint, computers, the Internet, or browsers or search changed the way we work decades back. There was a recent Microsoft Worklab Survey that said that only 40 percent of our time was spent doing creative things. 60 percent of our time was spent in communication, meetings, reformatting, presenting, etc., and this 60 percent could be either entirely taken away by Generative AI or reduced considerably because GenAI would help us do that. Microsoft CoPilot, for example, helps you gather data in your computer through prompts, create a sales pitch on Word and then you can prompt it to convert it into PowerPoint and it will do that immediately.
GitHub CoPilot does something similar for software engineers. For tens of millions of software engineers worldwide, it has considerably improved productivity by a factor of 1.5x to 2x. Going further it might go even further.

If you think about work – work is really composed of multiple tasks. Many of these tasks can be automated using GenAI, and I believe that all cognitive work like design, journalism, marketing and all creative work – whether it be visual design or writing or document editing, or summarisation of documents or creating reports or degenerating multiple copies and pitches and messages, etc. this would become faster, easier and better using GenAI. And, so, we are going to see a massive transformation of work.
This is very important because when you are doing this, what you are actually doing is increasing productivity by several percentage points and, productivity – if you go back into economic history – directly impacts prosperity. All major technologies were productivity enhancers – be it the Gutenberg Press, the Internet, Search, etc., and this productivity directly increases prosperity, leading to an increase in GDP and an increase in revenues, leading to better salaries and a better standard of living. There is a very profound effect that will happen on work through GPT4 and CoPilot.
Finally, GenAI is not just a trend or a tech it is a fundamental difference in the way humans work with their machines. And, therefore, you are talking to it in your natural language. Instead of talking to the machine in its language, the machine now needs to learn the human language – which are being rereferred to as prompts – and the way we work with machines will change considerably.

How can we make AI tools and resources more accessible to smaller businesses and individuals?
Jaspreet Bindra: Right now, it is only the beginning, so most models are in their freemium models. If you take ChatGPT, it is free. Only if you want GPT 4, you need to pay US $ 20 a month. As more and more tools come in and more open-source tools come in, the pricing is not going to be an issue – many of these tools will be free, inexpensive or almost free. Startups that will build on top of this will also find that these are very affordable or give huge RoI for small businesses, which small businesses may not mind paying. Even today, if one can afford it, spending US$20 a month on GPT4 is one of the best investments you can make as an individual and as an office worker – even if your company is not paying for it.
The problem, however, is going to be with the hundreds of millions of people who cannot afford this. And, that is where, especially in India, we will need to deliver GenAI and GenAI tools to the masses in the same way we delivered UPI and Aadhar to make Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) a Digital Public Good (DPG). We gave that all free and we can see that our country has been digitally transformed. I believe that we should do the same with GenAI in India. I call it JanAI – Jan is a play on Gen as well as on ‘Janta’ (Hindi word for people). Basically, what I am saying is that we need to build GenAI, Large Language Model (LLM) stacks, hopefully, Indian LLMs and Bharat LLMs, as a part of the India Stack and deliver it the same way in a simple manner over smartphones – as UPI and Aadhar are delivered. This would mean that every Indian who owns a phone or a computing device – and more than a billion do – would have access to GenAI tools. We will create a country of over 100 million creators and we could use these to simplify so many things. People could use their natural language, so they don’t need to be very literate. This could have massive use cases in healthcare, education – every child could have a personal tutor. I think we need to bring that vision of DPI to GenAI. This JanAI could bridge this digital divide and make it available to smaller businesses and individuals.
Is the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) role truly essential for organizational success in the AI era, or is it just a passing trend?
Jaspreet Bindra: When the digital revolution happened, most companies realized that they needed one single individual who they could turn to for the digital transformation of the company, and so, the CDO – or the Chief Digital Officer – was born. I was the CDO at the Mahindra Group and what I realized was that more than 50 percent of the work I needed to do was cultural – how to bring about a culture change and create a digital change and a digital mindset. And, that in itself would foster digital transformation. This was not really about technology, it was more about culture, mindset, and business models. The same things are now necessary for AI. Whatever the person is called – it could be the CAIO or the CEO or the Chief Transformation Officer or the Chief Strategy Officer. Whatever it is, I think we do need a new kind of culture in organisations – an AI culture, that makes everyone become a GENAI expert,
GenAI is a democratic technology – it is not only an IT department thing, or some interns working on it, or the CEO and C-Suite getting passionate about and looking for ways to make business better. This is a technology that every single employee of a company can learn very quickly and then figure out ways in which he/ she could be more productive. And how we can look at the hundreds of tools out there that could make their jobs easier and make them more productive, leading to the better performance of a company.
To make that happen, the job of senior management is to foster an AI culture that allows this within the right guardrails and security boundaries, Making sure that every employee becomes a 10x employee by using GenAI is going to be the biggest job of the Chief AI Officer (irrespective of the designation). So, I do believe that the role of the CAIO is necessary – whoever takes the role, or if it is created, which fosters an AI culture, a culture of curiosity and experimentation and change of work and jobs.
Therefore, this role and AI culture is necessary. But the CAIO/ CDO should be collapsed into one. We already have too many like the CTO, the CIO, etc., Some people have a CISO. We don’t need so many roles. I believe that all these should be one role.
Shalini Lal: What makes AI/ Gen AI programs different from other technology implementations is that there is potential for every part of the business to be impacted. Some problems to be solved are about developing efficiency. Others are about developing higher levels of accuracy. Still others are about discovering new ways to serve your customers.
And this is true not just of one function. But of frankly, all functions. So the potential at this time is very vast. This also means that you need someone senior to help prioritize AI implementation programs.
Add to that the reality that responsible AI implementation is also about being conscious of data ethics. And conscious of the regulation that is emerging around data.
So it does seem very helpful to have a senior leader build and lead a team of AI specialists, and give direction to the organizations’ AI programs.
Yet, there is a counterview to having a CAIO that comes from the fear that the AI program might get too centralized and miss opportunities. There is merit here as well. If enough senior business leaders do not have sufficient AI literacy, they will be unable to ‘discover its potential’ to solve problems within their function.
In my view, a CAIO is helpful. Yet the responsibility for a successful AI program is a shared responsibility between the many businesses and the role. So both will be important. Having a good leader and having a shared responsibility across business.
Will the AI race truly be dominated by a Microsoft-OpenAI alliance, or can Google reclaim its lead with advancements like Gemini Ultra?
Jaspreet Bindra: I still think that the company which, despite everything, is still the clear leader is Google. Despite the missteps they made in GenAI.
AI is not only about GenAI – there is massive stuff in AI. And what Google DeepMind has done in AI with protein folding, material detection, huge amounts of enterprise AI research, with products that predict the weather, etc., is just leap years ahead of what any other company has done so far. So, I believe that Google is super-strong. I know they have made missteps in GenAI with Gemini and Bard, and those are well-known. Those, in my opinion, are teething problems and have far more to do with the culture and leadership of the company rather than the technical prowess and the inherent strengths that Google has. I believe that Google will come back very strongly.
There will be three leaders – OpenAI-Microsoft, Google and the third spot is quite wide open. Anthropic is a pretender to the throne, so is Meta, and so is Mistral. It could be any of these who take the third spot.
The Big5 of Al – I don’t see Apple and Amazon within them. Though they will use AI extensively for their products, they are not likely to be ‘AI companies’ like the others.
What are some longer-term trends and potential disruptions we can expect as AI technologies continue to evolve?
Jaspreet Bindra: There are many long-term trends and disruptions – too many to enumerate. I think the one I believe is that we will soon see the emergence of AI Agents – they will be apps that can do things with minimal human guidance. As a human creating an itinerary and trying to book flights, hotels, etc., an intelligent agent, having been fed your data, knowing your preferences and past behavior will be able to do this much faster.
Another big thing that will happen is that AI will move to the edge. A lot of AI today sits on the cloud. We have already started seeing smaller LLMs sitting on our everyday devices like phones, PCs, televisions, etc. This makes them faster, cheaper, and easier to use.
The other thing that will happen is that as programming becomes natural language-based, all of us will become programmers. There is great change coming and that is why I keep repeating that what we need in organizations to thrive on this change is an organizational culture shift, which is very necessary.
With the rise of generative AI, how can we ensure originality and creativity are not stifled in fields like design and content creation?
Shalini Lal: This is a question that so many artists around the world are very concerned with. And rightly so.
Given that AI/ Gen AI is here to stay, the question each creative person will need to ask is how they can make the best use of these tools to make what they are doing—even better.
And there are so many possibilities. Perhaps AI can help them brainstorm creative ideas better. Or, the tools can allow them to build creatives that earlier would have either been impossible or far too expensive. Or, the tools can allow them to make sure that their creative output finds the right audience.
It is a question of discovering possibilities. Just like in other fields.
Do you see a future where collaboration becomes more prominent than competition in the AI landscape?
Jaspreet Bindra: Tech companies, by their very nature, compete and collaborate at the same time. That is why the term frenemy – friend and enemy – is often used for tech companies. They cannot collaborate. If you think about it Microsoft’s Cloud has OpenAI, Mistral, Meta – I would not be surprised if it even has Gemini. Apple’s search has Google. Amazon uses Microsoft’s productivity software. There is going to be both competition and collaboration. They would be fierce competitors, but at the right places where collaboration is required, they could come together. One can already see lots of collaboration taking place – maybe not so much among Big-Tech, but between Big-Tech and the Unicorns (the big start-ups) – they work in tandem. Anthropic has both Google and Microsoft as investors, who compete against each other. Collaboration and competition – this frenemy thing – is the name of the game.

								Ernst seeks information about SBA’s artificial intelligence use cases, IT work							

								In a letter, the Senate Republican questioned why the SBA hadn’t disclosed artificial intelligence uses in its inventory, alleging the agency was out of compliance.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is seeking information about the Small Business Administration’s IT investments and alleged undisclosed artificial intelligence use cases.
In a letter dated May 9 and made public this week, Ernst primarily requested details about how the SBA is managing IT investments through its IT Working Capital Fund, which the Iowa Republican said it hasn’t used appropriately. But she also probed the agency for details about its AI use cases, alleging the SBA had uses it hadn’t reported publicly in its annual inventory.
“In a recent interview, you stated that the SBA has embraced AI. Despite this, the SBA has not been transparent and reports that it has not used AI,” wrote Ernst, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. 
AI use case inventories, which were required initially under a Trump-era executive order and later enshrined into statute, are intended to provide information about agency uses of the technology in disclosures posted on their websites.

However, Stanford research, a Government Accountability Office review, and FedScoop reporting have found that AI inventories have lacked consistency and, in some cases, have omitted uses that should be made public. The Biden administration has recently expanded reporting requirements for those inventories and is looking to improve them.
While the SBA’s AI use case inventory currently shows no uses of the technology, Ernst cited several instances in which the agency had publicly touted AI use cases at the agency. 
She highlighted a May 2023 press release that stated “SBA will use advanced data analytics, third party data checks, and artificial intelligence tools for fraud review on all loans in the 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs prior to approval, starting August 1, 2023.” 
Ernst also pointed to a June 2023 press release that said the agency had used “several tools, including first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence,” to block millions of applications for pandemic relief that were ineligible, duplicative, or attempts at fraud.
In addition to IT investment information and AI disclosure, Ernst also requested information about how SBA planned to use its IT Working Capital Fund to improve its score for the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.

Ernst said despite the establishment of the fund — which was created under the Modernizing Government Technology Act that became law in 2017 — SBA “has had declining performance in its efforts to manage IT and implement” FITARA. In the past three years, the agency hasn’t achieved higher than a “C” on its FITARA score, which tracks agency IT modernization progress.
The SBA confirmed to FedScoop that it had received the letter but didn’t provide further comment. Ernst had requested a response by May 23.

Carly Holm examines AI’s impact on tech jobs and the need for companies to adapt with the right tools or partners
In March, employees in the marketing and communications division at IBM were reportedly told in a staff meeting that their numbers were being culled. This news substantiated a recent pattern of layoffs in the technology sector, which have included cuts at Amazon, Apple and Meta. Combined, these reports have amounted to at least 74,000 workers being laid off by 255 tech companies in 2024 alone, according to layoffs.fyi.  

Some jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI 

The existential ‘threat’ of technology, whether real or imagined, has been feared by the front-line worker since at least the era of the Industrial Revolution. Today’s advancements in technology, particularly including the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), are the latest iteration of this fear.   
Balancing profit with workforce impacts 
We have been told by none other than Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk that AI may render employment a luxury item: “You can have a job if you wanted to have a job for personal satisfaction,” Musk said at an event last year, “but the AI would be able to do everything.”  
Yet we also know that corporations have shareholders to satisfy and increasingly choose to cut expenses – including jobs – to stimulate (or simulate) continuous growth.  
The motivation to not only succeed in today’s fast-paced business landscape but to stand out, intensifies substantially in a field as competitive and fickle as technology. It also makes the allure of AI’s advertised production-boosting and cost-reducing benefits almost irresistible for companies.

In January of 2023, IBM announced that 3,900 positions would be slashed from the company’s workforce. Then, in August, the company announced it would be replacing 8,000 jobs with artificial intelligence instead.  
These updates were followed in December by CEO Arvind Krishna saying that IBM would be “massively upskilling all of our employees on AI”. Are these events related? Absolutely. Will embracing AI ultimately help IBM (and others who follow suit) become more efficient, and therefore more profitable? Possibly. So where do business leaders go from here when it comes to AI? Let’s find out.  
Why going all-in on AI isn’t the answer  
Predictions about the future of artificial intelligence vary wildly from expert to expert – and even among the CEOs whose job it is, in large part, to sell investors and the public on the promise of AI.  
This relatively new technology rivals Henry Ford’s factory line and the internet in terms of its potential to upend traditional business strategy and the current makeup of our overall workforce, yet it isn’t clear whether executives are taking the full measures of its implications.  
You might call AI the elephant in the corporate room, but it might be more accurate to describe it as the 800-pound gorilla in every C-suite.  
Predictions and realities 
A working paper released by MIT in January found that currently only 23% of worker wages being paid for vision tasks would be attractive to automate for a business, and suggested that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual.  
In its 2023 report on The State of AI at Work, Asana favoured a “human-centred AI approach” that emphasises worker participation rather than displacement. Yet Asana also found what it described as a “crisis in AI transparency”, in which only 32% of employees feel their company has been transparent about its use of AI – including fewer than half of executives.  
Other predictions are a bit more grim, such as the Chicago Booth Review noting that the path of technological progress has produced many head-on collisions between innovation and the labour market and calling for a policy and programme-heavy approach that will minimise negative outcomes for workers.  
Policies and programmes, however, come with their own host of issues. They take time to develop, demand compromise and often translate to additional costs. None of these outcomes perfectly align with the immediate interests of corporations or their leaders.  
So if AI is the future, what incentives do companies have to protect the security and earning power of workers whose roles will ultimately be usurped by machines?  
Be ready to respond, adapt and evolve  
A quick scan of the most cogent research and informed predictions on artificial intelligence in the workplace reveals just one thing: there are no certainties yet. The mysteries surrounding how far AI can carry industry into the future, and how quickly it will get there, far surpasses the current research available.  
Even the most modern-thinking organisations, who may feel inspired to jump into this technological advancement and replace each employed worker with an AI bot, can foresee potential risks in drastically reshaping their workforce so quickly.  
One certainty we can clearly draw is that AI will become an increasingly valuable commodity available to companies going forward. Organisations will need to be nimble in their hiring, training and restructuring – including that necessary upskilling of workers.  
AI can indeed learn from itself, but its deep-learning models need to be fuelled (and constantly tweaked) by humans with an holistic understanding of a department’s and company’s goals.  
Some jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI.  
Job losses and new opportunities 
In the technology sector in particular, companies must be ready to navigate economic volatility and the shifting winds of VC investment. As artificial intelligence continues to advance in every department from marketing to IT roles, organisations will need to adapt and reshape their workforce.  
There will be job cuts. But there will also be training, upskilling and the redefining of responsibilities of existing workers. Some roles may be eliminated in the face of AI, but existing workers may see a benefit in new training, upskilling and redefining of role descriptions and responsibilities.  
New types of workers will need to be hired. Companies need to be equipped with the tools, or aligned with an outsourcing partner who can empower them, to respond to all of these changes as they come.

Although there has been much discussion about the way generative AI will change many aspects of how we work, the vast majority of the public has been relatively slow to adopt generative AI products into their own lives.
This is according to a recent study published this week (28 May) by Oxford University’s Reuters Institute which shows that just a quarter (25%) of the UK population has used a generative AI tool in their private lives – a figure which surprisingly falls to 20% for their professional life where many of the advantages it is said can be found.
Even fewer still use a generative AI tool as part of their day-to-day lives. Just 2% of the UK adults surveyed used ChatGPT on a daily basis with only 29% using it at least once on a monthly basis. For other generative AI tools, like Google Gemini or Microsoft Copilot, these numbers fall drastically to just 7% in both cases using it at least once on a monthly basis.
Name recognition for the large players in the AI space is much healthier with 58% of the UK population at least having heard of ChatGPT followed by a steeper drop off to 17% for Microsoft Copilot, Bing AI (also 17%) and Google Gemini (15%). Even here, though, there is a substantial 30% of the UK population that hasn’t heard of a single generative AI tool.
It is clear, too, that some popular generative AI tools, like photo creation tool Midjourney, which have a severe problem with brand recognition with just 8% of UK consumers able to recognise its name. X’s (formerly Twitter) Grok is even less known with just 4% of UK respondents having heard about it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is an age split in the users of generative AI, while 56% of respondents aged 18-24 had used ChatGPT at least once, this number fell to just 16% for those aged 55+.
‘It’s not a slam dunk’: How will AI impact segmentation and targeting?The study also surveyed another five countries – USA, Denmark, France, Argentina and Japan – and found that their people’s views on AI were broadly similar. Americans are the most likely to be using generative AI in both their private lives (35%) and working lives (28%) with the Japanese the least likely to be using it both privately (23%) and professionally (12%).
Americans were also considerably more likely to have heard of a wider spread of generative AI tools than other countries, in particular, Meta AI which has 27% name recognition in the States compared to just 12% in the UK.
As to what the public is using generative AI for there is a fairly even split between using it for getting information (24%) and for creating media (28%). Within that 11% are using generative AI to answer factual questions, 9% for generating ideas and just 5% for one of the more heralded uses of the tech in data analysis.
The benefits that generative AI will have on society, though, is a somewhat mixed picture. Over two-fifths (41%) of the UK population expect generative AI to make society much or somewhat worse, with only 22% expecting it to make society better.
The impact it will have on each individual’s life is much cloudier, with a combined 54% either uncertain or don’t believe that generative AI will have any impact on how they live their lives.
None of this means, of course, that generative AI will not have an impact on the marketing industry. It undoubtedly will. But it is worth bearing in mind that the public’s excitement around the adoption of generative AI tools is comparatively muted compared to the furore of excitement seen in boardrooms across the world.
Convincing the public that it’s worth embracing will be just one of marketing’s challenges when it comes to adopting generative AI.

Research shows that AI disruption in labor markets will be substantial, affecting most companies, industries and workers.


While artificial intelligence (AI) continues to disrupt and transform entire industries — creating a new division of labor between humans and machines — business leaders everywhere are struggling to adapt to the Age of the Augmented Human.


Not only must they find effective ways to implement AI in their operations, but they must also cope with the growing AI skills gap that could threaten the future of their organizations.


In this AI-disrupted environment, a new approach to education and human resources is critical. Colleges and universities must produce the right talent, and recruiters must be able to find it


In Puerto Rico, the Department of Labor and Human Resources is implementing AI recruitment tools, and colleges and universities are already producing suitable job candidates, a local AI tech leader told News is my Business.


The Great DisruptionResearch shows that the AI disruption in labor markets will be substantial, affecting most companies, industries and workers.


The World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that 85 million jobs may be displaced by a global shift in the division of labor between humans and machines by 2025. At the same time, some 97 million new roles would emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labor.


According to WEF’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted between 2023 and 2028, and 42% of business tasks will be automated by 2027, varying from 35% of reasoning and decision-making tasks to 65% of information and data processing tasks.


Goldman Sachs estimates that 300 million jobs will be exposed to automation in the next 10 years. While generative AI could create new jobs and boost global productivity, it could also lead to a “significant disruption of the labor market,” the firm said.


Two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI, Goldman Sachs reported based on an analysis of databases detailing the task content of more than 900 occupations. Of the occupations that are exposed, 25% to 50% of their workload could be replaced.


According to an economic impact study by Cognizant and Oxford Economics, nine out of 10 U.S. jobs will be disrupted in some way by generative AI. Over the next 10 years, 9% of workers could be completely displaced by AI, with 1% potentially struggling to find new employment.


Jobs with higher levels of knowledge work may be most affected. “In the past, technology advances and automation have impacted mainly manual labor and process-centric knowledge work. Generative AI is poised to do the opposite, having a higher disruption on knowledge work,” Cognizant said.


Jobs involving credit analysis, computer programming, web development, database administration and graphic design already have a theoretical maximum exposure score of about 50%, and by 2032, as technology advances, some jobs’ exposure scores may climb to 80%, Cognizant added.


Likewise, a new analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that almost 40% of global employment is already exposed to AI and that AI will affect about 60% of jobs in advanced economies. Half of those will benefit from AI integration, thus enhancing productivity, while the other half will see AI replacing humans, shrinking labor demand, and leading to lower wages and reduced hiring, the IMF reported. By contrast, in emerging markets, AI exposure is expected to be 40%, with 26% of jobs expected to be significantly impacted.


Wider skills gapThe AI revolution is dilating an already wide global skills gap, and employers must face the challenge of finding talent in an AI-augmented labor market. Nearly 90% of tech industry leaders surveyed by Deloitte in 2022 and 2023 said that recruiting and retaining tech talent is a moderate or major challenge.


The 2024 Work Trend Index, published this month by Microsoft and LinkedIn, shows that 55% of business leaders – especially those in cybersecurity, engineering and creative design – are concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year. Although 79% of leaders agreed AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 60% said their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.


Employees will have to evolve alongside AI. According to an IBM report, 40% of the workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing AI and automation over the next three years. Of the executives IBM surveyed, 87% expect job roles to be augmented, rather than replaced, by generative AI.


However, most executives are unsure how to tackle the AI skills gap: 90% don’t completely understand their team’s AI skills and proficiency, and while 81% of IT professionals feel confident they can integrate AI into their roles right now, only 12% have significant experience working with AI, according to Pluralsight’s 2024 AI Skills Report.


Even though 95% of executives and 94% of IT practitioners believe AI initiatives will fail without staff who can effectively use these tools, only 40% of organizations have formal structured AI training and instruction.


“Until leaders understand the skills their teams have, they won’t be able to develop the skills they need to leverage their AI technology as a competitive differentiator,” Pluralsight said.


Puerto Rico talentThe labor market’s ability to progress alongside AI will rely heavily on tech education, an area in which Puerto Rico may excel.


“There’s a talent shortage everywhere, particularly for software developers and AI, and Puerto Rico is a good source of AI talent,” Carlos Meléndez, co-founder and vice president of operations for Wovenware, told News is my Business.


“We have good technical and engineering universities here, so we’re seeing really good talent coming from these schools,” he added.


According to Meléndez, the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez still holds the highest STEM reputation, but UPR Bayamón, UPR Río Piedras, Polytechnic University and Ana G. Méndez University, among others, are also producing excellent tech talent.


Puerto Rico is home to more than 100 accredited universities and colleges. These schools granted 20,500 STEM degrees in 2021, according to Invest Puerto Rico.


As more companies adopt AI, graduates will have the opportunity to work with this cutting-edge technology on the island, further enriching the talent pool, Meléndez explained. When hiring, Wovenware considers local graduates first because of their education, commitment and professionalism, he said, noting that the company is actively hiring software developers and data scientists, among others.


“There’s a lot of good talent in Puerto Rico. There’s a lot of innovation happening here. It’s not like 20 years ago when we started,” he said.


“If you look at what happened with Wovenware, a Puerto Rico-based company acquired by a public company, that moment really lets you know that the technology sector in Puerto Rico has changed. The companies that do come here find a hidden gem,” he added.


Wovenware, a software firm that provides custom and patented AI, computer vision and other custom software engineering solutions, was founded in Puerto Rico in 2003 and acquired in 2022 by Maxar Technologies, a Colorado-based geospatial intelligence company.

Puerto Rico gov’t adopts AIThis month, Puerto Rico Labor Secretary Gabriel Maldonado-González participated in a forum on the impact of AI on human resources management at Cultivate 2024, an annual summit held in San Francisco by AI-powered talent platform company Eightfold.ai.


During a panel titled “AI and the Law: Navigating Global Policies and Regulations,” Maldonado-González shared insights on the legal implications of AI, its implementation in government spheres and the expectations for this technology in the labor market.


“At the Department of Labor and Human Resources, we are transforming the recruitment and selection process, empowering all employers and workers in Puerto Rico with the necessary tools to streamline and promote talent hiring, job search and professional development,” he said in a press release.


“Through our Employment and Recruitment Portal to Facilitate Labor Integration (PERFIL), powered by the Eightfold.ai platform, we are providing the latest in human resources technology. Our commitment is to continue innovating to offer better service to the public, maximizing our resources to help more people join the labor market and achieve their professional goals,” Maldonado-González added.

Sign UpCancelOKAt work as well as in your personal life, you’ve almost certainly been bombarded with talk about generative artificial intelligence (AI). It’s all over the mainstream media, in trade journals, in C-suite conversations, and on the front lines of whatever work your organization does. There’s no escaping it.The stories make AI sound so miraculous that, in fact, you could be forgiven for thinking it must be a bunch of hype. But the reality is, generative AI can truly be transformational for businesses. You can leave it for textbooks to fill in the details about what AI is and how it works. But in a nutshell, AI relies on building large language models (LLM) with the help of machine learning (ML). AI trains on vast amounts of data, immerses itself, and learns from the data in ways not unlike how humans learn (but a whole lot faster, and ingesting far, far more data).Notice that the title of this article refers to generative AI. This AI doesn’t just make recommendations — it actually creates new data or content, or generates insights by using the power of natural language processing (NLP) and ML.
Tackling many tasks
What can generative AI really do for your business? What business problems can it solve? For starters, it’s a fantastic headache remedy. Some of the business headaches generative can cure include

Production bottlenecks: Got processes that are stuck and unable to keep up with the demands of customers? Generative AI breaks through bottlenecks by automating processes, improving efficiency, facilitating faster and better human decisions, increasing output, maximizing resources, and speeding up development cycles.
Tedious tasks: Generative AI can tackle mundane and tedious tasks, freeing up human brainpower for real value-creating initiatives that your people will find more fulfilling.
Inconsistencies and noncompliance: Generative AI creates consistency across your organization’s communications and enforces compliance with internal and external standards. It’s easy for discrepancies and errors to pop up and multiply — generative AI can identify these issues, offer insights and recommendations, and even automatically fix them.
Training hurdles: Generative AI helps new hires onboard and get up-to-speed quickly by generating training materials and job simulations. Personalized instruction can fill knowledge gaps.
Customer-service struggles: When equipped with information-retrieval solutions, the technology can answer questions quickly and can even handle some customer interactions entirely on its own. It also improves live human interactions by empowering agents and creating instant conversation summaries.

Exploring the use cases
What generative AI can do for your organization boils down to three primary areas:

Creating: This is what it sounds like — using AI to come up with something new. It also may mean editing or revising something that has already been created, by a person or AI, perhaps by turning it into a different format. For your marketing team, a generative AI tool can write the first draft of an ebook about a new product, or create a press release or search engine optimization (SEO)-ready web content. It can come up with a knowledge base article on the latest product feature to help the support team, or a best-practices management article for learning and development. It can help the human resources (HR) team write a job description, making sure it’s doing so in inclusive language. The product development team will love how it ingests and crunches a list of features and bug tickets to come up with release notes.
Analyzing: This means taking an in-depth look at content of some kind and generating insights. Generative AI can spot trends or reach conclusions of some sort, perhaps even analyze sentiment amid a batch of customer feedback. Marketing may ask the AI platform to process a webinar recording and summarize the key takeaways. The support team can have it scour customer support survey responses to come up with insights on areas of improvement to consider. Generative AI can help learning and development conjure up some FAQs by analyzing and categorizing what’s in an internal wiki. AI can listen to a recording of a job interview and create a summary for a recruiter. Product developers can have it study customer feedback to find insights for what new features to prioritize.
Governing: The govern use case includes a focus on compliance, looking for language that runs afoul of legal and regulatory rules. It finds incorrect terminology and statements and works to prevent data loss and global compliance problems. This type of AI work also means checking for factual accuracy, detecting claims that are wrong and suggesting replacement wording. Marketers can use it to find errors and violations in advertising copy, and for HR, AI can flag non-inclusive language in employee communications, then make suggested revisions. The learning and development team may use it to ensure training materials are compliant with industry certification requirements and other vital standards.

Making it happen
Many generative AI tools are out there right now, and they’re ready for the masses. Countless people subscribe to platforms such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, and Meta AI is now built right into social media platforms.For the use cases outlined in the preceding section, though, it’s essential to seek an enterprise-grade, full-stack generative AI platform rather than a consumer-targeted AI assistant. Your organization will want a platform that can be truly customized to your needs and integrated with your operations, trained on accurate data that’s relevant to your business and industry, and fully in line with your security and compliance requirements.So, do it yourself? That’s not such a great plan, either. Building your own AI stack can be slow and expensive. Look for a partner that can abstract the complexity so you can benefit from the AI-first workflows, not get bogged down building and maintaining infrastructure.
When picking a platform, follow these tips:
Keep pace with your organizational needs. Get a tool that can deploy custom AI apps in a snap for any use case, including digital assistants, content generation, summarization, and data analysis.
Seek the right model. Palmyra LLMs from Writer, for example, are top-ranked on key benchmarks for model performance set by Stanford’s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models.
Connect to your company knowledge. An LLM alone can’t deliver accurate answers about information that’s locked inside your business knowledge bases. For that, you need retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which is basically a way to feed an LLM-based AI app company-specific information that can’t be found in its training data. Check out writer.com/product/graph-based-rag for more information.
Be sure it’s fully customizable. You need consistent, high-quality outputs that meet your organization’s specific requirements, and a general consumer tool can’t do that. You also must have AI guardrails that enforce all your rules and standards.
Integrate the tool. To fit into your flow, AI apps need to be in your people’s hands however they’re working. You need an enterprise application programming interface (API) and extensions that’ll build tools right into Microsoft Word and Outlook, Google Docs and Chrome, Figma, Contentful, or whatever else your people love to use.
Deploy it your way. Look for options that include single-tenant or multi-tenant deployments.
Get things done quickly. Look for a platform that can have you up and running in days, not months. Wouldn’t you rather spend your time adopting than tediously building?
Keep it secure. Here’s an incredibly vital area where consumer tools can leave your enterprise at great risk. You need an LLM that’s secure, auditable, and never uses your sensitive data in model training. You’ll lose a lot of sleep if your tool doesn’t comply with the standards your organization must follow, whether that means SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, or CCPA. Find a tool that manages access with single-sign on (SSO), multifactor authentication, and role-based permissions.

Generative artificial intelligence could lead to a €40-45 billion boost in the size of Ireland's economy over the next decade if fully adopted, according to a new study.
The research finds that two thirds of jobs - equivalent to 1.7 million roles - will potentially be assisted by generative AI.
A further 800,000 roles, or 28% of the workforce, are unlikely to be exposed to automation at all it says.
However, the report says that 150,000 or 6% of positions here are likely to have more than half of their work fully or partially displaced by the automation provided by AI and will need to find new employment.
The estimated cost of the productivity loss arising from this is €1-2 billion, it states.
""These workers are likely to see their jobs fundamentally change and may need to be re-employed in new occupations,"" the analysis concludes.
The research was carried out by Implement Consulting Group on behalf of Google Ireland between November of last year and March of this year.
Around 8% of Irish businesses had adopted at least one form of AI by last year, the report finds, on a par with the EU average, but behind other Northern European states like Denmark, Finland and Belgium were adoption is already much higher.
58% of Irish business leaders told the authors that AI has already improved the productivity of their staff.
Just over half claim it has generated new ideas which have already been implemented.
The authors estimate that at its peak, the productivity effect of generative AI in Ireland will be equivalent to 1.4% of Gross Domestic Product each year.
However, they also estimate that if there is a five-year delay in making use of the potential benefits of generative AI, the GDP growth potential falls from 8% or €40-45 billion to only 2% or €8-10 billion.
""Ireland should seek to leverage the national presence of multinational tech giants by incentivising partnerships and mentorship programmes between these corporations and SMEs,"" partner at Implement Consulting Group, Martin H Thelle, said.
""This can facilitate knowledge transfer, provide access to advanced AI tools and resources as well as encourage the development of AI-based business models in the start-up ecosystem,"" he added.
The report predicts that AI could have the greatest impact on Ireland's large manufacturing sector, potentially boosting annual productivity growth by 1.2% or €15-16 billion.
SMEs lag behind larger corporations on AI adoption, it also says, with 36% of big firms adopting it in 2023, compared to 7% of SMEs.
A higher share of female workers are estimated to be affected by generative AI than males, both positively and negatively.
The report says that in order to be able to compete with other large economies like the US, Ireland will have to depend on AI initiatives being driven at EU level.
However, it also states that gaps in AI drivers here will need to be filled, in areas like talent, development, commercial and research.
""For the past 20 years, Ireland has been at the forefront of the digital age, embracing new technology and leading innovation in Europe,"" said Vanessa Hartley, head of Google in Ireland.
""Today we are at an inflection point and we have an immense opportunity to ensure Ireland remains at the heart of this next transition to AI,"" she stated.
In relation to the issue of displacement of jobs, the Google boss said the company wants to make sure it is bringing AI to Ireland in both a bold and a responsible way.
""It is really important that we think about reskilling and upskilling those roles...that might be impacted by AI,"" she said.
Minister for Enterprise, Peter Burke, said AI would complement a lot of existing roles but he added that the Department of Finance is producing a report to stress test the labour market to see what areas could be at risk and how that can be responded to in a way that maintains employment growth.
He said there is so much opportunity in AI and we as a country have to work to hive that out and use it to our maximum benefit.
Regarding the impact of AI on Google's presence in Ireland Ms Hartley said the company continues to invest here and it remains Google's HQ for the EMEA region.
""We see ourselves continuing to focus on areas of priority such as engineering and this is the largest sales site for Google in the world and will continue to be so,"" she said.
However, AI requires data centres and right now there is an effective moratorium on the construction of new ones in the greater Dublin region due to concerns about the capacity of the electricty grid.
Google has a data centre in Dublin and Vanessa Hartley said as AI becomes accessible to consumers and businesses, the company does expect to see demand in its data centre capacity and usage.
""However, Google remains committed to being carbon free by the end of 2030,"" she added.
Peter Burke said a position paper in relation to data centres is currently awaited from the energy regulator.
He said certainty needs to be provided around data centre development, ""and we will.""
The report was published as Google launched a new AI education pillar through its digital upskilling programme, ""You're The Business"", which is delivered with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.

A new crop of chatbots is tackling another area typically handled by humans: career coaching.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeAt a time when people worry they could be replaced by AI in their jobs, some are using that same tech to help guide them at work. People already turn to generative AI for the kind of advice provided by professionals — things like dating tips, trip planning and how to deal with toxic people. Why not our jobs?We tested six bots to see how they compare to real career coaches, asking everything from how to best handle sexual harassment to when to move on to a new job. We found that while the AI tools give decent boilerplate advice, they can also complicate issues or offer biased solutions.How they did in our testsThough not as powerful as human coaches, generative AI showed some promise as another tool for people struggling at work. The key is to use it as an idea generator or to get additional perspectives, but ultimately rely on your own judgment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Say, ‘This is my plan. What else should I think about?’” said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies AI’s impact on work. “That’s where I see the most promise.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowThe AI tools specifically built for professional coaching walked us through issues step by step, often asking targeted follow ups. These apps typically guided us to solve our own problems, and avoided nudging us down a path. The more general apps like ChatGPT were likely to dump a bunch of information at once. (Video: The Washington Post)For sensitive subject matters such as harassment or suicidal thoughts, all the bots recommended contacting HR or mental health professionals.Story continues below advertisementGoogle SGE: The company’s generative AI search, which automatically shows up on the top of many Google searches, typically gave us a bulleted list of advice followed by links for more information. The links were to job sites, career service providers, and company and university blogs.AdvertisementCopilot: Microsoft’s AI bot was similar, though it allows you to hold more of a conversation. After we asked it how to talk to a boss about micromanaging tendencies, we were then able to press it for things such as how to set boundaries. It spit out more steps, including possible wording: “I appreciate feedback, but I’d prefer to receive it during our weekly check-ins rather than throughout the day.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNext$30 million gift will fund center to push for Supreme Court overhaulJim Kohlberg donates $30M for center focused on overhauling the Supreme Court.

First, it replied with questions about why we were asking, how we felt about our job and whether there were steps we could take to solve our issues. The app is owned by CoachHub, a company that connects people with human career coaches.Advertisement“If you need to manage a complex situation today, you don’t need to wait for your coach,” said Pedro Cabrera, senior vice president of data and insights at CoachHub.Wisq: This app allows you to choose from a selection of topics such as “developing leadership skills” or chat freely with the bot.

That may be because the system, powered by its own models, only pulls from curated content, versus the entire internet, or data your company uploaded for corporate accounts, according to Harry Novic, founder and CEO of Rocky.ai. It uses major models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT to enhance specific conversational requests.AdvertisementCoachHub’s AIMY, Wisq and Rocky.ai are available as mobile apps or on the web.

It warns that answers may sound right but be wrong and reminds users it doesn’t know everything. Microsoft says it agrees Copilot was not built to be a career adviser.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI is also known to have issues with gender and racial bias in its answers. For example, when we asked ChatGPT for job recommendations for a woman and then a man, it gave gendered answers like more science and technology-related jobs for the man.The bots were sometimes too general to be helpful, or too weird to make sense. Copilot didn’t know how to advise someone who may suspect they’re the victim of unconscious bias in the workplace, instead offering generic advice about unconscious bias like “educate yourself.” At one point Rocky.ai asked, “Which task will you prioritize today and draw upon your deepest reserves of discipline?”In other cases, the follow-up questions became confusing and circular, almost baiting us to answer the original question by asking the same question back. In those cases with AIMY, we ended the loop with a simple, “I don’t know. Can you help?” which prompted the bot to then brainstorm with us.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“AI lives on the internet, and you and I live in the real world — a distinction we shouldn’t forget,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global artificial intelligence practice for recruiting firm Korn Ferry. “AI is meant to support decision-making, not take it over completely.”Will AI coaches be employable in the future?AI won’t be able to give you what a human coach can as they will lack empathy, human emotional cues and knowledge of your personal experiences, experts and software makers agree.“A mentor has awareness of your career trajectory and experience that [AI] wouldn’t,” Rahman said.You should start with basic AI literacy and skepticism, and familiarize yourself with data privacy policies before asking for advice.Software makers and AI experts agree that the technology is only expected to get better.

PwC, the global professional services firm and one of the “Big Four” accounting firms, has reached an agreement with OpenAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) research organization, making PwC the first reseller for ChatGPT Enterprise, as well as the largest user of the product. Additionally, the firm is integrating ChatGPT into its workforce in the U.S. and U.K., including the recently announced ChatGPT-4o model and capabilities. 
In a press release from Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer for PwC U.S., and Ben Higgin, head of technology and investments for PwC U.K., they said, “By embracing ChatGPT Enterprise across our workforce, we will bring our first-hand experience of our AI transformation to clients, complementing our audit, tax and consulting services with a broad array of business and industry solutions.” The release noted the applications would support tax return review, proposal response generation, software lifecycle assistants and dashboards. 




















GenAI is involved with 950 of PwC’s top 1,000 client accounts, and the agreement will allow these clients to purchase access to the tool through PwC. This latest agreement is a part of the firm’s three-year AI roadmap and $1 billion investment. 
PwC’s bet on GenAI and its impact on CFOs and the finance function aligns with how much of the workforce is finding ways to use AI at work, even if finance teams are generally behind the rest of their organizations. According to Microsoft’s 2024 work trend index report, 75% of employees globally are using AI in some capacity.
And per a recent report from accounting-focused cloud services provider Rightworks, 73% of accounting firm leaders are not using AI in any way. Even as PwC pushes its ChatGPT chips to the middle of the table, CFO’s own poll of its subscribers to The Daily Balance indicated there will be a dramatic drop in AI enthusiasm over the next six to 12 months.

The rise in GenAI expectations, combined with numerous reports and surveys, indicate the Gartner hype cycle may be in full effect. OpenAI was created in 2015 to, according to its charter, develop “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work."" Entire industries have sprung up to develop and support AI initiatives, and PwC’s announcement is elevating expectations.

There is an enthusiasm gap between GenAI headlines and expectations of accurate outcomes, and CFOs have valid reasons for concern. Aside from the more notable events such as cybersecurity breaches and deepfake fraud, GenAI adoption brings with it significant costs.











GenAI, by its nature, requires extensive ongoing — and increasing — costs in maintaining large language models (LLMs), compliance, ESG considerations and a parabolic increase in the number of employees who will increase the rate of queries over time. Additionally, ongoing experimentation is necessary to build a robust tool, which will continue to bend the cost upward at a nonlinear rate.

PARIS – It’s Rafael Nadal’s voice, it’s him, unmistakable. And the video shows him speaking on centre court at Roland Garros, where the Spaniard has won 14 of his 14 finals.
What you hear is astonishing.
I own fucking Roland Garros.
I won here more than anyone ever.
I only came out to test the clay for the Olympics.
I am the king here and everyone knows.
Djokovic has won the French only three times.
He is a man child, he may have the most Grad Slam titles, but he has no class.
He is what I call Le Petit Poubelle.
I am the best tennis player ever.
The fans who saw me today will tell their grandchildren they saw a God play tennis.
I might be old, but I’m the best to do it. Thank you and goodbye.
The video shows Nadal, and it is the Nadal who was speaking on Monday after losing in the first round to Germany’s Alexander Zverev. But what he says, although his voice and gestures make some very unsuspecting people think it is real, is only a product of Artificial Intelligence, a work of @memerunnergpt Tik Tok and shared by a fan account of the Nadal (@Nadal_Fr) that amazed many on a rainy and cool Tuesday at Roland Garros.
The video shared by @Nadal_fr Twitter account in which Artificial Intelligence makes him say things he wouldn’t say
A delirium, because Nadal would never say that. And that’s precisely why the video generated attraction, because it shows an impossible Nadal.


Artificial Intelligence created a video of Nadal talking about things he would never say.

And while on Monday Nadal’s fans appealed to artificial intelligence to make him say things he would never say, the ‘real’ Nadal spoke and said some astonishing things. Not to the extent of the fake video, but somewhat unusual.
It was when he was asked what it meant for him that his match against German Alexander Zverev was followed in the stands of the stadium by Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. The two current number one players and a former number one who is also Nadal’s successor in Spain.
‘I didn’t see them, but I think it’s normal in a way, isn’t it? I think if it’s the last time I’m going to play here and if I know Novak is the last time he plays at Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there…. I mean, these kind of young rivals or young players that are here like Carlos, that probably watch me on TV most of their years that they’re living, it’s normal that somehow they’re interested to see how this is going to be, and especially in this particular place with all the history that I had behind it, right? Happy for that to happen, you know, because that means that I have a positive legacy here and a positive legacy in my career, right?’
+Clay  Alcaraz, Djokovic and the only thing that matters: three or 24.Nadal said what he said and in a relaxed manner, but to talk about his place in history and to say that it is normal for his fellow tour mates to want to come and see him is as correct as it is unusual for a man who, after winning several consecutive Roland Garros like a steamroller, used to show extreme respect for his debut against a 19-year-old world No. 188, when everyone – including him – knew the match was a mere formality if it was played on the clay of Paris.
The Spaniard made a cult, over two decades of public exposure, of exhibiting humility and respect for his opponents. The essence of the sportsman, although today it is not so fashionable.
Nadal does not usually speak highly of himself. It is probably a licence he is allowing himself in the final stretch of his career. That’s why his analysis on Monday of the presence of Djokovic, Swiatek and Alcaraz drew mild attention: he was talking about a Nadal somewhat relieved of the burden of being flawless.
Alcaraz, confirming Nadal, sees it perfectly natural to attend his matches from the stands.
‘I said many times that I wanted to enjoy as much as possible Rafa’s matches in his tournaments. And the match against Zverev is a great match to watch as a tennis fan,’ said the reigning Wimbledon champion when asked on Sunday if he would watch Nadal live.
The presence of a top player watching another top player from the stands is unusual in tennis. In the great years of the ‘big three’ it was common to ask Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer if they would watch the match of one of them.
+Clay  ""Serbia!"", Djokovic's final statement in his most glorious hourThe answer was usually ‘yes’, but on television and from the hotel room. Logically, they tended to be the star matches of the night session, unlikely to play a big match at four in the afternoon, as was the case with Nadal on Monday.
At the stroke of midnight on Tuesday, Djokovic answered CLAY a simple question: what did you see in Nadal’s match on Monday?
“I think he played very well comparing to what we saw from his performance in — where was it? — in Rome and where he played in Barcelona, I think he played really on a much higher level. Even though he lost in the straight sets, second and third were really close. He could have easily won one of those two sets, and maybe the match was going in a different direction.But he was a bit unlucky with the draw, because Zverev, he is in a great form, winning Rome, and he was serving extremely well. It’s tough to play Sascha when he’s feeling the ball so well.But it was great to watch. I don’t recall last time I actually watched a set of any match live on that level, other than Davis Cup, of course, matches. It was great. I saw, you know, Iga was there, Alcaraz was there, and we all wanted to get, I guess, a glimpse of the atmosphere, you know, of that possibly unique moment, you know, that could be his last.”
Do you think 2024 will be his last year playing?
‘It doesn’t look like it,’ replied the Serb, who knows and has suffered Nadal like few others.
“Nadal inspired me. On and off the court,” confessed Swiatek, who on Monday was taking pictures of her great idol with her mobile phone, just like any other fan.
The fake Nadal, the Artificial Intelligence Nadal, would say it’s only natural that he would do that, because there’s no one like him in Paris. The real Nadal, probably too.

The official Economic Daily on Monday called on employers to be aware of potential risks while using the technology, highlighting that artificial intelligence could have “algorithmic bias and discrimination” when evaluating candidates.
The article said that while AI could make preliminary screening of job candidates more efficient, current algorithms and standards for AI interviews could “hardly fully reflect the complexity and diversity of human behaviour”.
Personal information, such as gender, age and place of birth, might affect the assessment and worsen workplace discrimination, it said.
Government agencies should also take measures to prevent risks and investigate any violations of labour laws with the use of algorithms, it said, noting that a sound regulatory mechanism should be established to prevent the misuse of the technology.
Beijing has eyed AI as a way to help its sluggish economy recover and counter long-term economic challenges, including a shrinking workforce.
China has also sought strict regulatory control over the use of the technology, citing cybersecurity concerns.


AI is a frontier in the intensifying US-China rivalry in science and technology. In March, Premier Li Qiang introduced an AI+ initiative to integrate technology across traditional sectors to drive economic growth and technology upgrades.
Since late 2022, when US firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Chinese tech firms and start-ups have been developing their own models and competing to draw users to their generative AI services. These include Baidu’s AI chatbot Ernie Bot, which was released in March 2023 as China’s first answer to ChatGPT.
China’s labour laws state that company employment policies should not discriminate based on gender, but some employers still only recruit or show preference for men. Earlier this year, Chinese researchers found a significantly increased workplace gender gap during the pandemic.
In recent years, Chinese media reports and public debate have drawn attention to the “age 35 phenomenon”, referring to job discrimination that typically starts around that age. Experts have warned that age discrimination could have potentially serious economic consequences as the country’s population and workforce shrink.
Chinese lawmakers and political advisers have also voiced concerns about potential issues arising from the use of AI and called for effective regulation.
The Monday article noted that government agencies should pay special attention to ensure that AI interviews meet the requirements of relevant laws and regulations.
It also highlighted privacy concerns, noting the potential risk of personal data leaks related to AI interview videos and storage of these videos. The use of the technology should protect against excessive personal data collection and avoid leaks, it said.

Michael Spataro, Legion Technologies 5/30/2024      facebooktwitterlinkedInemail       The battle for a fair workweek is not new. Labor struggles throughout history have given us weekends, the standard 40-hour workweek and other common benefits we expect today. Still, we've yet to perfect the concept of ""fair"" and in the places we're making progress, not everyone is reaping the benefits.Right now, the struggle for a fair workweek is largely centered around hourly workers, whose rate of pay — and subsequently, their livelihood — depends on the reliability of their schedules. If they can't work enough hours, they may not receive adequate pay to cover basic necessities. But ""fair"" is more than just ""enough."" Workers also want the flexibility that allows them to take care of other responsibilities, like education and caregiving. Research shows that schedule flexibility is hourly workers' No. 1 priority — and they deserve that flexibility without having to sacrifice pay or stability in their schedules. It should come as no surprise that workers nationwide are campaigning for measures that further improve their work-life balance and guarantee a dignified workplace experience.[Read more: CSN EXCLUSIVE: Retail Employees Seek Better Communication & Flexibility]

AdvertisementFair workweek laws prevent employers from assigning ""clopenings"" (consecutive opening and closing shifts), cap workdays at a certain number of hours and ensure predictive scheduling, among other measures to improve employees' quality of life. However, these laws may create new challenges for stores that depend on hourly labor. As workweek laws evolve, convenience stores could encounter difficulties in balancing compliance with growth and keeping ahead of the competition. Fortunately, new technologies — such as artificial intelligence (AI) — are constantly emerging to facilitate greater flexibility and improve the overall employee experience. It's simply a matter of knowing how to harness them. AI: The Manager's Workweek AssistantC-stores have a legal obligation to uphold labor practices at the leadership level, but store managers typically have the responsibility of ensuring schedule fairness and maintaining compliance in day-to-day operations. It's just one more responsibility for store managers. Managers are the point of convergence between customers, employees and corporate leadership — they have an outsized impact on the success of the store, but that too often translates to an unsustainable workload. Using AI to intelligently automate schedule fairness and compliance management across all jurisdictions lifts a major weight from their shoulders and, when integrated into a modern workforce management (WFM) platform, allows them to focus on creating a better experience for both their internal teams and customers. A few examples of how AI can assist c-store managers are:Error reduction: One small misstep in compliance can set off a wave of serious consequences. AI-powered systems, when coordinated with local labor laws, can flag and correct potential violations in scheduling, automatically calculate premium pay (overtime, holiday pay, etc.), and alert managers to new labor laws and policy changes. They can also help c-stores track their compliance records over time, should anything come under scrutiny. Schedule management: AI-powered scheduling automatically prevents ""clopening"" shifts, missed meal breaks and other potential violations while still accommodating employees' needs. It also prompts schedule creation well in advance, in line with predictive scheduling regulations. As labor laws amend and evolve, AI can help managers keep up with the changes to massively reduce legal risk to the business while providing employees with fair and flexible schedules. Compliance insights: Generative AI copilots within a WFM platform can automatically source compliance information for managers using a plain language interface. In addition to answering compliance questions, these powerful virtual assistants can enable automatic schedule adjustments and give employees increased visibility into their hours and pay. This way, employees have peace of mind that their schedules are up to fair workweek standards and managers don't have to second-guess themselves. Ideally, all these functions exist within a single WFM system with AI at the core. The harmonization of multiple types of AI optimizes the intelligent automation of WFM processes, reducing managers' stress while ensuring compliance. Improving the Employee Experience C-store employees deserve more than just a ""fair"" workweek. They deserve good jobs that energize them, give them purpose and allow them to lead fulfilling lives outside of work. Beyond compliance, AI-native WFM creates a better experience for hourly workers by enabling greater flexibility and freeing up time for more meaningful work. They get to enjoy their job and their life outside of it, while c-stores benefit from a more engaged workforce. This is why leaders must abandon tedious manual scheduling and embrace AI. With intelligently automated scheduling, employees can easily request schedule changes and the system will accommodate them according to projected demand and compliance requirements. The crux of the current labor movement — and every movement that preceded it — is a better quality of life.

If you’ve worked any length of time in tech, you know that roles constantly evolve. New tools and frameworks can change the workflow for building apps and services; increasingly sophisticated automation can radically change the list of tasks you confront on a given day. Now there are hints that AI is accelerating these kinds of transformations. 

“The skills required by employers in AI-exposed occupations are changing fast. Old skills are disappearing from job ads—and new skills are appearing—25 percent faster than in roles less exposed to AI,” states a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which analyzed more than half a billion job ads from 15 countries to determine how AI is impacting the current global workforce. 

In the context of information security, for example, skills such as AI/ML inference and smart devices have seen notable increases in job-posting mentions (+113 percent and +81 percent, respectively) while cloud operations and JavaScript have declined; in analysis, job posting mentions of natural language programming and asset analytics have leapt (+64 percent and +3 percent, respectively), even as employer need for data synthesis and regression analysis dips (-8 percent and -21 percent, respectively). 

For many tech professionals, learning the nuances of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini is crucial, especially as more companies integrate these tools into their code-generating workflows. Mastering the right prompts for code generation will take you far.

Four in every five of businesses in the Asia-Pacific region believe that generative AI adds value, but two-fifths of the general public are skeptical about its value and fearful about its future, according to new research from Alteryx.
This is based on a survey conducted by Coleman Parks, covering 400 IT business leaders and 600 members of the general public in APAC.
The research highlights similarities in generative artificial intelligence usage. Two-thirds (66%) of the general public use generative AI to search for information, and 45% of businesses use it for data analysis.
Regarding sentiment, 78% of the general public feel positive about the increasing use of generative AI to create content they consume, but 47% added that its use needs to be regulated.
In Singapore, the general public in Singapore ranked ethics as the highest activity that generative AI should not be involved in (50%), while business respondents ranked critical decision making as the highest activity (41%).
Also, 69% of business leaders reported that AI hallucinations negatively impact their overall trust in AI, while 73% of the general public say the same.
In the past year, businesses have run an average of three pilots using generative AI, and 73% say the projects were very or extremely successful.
Businesses listed data privacy and security (49%), security concerns (46%), and quality and reliability of outputs (36%) as top challenges in scaling AI. Only 35% reported that ethical use guidelines were in place, lower than the regional average of 39%.
Getting training right today is essential, especially since 29% reported that a lack of skilled talent is holding them back from scaling generative AI across the organization. Yet, 15% of organizations using generative AI don’t offer any mandatory AI training.
There is also a discrepancy in generative AI’s impact on existing job roles with 73% of businesses feel that generative AI will likely replace existing job roles in the organisation over the next two to three years, whereas only 40% of the general public believe generative AI will lead to job losses.
Three in five (65%) businesses plan to continue to increase their investment in generative AI technologies. However, members of the general public are concerned that generative AI will give rise to fake news (39%) and be used by hackers to commit crimes (37%).
Half of the businesses (50%) say their organisation has experienced misinformation produced by generative AI, with the materials delivered by generative AI infringing copyrights or other intellectual property rights (46%) and containing biased information (46%).
Similarly, 52% of the general public reported that information produced by generative AI was incorrect, and 47% believed it was outdated.
“As we navigate the early stages of genAI adoption, it’s vital that businesses and the general public truly understand the value of AI and mitigate fears. However, 
“We know from the data that trust, ethical concerns, a skills shortage, fear of privacy infringement, and algorithmic bias are critical roadblocks that must be overcome,” said Trevor Schulze, CIO at Alteryx.
“To truly reap the benefits of this ‘game-changing’ tech, organisations must accelerate their data journey, implement better governance and empower non-technical users to access and analyse data in a secure and trusted environment, while addressing privacy and bias concerns,” said Schulze.

The transformative technology opens the door to new and potentially more insidious threats. Chief among these is the proliferation of misinformation, the creation of convincing deepfakes, and “hallucinations”— content that appears realistic yet is entirely fabricated—all of which have the potential to fuel civil unrest and societal discord.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe stakes of GenAI's threats seem particularly high, especially in an election year and a climate of worsening political polarization. And no one is immune from the repercussions. While many public and private entities are working to solve AI-generated misinformation, business leaders need to stay vigilant and up to date on evolving risks. Only then will they be poised to harness GenAI's transformative benefits and appropriately look to safeguard themselves, their workforces, and, perhaps, the rest of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe biggest GenAI risk we have yet to face&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the dystopian film Blade Runner, the Tyrell Corporation's androids are marketed with the slogan “more human than human.” This sentiment eerily echoes the capabilities of GenAI, which can generate synthetic images, videos, voice recordings, and other types of content that are often indistinguishable from the real thing. While this capability is already being used for good, helping creatives, educators, and other professionals do their jobs more effectively, it also poses concern.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe dissemination of targeted misinformation to incite violent unrest has been a growing problem for years, with bad actors already employing far-cruder technologies than AI. The accessibility of sophisticated tools like ChatGPT, often at little or no cost, raises the specter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFraudulent schemes are easier and more realistic than ever. Consider the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warning from March 2023 about scammers cloning peoples’ voices. All that is needed is three seconds of training on an audio file.\n\n\n\nMoreover, we find ourselves amid escalating civil unrest. According to Verisk Maplecroft’s global Strikes, Riots, Civil Commotion (SRCC) model, major U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are at high risk for unrest this year. These cities aren’t only wellsprings for social movements—they represent some of the biggest business, financial, and political hubs in the world.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe impact of civil unrest or other types of public panic can be severe, taking the form of looting, smear campaigns against businesses, boycotts, or a stock market collapse—all of which could cost our economy. For example, the looting and rioting that happened following George Floyd's death resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in property damages for business owners. Or, consider the 48-hour collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, fueled by fleeing investors consuming misinformation spread via social media.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough GenAI wasn’t responsible for these situations, it’s not hard to see how it could amplify or incite similar incidents. One can easily imagine how fake content intended to incite outrage with targeted social media campaigns, could fuel distrust in elected officials, notable figures, business leaders, and enterprises. The ultimate result could be collective public action that results in reputational, operational, or financial damage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEveryone can combat misinformation&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAddressing the risks posed by AI-generated misinformation is complex. Even the Department of Homeland Security has conceded that “there is no single or universal solution” to solve the problem of deepfakes, emphasizing that a combination of technological innovation, education, and regulation is essential for effective detection and mitigation.\xa0\n\n\n\nEven before GenAI’s emergence, companies big and small were developing tools to help detect and even remove misinformation, often leveraging AI. However, the effectiveness and scope of these interventions remain limited.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore needs to be done to examine how the algorithms that power social media platforms perpetuate false narratives by systematically resurfacing viral posts, even if they contain misinformation or other types of extremist content like hate speech. For example, as companies like Meta look to integrate new GenAI content generation capabilities into their platforms, slowing the spread of misinformation will become more challenging.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn response, both public and private sectors, including developers at OpenAI, are exploring how they can protect themselves against AI’s risks. This includes academic and tech industry initiatives focused on educating students and workforces to identify and address misinformation. Additionally, legislative actions, such as a White House executive order and the U.K.’s vision for ethical AI, are laying the groundwork for increased regulation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs efforts to safeguard the public against AI continue, businesses can’t just sit back and wait for further instructions. They must take immediate action to help protect themselves and their workforces. Even small steps, like educating employees on GenAI’s risks or encouraging them to take a zero-trust approach to communications, can help reduce the technology’s potential effects on businesses and society.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApproach with a healthy dose of skepticism&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the risks, GenAI possesses a wealth of potential. It's a powerful tool that can help drive business growth and innovation, helping improve our work and personal lives. However, given the gravity of its potential threats—including the potential to fuel civil unrest—we must remain cautious.\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nAs businesses plan for the future, it’s important to stay abreast of AI-related developments—from emerging scams to legislative rulings to positive innovations. By doing so, we can all work to create a more informed public consciousness and a world where AI does more good than harm.\xa0\xa0""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it', 'name': 'Civil unrest can spread through generative AI - Fast Company', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-05-29T09:30:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-05-28T21:49:09+00:00', 'description': 'These cities are wellsprings for social movements and represent some of the biggest business, financial, and political hubs in the world.\xa0', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it']}], 'author': [{'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold#/schema/person/e419ad025df62fbc3cc87331f5bf56cd', 'name': 'Rob Newbold', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold#/schema/person/image/36e720f6a5cccdddaad4c194c1bf1ea5', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1828e2da4d28a640ea953a5972f7b00d?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1828e2da4d28a640ea953a5972f7b00d?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'Rob Newbold'}, 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold', 'description': '<span class=""TextRun MacChromeBold SCXW141375342 BCX0"" lang=""EN"" xml:lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""none""><span class=""NormalTextRun SCXW141375342 BCX0"">Rob Newbold is president of Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk.</span></span>'}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'width': 2480, 'height': 1395, 'caption': '[Photo: Kendall Hoopes/Pexels]'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.fastcompany.com'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'NYC, LA, and DC are at high risk for GenAI-fueled civil unrest.

Artificial Intelligence: Navigating recruitment to workplace life

          By Alex Kuzmina, Ahmad Habash, João De Almeida, Misch Pautsch 

        Published on

AI has already been a prominent tool in the workplace, however, there is now more initiative to further incorporate AI in a multitude of sectors such as public services and recruitment. How is Luxembourg, more precisely ADEM adapting to a world heavily reliant on AI?  This article offers an outline of the ADEM pilot project, taking into account a variety of factors, including the program's advantages, disadvantages, and potential risks.




The fact that the EU-AI Act has been recently voted into effect, highlights the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily lives. This encompasses a wide range of applications; from the use of chatbots like ChatGPT for recipe inquiries to interactive conversation partners and AI models generating images based on user prompts. But more importantly, there is a significant yet less evident aspect concerning individuals, particularly job seekers, as AI programs have long been utilised in decision-making processes affecting their future. The AI4GOV initiative, a government effort aimed at digitalising Luxembourg, includes a pilot project for Agence pour le Développement de l’Emploi (ADEM) with a €100,000 budget. It’s a statistical model using AI, enabling advisers to estimate and characterise the risk of job seekers remaining unemployed over a longer period, based on various factors such as age, or the number of days without employment before registering with ADEM. What does the new AI initiative mean for labour laws and the individual employment experience? How do AI models affect the recruitment process and the current HR structures? Let’s see what labour law, recruitment professionals and ADEM have to say.

Knowledge of this technology represents the future of the world of work.  (Illustrative image by Infobae)
A recent study by consulting firm PwC has revealed a significant trend in the global labor market: jobs that require artificial intelligence (AI) skills offer higher salaries compared to those that do not require this advanced knowledge.
The study analyzed more than 500 job offers published over the past year in 15 countries in North America, Europe and Asia, yielding interesting results about the impact of AI on pay and job demand.
It has been established that vacancies requiring knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence They offer significantly higher remuneration compared to traditional professions.
The most in demand are specialists in various fields involved in artificial intelligence.  (Illustrative image)
For example, In the US, lawyers with artificial intelligence skills can earn up to 49% more than their colleagues without this knowledge. On the other hand, according to the study, financial analysts who master this technology can increase their income by 33%.
PwC attributes these salary differences to the growing importance of AI across industries and the added value these skills bring to professionals.
In its turn, The study also found accelerated growth in demand for jobs requiring artificial intelligence skills.
Between 2012 and 2023, this demand grew almost four times faster than the total number of all jobs in the countries analyzed.  This trend highlights the growing relevance of artificial intelligence in the workplace and the need for trained professionals in this field.
Companies that choose to hire professionals with this knowledge achieve their goals faster.  (Illustrative image by Infobae)
In addition, PwC found that the industries most exposed to AI technologies experienced significantly greater productivity gains than other sectors.





  



In particular, productivity in these industries grew 4.8 times faster than in those that are not as closely related to AI. This phenomenon suggests that the adoption of artificial intelligence not only improves efficiency, but also stimulates competitiveness and innovation in companies.
Experts have spoken out, arguing that this trend will increase over the years, which is reflected in new jobs and new professional profiles.
Schools need to be aware of this new demand for workers.  (Illustrative image)
They also emphasize that artificial intelligence technology has the potential to profoundly transform the labor market, creating new job opportunities in specialized fields while automating everyday tasks.
The impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market goes beyond wages and job demand.  There are also changes in the skills that employers value in candidates.
Artificial intelligence skills such as machine learning, programming in specific languages, and analyzing large volumes of data, are becoming increasingly common requirements in job descriptions.
This change reflects the importance of technology in decision making and optimization of business development processes at a global level.
Technology is increasingly being integrated into work offices.  (Illustrative image)
The introduction of artificial intelligence poses significant challenges for workers and businesses. Those who do not adapt to this new reality risk being left behind in a competitive market.
Companies, for their part, should invest in training and development of their employees to ensure they have the necessary skills for the jobs of the future, according to recent research.
In this sense, AI education and training initiatives are becoming a priority for many organizations.

More than half of workers say they are worried that AI makes them look replaceable, research from Microsoft and LinkedIn has found.Three quarters of knowledge workers now use AI at work, saying it saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work. However, more than half of these admit that they're using it for their most important tasks, with 53% now worried about being replaced with AI entirely.In a report, 'AI at work is here. Now comes the hard part', the companies found that the use of generative AI at work has nearly doubled in the past six months. LinkedIn says it's seeing a significant increase in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles, something most leaders say they now look for in a new hire.The report identifies a group of power users who have reorganised their work processes and are saving more than 30 minutes per day. More than nine in ten of these power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProThese users are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO about the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function, and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their particular role.""AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,"" says Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. ""Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.""However, although 79% of leaders agree that adopting AI is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% say their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

A separate LinkedIn study has found that the US numbers are even higher, with 85% eyeing a career move.RELATED WHITEPAPER(Image credit: Udemy)Provide opportunities for leaders to learnMore than half of leaders also say they're concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year, with leaders in cyber security, engineering, and creative design the most concerned.""AI is redefining work, and it’s clear we need new playbooks,"" says Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn.""It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.""

Efficiency through artificial intelligence



Rail freight booking service RailX is one of a number of transport partners that will work alongside startup companies to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions to industry challenges.
As part of Digital Catapult’s High Growth AI Accelerator for transport programme, the company will work to drive the adoption of AI and machine learning as it works to solve ongoing operational challenges, whilst also progressing decarbonisation and efficiency goals.

“There is huge potential for AI to have a transformative effect on both efficiency and productivity for these projects spanning from London to north-east England and across different transport modes” – Sara El-Hanfy

Through the new accelerator, RailX will work alongside Atera Analytics Ltd, Singular Intelligence Limited and iPurvey to develop ways that rail and road freight bookings can be automated and optimised. This will contribute to the decarbonisation of the booking process, whilst also improving efficiency and productivity, which is a key part of RailX’s long-term commercial success.
This work will also help to demonstrate the value of AI and machine learning in the process of making further sustainability gains across the rail freight sector, and the wider transport sector as a whole.
Speaking about the influence that this project can have on transport, Innovate UK’s Head of Artificial Intelligence, Sara El-Hanfy, said:




“It is inspiring to see the projects moving forward as part of the High Growth Accelerator. As part of the Innovate UK BridgeAI programme, this initiative shows how the cohort of companies joining could influence and accelerate the adoption of AI. There is huge potential for AI to have a transformative effect on both efficiency and productivity for these projects spanning from London to north-east England and across different transport modes, promising wide-reaching benefits for the sector.”
With the announcement of this news comes the beginning of a 14-week programme that will see each of the startup companies involved across the wider programme provided with a range of resources by Digital Catapult. These include computational power, strategic guidance, holistic diagnostics, and tailored support, as well as access to an ecosystem of developers and peer learning to ensure that expertise and capabilities can be developed.
Jessica Rushworth, Chief Strategy and Policy Officer at Digital Catapult, also commented:
“The BridgeAI transport accelerator holds the potential to address critical challenges within the sector and open up several new avenues for economic growth and investment. Achieving efficiency, productivity and sustainability gains in the transport industry will be a key determinant to fostering sustainable sectoral growth.”

                LinkedIn Shares Insight Into Professional Use of Generative AI
            





        Published May 8, 2024

Content and Social Media Manager





























































Looking to get a better handle on the evolving impact that generative AI is having on your industry, and potentially your career?
This will help. LinkedIn has partnered with parent company Microsoft to provide a new overview of the AI landscape, and how these advanced tools are changing the workforce as we know it.
And while you’re likely aware of the rising AI impact, having additional context on the actual scope of professional transformation could provide you with more impetus to learn these systems, and how to use them to your benefit.
First off, the report notes that the use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the last six months, with 75% of global knowledge workers now using AI tools in their regular process.

That’s not overly surprising, but the real test is how helpful these tools can be, and what people are actually using them for. A worker using ChatGPT once every now and then to come up with an idea isn’t a major shift, but referring to an AI bot every day is significant, and that context is somewhat missed by this question. 
But even so, 75% is a very high number, which underlines the importance of AI tools and their potential in the modern workforce.
Yet, at the same time, 53% of people who use AI at work also worry that using it on important work tasks could make them look replaceable.




















It’s a difficult balance, but the idea of AI tools is not to replace humans (in most cases), but to supplement, and provide assistance to refine specific tasks. AI outputs alone are generally not enough to fill-in for actual human expertise, but they can streamline many processes, which should lead to significant workplace efficiency.
And as you would expect, younger users are more actively adopting the new wave of AI apps.

That further points to future shifts, because as these youngsters grow up in a world where generative AI exists, they’ll increasingly find new uses for it, which will then lead to broader reliance on AI in the workforce.
And clearly, hiring managers are already factoring this in:

If you’re not at least aware of how the latest AI tools could assist in your work, then you need to increase your knowledge, and ensure that you’re across the disruption that these apps are causing in your sector.
The report also looks at which job roles are adding AI skills, based on LinkedIn data.

Of course, not everyone is updating their LinkedIn profile to reflect such, but the graph gives you some idea of which areas AI is having an impact, at least in terms of prompting members to improve their knowledge. 
There are also some further LinkedIn data points included in the report:

In the past six months, the use of LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals, with roles like project managers, architects, and administrative assistants looking to skill up most.
We’ve also seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members globally adding AI skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their profiles - with writers, designers, and marketers topping the list. 
LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17% greater application growth over the past two years compared to job posts that don’t mention them. 

The report provides an interesting snapshot of the current AI landscape, and the disruption that AI is causing in various industries.
But the bottom line, and likely the main intention of the report, is that you need to be upping your knowledge of generative AI tools, and how they’re impacting your industry.
At the least, you need to understand the potential, as hiring managers are increasingly seeking those with AI skills and knowledge.

                Employers split on using generative AI for HR as legal risks loom
            
AI’s status as a mere curiosity for HR did not last very long, but a new Littler Mendelson survey suggests there may still be a significant level of hesitancy from organizations.

            U.S. President Joe Biden hands Vice President Kamala Harris the pen he used to sign an executive order regarding artificial intelligence during an event at the White House on Oct. 30, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Most employer respondents to Littler Mendelson’s survey said they were at least moderately concerned about enforcement from federal agencies in the near term.

Dive Brief:

U.S. employers in an annual Littler Mendelson survey exhibited a nearly 50-50 split on the use of generative artificial intelligence for HR tasks, as 51% said their organizations did not use generative AI for HR while 49% did, according to results published by the law firm Wednesday.
With respect to using AI for HR, most of the more than 400 in-house lawyers, executives and HR professionals surveyed were at least moderately concerned about complying with state, federal and international data protection and information security laws. That contingent included 81% of respondents representing large organizations, Littler said.
Employers were also concerned about employment law enforcement generally, with 8 in 10 stating they expected at least a moderate impact from the U.S. Department of Labor in the next year. Seventy-three percent said the same of the National Labor Relations Board.

Dive Insight:
AI’s status as a curiosity for HR departments did not last very long: The majority of C-suite leaders in a Deloitte survey published last week said they were seeking to change their talent strategies due to AI. That follows reports from other sources that stressed the need for organizations to develop AI-specific strategies for the workplace.
Littler’s survey, however, appears to show that there may still be a significant level of hesitancy in the industry around AI. Of those using generative AI for HR in the survey, the plurality said they were using the technology to craft HR-related materials or for self-service in the form of chatbots.
“Employers should be intentional about their generative AI usage, not only with regard to whether they use it at all, but also how, why and when,” Niloy Ray, shareholder at Littler, said in a press release Wednesday. “Policies governing the safe usage of AI can help protect against inadvertently running up against data privacy, discrimination and other potential vulnerabilities, along with the reputational issues that can stem from AI hallucinations.”

Slim majority of employers not using generative AI for HR
“In which of the following ways is your organization using generative AI to assist with human resources and talent acquisition processes? (Select all that apply)”

Compliance risks in the AI space include the growing number of laws governing use of the tech to evaluate job candidates. At least three jurisdictions have such laws in place, including the states of Illinois and Maryland as well as New York City. At the federal level, the U.S. Department of Labor recently provided guidance around how AI could interact with various employment laws. Others are concerned about the potential diversity, equity and inclusion implications of AI tech.
Still, approximately 52% of all jobs are expected to change significantly due to future integration of generative AI within the next decade, according to a report by Cognizant and Oxford Economics. A February report by the Society for Human Resource Management and The Burning Glass Institute found that the tech will have the most notable effects on companies in the finance, insurance, professional services and information systems industries — with the potential for a “high human cost,” the report said.
A large majority of employers responding to Littler’s survey downplayed concerns about job displacement due to AI, however. Eighty-eight percent said they were either slightly or not at all concerned about this.

Recognizing this, GITEX Africa 2024 (www.GITEXAfrica.com), the continent’s largest tech and startup exhibition scheduled from 29-31 May in Marrakech, Morocco, will bring strategic leaders, technology pioneers, innovators and industry disruptors together to share insights around the opportunities presented by this groundbreaking technology.With a growing youth population, digital transformation, fuelled by AI, is emerging as key to the continent’s growth. By 2030, young Africans are expected to constitute 42% of global youth (https://apo-opa.co/3yaI27I), representing a formidable potential tech workforce. And countries like Tunisia are leading the way in creating and leveraging the opportunities that AI brings.Sharing Real-world SolutionsDelegates at AI Everything Expo by GITEX Africa 2024 will have the opportunity to hear from business leaders who are actively deploying AI in real-life scenarios, redefining business paradigms, and driving tangible return on investment. Tunisian representation includes speakers such as the country’s Minister of Communication Technologies, His Excellency Dr. Nizar Ben Neji, and Olaya Bahloul Ghenia, Chief Information Security Officer at the Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG). Country exhibitors include software companies FININFO SOLUTIONS, and Axe Finance, both in the digital finance show sector.Tunisia provides a shining example of how embracing artificial intelligence provides unique opportunities to catalyze economic growth and foster job creation. Through its many initiatives aimed at leveraging AI to the benefit of the country, it is making a firm investment in developing a prosperous and technologically advanced future for its citizens.Leading the Way in AI AdoptionTunisia has emerged as a leader in AI development and adoption, harnessing the potential of AI as an enabler of economic growth and incorporating it into various aspects of the country’s economy. With close to 10 million internet users (https://apo-opa.co/3JPIY47), representing internet penetration of almost 80 percent, the country’s digital maturity places it in a strong position when it comes to embracing new technologies such as AI.With its strong commitment to education, innovation and entrepreneurship, Tunisia is already making use of artificial intelligence to enhance various economic sectors. For instance, from agricultural solutions that optimize irrigation systems, to using AI to develop sustainable animal feed alternatives, the agritech industry is making significant strides. Tech companies are making AI technology readily available to users in the country, while online booking platforms are enhancing the tourist experience.Government Commitment to Developing AI skillsThe Tunisian government is also actively promoting AI development through initiatives like the national AI strategy (https://apo-opa.co/3JRSTGo); innovation hubs such as Elgazala Technopark, aimed at fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and startups; and training and education initiatives that are equipping the workforce with necessary skills.In addition, the country is actively hosting and engaging in events aimed at broadening access to innovative AI technologies. For example, 2024 sees the eighth edition of the Tunisia Digital Summit, which discusses digital technology trends, including AI, with industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs. Similarly, Hackathon Tunisia encourages participants to develop innovative AI solutions for real-world problems. Under the High Patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI of the Kingdom of Morocco, GITEX AFRICA is held under the authority of the Moroccan Ministry of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, and hosted by the Digital Development Agency. The 2nd blockbuster edition, organised by KAOUN International, follows its pioneering debut in 2023.More information is available at www.GITEXAfrica.com.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of GITEX Africa.Media Contact: Gareth Wright – PR Director  Tel.: + 971 50 273 3832  Gareth.Wright@dwtc.com Tayce Marchesi – PR Executive Tel.: + 971 58 552 3994 Tayce.Marchesi@dwtc.comOn social media: Facebook: https://apo-opa.co/3JwCSp0 Instagram: https://apo-opa.co/3Qjatqj Twitter: https://apo-opa.co/3w8Pbom LinkedIn: https://apo-opa.co/3QluZGW Youtube: https://apo-opa.co/3UdDFAb Hashtag: #GITEXAFRICA Website: www.GITEXAfrica.comAbout KAOUN International: KAOUN International is the independent events company and wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) established to organize and manage events internationally.

Three in four workers are using generative AI in the workplace, according to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report by Microsoft and LinkedIn, with 46% saying they started using AI in the last six months. Ninety percent of workers reported using AI saves them time, and 84% said it helps boosts creativity so employees can focus on other work. Meanwhile, 78% of employees across age groups said they are bringing their own AI tools into the office. 

Microsoft and LinkedIn surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, and analyzed labor and hiring trends to collect data for the report.

“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”

One driver of employees using AI tools at work is a struggle to keep up with the pace and volume of their work, with 68% of respondents reporting this challenge and 48% of workers saying they feel burned out.


But 53% of surveyed workers said they are worried that using AI at work for important tasks “makes them look replaceable,” while 52% said they are reluctant to disclose they are using AI at work. Forty-five percent of workers said they fear AI will replace their jobs.

Employers are also worried about AI, but in different ways. While 79% of surveyed business leaders said adopting AI is important to staying competitive, 59% reported feeling worried about quantifying productivity gains from AI. And 60% reported feeling worried their company’s leadership “lacks a plan and vision to implement AI.” 

Despite employees’ fears of being replaced by generative AI, the Microsoft and LinkedIn survey found that 66% of business leaders said they wouldn’t hire a person without AI-related skills. And 71% said they would rather hire a less experienced employee with AI skills, rather than a more experienced candidate who lacked AI knowledge.

Technology   //   May 8, 2024How Verizon and PwC are using generative AI to improve talent management By Cloey Callahan

Internal talent marketplaces are getting smarter, thanks to generative AI. 
Companies like telco group Verizon and management consultancy PwC are using new technologies that signpost what internal job opportunities are available and relevant to their employees, and match which workers would best suit certain roles, based on their skill sets and career paths. 
While some companies have been cultivating their internal talent marketplaces for years, others are just getting started, as businesses prioritize upskilling and retaining internal talent rather than overhiring. And the integration of generative AI into these marketplaces, has meant that leaders can view which employees match the skill sets for internal job openings much faster, taking into account more information related to the specific career goals and paths of individuals. 
A total 30% of large enterprises will have deployed an internal talent marketplace by 2025, according to Gartner.  “This is one of the best use cases for AI and talent management right now,” said Colleen Malley, senior principal analyst in the Gartner HR function who focuses on talent management. However, only 15% of these will fully roll it out to all employees and use cases.
“If you’re looking at driving retention, in addition to using technology to draw out new information, there’s also the art of acting on it,” said Malley. “So when employees are getting access to this data and you’re able to do an analysis with it, but you don’t, you’re going to lose that trust and confidence from employees. Make sure that you’re taking that action, communicating it out thoroughly, receiving feedback, and adjusting it over time.”

We spoke with leaders at Verizon and PwC to better understand how they’re doing just that.
PwC’s My Marketplace
At the end of 2023, PwC launched “My Marketplace,” a talent marketplace that uses AI technology to provide leaders with increased visibility to what talent they have across the firm and connects its over 75,000 employees to new skills and opportunities within the organization.  

“It allows our employees to learn about the types of work we do, understand how their skills link to different roles, identify areas to upskill and expand their networks,” said Yolanda Seals-Coffield, PwC’s chief people officer.
So far, it’s available to its U.S. employees and almost half of them have explored the platform. 
It’s a win-win for both employees and leaders, stressed Seals-Coffield. The platform gives PwC’s leaders increased visibility to more talent, both within and outside of their immediate teams or personal networks. 
“We are hopeful that My Marketplace helps us better allocate resources, broaden access to talent based on skills and drive sustained client outcomes,” said Seals-Coffield. “We are also monitoring the impact of the tool in several different areas, and as more time passes will have a better idea of its influence on the specific areas of our business.”

Meanwhile, My Marketplace allows employees to provide their preferences in the projects, types of work and new skills they’d like to work on, “giving them an active role in their career journey,” said Seals-Coffield. Employees who use My Marketplace will see client engagements, strategic needs, internal mobility, and global mobility opportunities both within and outside of their teams. 
My Marketplace is part of a larger initiative at PwC called MyAI, a $1 billion, three-year investment in generative AI that reflects the firm’s commitment to upskilling its workforce by ensuring its employees are savvy and responsible users of this new technology. Since its launch in 2023, more than 95% of the firm has engaged with My AI. 
“Our ‘client zero’ approach is a proving ground for AI and technology use cases, where we’re leveraging our investments to transform our own firm so we can share those lessons, and create similar opportunities, with our clients,” said Seals-Coffield.
Verizon’s AI-focused vision this year
This year Verizon is doubling down on using AI to help with talent management. It’s part of a multi-year initiative, referred to internally as Journey Forward, to provide more resources and development opportunities.
Verizon already claims a very slow staff churn. Of its 110,000 employees worldwide, the average amount of time someone remains at the company is 12.9 years, according to the company. But to ensure that figure remains sustainable it’s investing heavily in using AI to further improve internal mobility for employees. 
The first phase began with job architecture, also known as taxonomy, which groups job attributes and ultimately helps identify an employee’s progress and standing, and maps out what potential growth opportunities there could be for that person based on what’s available within the company. It has also launched an online job library from which employees can access information about Verizon roles. 
So far, the plan has paid off. Verizon’s 2023 VZPulse+ survey, which had an employee participation rate of 88%, showed results that ranked in the 83rd percentile in overall employee engagement, 82nd percentile for a culture of inclusion, and 76th percentile in overall satisfaction compared to Gallup’s company-wide database.
Now, it’s about focusing on how to use AI to make all of that just a little bit easier. 
“This year, we’re harnessing the power of AI and tech,” said Ashley Walvoord, Verizon’s associate vp of talent management. “We can say ‘Hey, you were interested in this, here’s what it takes, here’s what you have, here’s some ideas for how we can invest in you to get you there, or have you thought about this job over there.’ You don’t need to come up with the right keywords, we’ll share them with you and see if you’re interested.”







            ""We can say ‘Hey, you were interested in this, here’s what it takes, here’s what you have, here’s some ideas for how we can invest in you to get you there, or have you thought about this job over there.’""

It’s giving them the skills needed for a job and the kinds of learning and opportunities that might be a good match for them, added Walvoord. Generative AI can help employees get answers about things more efficiently, more productively, and overall enhance the employee experience.
In the long term, Verizon plans to start researching how generative AI can be used to help people be more effective with how they give each other feedback, not just limited between manager and employee, but to provide a culture of feedback all around. Additionally, the company’s goal is to ensure that all employees know how to harness AI to have clarity on their priorities and goals. 
“This is a space where I think AI starts to level the playing field in how we work,” said Walvoord. “When you focus on how it can support the how, and you keep the employee in the decision-making chair, it’s all about elevating what their impact can be. I think that’s really exciting.”

Alex Gay, Senior Director of Product Marketing, Adobe Document Cloud 
Most business today can be described as MORE—more technology, more meetings, more projects, more data, and more documents. Coupled with the increasing expectations to do more with less, it’s a lot for knowledge workers to handle. In fact, according to MIT Sloan, 80 percent of knowledge workers experience information overload and it’s impacting productivity. Adobe’s Future of Digital Work survey reported that knowledge workers waste nearly a full day (8.2 hours) a week just looking for information they need to do their jobs. 
A lot of that information resides in documents like contracts, financial filings, white papers, sales decks, and research reports. Most of the data in those documents (80-90%) is unstructured, making it especially difficult to analyze and action. Generative AI presents an incredible new opportunity to empower every knowledge worker to get more value from their documents and work more productively. However, deploying generative AI across the organization quickly, yet in a secure and compliant way can be challenging for IT leaders. 
Trust meets value
For more than 30 years, the world’s largest organizations have trusted Adobe Acrobat with their most important information. When it comes to generative AI, we know enterprises need technologies that provide fast time-to-value and meet their security and governance requirements. That’s why we’ve introduced Acrobat AI Assistant for our enterprise customers, a generative AI-powered conversational engine that can be quickly and safely deployed and used. AI Assistant can be deployed in minutes — and used in a familiar environment for employees. And because the features only work on documents users provide, they align to companies’ existing governance processes. We supplement LLM technologies with our own IP, greatly enhancing the quality and reliability of the output and prohibit third-party LLMs from storing, using or training on our customers’ data. And like other Adobe AI features, AI Assistant is developed and deployed according to our AI Ethics principles.
We rolled out AI Assistant to our own employees and they became early adopters of the technology. This fast time to value has been exciting to see, as our employees are discovering faster ways to do their best work. As a result, a range of use cases has started to emerge. The following are a few real-world examples of how our teams are using AI to turn document data into actionable insights and free up time for more valuable tasks.

Marketing and communications: Creating compelling content at scale

Today’s marketing professionals are voracious consumers and producers of content. They read research reports, white papers, and media coverage to stay up-to-date and then produce an ever-increasing amount of content to keep both internal and external audiences informed and engaged. Research suggests that 2-4 blog posts a week is ideal to keep interest in the brand high – and social channels require even more fresh content. 
Employees from our marketing team are saving 5+ hours each week using Acrobat AI Assistant to get insights quicker and consolidate and format information into different types of assets – from executive updates to blogs to social posts – using clickable citations to verify the information is correct. 
2. Sales: Closing bigger deals – faster – and nurturing customer relationships
For sales teams to be successful, they need to deeply understand customer pain points, opportunities, and industry trends so they can create personalized pitches for new customers and customized solutions to help existing customers evolve their business. 
To do that, our sales teams spend a lot of time sifting through complex and lengthy documents like annual reports and 10-Ks for key insights like a customer’s mission, recent financial performance, risks, roadmap, and longer-term objectives. The team started using AI Assistant to summarize the most important points from the documents and ask specific questions to inform their pitches. They also used generative AI to quickly locate and verify details on topics like security practices and information governance in highly technical documents for customer RFPs, and to generate content like email summaries for their teams or summaries for slide decks. With AI, our sales team can now do the same work in about 4 hours or half the time it normally took them – opening opportunities to work with more prospects and customers. 
3. Finance: Analyze reports and provide timely recommendations 
Adobe’s finance team spends hours each week on tasks like reading financial statements, earnings, and industry reports, summarizing recommendations for internal clients, creating reports and blogs based on their analysis and creating emails to update their colleagues. By leveraging AI Assistant to do things like summarize earnings highlights, create first versions of blog posts and draft emails, each employee can save about 7 hours each week and get timely information to stakeholders much quicker.
4. Legal: Promptly access impact of new regulations and save time toward compliance
Our legal teams and compliance officers are charged with tracking and understanding a growing number of new regulations affecting the business. They also need to communicate key points to executives, which requires distilling complex information and removing legal jargon. AI Assistant is helping Adobe’s legal team streamline these processes by instantly generating synopses of regulations, distilling key takeaways, and then automatically formatting them into emails, reports, or slides – cutting time they normally spent in half.
5. Research & development: Stay on top of industry trends
At Adobe, our investment in R&D drives our innovation and growth. R&D’s job is to keep themselves and product teams current on the lates industry and technology trends. This requires a tremendous amount of reading and summarizing information to share with the department and cross-functional teams, and for inclusion in product requirement documents. Without AI Assistant, each researcher could spend more than 10 hours each week reading and summarizing information. Leveraging generative AI, they’ve been able to reduce that down to just four hours a week. 
Generative AI is an incredibly exciting new technology and it’s exciting to see it transform from a curiosity into providing real value for knowledge workers across just about every role. To learn more about Acrobat AI Assistant, visit here.

One year ago, generative AI burst onto the scene and for the first time since the smartphone, people began to change the way they interact with technology. People are bringing AI to work at an unexpected scale — and now the big question is, how’s it going?
As AI becomes ubiquitous in the workplace, employees and businesses alike are under extreme pressure. The pace and intensity of work, which accelerated during the pandemic, has not eased, so employees are bringing their own AI to work. Leaders agree AI is a business imperative — and feel the pressure to show immediate ROI — but many lack a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line.
At the same time, the labor market is set to shift and there’s a new AI economy. While some professionals worry AI will replace their job, the data tells a more nuanced story — of a hidden talent shortage, more employees eyeing a career change, and a massive opportunity for those willing to skill up.
“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”
For our fourth annual Work Trend Index, out today, we partnered with LinkedIn for the first time on a joint report so we could provide a comprehensive view of how AI is not only reshaping work, but the labor market more broadly. We surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, identified labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and conducted research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know — and actions they can take — when it comes to AI’s implications for work.
1. Employees want AI at work — and won’t wait for companies to catch up.
Three in four knowledge workers (75%) now use AI at work. Employees, overwhelmed and under duress, say AI saves time, boosts creativity and allows them to focus on their most important work. While 79% of leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% worry their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it. While leaders feel the pressure to turn individual productivity gains into organizational impact, employees aren’t waiting to reap the benefits: 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.
2. For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling.
We also see AI beginning to impact the job market. While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, our data shows more people are eyeing a career change, there are jobs available, and employees with AI skills will get first pick. The majority of leaders (55%) say they’re worried about having enough talent to fill open roles this year, with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design feeling the pinch most.
And professionals are looking. Forty-six percent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead — an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021 — a separate LinkedIn study found U.S. numbers to be even higher with 85% eyeing career moves. While two-thirds of leaders wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills, only 39% of users have received AI training from their company. So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, we’ve seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.
In a world where AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth, it’s a two-way street: Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up will have the edge.
3. The rise of the AI power user — and what they reveal about the future.
In the research, four types of AI users emerged on a spectrum — from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively. Compared to skeptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren’t doing it on their own.
Power users work for a different kind of company. They are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function.
“AI is redefining work and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. “It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
The prompt box is the new blank page 
We hear one consistent piece of feedback from our customers: talking to AI is harder than it seems. We’ve all learned how to use a search engine, identifying the right few words to get the best results. AI requires more context — just like when you delegate work to a direct report or colleague. But for many, staring down that empty prompt box feels like facing a blank page: Where should I even start?
Today, we’re announcing Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help our customers answer that question.

If you’ve got the start of a prompt, Copilot will offer to auto-complete it to get to a better result, suggesting something more detailed to help ensure you get what you’re looking for. That not only speeds things up, it offers you new ideas for how to leverage Copilot’s power.

Other times, you know exactly what you want — you’re just not sure how to ask. With its new rewrite feature, Copilot turns a basic prompt into a rich one with the click of a button, turning everyone into a prompt engineer.

Catch Up, a new chat interface that surfaces personal insights based on your recent activity, provides responsive recommendations, like “You have a meeting with the sales VP on Thursday. Let’s get you prepared — click here to get detailed notes.”
We also know that every role, team and function has unique needs and ways of working. To help create prompts for exactly the work you do, you’ll soon be able to create, publish and manage prompts in Copilot Lab that are expressly tailored to your closest teams.

These features will be available in the coming months, and in the future, we’ll take it a step further, with Copilot asking you questions to get to your best work yet.
LinkedIn has also made free over 50 learning courses to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.

Microsoft and LinkedIn’s annual Work Trend Index reveals the state of AI at work, the cultural shifts at play and what businesses and employees need to know.
A year since generative AI arrived on the landscape, Microsoft’s fourth annual Work Trend Index – its first collaboration with LinkedIn – provides a comprehensive view of how AI is reshaping work and the labour market. To coincide with the report, Microsoft has also announced new innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 with guidance on how to create prompts and tailored support.
The Work Trend Index combines survey data from 31,000 knowledge workers and leaders across 31 countries, as well as trillions of productivity signals, telemetry data and LinkedIn jobs and labour data to show how AI is taking hold in the workplace.
Lucy Debono, Modern Work Business Director, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, says 2024 is the year AI at work will become “real”.
“Organisations that apply AI to drive growth, manage costs, and deliver greater value to their customers will pull ahead. The data also shows that AI will play a major role in the labour market, with greater value placed on AI – both as a skillset and aptitude among job seekers, and for its ability to reshape workflows so employees can enjoy their work more.”
The Work Trend Index reveals three key themes:
 

Employees want AI at work – and won’t wait for companies to catch up

New Zealand workers are among the strongest adopters of generative AI in the workplace, with 84% using the technology at work, higher than the global average of 75%. Employees who are using AI say it, saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work.
However, the rapid uptake means New Zealand leaders are more worried that their organisation lacks a plan and vision to implement AI (74% of New Zealand leaders, versus 60% of global leaders).
While leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remaining competitive, employees often aren’t waiting to be formally trained or introduced to the tools via their IT departments and leadership teams. 81% of AI users in New Zealand are bringing their own AI tools to work. The challenge (and opportunity) for every leader is to channel this momentum into return on investment, through a cohesive AI strategy.
 

AI skills are giving jobseekers the edge

While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, Work Trend Index data shows employees with AI skills will get first pick.
In Australia, LinkedIn research shows 87% of hiring managers plan to hire or expand their workforce this year. However, in New Zealand, unemployment is forecast to rise to at least 5 per cent by the end of 2024.
This makes it even more important for New Zealand workers to upskill. However, only 39% of LinkedIn users, globally, have received AI training from their company.
So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, there’s been a 142% increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.
“Leaders have made their land grab for technical AI talent – with hiring up 323% globally in the last eight years. Now they’re turning their sights to non-technical talent with AI-aptitude. While leaders recognise the value of bringing on new employees with these skills, they’re missing the value of developing their own people by investing in AI tools or products for their teams and implementing training that’s specific to their industry and employees’ job functions,” says Matt Tindale, Managing Director, LinkedIn Australia and New Zealand.
 

The rise of the AI power user – and what they reveal about the future

Through the Work Trend Index research, four types of AI users emerged– from sceptics who rarely use AI, to power users who use it extensively. Compared to sceptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day.
Approximately 8 in 10 Kiwi power users frequently start their day with AI or use it to get ready for the following day, in line with the global average of 85%. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable.
However, the data shows New Zealand is behind other countries on engagement from business leadership. Power users in New Zealand are 36% more likely than the average worker to have heard from their CEO (compared to 61% globally), and 33% more likely to have heard from their function or department lead (compared to 40% globally), on the importance of using generative AI at work. This could be holding New Zealand back from driving greater ROI on AI investments.
The data also shows New Zealand workplaces need to encourage a culture of greater AI experimentation and training. Only 33% of power users in New Zealand say they are experimenting with different ways of using AI (compared to 68% of global AI power users); and just 24%  are frequently asking co-workers what prompts they find most useful (versus 40% globally). AI power users in New Zealand are also about 10% less likely to receive training on how to use AI for their specific role or function compared to global AI power users.
New innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 provide help with prompts 
Many Microsoft customers have shared that writing the right AI prompts is the hardest part.
As part of the Work Trend Index launch, Microsoft has introduced Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help customers add greater context to their AI prompts and get more from the generative AI technology. Over the coming months, auto-complete and rewrite features will be added to help improve prompts, along with a “catch-up” function that automatically suggests how to prepare for upcoming meetings. A Copilot Lab feature will also provide prompts tailored to specific teams and work duties.
Interested to level up your AI skills? LinkedIn has made free over 50 learning courses to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.

The ITRC has seen a 545% increase in reports in January 2024 compared to December 2023. Velasquez said the quality of the fake checks and letters has improved because of artificial intelligence.Read: Car owners suing Subaru, saying their cars accelerated without them touching the gas pedal“It doesn’t take any time, and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles. So, it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those A.I. generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails.Crooks use A.I. to scrape your personal information, then create and send a targeted attack.Read: Stolen EBT funds: How secure are these cards?Using Becker’s Action News Jax bio, we asked ChatGPT to write a customized remote job offer letter. It even mentions some of Becker’s awards and states he can work from the comfort of a home studio.Another part of the scam can include links within the offer letter asking victims for more information. Clicking those links can download malware or steal your private information to use against you or sell on the dark web.How to protect yourself According to the Federal Trade Commission, there are ways to protect yourself:Verify the job ad.Visit the official company website and apply there instead.Google the company with words like “scam,” “review,” or “complaint.”If a company sends you a check, asks you to deposit it, and return part of the money, it’s a scam.Synterex Statement:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be. It is disheartening, to say the least, to see applicants who are excited about the potential to work for these companies have their time and resources stolen, or worse. That’s why we are always working to elevate our digital security measures to combat this type of threat.”Click here to download our free news, weather and smart TV apps.

In the future, will data analysts find themselves unemployed due to generative AI displacing jobs? Not quite. However, many roles in this space should expect major changes to their duties as businesses dramatically rethink their approach to data analytics in response to the generative AI revolution. How will this happen?
Background: What Do Data Analytics Teams Do?
Let's begin by exploring the tasks typically performed by a data analytics team in a business that hasn’t yet adopted generative AI for enhancing analytics capabilities.

Traditionally, data analysts focused on integrating various data sources within a given organization and then creating queries to enable business stakeholders to answer questions based on their data. This process was often complex and time-consuming, for several reasons.

One reason was the challenge of mapping disparate data sources together and implementing the necessary data transformations to query all of them in a consolidated fashion. This task required deep expertise in data integration and analytics, consuming much of analysts' time.

A second issue was that the initial queries rarely fully answered a business stakeholder's question, due to the difficulty in determining exactly what information the stakeholder wanted. As a result, queries became iterative processes, with analysts having to tweak queries and generate new reports repeatedly until they finally arrived at the desired answer.

In short, traditional data analyst roles have revolved around complex data integration and querying tasks. The work tends to be tedious and time-consuming, and it becomes even more challenging as the scale and diversity of data assets within a business increase.
How Generative AI Can Change Data Analytics
Generative AI, however, is poised to fundamentally change data analytics processes.

The main reason is that generative AI models can allow business stakeholders to ask and answer data-centric questions without relying on data analysts to write queries for them. As long as a generative AI model has access to relevant data sources, it can accept questions in natural language form and then generate appropriate data queries based on them. This is precisely one of the use cases that solutions like Amazon Q are designed to address.

For the data analyst role, this approach to querying data has two profound implications. One is that it reduces the importance of creating data inventories and maps. Instead of integrating disparate data sources in the traditional way – which entailed manual effort on the part of data analysts – businesses can simply expose all of their relevant data to generative AI models and let them decide how to query it.

In addition, a generative AI-based approach to data analytics makes it possible to iterate and refine queries much faster than teams could if they relied on analysts to write queries manually. Instead of a time-consuming process where a data analyst and a business stakeholder hold a back-and-forth conversation, and the data analyst writes multiple queries and reports in an attempt to provide the answers the business stakeholder seeks, the stakeholder can interact directly with a generative AI service to ask a question in different ways until the service produces the right answer.

This isn't to say that generative AI can interpret business needs any better than human data analysts. Natural language queries are always ambiguous, for generative AI models and humans alike. The advantage that generative AI has in this context is its ability to iterate faster and to generate new versions of an answer in a matter of seconds instead of hours.
The Future of Data Analyst Jobs
None of this is bad news for data analysts who may be worried about their jobs. On the contrary, although generative AI is likely to upend core elements of the traditional data analytics function within many businesses, it will make data analysts' jobs more rewarding and important in other ways.

Instead of spending most of their time on data integration and querying, analysts within a business that adopts generative AI as the basis for analytics will shift toward work that caters to enabling generative AI. Analysts will take the lead in model training, for example. They'll also play key roles in enforcing data governance and security policies, which shape which data generative AI models can and can't access – or, in cases where highly granular levels of access are necessary, data analysts will help enable controls that allow certain users to access certain data via generative AI services, which may not be available to other users of the same service.

This work will likely be more rewarding than the tedium of writing queries. It will also involve acquiring new data management skills – which is why data analysts who want to get ahead of the generative AI revolution should now be focusing on upskilling in this realm.
Conclusion: A Bright, but Different, Future for Data Analysts
If you're a data analyst living through the generative AI revolution, now's the time to rethink your role and the value you bring to business. Gone are the days when the ability to integrate data sources and write complex queries was the be-all and end-all of the data analytics function. Going forward, capabilities related to supporting and managing the data paradigms that power generative AI models will become central.

Ultimately, the work that data analysts perform in the brave, new, generative AI-centric world is likely to be more interesting and rewarding, and it will certainly be quite different from traditional data analytics tasks.

However, the executives are wary that generative AI could wipe out several entry-level roles, and customer care roles are expected to be severely affected.While firms anticipate new hires, a cross-section of respondents have expressed fears over the difficulty of sourcing top talent, with job candidates obfuscating their skills using AI and other emerging technologies.“Companies are reshaping their workforce to be more AI savvy,” said Vamsi Duvvuri, EY Technology, Media and Telecommunications AI Leader. “With this transition, we can anticipate a continuous cycle of strategic workforce realignment, characterized by simultaneous layoffs and hiring, and not necessarily in equal volumes.”Despite the hiring spree, the poll revealed an upward trend of employees turning to generative AI offerings to improve workplace productivity and efficiency. 72% of executives confirm AI use cases within their organization, with employees leaning on the offerings for coding, internal communication, and data analysis.Apart from challenges around hiring and layoffs, respondents say they are treading with caution over fears of security breaches and data leaks from AI use. Following this, nearly 90% of respondents are pushing for internal guardrails to promote safe usage, while a majority say tighter regulations will mitigate associated risks.Other areas of concern include copyright infringement, the steep cost of upskilling employees, and AI-generated bias, but respondents opine that the benefits significantly outweigh the downsides.A changing workforceSeveral studies are forecasting changes to the global workforce due to generative AI adoption. One report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) notes that while productivity is poised to spike by 40%, advanced economies are at a higher risk of job losses from automation.Another study by IBM (NASDAQ: IBM) says that nearly two billion individuals will require new AI skills to remain competitive in the workplace. Per the report, the seismic upskilling drive will affect finance, procurement, marketing, and customer service employees.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Chen and Cade MetzTripp Mickle, Brian X. Chen and Cade Metz have been reporting on Apple’s plans for generative A.I. for this article since the fall of 2023.May 10, 2024Apple’s top software executives decided early last year that Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, needed a brain transplant.The decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI’s new chatbot, ChatGPT. The product’s use of generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company’s work, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly.Introduced in 2011 as the original virtual assistant in every iPhone, Siri had been limited for years to individual requests and had never been able to follow a conversation. It often misunderstood questions. ChatGPT, on the other hand, knew that if someone asked for the weather in San Francisco and then said, “What about New York?” that user wanted another forecast.The realization that new technology had leapfrogged Siri set in motion the tech giant’s most significant reorganization in more than a decade. Determined to catch up in the tech industry’s A.I. race, Apple has made generative A.I. a tent pole project — the company’s special, internal label that it uses to organize employees around once-in-a-decade initiatives.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTApple is expected to show off its A.I. work at its annual developers conference on June 10 when it releases an improved Siri that is more conversational and versatile, according to three people familiar with the company’s work, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly. Siri’s underlying technology will include a new generative A.I. system that will allow it to chat rather than respond to questions one at a time.The update to Siri is at the forefront of a broader effort to embrace generative A.I. across Apple’s business. The company is also increasing the memory in this year’s iPhones to support its new Siri capabilities. And it has discussed licensing complementary A.I. models that power chatbots from several companies, including Google, Cohere and OpenAI.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Apple executives worry that new A.I. technology threatens the company’s dominance of the global smartphone market because it has the potential to become the primary operating system, displacing the iPhone’s iOS software, said two people familiar with the thinking of Apple’s leadership, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly. This new technology could also create an ecosystem of A.I. apps, known as agents, that can order Ubers or make calendar appointments, undermining Apple’s App Store, which generates about $24 billion in annual sales.Apple also fears that if it fails to develop its own A.I. system, the iPhone could become a “dumb brick” compared with other technology. While it is unclear how many people regularly use Siri, the iPhone currently takes 85 percent of global smartphone profits and generates more than $200 billion in sales.That sense of urgency contributed to Apple’s decision to cancel its other big bet — a $10 billion project to develop a self-driving car — and reassign hundreds of engineers to work on A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTApple has also explored creating servers that are powered by its iPhone and Mac processors, two of these people said. Doing so could help Apple save money and create consistency between the tools used for processes in the cloud and on its devices.Rather than compete directly with ChatGPT by releasing a chatbot that does things like write poetry, the three people familiar with its work said, Apple has focused on making Siri better at handling tasks that it already does, including setting timers, creating calendar appointments and adding items to a grocery list. It also would be able to summarize text messages.Apple plans to bill the improved Siri as more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers. The strategy will also save money. OpenAI spends about 12 cents for about 1,000 words that ChatGPT generates because of cloud computing costs.(The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.But Apple faces risks by relying on a smaller A.I. system housed on iPhones rather than a larger one stored in a data center. Research has found that smaller A.I. systems could be more likely to make errors, known as hallucinations, than larger ones.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s always been the Siri vision to have a conversational interface that understands language and context, but it’s a hard problem,” said Tom Gruber, a co-founder of Siri who worked at Apple until 2018. “Now that the technology has changed, it should be possible to do a much better job of that. So long as it’s not a one-size-fits-all effort to answer anything, then they should be able to avoid trouble.”Apple has several advantages in the A.I. race, including more than two billion devices in use around the world where it can distribute A.I. products. It also has a leading semiconductor team that has been making sophisticated chips capable of powering A.I. tasks like facial recognition.But for the past decade, Apple has struggled to develop a comprehensive A.I. strategy, and Siri has not had major improvements since its introduction. The assistant’s struggles blunted the appeal of the company’s HomePod smart speaker because it couldn’t consistently perform simple tasks like fulfilling a song request.The Siri team has failed to get the kind of attention and resources that went to other groups inside Apple, said John Burkey, who worked on Siri for two years before founding a generative A.I. platform, Brighten.ai. The company’s divisions, such as software and hardware, operate independently of one another and share limited information. But A.I. needs to be threaded through products to succeed.“It’s not in Apple’s DNA,” Mr. Burkey said. “It’s a blind spot.”Apple has also struggled to recruit and retain leading A.I. researchers. Over the years, it has acquired A.I. companies led by leaders in the field, but they all left after a few years.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe reasons for their departures vary, but one factor is Apple’s secrecy. The company publishes fewer papers on its A.I. work than Google, Meta and Microsoft, and it doesn’t participate in conferences in the same way that its rivals do.“Research scientists say: ‘What are my other options? Can I go back into academia? Can I go to a research institute, some place where I can work a bit more in the open?’” said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a leading A.I. researcher, who left Apple in 2020 to return to Carnegie Mellon University.In recent months, Apple has increased the number of A.I. papers it has published. But prominent A.I. researchers have questioned the value of the papers, saying they are more about creating the impression of meaningful work than providing examples of what Apple may bring to market.Tsu-Jui Fu, an Apple intern and A.I. doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote one of Apple’s recent A.I. papers. He spent last summer developing a system for editing photos with written commands rather than Photoshop tools. He said that Apple supported the project by providing him with the necessary G.P.U.s to train the system, but that he had no interaction with the A.I. team working on Apple products.Though he said he had interviewed for full-time jobs at Adobe and Nvidia, he plans to return to Apple after he graduates because he thinks he can make a bigger difference there.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. product and research is emerging in Apple, but most companies are very mature,” Mr. Fu said in an interview with The Times. “At Apple, I can have more room to lead a project instead of just being a member of a team doing something.”Tell us how your law firm is using A.I.We’d like to hear from lawyers working with generative A.I., including contract lawyers who have been brought on for assignments related to A.I.

Now comes the hard part"", was released on Wednesday, May 8. It claimed that in the last six months, the use of Artificial Intelligence has “nearly doubled.” The research was “based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, labour and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and research with Fortune 500 customers.”The research discovered that 75 per cent of “knowledge workers” across the globe use AI in the workplace. It added that the employees, who struggle to keep up with the pace and the volume of the work, believe that “AI saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work.”It is worth noting that while 79 per cent of leaders agree that “AI adoption is critical to remain competitive”, 59 per cent “worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI.”On the other hand, about 60 per cent claim that their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.The report noted that 78 per cent of AI users are bringing their own tools to work —""Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI)”It added, “A majority of leaders (55%) are concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering and creative design feeling the pinch most. And professionals are looking. Forty-six per cent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead — an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021.”The research found “Four types of AI users” — from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively.“Over 90 per cent of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren't doing it on their own. These users are 61 per cent more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53 per cent more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function, and 35 per cent more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function,” added the report.LinkedIn has witnessed a significant rise in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles. In addition, most leaders, on the other hand, claim that they won't hire an employee without AI skills.The report added, “But with many leaders worried their company lacks an AI vision, and employees bringing their own AI tools to work, leaders have reached the hard part of any tech disruption: moving from experimentation to tangible business impact.”Also ReadTerminal Cancer Patient's Brain Surgery Delayed By Microsoft OutageSamsung’s Future AI Smartphones to Be ‘Radically Different’ From Existing Phones: ReportMicrosoft Reportedly Exploring Cloud-Only, Family Plan and Ad-Supported Xbox Game Pass TiersPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Thursday, May 2, 2024. Microsoft will invest $2.2 billion over the next four years in Malaysia’s new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as partnering with the government to establish a national AI center, Nadella said Thursday.
Having knowledge about how to use artificial intelligence as a skill is becoming more desirable in the Houston area, according to the latest Work Trend Index report from Microsoft and LinkedIn.
More workers are writing AI skills on resumes and applying them to their jobs. According to the report, about 73% of knowledge workers in Houston say they use AI at work. That’s a little above the national average of 71%.
Robert Schapiro is the Microsoft Senior Director of Energy and Resources locally. He said AI can be used in many ways.
“In day-to-day roles, people use AI to do less administrative work, like sifting through emails, and now they have more time to use their creativity and technical skills,” he said.
AI can range from editing software like Grammarly to server robots at hotels and restaurants. Schapiro added that on a national level, there’s been a dramatic increase in LinkedIn users adding skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their profiles.
At least one local university has been working on various projects and studies to implement AI in different industries. A study from the University of Houston last year found AI could change the way people book reservations. And earlier this year, TxDOT provided a $500,000 grant to the university to look into how highway bridge inspections can be improved with AI.
“A lot of what we do in Houston involves industrial operations with workers in the field who are assessing and fixing equipment,” Schapiro said. “Now, they can use AI that has been trained on their own maintenance manuals and employees can chat with an AI assistant to diagnose and solve issues without having to call back to headquarters.”
Schapiro said around half of Houston-area leaders are still worried their organization’s leadership does not have a plan and vision to implement AI. In addition, regulation both in the U.S. and internationally is still lacking across various industries.
Earlier this year, the European Union approved the first comprehensive artificial intelligence legislation. And last year, some actors’ and writers’ strikes stemmed from concerns about how AI is used in creative industries.
Still, Schapiro said a little over two-thirds of Houston-area leaders believe their company needs to implement AI.
“Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract and retain the best talent. And professionals who skill up will have the edge,” Schapiro said.
The full report and Houston-area findings can be found online.

Login     Listen to this article 5 min    Jade Rosocha is sometimes embarrassed to admit how often she uses generative artificial intelligence at work.The executive at life insurer TAL uses Microsoft Copilot “maybe every second hour” to transcribe meetings, write emails and help her produce strategic plans.TAL executives Hinesh Chauhan and Jade Rosocha are frequent users of Microsoft Copilot.  Dominic Lorrimer“I don’t use it for scheduling because I’m quite an organised person by nature. [But] I use it to bridge gaps in other capability areas, such as content design and creative work,” said Ms Rosocha, who is TAL’s general manager of infrastructure, operations and service excellence.Ms Rosocha told The Australian Financial Review she also used Copilot – which is embedded in Microsoft Teams and all Microsoft 365 apps – to find action points in emails she might have missed.“I use it to trawl through all of the information in the new emails that may have popped into my inbox, and to give me a summary of anything I should be particularly aware of,” she said.Related QuotesAdvertisementNew research from Microsoft, based on responses from more than 31,000 employees across 31 countries, suggests 84 per cent of knowledge workers in Australia now use generative AI at work, compared with a global average of 75 per cent.But employees such as Ms Rosocha are members of a more exclusive group.These “power users” use generative AI at least several times a week and consequently save more than 30 minutes a day, according to Microsoft.The other common types of AI users are: sceptics, who rarely use AI; novices, who use it a few times each month and say it saves them no more than 30 minutes a day; and explorers, who use it up to once a week and say it saves them between five and 30 minutes each day.Microsoft’s modern work director, Lucy Debono, said a standout finding from the research was that almost nine in 10 power users were “bookending” their day with AI.“They’re showing up and structuring their day with AI, and [also] looking ahead to the next day and using AI to prepare there,” she said.AdvertisementPower users were also 66 per cent more likely than other users to ask AI to redesign their business processes and workflows, 56 per cent more likely to use it to catch up on missed meetings and 51 per cent more likely to use it to analyse information.Other common applications included designing visual content, brainstorming or problem-solving, and using it while interacting with customers.Experimentation is keyBut the No.1 predictor of someone’s power user status was their willingness to experiment with different ways of using AI.“If they use it and don’t get the response or return they wanted the first time, they’ll keep going,” Ms Debono said.Power users were also 49 per cent more likely than others to frequently pause and ask themselves whether AI could help with a task before starting it, and 56 per cent more likely to research and try new prompts.AdvertisementTAL chief information officer Hinesh Chauhan, another self-confessed power user, said experimentation was a key component of the insurer’s gradual adoption of Microsoft Copilot. The company has given the tool to 300 of its 3000 employees.In February, after 12 weeks of using Copilot, six in 10 employees reported the tool had made them more productive, and the same number said it allowed them to focus on more satisfying work. Meanwhile, 58 per cent said they would not want to go back to working without Copilot, up from 38 per cent after four weeks.“One of our goals was to put the technology in the hands of the users very quickly, and to start building a repository of [potential] use cases,” Mr Chauhan said. “Just let them have a crack at it and see how they’re using it, with safety and guardrails in place.”He said employees were saving between one and six hours a week by using the tool, depending on their role, with the greatest time savings enjoyed by workers who analysed, sorted and summarised a high volume of documents.Common applications include asking Copilot to suggest points to consider before joining a meeting, asking for feedback on a presentation and getting the tool to produce different sets of meeting notes for different types of stakeholders.“People are choosing then to spend that time [having] more quality conversations with their customers, their partners, [and there’s] more time for learning and development,” Mr Chauhan said, adding that Copilot was taking on the tasks that employees “would rather not do”.“Our people are self-selecting to do the higher-order, higher-value activities that bring them a bit more joy in their work. So that’s a real advantage of using this technology.”RelatedConsultants using AI do better, especially underperformers: studyRelatedWhat this law firm learnt from experimenting with AIExpert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowEuan Black is a work and careers reporter at The Australian Financial Review.

Balancing Innovation and Employment: Navigating the Impact of Artificial Intelligence

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there’s a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymakers worldwide.
Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.
However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. 
As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there’s a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.
Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. 
This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.
In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work.
Reskilling and upskilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and upskilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.
Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. 
Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.
As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. 
While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation.
AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are, however, legitimate concerns about its impact on job markets and economic inequality. To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.

In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing coverage of prompt engineering strategies and tactics that aid in getting the most out of using generative AI apps such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Gemini, Claude, etc.


Here’s the deal this time.

I’ve carefully compiled a comprehensive list of the best-in-class prompt engineering techniques and associated skills, aiming to provide you with a quick and easy-to-understand explanation. I’ve also included handy-dandy online links in case you want to learn more. There are a ton of captivating nitty-gritty details that you can dish into.

All told, this is my all-in-one package for those of you who genuinely care about prompt engineering.

Loyal readers might remember my prior recap of prompt engineering techniques, see my detailed discussion at the link here. I covered thirty keystone prompting approaches. You’ll be pleased and hopefully elated to know that this latest incarnation contains fifty essential prompting approaches and incorporates that prior coverage here. As a side note, those added twenty techniques have been detailed in my column and were posted after having done that earlier all-in-one recap.
PROMOTED
Bottom line: You are in the right place now for the big picture on prompt engineering for generative AI.
I will proceed as follows.
First, I will do a brief overview of why prompt engineering is an essential skill when using generative AI. Next, I showcase in alphabetical order the fifty prompt engineering techniques that I believe encompass a full breadth of what any skilled prompt engineer ought to be aware of.

I’d wager that some of these fifty techniques are not necessarily well-known by even those who are profoundly interested in prompt engineering. Thus, to help out, I have at the end of this depiction provided a list of the Top 10 that I humbly proclaim that every sincere and seriously studious prompt engineer ought to know. I guess you could say that the rest of the remaining forty beyond the Top 10 is more so icing on the cake. Well, maybe. I still earnestly believe that any good prompt engineer should at least be comfortably familiar with the whole kit-and-kaboodle (i.e., all fifty techniques).

Okay, now then, if you are desirous of being an all-out prompt engineer, the best of the best, the top banana, here’s my lay-down-the-gauntlet challenge for you.
Are you ready for this?

I trust so.
Go through every prompt engineering technique that I lay out here. Make sure to use the provided online links and fully read the detailed indications that underpin each technique (no skipping, no idle eyeballing). Try extensively using the technique in your favored generative AI app. Quiz yourself to double-check that you really know how to use each technique. Be honest. Be fair and square.
Upon completion of that noble quest, I hereby convey upon you an honorary prompt engineering badge-of-honor and vociferously applaud you for your dedication and persistence in wanting to be the best of the best when it comes to prompt engineering.
Let’s get underway.
The Importance Of Prompt Engineering Is Woefully Understated
My golden rule about prompt engineering is this:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter.


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry.
Similarly, if you put distracting words into your prompt, the odds are that the generative AI will pursue an unintended line of consideration. For example, if you include words that suggest levity, there is a solid chance that the generative AI will seemingly go into a humorous mode and no longer emit serious answers to your questions (which, you might aim to intentionally achieve, but this should not be something that catches you unawares or by utter surprise).
I have a helpful rule-of-thumb that I repeatedly cover in my classes on the core fundamentals of prompt engineering. Here it is. Be direct, be obvious, and generally avoid distractive wording when composing your prompts.
Voila, you’ve just learned something about prompting.
Indeed, that’s what prompt engineering is all about. The idea is to abide by tried-and-true prompting techniques, strategies, tactics, and the like, doing so to get the most you fruitfully can out of using generative AI. A whole gaggle of AI researchers have painstakingly sought to perform experiments and ascertain what kinds of prompts are useful. They have also generally identified prompts that are either not useful or, worse still, prompts that will waste your time and effort (plus, if you are paying to use generative AI, will needlessly cost you for the computational processing cycles wastefully consumed).
Getting back to my above recommendation about using direct wording for your prompts, being mindlessly terse should be cautiously employed. You see, being overly sparse can be off-putting due to lacking sufficient clues or information. When I say this, some eager beavers then swing to the other side of the fence and go overboard in being verbose in their prompts. That’s a problem too. Amidst all the morass of details, there is a chance that the generative AI will either get lost in the weeds or will strike upon a particular word or phrase that causes a wild leap into some tangential realm.
Of course, I am not saying that you should never use detailed prompts. That’s silly. I am saying that you should use detailed prompts in sensible ways, such as telling the generative AI that you are going to include necessary details and forewarning the AI accordingly.
All in all, I advocate the decidedly sensible practice of the Goldilocks style of prompting. Do not have porridge that is too hot or too cold. The nature of your prompt should be just right, befitting the circumstance at hand. Thanks go to Goldilocks and those three bears for their clairvoyance about the future and the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs).
I like to emphasize at my speaking engagements that prompts and dealing with generative AI is like a box of chocolates. You never know exactly what you are going to get when you enter prompts. The generative AI is devised with a probabilistic and statistical underpinning which pretty much guarantees that the output produced will vary each time. In the parlance of the AI field, we say that generative AI is considered non-deterministic.
My point is that, unlike other apps or systems that you might use, you cannot fully predict what will come out of generative AI when inputting a particular prompt. You must remain flexible. You must always be on your toes. Do not fall into the mental laziness of assuming that the generative AI output will always be correct or apt to your query. It won’t be.
Some naysayers opt to discard prompt engineering because the prompting techniques do not ensure an ironclad guarantee of working perfectly each time. To those malcontents, they seem to dreamily believe that unless a fully predictive tit-for-tat exists, there is no point in learning about prompting. That’s the proverbial tossing out the baby with the bathwater kind of mentality and misses seeing the forest for the trees.
Prompt engineering gives you an edge. An important and quite productive edge.
The techniques and approaches of prompt engineering provide a fighting chance at getting things done efficiently and effectively while using generative AI. Sure, the precepts and recommendations are not a one-hundred percent assurance. Those who shrug their shoulders and fall into random attempts at prompting will end up getting their just deserves. They will likely spin their wheels endlessly and ultimately give up using generative AI in self-disgust. Rather than doing an introspective examination that they opted to toss asunder prompt engineering, they will likely bemoan that generative AI is confusing, confounding, and ought to be avoided.
The thing is, we aren’t going to be able to simply decide to avoid generative AI. Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous. Period, end of story.
Adapt or become roadkill.
There is another oft-speculated claim that there is no need to learn prompt engineering because advances in AI technology are going to make prompting obsolete.
Allow me a moment to address this expressed concern.
Some people say that there is no need to learn about the composing of good prompts. The usual rationale for this claim is that generative AI will be enhanced anyway by the AI makers such that your prompts will automatically be adjusted and improved for you. This capacity is at times referred to as adding a “trust layer” that surrounds the generative AI app, see my coverage at the link here.
The loudly aired opinion is that soon there will be promulgated AI advances that can take the flimsiest of hand-composed prompts and still enable generative AI to figure out what you want to do. The pressing issue therefore is whether you are wasting your time by learning prompting techniques. It could be that you are only on a short-term ticking clock and that in a year or so the skills you homed in prompting will be no longer needed.
In my viewpoint, and though I concur that we will be witnessing AI advances that will tend toward helping interpret your prompts, I still believe that knowing prompt engineering is exceedingly worthwhile.
Here’s why.
First, you can instantly improve your efforts in today’s generative AI, thus, a speedy and valuable reward is found at the get-go. The payoff is immediate.
Second, we don’t know how long it will take for the speculated AI advances to emerge and take hold. Those who avoid prompting improvements of their own volition are going to be waiting on the edge of their seat for that which might be further in the future than is offhandedly proclaimed (a classic waiting for Godot).
Third, I would vigorously suggest that learning about prompting has an added benefit that few seem to be acknowledging. The more you know about prompting provides a nearly surefire path to knowing more about how generative AI seems to respond. I am asserting that your mental model about the way that generative AI works is embellished by studying and using prompting insights. The gist is that this makes you a better user of generative AI and will prepare you for the continuing expansion of where generative AI will appear in our lives.
I hope the above has whetted your appetite for digging into my compiled list of the best of the best for prompt engineering techniques.
Comprehensive List Of Essential Prompt Engineering Techniques
Enough of the preparatory chitchat, some of you are perhaps thinking, let’s get to the brass tacks. Let’s see the bonanza. Show me or step away.
In alphabetical order and without further ado, I present fifty keystone prompt engineering techniques.
Each comes with a brief sentence or two as an explanation of the essence of the technique. I also provide a handy link for the full-on details, including examples. In terms of the naming or phrasing of each technique, there isn’t a standardized across-the-board accepted naming convention, thus I have used the name or phrases that I believe are most commonly utilized. The aim is to try invoking a generalized indication so that you’ll be immediately in the right ballpark of what the technique references.
Have fun.
Here we go.
Add-On Prompting
You can use special add-ons that plug into generative AI and aid in either producing prompts or adjusting prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of add-ons for prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Hallucination Avoidance Prompting
One of the most pressing problems about generative AI is that the AI can computationally make up falsehoods that seem to be portrayed as truths, which is an issue known as AI hallucinations (I disfavor the catchphrase because it tends to anthropomorphize AI, but it is unfortunately caught on as a phrase and we seem to be stuck with it). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of AI hallucinations, see my extensive coverage at the link here, the link here, and the link here. **
Beat the “Reverse Curse” Prompting
Generative AI is known for having difficulties dealing with the reverse side of deductive logic, thus, make sure to be familiar with prompting approaches that can curtail or overcome the so-called “reverse curse”. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of beating the reverse curse prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
“Be On Your Toes” Prompting
The phrase “Be on your toes” can be used to stoke generative AI toward being more thorough when generating responses, though there are caveats and limitations that need to be kept in mind when using the prompting technique. For various examples and further detailed indications about “be on your toes” prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Browbeating Prompts
A commonly suggested prompting technique consists of writing prompts that seek to browbeat or bully generative AI. You need to be cautious in using such prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about browbeating prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Catalogs Or Frameworks For Prompting
A prompt-oriented framework or catalog attempts to categorize and present to you the cornerstone ways to craft and utilize prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompt engineering frameworks or catalogs, see my coverage at the link here.
Certainty And Uncertainty Prompting
You can explicitly indicate in your prompt that you want generative AI to emit a level of certainty or uncertainty when providing answers to your questions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the hidden role of certainty and uncertainty when prompting for generative AI, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Density (CoD) Prompting
A shrewd method of devising summaries involves a clever prompting strategy that aims to bolster generative AI toward attaining especially superb or at least better than usual kinds of summaries and is known as Chain-of-Density (CoD). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of CoD or chain-of-density prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) Prompting
A variation on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) consists of the Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) prompting technique, which seems to reduce the degree of generative AI hallucinations. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of chain-of-feedback prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been heralded as one of the most important prompting techniques. When you enter a prompt, you invoke CoT by simply telling generative AI to work in a stepwise fashion. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Thought Factored Decomposition Prompting
You can supplement conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with an additional instruction that tells the generative AI to produce a series of questions and answers when doing the chain-of-thought generation. Your goal is to nudge or prod the generative AI to generate a series of sub-questions and sub-answers. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of chain-of-thought by leveraging factored decomposition, see my coverage at the link here).
Chain-of-Verification (CoV) Prompting
Chain-of-Verification (known as COVE or CoVe, though some also say CoV) is an advanced prompt engineering technique that in a series of checks-and-balances or double-checks tries to boost the validity of generative AI responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of CoV or chain-of-verification prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Conversational Prompting
Be a fluent and interactive prompter, while avoiding the myopic one-and-done mindset that many unfortunately seem to adopt when using generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of conversational prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
DeepFakes To TrueFakes Prompting
You undoubtedly know about Deepfakes, while a different angle involves establishing via generative AI a Truefake, namely a fake version of yourself that is “true” in the sense that you genuinely want to have your fake digital twin devised. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of going from Deepfakes to Truefakes via prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP) And Hints
Using subtle or sometimes highly transparent hints in your prompts is formally known as Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP) and can substantially boost the generative AI responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of hints or directional stimulus prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Disinformation Detection And Removal Prompting
The volume of disinformation and misinformation that society is confronting keeps growing and lamentedly seems unstoppable. A notable means of coping consists of using generative AI to be your preferred filter for detecting disinformation and misinformation. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompting to detect and mitigate the flow of misinformation and disinformation, see my coverage at the link here.
Emotionally Expressed Prompting
Does it make a difference to use emotionally expressed wording in your prompts when conversing with generative AI? The answer is yes. And there is a logical and entirely computationally sound reason for why generative AI “reacts” to your use of emotional wording. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of emotionally worded prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
End-Goal Prompting
A highly recommended prompting strategy consists of identifying what your end goal is while working in generative AI and aiming to solve or delve into a particular topic or problem of specific interest. For various examples and further detailed indications about end-goal planning, see my coverage at the link here.
Essay-Compression Prompting
Sometimes instead of getting a summary, you want to have an essay compressed, meaning that it contains the same words as the original source but tosses out words that aren’t necessarily needed per se. For various examples and further detailed indications about essay-compression prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Fair-Thinking Prompting
You can use clever prompts that will get generative AI to lean in directions other than the already predisposed biases cooked into the AI, aiming to get a greater semblance of fairness in the generated responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of fair-thinking prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Flipped Interaction Prompting
You can flip the script, as it were, getting generative AI to ask you questions rather than having you ask generative AI your questions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of flipped interaction, see my coverage at the link here.
Generating Prompts Via Generative AI
Rather than directly composing your prompts, you can ask generative AI to create your prompts for you. This requires knowing what kinds of prompting will get you the best AI-generated prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about generating prompts prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Illicit Or Disallowed Prompting
Did you know that the licensing agreement of most generative AI apps says that you are only allowed to use the generative AI in various strictly stipulated ways? For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of what is considered illicit prompts (i.e., that you aren’t supposed to use), see my coverage at the link here.
Imperfect Prompting
Imperfect prompts can be cleverly useful. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of imperfect prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
Importing Text As Prompting Skill
There are circumstances involving importing text into generative AI that require careful skill and necessitates the right types of prompts to get the text suitably brought in and properly infused. For various examples and further detailed indications about importing text prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Interlaced Conversations Prompting
Most of the popular generative AI apps require that each conversation be distinct and separate from your other conversations with the AI. The latest trend entails allowing for the interlacing of conversations and requires rethinking how you compose your prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about interlaced conversation prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Kickstart Prompting
A wise move when prompting is to grease the skids or prime the pump, also known as kickstart prompting, which involves doing an initial prompt that gets generative AI into the groove of whatever topic or problem you want to have solved. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of kickstart prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Least-to-Most Prompting
Least-to-Most prompting (LTM) is a technique that involves guiding generative AI to work on the least hard part first and then proceed to the harder part (an alternative approach is Most-to-Least or MTL prompting). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of LTM and MTL prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Macros In Prompts
Similar to using macros in spreadsheets, you can use macros in your prompts while working in generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompt macros, see my coverage at the link here.
Mega-Personas Prompting
Mega-personas consist of the upsizing of multi-persona prompting. You ask the generative AI to take on a pretense of perhaps thousands of pretend personas. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of mega-personas prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Multi-Persona Prompting
Via multi-persona prompting, you can get generative AI to simulate one or more personas. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of multi-persona prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Overcoming “Dumbing Down” Prompting
Knowing when to use succinct or terse wording (unfairly denoted as “dumbing down” prompting), versus using more verbose or fluent wording is a skill that anyone versed in prompt engineering should have in their skillset. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of averting the dumbing down of prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
Persistent Context And Custom Instructions Prompting
You can readily establish a context that will be persistent and ensure that generative AI has a heads-up on what you believe to be important, often set up via custom instructions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of persistent context and custom instructions, see my coverage at the link here.
Plagiarism Prompting
Your prompts can by design or by happenstance stoke generative AI toward producing responses that contain plagiarized content. Be very careful since you might be on the hook for any liability due to plagiarism. For various examples and further detailed indications bout the nature and use of prompts that might stir plagiarism, see my coverage at the link here and the link here. **
Politeness Prompting
A surprising insight from research on generative AI is that prompts making use of please and thank you can stir AI to produce better results. Make sure to use politeness while prompting, though do not go overboard and be judicious in such wording. For various examples and further detailed indications about politeness prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Privacy Protection Prompting
Did you realize that when you enter prompts into generative AI, you are not usually guaranteed that your entered data or information will be kept private or confidential? For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompts that might give away privacy or confidentiality, see my coverage at the link here.
Prompt Shields and Spotlight Prompting
The emergence of prompt shields and spotlight prompting has arisen due to the various hacking efforts trying to get generative AI to go beyond its filters and usual protections. Here’s a useful rundown of what you need to know. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of prompt shields and spotlighting prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Prompt-To-Code Prompting
You can enter prompts that tell generative AI to produce conventional programming code and essentially write programs for you. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompting to produce programming code, see my coverage at the link here.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prompting
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is hot and continues to gain steam. You provide external text that gets imported and via in-context modeling augments the data training of generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), see my coverage at the link here.
Self-Reflection Prompting
You can enter a prompt into generative AI that tells the AI to essentially be (in a manner of speaking) self-reflective by having the AI double-check whatever generative result it has pending or that it has recently produced. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of AI self-reflection and AI self-improvement for prompting purposes, see my coverage at the link here.
Show-Me Versus Tell-Me Prompting
Show-me consists of devising a prompt that demonstrates to the generative AI an indication of what you want (show it), while tell-me entails devising a prompt that gives explicit instructions delineating what you want to have done (tell it). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the show-me versus tell-me prompting strategy, see my coverage at the link here.
Sinister Prompting
People are using sinister prompts to get generative AI to do foul things such as scams and the like. I don’t want you to do this, but I also think it is valuable for you to know what sinister prompts do and how they work, alerting you to avoid them and not inadvertently fall into the trap of one. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of sinister prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) Prompting
Via a prompt akin to Chain-of-Thought (CoT), you tell the generative AI to first produce an outline or skeleton for whatever topic or question you have at center stage, employing a skeleton-of-thought (SoT) method to do so. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the skeleton-of-thought approach for prompt engineering, see my coverage at the link here.
Star Trek Trekkie Lingo Prompting
An unusual discovery by researchers showcased that using Star Trek Trekkie lingo in your prompts can improve generative AI results. Downsides exist and can undercut your efforts by inadvertent misuse or overuse of this technique. For various examples and further detailed indications about Trekkie prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Step-Around Prompting Technique
At times, the prompts that you seek to use in generative AI are blocked by the numerous filters that the AI maker has put in place. You can use the step-around prompting technique to get around those blockages. For various examples and further detailed indications about step-around prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
“Take A Deep Breath” Prompting
The prompting phrase of “Take a deep breath” has become lore in prompt engineering but turns out that there are limitations and circumstances under which this wording fruitfully works. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the take a deep breath prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Target-Your-Response (TAYOR) Prompting
Target-your-response (TAYOR) is a prompt engineering technique that entails telling generative AI the desired look-and-feel of to-be-generated responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of TAYOR or target-your-response prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting
Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) is an advanced prompting technique that involves telling generative AI to pursue multiple avenues or threads of a problem (so-called “thoughts”) and figure out which path will likely lead to the best answer. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of ToT or tree-of-thoughts prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Trust Layers For Prompting
Additional components outside of generative AI are being set up to do pre-processing of prompts and post-processing of generated responses, ostensibly doing so to increase a sense of trust about what the AI is doing. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of trust layers for aiding prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Vagueness Prompting
The use of purposefully vague prompts can be advantageous for spurring open-ended responses that might land on something new or especially interesting. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of vagueness while prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
End of List
Whew, that’s quite a comprehensive list.
It ranged from A to Z (kind of, the last item starts with the letter V, though I was tempted to purposely make a prompting technique name that began with the letter Z, just for fun).
I ask that you mindfully contemplate the list.
Did you see techniques that were akin to seeing old friends?
Did you see techniques that were new to you and caught your attention?
Let’s discuss the list further.
Numbering The Prompt Engineering Techniques While In Alphabetical Order
The above list of prompt engineering techniques was shown in alphabetical order.
I did so for ease of reference. If you perchance knew the name or phrase of a particular prompt engineering technique, I sought to make life easy for you to find the technique by looking alphabetically for it. I didn’t number them because I was worried that the numbering would imply a semblance of importance or priority. I wanted the above listing to seem that all the techniques are on an equal footing. None is more precious than any of the others.
Lamentedly, not having numbers makes life harder when wanting to quickly refer to a particular prompt engineering technique. So, I am going to go ahead and show you the list again and this time include assigned numbers. The list will still be in alphabetical order. The numbering is purely for ease of reference and has no bearing on priority or importance.
There is another reason too for me to number the list. I had earlier suggested that you might want to step by step make sure that you are familiar with each of the prompt engineering techniques.
Here’s how I suggest that you proceed.
I’d recommend that you use the numbered list shown next. Import the list into your favorite spreadsheet.
Make a column that you can mark as to whether you are familiar with the specific technique, do so by using a plain score ranging from 0 to 5, wherein 0 is that you don’t know it at all, while the highest score of 5 is that you know it like the back of your hand. Be straightforward and don’t give a fake score. Put your real score. This list is solely for your own benefit.
Make another column that has a score showing what you want to become in that technique (suppose for example that you start as a self-rated 1 on a particular technique and want to end up at a self-rated 4). Finally, add an additional column that will contain a target date of when you hope to attain the heightened score.
You can now use that spreadsheet as your career planning guide for prompt engineering purposes. Keep it updated as you proceed along in your adventure as a prompt engineer who wants to do the best that you can.
Whether you undertake that treasured challenge or not, here’s the list with numbers shown as pure reference and the list is still in the same alphabetical order as shown above:

It is an impressive list.
I also realize it might seem like a daunting list. I can hear the commentary that this is way too much and there is no possible way for you to spend the needed time and energy to learn them all. You have your day job to deal with. You have work-life balances that need to be balanced. Etc.
Yes, I hear you.
Let’s discuss what I consider to be the ten most important.
My Recommended Top 10 Of The Best You Need To Know
I will next show you my list of the Top 10.
The numbering now does in fact denote a priority or importance.
Please don’t confuse the numbering of the above alphabetical list with the numbering of the below list. The numbers above were for the sake of convenience. The numbers below are for distinguishment of importance or priority.
I still opted to keep the below in alphabetical order. This certainly is highly debatable and you might argue that the Top 10 should be reordered based on their relative position. Sure, I get that. When I next give a public presentation on this matter, I’ll be happy to do such a live rearrangement and we can dexterously debate the sequence at that time.
Here are my Top 10 of the best of the best for prompt engineering techniques:


(1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (listed above as L-10).
(2) Chain-of-Verification (CoV) Prompting (listed above as L-12)
(3) Emotionally Expressed Prompting (listed above as L-17)
(4) End-Goal Prompting (listed above as L-18)
(5) Flipped Interaction Prompting (listed above as L-21)
(6) Generating Prompts Via Generative AI (listed above as L-22)
(7) Mega-Personas Prompting (listed above as L-30)
(8) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prompting (listed above as L-39)
(9) Step-Around Prompting Technique (listed above as L-45)
(10) Trust Layers For Prompting (listed above as L-49)


I am saying that you should know each of those by heart.
They should be like falling off a log. Roll up your sleeves and get to work. Commit them to memory. Use them daily, as needed.
Allow me a moment to say a bit more. I frankly agonized at coming up with a Top 10. All fifty on the list are, to me, of great merit and well worth knowing. It saddens me to see some in the list of fifty that did not make my Top 10. They are all deserving of being in the Top 10.
So, please do not treat the remaining forty as though they are inconsequential. It would break my heart. If you can, get to know them all.
Conclusion
Lifelong learning.
That’s what everyone is talking about these days. We are told time and again that we need to be lifelong learners. By gosh, I wholeheartedly agree.
This comes up here because the latest and greatest in prompt engineering is constantly changing. There are new ideas brewing. New AI research efforts are pending. It is a glorious time to be using generative AI.
I pledge that I will keep covering prompt engineering and bringing to you the newest prompts, along with whether they work or flop. I’d bet that in the next few months ahead, at least a half dozen new prompts will be identified and garner worthy attention.
Keep your eyes and ears open, and I’ll do my best to make sure you can be a lifelong learner, faithfully and profitably.

The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) reports that up to eight million workers in the UK could be vulnerable as the technology becomes capable of performing their tasks. But in Cambridgeshire, a company is using AI to try to extend the working life of people with physical jobs. Being a mechanic can be tough on the body. There is a lot of bending, lifting and stretching in order to work underneath vehicles. Jobs like these can lead to muscular-skeletal problems, which cause pain in the back, joints and muscles. In 2022-23 it was affecting 473,000 workers in the UK.Some people are forced to give up jobs they love because of it, but at German Autowerks in Kimbolton they have used AI to try to prevent that.German Autowerks has invested in technology to protect staff from workplace injuryTechnicians were filmed as they carried out their everyday tasks. AI then analysed the video and identified the pressure points and potential problem areas on the body.  The company then used the information to select specific exoskeletons from the open market for staff to wear - they are powered harnesses which take some of the strain of the job away from the body.Technician John McGoughey said the exoskeleton made heavy tasks much easierJohn McGaughey, a technician, said ""after a few minutes it's like wearing clothing, you don't realise it's there"".""A wheel is about 20kg but this makes it feel half the weight, and you can enjoy the work because you're not feeling the aches and pains,"" he said.The AI technology was provided by Hertfordshire-based Stanley Handling, which believed systems such as these would become standard Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in future - like a hard hat or hi-vis jacket. Andre Jutel said AI technology could help an ""ageing workforce""""It's about protecting people,"" said the company's solutions consultant, Andre Jutel.""There are a lot of difficult manual jobs out there and we have an ageing workforce. The average worker may not be able to retire at 65 - it might have to be 75. This type of technology assists them in working for longer.""But could and should jobs like this be automated instead? Andre Jutel said in some cases it was impossible or impractical, adding: ""Businesses are dynamic. They change and certain tasks aren't needed any more. ""I've seen a £100,000 piece of machinery become redundant in a few months because it's designed for a set purpose. Humans are flexible and adaptable - that's why we think it's better to focus on helping them."" Getty ImagesThe Institute of Public Policy Research said women were likely to be more affected by AI-related job lossesArtificial intelligence already assists workers in many professions. Doctors use it to help diagnose and treat patients, police forces use it to perform admin tasks and free up officers, teachers use it to save time on lesson planning and farmers use it to predict harvesting times. In each of these situations, and with the ergonomic analysis of the mechanics, AI performs tasks faster than a human could - but a person always checks the results. There are concerns that without policy to protect them, many jobs will be lost to AI rather than supported by it. Last year, BT announced plans to replace thousands of jobs with AI technology.Ocado GroupAI is used to help robotic arms grab the correct items at the Ocado warehouse in LutonThe Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) believes that secretarial, customer service and administrative roles are most imminently at risk, which affects a greater proportion of women.  Carsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR, said: ""AI is set to be a game changer for millions of us. Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it.""A jobs apocalypse is not inevitable - government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well. If they don't act soon, it may be too late.""The government wants the UK to be a global leader in AI. The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said: ""AI is helping to make our jobs safer and more satisfying... but we must also prepare for a near future where the most powerful systems are significantly more capable. ""AI can and must remain a force for the public good, and we will ensure that is the case as we develop our policy approach in this area.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Julien Harou’s career started in geology in his current role as a water management and infrastructure researcher now straddles economics and engineering, with a particular focus on using artificial intelligence (AI) to measure Ghana’s future energy needs.Harou is relatively upbeat about progress so far towards achieving sustainable and reliable energy for all by 2030, the seventh of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by the United Nations in 2015. He points out that from 2015 to 2021, the portion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%, and last year about 30% came from renewable sources.Harou’s research at the University of Manchester, UK, incorporates computer modeling and artificial intelligence design algorithms to balance Ghana’s long term renewable energy and infrastructure needs. But AI also helps to address the environmental and human health impacts. For example, Ghana’s Volta River was dammed in the 1960s to create the Akosombo dam. But its arrival depleted fish stocks and increased weed and algae growth, providing habitat for vectors of waterborne diseases. It’s all about compromise and trade-offs, Harou tells the seventh episode of How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals, a podcast series that profiles scientists whose work addresses one or more of the SDGs.Episodes 7-12 are produced in partnership with Nature Water, and introduced by Fabio Pullizi, its chief editor.

How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7)
Fabio Pullizi: 00:09Hello, this is How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals, a podcast brought to you by Nature Careers, in partnership with Nature Water.I’m Fabio Pulizzi, chief editor of Nature Water. This is the series where we meet the scientists who have been quietly incrementally working towards the global development targets set by the United Nations in 2015.World leaders pledged to solve a range of economic, environmental and social issues, and the package of 17 Sustainable Development Goals were born.Since then, in a huge effort, thousands of researchers all over the world have been tackling the biggest problems that the planet faces today.In episode seven, we look at Sustainable Development Goal number seven: how to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.And meet an engineer who uses artificial intelligence to help Ghana design its renewable energy future.Julien Harou 01:21Okay, hi, my name is Julien Harou. I’m a professor in water management and infrastructure systems at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.I started out as pretty much a pure water resources professor. So I would look to help water companies and countries plan their their water resources and manage them.But very quickly, because of hydropower, I moved into joint water and energy systems. And water is also used for food production. So I somehow grew from water to water, energy, food. The United Nations General Assembly in 2015 developed a series of goals. And goal number seven is the one related to energy. So the formal goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy for all.And so the question quickly becomes: “Well, are we making any progress to that goal?”Well, actually, the news is relatively good. From 2015 to 2021, the portion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%.So it’s pretty decent, that means there’s a little less than than 10% of people now who don't have access to energy.The other, the other thing that was mentioned was that these goal wants sustainable energy. And what that generally means is renewable energy. So energy that doesn't require burning fossil fuels. And in 2023, about 30% of the global energy generation was from renewable energy sources.These have much lower carbon dioxide emissions. And so this is also a pretty big success, especially since….in the year 2000, so just less than 25 years ago, it was 18%. So the news for SDG goal number seven is actually pretty decent. And things are progressing rapidly.Julien Harou 03:33You can’t study in university water energy food systems, that doesn’t exist. So it’s quite, the people who are in this field, it’s generally a little bit unusual where they come from.So I was actually born in Brazil, grew up and raised in the United States. Then I trained in Belgium, my native country where my parents are from, as a geologist.And then slowly I started working in the in the water field, and then got drawn to civil engineering because I just saw the problems in the world created by infrastructure.So I went back late in life. I was a mature student, and did graduate degrees at Cornell and UC Davis.And there I really started to focus on on water and economics. And so that’s how I got slowly into this area of water, energy, food systems and human natural systems.Recently, I work mostly in Africa and Asia. And looking at how to better manage human natural systems.So, my focus is on countries where the water, the energy and the food system, and the environment are interconnected and interacting and so when you act in one, you affect the the other.The big turning point in my career is I was working on a project for the World Bank evaluating dam investments. So these are reservoirs, hydropower dams in in Nepal. And it occurred to me and to our research group that it was just not possible to evaluate the value of an investment in a hydropower dam if you didn’t consider what it was contributing to the to the wider energy system.So that’s where I stopped being a pure water engineer and moved to, you know, water, energy food systems. Because I found you couldn’t, you couldn’t evaluate how valuable a water asset was an infrastructure asset like a hydropower dam, if you didn’t consider how it was contributing to the energy system at national scale.And for example, what we’re talking about today, renewable energy. You know, hydropower is a renewable source. But it’s a renewable source that comes at a certain cost.You have to flood certain areas, you have to change the way the water regime works. And so there’s some environmental sacrifices there, and potentially human sacrifices.Surprisingly, even though I started my career as a geologist, and I really had no interest in computers whatsoever, I very quickly realized that these human natural systems are very large and very complex. And your brain just can’t wrap itself around the problem. You need computers.So strangely, from geologist, I went to kind of applied computer guy, and spent many years developing these computer simulation tools to represent how the different elements of water energy food systems work together.Finally, this led to artificial intelligence. It turns out, you can connect these simulators to these new artificial intelligence design methods.And you can find really clever ways to develop human natural systems that get lots of benefits and don't have too many negative impacts. So yeah, that was my career in a nutshell. Starting in geology and finishing in economics, engineering and artificial intelligence.There are many ways to generate energy, and water is just one of them. And in fact, people have used water and moving water to help do work throughout history.For many, many years, water was used to drive mills that would grind grain into flour to make bread. So that was the, that was the initial hydropower.Nowadays, we just convert it to electricity. And so the way it works is that water is stored at altitude, it has a lot of potential energy, it’s heavy, and it’s high up and so when it flows down, that will create kinetic energy.And hydropower is simply taking that kinetic energy and using turbines and generators to convert the kinetic energy into the electricity that we use in the electrical grids and power grids.And so essentially, hydropower is this conversion of the energy that’s in water into electricity. The big win from hydropower, and particularly storage hydropower, is that it’s a renewable source because water falls from the sky in rainfall and that water becomes then available. If it’s stored, it becomes available when you need it.Hydropower is both renewable and dispatchable. Dispatchable is a technical term from the energy sector means in summary is that you can turn it off and on when you when you want it.This is not the case for other renewable energy sources. So solar and wind energy are called variable sources or intermittent sources. That means they’re unpredictable, right? You don’t really know when it’s going to be sunny, and you don’t really know when it’s going to be windy, and it can stop being sunny or windy at any time. So that’s why those renewable sources are called variable or intermittent.It just means that there’s they are somewhat unpredictable. So hydropower is the perfect complement to that. And so, you know, that’s, that’s a good thing. It’s a good thing that hydropower is compatible in that way.And it can allow countries to really increase their, the amount of renewables they use, right? If you have a backup of hydropower, you can have more solar, you can exploit more solar and more wind power, because you know, that if all of a sudden those turn off, you can just put on your hydropower.However, that sounds like a perfect solution. But imagine what would happen if the rivers were going up and down just to react to the how much wind and sun there were.You would really change the way rivers look, you know, could become quite dangerous. You would never know if a river is going to be flowing quickly or, or slowly. It wouldn't be great for humans, but also not great for wildlife.So, yeah. So although wind, solar and hydropower can work well together, in practice you have to make sure that you’re not creating a negative impacts on humans and the environment when you when you do use them together.Ghana is a country in West Africa. It has about 32 million people, the area is about the same as as the United Kingdom, perhaps. It’s on the coast. It’s near other countries like Burkina Faso and Nigeria.And the most surprising thing with Ghana is that has the Volta River, which in 1960s, there was a large dam created there.And this dam, called the Akosombo dam, it flooded a part of the Volta River, and created an absolutely huge reservoir that you can see from space. It’s 8500 square kilometres.So it’s just a huge amount of landmass there that was lost. Of course, in exchange for power production.Nowadays, it’s about two thirds of the national production is from thermal sources. So these are things like natural gas and crude oil and diesel. But about one third is still from dams.The other thing happening in Ghana is that they are, like most other countries, rapidly trying to increase the renewable energy there. It’s currently well, because of hydropower, it’s 33%, the solar and wind is quite low now in Ghana, just a few percent.And that is trying to be increased. One issue is that the solar potential is in the north, that’s where it’s quite sunny, in the highlands there. And most of the people live near the coast in the south. Right, so in the 1960s, this really large dam was put in place. Originally, it was mostly for a large aluminum smelter. They wanted to create metal production there, and they needed a lot of energy to do so.What happens is that the whole, the river was really changed to suit their energy needs. And so the dam was operated to favour baseload hydropower. So that means you’re, you’re trying to release the same amount amount of water all the time every day to have that steady supply of energy.And that really wasn’t that great for the environment. The Volta river traditionally would have quite a bit of natural variability, it would have wet seasons, dry seasons. And so when all of a sudden it became the same amount of water flowing all year, it really affected the environment and the ecosystems and that had a few manifestations.For example, the Volta river flows down into the sea, in an estuary. And there the fact that the saltwater and freshwater stopped mixing the way they did meant that there was less fish to be caught, less clams, oysters, and the fish catch was changed and decreased.There was also unfortunately, a lot of growth of weeds and algae. The presence of aquatic weeds along the lakes and also the tributaries that flow into the Akosombo really negatively affected the local human health.These weeds provide habitat for animals like blackflies, or mosquitoes, or snails, that became or that are vectors of waterborne diseases.And there’s unfortunately several diseases that really strongly increased. One called bilharzia, one called river blindness, and malaria as well. You can definitely see how there’s a clear impact healthwise from, from the dam.Julien Harou 13:47We created a computer model of the Ghananian natural and human natural system. And we did that really to try to answer the question: “What infrastructure elements should Ghana pick up over the next 20-30 years?”So how should they get their energy in the future? How should they improve their water supplies? What infrastructure should they put in place? So really, it’s a design problem or an investment problem?And so the computer models were built specifically to answer those questions. And so, we have, you know, one river system model, which, you know, has the Volta River and other of the major rivers and the major dams.Then we had a power system model. This is like, imagine like a network of the of the grid, the electrical grid and you’re representing all the locations where energy is generated and where energy is consumed.And then we also have, you know, the accounting of the benefits that come from water and energy. So every place where you have economic production of some sort like irrigation food production, that’s also represented.And so the model will march along through time. Computer simulation of human natural systems, it's very cool.But it’s been active since the 1960s. So economists, scientists and engineers have been doing that, pretty much since the 1960s.The really cool thing that hapened in the last 10 years is artificial intelligence. You can take your integrated resorce system simulator, which is maybe kind of boring, just a computer tool that tracks resources over time. And you can connect it to AI.You can connect it to artificial intelligence design algorithms. In this case, we use one which is very cool, called evolutionary algorithms.These are algorithms which just imitate evolution. If you look at yourself or your cat, and you will see that evolution produces amazing things.And so we just use the same processes of evolution. And we encode all the potential investments into these genomes.And then we allow these genomes to exist over many generations, and let the population evolve. And so it’s kind of an artificial way to design a system where you kind of trick evolution to not evolve a species, but to evolve an infrastructure system that works very well.And so the evolutionary algorithm and the simulators just work hand in hand. And over millions of generations, they just refined the design.And after a lot of calculations, something that would take you years to do on your laptop, (we do it on supercomputers, of course, or cloud computers), you get these really evolved designs.And these will, these will recommend the synergistic ways that the water system, the energy system, and the food production system and the environmental system, how they can really synergistically and opportunistically work well together.Okay, so the the results of the study were quite interesting. The first thing the artificial intelligence did is it said, “Oh, you know, renewable energy is good, let’s generate a ton of new energy from solar power and wind power.”And so that’s the first thing it tried. It just, you know, full speed on expanding the renewable power from solar and wind.What happened then is that to produce a stable electrical grid, it needed to start having the hydropower just turn on and off.As soon as there was not enough power from wind and sun, the hydropower would just release water.And so what happened is the rivers across Ghana in the computer model became very dangerous. Flashy, flashy rivers, if you willThey would just have high flows, and then they would have low flows. And it would just change all the time. And so that’s not good for the environment. And it's not good for humans who live near the rivers. It is quite dangerous.So in the end, what the computer model found, and what we were able to tease out of these artificial intelligence, a design approach, was a compromise, really.So we looked at the trade-offs between all the performance metrics that we were tracking, all the benefits we wanted from the system. And in the end, it invested in a system that put quite a bit of biogas and solar power in the north of Ghana.A lot of winds near the coast on the southeast of the country where a lot of people live, and then created a whole series of new transmission lines across the country to kind of equalize, and, you know, to make sure that all the energy produced by in these different regions of Ghana, could, could be at the right place at the right time, if you will.And by doing that, really intelligently, it was able to really reduce the damage to rivers. And so the the hydro-peaking, or the kind of artificial river regime, was really reduced very much.In this compromise solution that was found the intermittent renewables, although they could go up to nearly 40%, that was found to be very damaging to the, to the aquatic ecosystems.And so we were able to find a solution that is more like 20 to 30%, you know, because hydropower is already over 30%.So we could get to a system by the 2030s. Ghana would be more than half of its national power would be from a renewable sources, but still it wouldn't have some of these damages that would happen if your only objective was increasing renewables.So we were happy with this compromise solution. It was getting Ghana very quickly by the 2030s to more than half of their national energy from from well over half from renewable sources, and, but without some negative impacts that might happen if you try to do that too quickly.Julien Harou 20:28At the moment the best predictions are that the renewable energy mix by 2030 will be about 42%, which is a very large amount.At the year 2000, it was only about 17%. So going from in 20, you know, in 30 years going from 17% to 42% would really be a huge success for the world.But what I think this study underlined is that because energy systems are linked to other natural resource, or other resource systems like water, food production and the environment, countries and policymakers in the UN and other places need to be very careful to not try to go too quickly and not try to change the way our human natural systems are organized, too quickly, because then you could have all sorts of negative social and economic and environmental impacts.If you try to make the change too quickly, make the transition too quickly to renewable energy, you might create some negative impacts.And so that’s really what this study tried to underline is that you should look at this the whole system, the whole country, or in some cases, in the case of power pools, where countries are working together, you should look synergistically at how the whole energy system can cooperate effectively with the water system, the food production system, the environment, and find solutions that are acceptable for all the different sectors and the regions of the country or the regions of the, or the countries in a multi-country system.We’re pretty excited about this design approach. So it’s really a computer simulation linked to artificial intelligence.It’s an exciting use of of artificial intelligence design. We think that this will make lots of contributions. There’s lots of researchers around the world who are starting to use these these methods.So we’re excited to see this work expanding throughout the world and countries making use of these, these planning and design methods to improve the way they select infrastructure investments.You know, infrastructure is very expensive, it’s there for a long time. And it’s just essential that countries not make mistakes, you know, as they push forward in the energy transition.It’s just very important that they make infrastructure investment solutions, which make the most sense for their people, for their environment, and for their economies, so that you know, they can continue to thrive and they can quickly move towards, towards you know, in the direction of the SDGs in particular SDG number seven, the one on renewable energy and sustainable energy for all.Fabio Pullizi: 23:39Thanks for listening to this series How to save humanity in 17 goals. Join us again next time when we look at Sustainable Development Goal number 8: economic growth and decent work for all.See you then.

UKG to Transform Payroll Reporting with Generative AI




Uncover insights, build reports, and make data-driven decisions by simply asking a question






May 08, 2024 11:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOWELL, Mass. & WESTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UKG, a leading provider of HR, payroll, workforce management, and culture solutions for all people, today announced during the 42nd annual Payroll Congress Convention and Expo that it is transforming payroll reporting with generative AI (GenAI). A leader in AI for HCM, UKG will make it even easier to create payroll reports in UKG Pro by allowing users to uncover insights and curate dashboards with explanations through a simple question and answer interaction.


“Payroll curates one of the richest yet most underutilized datasets in any organization, and firms of all sizes are increasingly seeking to access its deep insights to support data-driven decision-making”Post this

Conversational experiences are a cornerstone of the UKG GenAI strategy. Instead of requiring payroll teams to manually search, review, or audit large datasets for specific information, they can dramatically accelerate the process with a text-based request for information, such as “Show me employees who still receive a physical paycheck?” or “Tell me which employees have reached the social security wage limit?” By further improving a vital business process with GenAI support, accuracy is enhanced while also freeing up time to focus on other strategic priorities that help people and the organization.


“Payroll reporting often feels like seeking a needle in a haystack, and by the time the frantic search for information is over, it’s often too late to take action on the moment,” said Hugo Sarrazin, chief product and technology officer at UKG. “With generative AI, we’re dramatically reducing payroll complexity by making critical payroll data easily searchable and accessible through conversational experiences, while also putting that information into actionable context for payroll teams.”


Beyond benefits to payroll processing and reporting, GenAI is embedded throughout the Pro suite to help all employees, whether frontline or in-office, accomplish more during the flow of their everyday work. In addition to conversational search that understands a user’s language and intent in order to deliver better results, GenAI will also help organizations with:



Summarization: Highlighting common themes and trends from long-form text documents, such as feedback for performance reviews;



Classification: Recognizing various types of data based on content and context in order to identify patterns or provide guidance and recommendations on otherwise hard-to-spot trends; and



Content creation: Learning patterns based on existing data, then using that knowledge to generate new and unique content, such as job descriptions.



The AI in the Pro suite is powered by UKG Bryte, an AI assistant that is part of Pro’s architecture. UKG Bryte is trained on the world’s largest collection of people data, work data, and culture data, including three decades of Great Place To Work® benchmarks and best practices that only UKG has. By deploying an advanced AI approach built around a commitment to ethical utilization and includes UKG Bryte, leading Large Language Foundational Models from Google Cloud, and the customer’s unique data, UKG provides employees at all levels with guidance, recommendations, and proactive nudges grounded in proven strategies.


“Payroll curates one of the richest yet most underutilized datasets in any organization, and firms of all sizes are increasingly seeking to access its deep insights to support data-driven decision-making,” said Pete Tiliakos, principal analyst and strategic advisor at 3Sixty Insights. “Gen AI-enabled, conversational analytic payroll reporting is well-timed and accelerates UKG’s transformative payroll vision, which spans from global scheduling to funding and aims to augment employees, managers, and practitioners for improved workforce and business outcomes.”


UKG pay innovations, such as UKG One View — which provides an industry-first schedule-to-pay solution for multi-national businesses — will be on display from May 7-10 in UKG booth #715 during Payroll Congress.

Generative AI, now front and centre in our digital experiences, is seeing unprecedented uptake. ChatGPT has been one of the fastest growing digital services of all time. Some children use it daily, for example when doing their homework or choosing what to wear. Its capabilities and adoption set off a storm of reactions around the impact and future of AI broadly: from open letters demanding a pause on AI development to calls to protect children against its harmful content. In the face of increasing pressure for the urgent regulation of AI, and schools around the world banning chatbots, governments are asking how to navigate this dynamic landscape in policy and practice.The known issues with AI systems, such as algorithmic bias and a lack of transparency into how they work, are equally applicable to generative AI. It may even amplify some issues – like unpredictable outputs – or introduce new ones. We don’t presume to have the answers. But given the pace of AI development and adoption, there is a pressing need for research, analysis and foresight to begin to understand the impacts of generative AI on children. Here, we explore some of these current opportunities, risks and questions.















UNICEF/UNI441136/Andriantsoarana











What is generative AI and how is it being taken up?Generative AI is a subset of AI that uses machine learning to discover patterns and structure from training data and then generate new data that have similar characteristics. It has a wide range of uses, such as producing content that mimics human-generated output (including text, images, audio and computer code), completing complex planning tasks and exploring the development of new medicines.Data on how children or youth around the world are using generative AI tools are limited, but initial studies indicate it is much more than adults. A small online poll in the US indicated only 30 per cent of parents say they have used ChatGPT compared to 58 per cent of children aged 12-18. Many children reported hiding their usage from parents or teachers. In another US survey, young adults (aged 18–29) who had heard of ChatGPT reported using it more than their older counterparts, and they did so for entertainment, to learn something new and for work tasks.Generative AI can instantly create text-based disinformation that is indistinguishable from, and more persuasive in swaying people’s opinion than, human-generated content.AI is already central to children’s digital environment, through recommendation algorithms or automated decision-making systems, for example. Generative AI will no doubt take an even greater hold of their digital experiences, and at a rapid pace. First, it is being embedded as chatbots, digital assistants, personal assistants and search engines into software and apps already used by children. Snapchat introduced an ‘AI friend’ chatbot to its 375 million daily active users. Snapchat is very popular with children: almost 60 per cent of 13-17-year-olds in the US and almost half of 3-17-year-olds in the UK use it (it is the fourth most popular app in the UK after YouTube, WhatsApp and TikTok). Meta has announced plans to introduce AI agents into every product used by over 3 billion people every day, including Instagram and WhatsApp.Second, generative AI systems are being fine-tuned within specific sectors, potentially enabling more targeted and powerful capabilities. For example, Khan Academy has introduced a personal tutor in its platform that was honed from a general purpose chatbot to one particularly strong in learning conversations.What are some key opportunities and risks for children?With the increasing power and prevalence of AI, it is easy to see the many opportunities that generative AI can potentially offer children and young people directly or indirectly. For example:Personalized learning systems that can explain difficult concepts and help children develop skills, tailored to a child’s specific needs. Additionally, the systems can adapt according to the learning style and speed to maximize the child’s learning experience.Tools to support children’s play and creativity in new ways, like generating stories, artwork, music or software (with no or low coding skills).Enhanced accessibility for children and young people with disabilities who would benefit from new ways to interface and co-create with digital systems.In healthcare, early detection of health and developmental issues as children use the systems directly. Indirectly, generative AI systems can provide insights into medical data to support advances in healthcare.More broadly, the analysis and generative capabilities can potentially be applied in a range of sectors to improve efficiencies and develop innovative solutions that can positively impact children. For example, in the public sector governments could augment citizen engagement channels to allow for additional languages and a mix of text, images or audio exchanges (for people with low levels of literacy).At the same time, there are clear risks that the technology could be used by bad actors, or inadvertently cause harm or society-wide disruptions at the cost of children’s well-being and future prospects.Persuasive disinformation and harmful and illegal content at scale and lower cost. Generative AI can instantly create text-based disinformation that is indistinguishable from, and more persuasive in swaying people’s opinion than, human-generated content. In a test by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Google’s Bard generated misinformation without disclaimers when prompted on 78 out of 100 false and potentially harmful narratives, including climate, vaccines, LGBTQ+ hate and sexism. AI-generated images are now indistinguishable from – and, in some cases, deemed more trustworthy – than real faces.Looking ahead, synthetic content (for example, misleading deepfake images, audio, video and text) can potentially be personalized to individual users and, as a result, be harder to combat by automated and human moderators. Future generative AI chatbots could be programmed to impersonate humans and adapt in real-time conversations to attempt to persuade real people about issues or urge them to act. A particularly malicious case might be one-on-one chats, where unwitting individuals would be targeted and the chatbot would attend to the person’s concerns or counterarguments directly, thus likely increasing the odds of persuasion.When used by propogandists, generative AI models will likely transform online influence operations, posing a threat to democratic processes.When used by propogandists, generative AI models will likely transform online influence operations, posing a threat to democratic processes. By mimicking human-generated text, generative AI can instantly flood regulatory and legislative systems with automatically composed messages – effectively lobbying for certain interests – and drown out any human input. Meta has reported exponential growth since 2019 in the use of fake profile photos generated by GANs – generative adversarial networks).The deleterious effect of an internet awash with misleading content is an erosion in trust as the authenticity of all content is questioned, including information from UNICEF. With their cognitive capacities still in development, children are particularly vulnerable to the risks of mis/disinformation and a more uncertain, corroded, and harmful disinformation ecosystem is of great concern.Regarding illegal content, generative AI is being used to create photo-realistic child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The AI image generation models, which are open-source and can thus be operated with no protective guardrails, are trained on existing CSAM and photos of children from public social media accounts. While the volume of such content is still relatively small, given how quickly generative AI tools are developing, researchers predict the number of cases will only grow. This would flood law enforcement with new ‘fake’ CSAM, which would not only detract from their ability to handle CSAM depicting real children, but also complicates victim-identification and rescue operations.In addition, a recent FBI alert noted an uptick in reporting of sextortion, including of minors, using AI-generated images. Bad actors use existing photos (for example, from social media accounts) to generate explicit, sexually themed photos (i.e., “deepfakes”) with which to harass and blackmail victims. Reports of other types of scams are also emerging synthetic voices models are being used to con victims by impersonating real people, such as relatives, requesting money.Given the human-like tone of chatbots, where the line between animate and inanimate blurs, what are the impacts on children’s development – and privacy – when they interact with these systems? Research indicates they may influence children’s perceptions and attributions of intelligence, their cognitive development, and social behaviour – especially during different developmental stages.When generative AI confidently makes up false information, what impact does this have on children’s understanding and education, especially if they become increasingly reliant on chat-enabled tools? Generative AI has produced dangerous content: Amazon Alexa advised a child to stick a coin in an electrical socket. Snapchat’s AI friend gave inappropriate advice to reporters posing as children. Snap, the creator of Snapchat, has since put in place tools that attempt to detect “non-conforming” language, including references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying and hate speech. However, it remains an issue that many generative AI systems are already live and accessible to children while continuing to produce misleading and harmful content or interactions. More broadly, as children interact with generative AI systems and share their personal data in conversation and interactions, what are the implications for children’s privacy?Modification of children’s behaviour and worldviews – intentionally or not. AI systems already power much of the digital experience, largely in service of business or government interests. Microtargeting used to influence user behaviour can limit and/or heavily influence a child’s worldview, online experience and level of knowledge. As UNICEF has noted, “children are highly susceptible to these techniques which, if used for harmful goals, are unethical and undermine children’s freedom of expression,” freedom of thought and right to privacy. Whereas current algorithms often promote sensationalist content to maximize attention, generative AI chatbots posing as real people could first gain children’s trust and, over time, influence them in more subtle ways for commercial or political gains. The online battleground could thus “shift from attention to intimacy,” according to historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari. He is concerned that bad actors could use AI bots to manipulate real users in hidden and persuasive ways.Another professor, Seth Lazar, warns that we can expect the same challenges with search engines and social media platforms shaping people’s worldview, social interactions and experiences, only now pitched as an “agent that really knows you, and can engage with you in natural language.” Even when there isn’t bad intent, research on the use of generative AI systems to write essays shows that the biases in the models nudge users towards or against certain views in the writing process. The result is that students might be unconsciously pushed to take on certain views when using AI systems to help them learn.Disruption to the future of work upending education provision today. AI combined with robotics first impacted blue collar work in factories through automation of predictable and repetitive tasks. In recent years, the scope of labour market exposure to AI systems has widened to some professional spheres. Now it is predicted that the daily work of teachers, telemarketers and professionals in legal services and securities, commodities and investments – amongst others – will see high exposure to generative AI tools. More research and foresight are needed to anticipate the impacts of generative AI in the workplace. Its potential disruption has great relevance for children’s future work life, as well as how and what education is provided to them today.We know that since emerging technologies are not evenly distributed within and between countries, they have the potential to aggravate existing inequalitiesAside from the future, work practices in today’s AI supply chain are questionable. The quality of AI systems is dependent on accurately labeled and annotated training data, which is prepared by humans. Gig workers, often based in developing countries, assess video clips for sexual content, rate chatbot responses, identify objects within images, and upload selfies of various facial expressions, amongst other tasks. These jobs are low paying, stressful, unpredictable, unrecognized and shrouded in secrecy to protect Big Tech companies that run AI systems, bringing into question whether they constitute ethical and decent work.Aggravation of existing inequalities around the digital divide, with some children more at risk from the harmful effects of generative AI and unable to help shape its development and access its benefits. We know that since emerging technologies are not evenly distributed within and between countries, they have the potential to aggravate existing inequalities. Generative AI is no exception. Equitable, inclusive and responsible generative AI needs to cater to the different contexts and developmental stages of all children, especially those from marginalized communities, and be available to every child when beneficial. If children’s data is used to shape generative AI systems, the collection and processing of their data must be done responsibly, with clearly defined purposes, and safely, regardless of where the data come from. This will not happen through market forces alone, but only by regulation and actively addressing power imbalances and digital exclusion. UN Secretary General António Guterres believes that guardrails, grounded in human rights, transparency, and accountability, are needed to ensure that AI development “benefits all.”While this list of opportunities and risks is far from exhaustive, it illustrates that the impacts of generative AI will be wide-ranging and demand a pro-active response from those who regulate and develop AI – and related data – systems so that these empower and protect children. It also highlights the critical need for a strong advocacy and education investment to ensure that communities, children, parents, teachers, policymakers and regulators are able to engage in meaningful conversation with tech companies towards child-centred AI.Children will experience an increasingly high level of exposure to AI systems over the course of their lives, with impacts in childhood having long-term effects. Addressing their needs is critical. Looking further ahead, the way AI is shaped today will have significant bearings on future generations. As noted by Guterres, “present generations have a responsibility to ‘halt and prevent developments that could threaten the survival of future generations … [including] new technologies’”. Concerns around the future of AI-enabled warfare are particularly crucial to address.As a starting point, existing AI resources provide much direction for responsible AI today. For example, UNICEF’s Policy Guidance on AI for Children has nine requirements to uphold children’s rights in AI policies and practices and the World Economic Forum’s AI for Children toolkit provides advice to tech companies and parents. But advances in generative AI mean existing policies must be interpreted in novel contexts, and new guidance and regulations may need to be developed.Policymakers, tech companies and others working to protect children and future generations need to act urgently. They should support research on the impacts of generative AI and engage in foresight – including with children – for better anticipatory governance responses. There needs to be greater transparency, responsible development from generative AI providers and advocacy for children’s rights. Global-level efforts to regulate AI, as called for by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, will need the full support of all governments.

A key finding was that 75% of knowledge workers worldwide are already using generative AI. While some executives lament the slow uptake by workers of internally supplied generative AI solutions, they aren’t seeing the broader trend of shadow AI use. The report found that 78% of knowledge workers bring their own AI (BYOAI) to work. For GenZ, the figure is 85%. However, even Baby Boomers are BYOAI at a rate of 73%. This suggests that the behavior is broad-based. The implications of these findings are threefold: Workers are clearly seeing benefits from using generative AI.Companies that don’t successfully provide approved and integrated generative AI solutions are not fully accessing the potential value and are increasing risks that customer data or security issues will arise through unmonitored AI use. The trend of worker use of AI will be hard to reverse.Humans Will Find a WayHumans are natural problem solvers. This is particularly true when it impacts their livelihoods. The report identified several generative AI adoption drivers that indicate generative AI has become the solution to a festering problem for knowledge workers.Email overload is a continuing problem68% of employees said they struggle with the pace and volume of work69% say AI can help get them promoted faster, and  79% say AI skills broaden theirjob opportunities76% of people say they need AI skills to remain competitive in the job marketWhether or not employers are rolling out generative AI tools, the ease of access and tangible benefits of time savings and quality improvement are making the adoption inevitable. Wherever there are words that need to be read, transformed, or created, you are likely to see generative AI adoption. Workers want to streamline their tasks, and AI is helping them get through work overload, which is often the result of information overload. Employers Want Generative AI Skills A final point on generative AI adoption in the enterprise. Employers are starting to preference candidates with AI skills. Microsoft found that 66% of business leaders would not hire someone without AI skills and that they intend to use the technology to augment the capabilities of early-career employees. Whether it is to cope with high workloads, achieve more in their role, or simply look attractive to prospective employers, generative AI is becoming commonplace among knowledge workers. That adoption trend is very likely to expand and deepen.

The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn has highlighted that employees today want AI at work and that this trend is visible across industries.  More employees are adopting Generative AI tools for work, often without the knowledge or official sanction of the employers. Based on the report, 75 per cent of ‘knowledge workers’ globally are using Generative AI. This pool of users includes 85 per cent Gen Z staff and 73 per cent boomers. The report also stated that as many as 53 per cent of AI users worry that if their employer finds out, it could signal they are replaceable.  Despite this widespread under-the-radar adoption, many companies are struggling to understand AI. 66 per cent of leaders say they wouldn't hire someone without AI skills, yet only 39 per cent provide training for it, and 60 per cent of leaders worry their AI strategies are insufficient. As employees grapple with the volume of work and expected pace of execution, they are bringing their own AI to work. Based on the report, ‘bring their own AI’ here means employees using AI tools that have not been sanctioned by the companies. While most business leaders admit that AI is imperative for business, most of them believe their organisations lack the vision and planning to apply AI to their workflows. ""The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability."" 3 out of 4 people use AI at work According to the report, 75 per cent of people are already using AI at work, while 46 per cent of them started using AI less than six months ago. 78 per cent of the respondents brought their own AI to work. This shows that without proper guidance from the top, employees are taking matters into their own hands and using AI under wraps. As many as 52 per cent of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks. This shows how companies are missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale. It also puts company data at risk in an environment where an organisation’s biggest concern is cybersecurity and data privacy.  AI is setting the bar high From the employer's perspective, 66 per cent of leaders have admitted they would not hire someone without AI skills. This shows how acquiring AI skills has become key for jobseekers. Even though job loss is one of the major concerns with the rapid proliferation of AI, the report offers a balanced view.  As many as 55 per cent of leaders expressed concern about having enough talent to fill roles. These leaders hail from across functions, however, a majority (60 per cent or higher) are from cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design.  When it comes to working professionals, 45 per cent worry AI will replace their job, 46 per cent said they are considering quitting in the year ahead (higher than 40 per cent, who said the same in 2021). While many leaders said they won’t hire someone without skills, 71 per cent said that they would rather hire a less experienced person with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them.  The report also highlighted the rise of AI power users. These are users who use generative AI at least several times a week and save at least 30 minutes a day with that. The way forward Based on the rapid adoption of AI and current trends, companies should work across leadership on plans for AI skills and guardrails rather than overlooking the technology. While employees are acknowledging AI’s benefits with productivity, using it secretly shows fears about obsolescence. Even as generative AI trickles down across organisations, companies must adapt to stay ahead. ",,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/AI-jobs-1.jpg', 'caption': 'The current wave of AI has also made it important for jobseekers to be equipped with AI skills.

The impact of artificial intelligence on America’s economy has proven far more limited than doomsayers predicted. Some researchers now say the technology could help low-skilled workers more than it will hurt them. “People learn how to be productive with the technology,” says Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University. “But again, the bad news hits first.”

Artificial intelligence, while eliminating some jobs, may improve productivity and lead to better customer satisfaction. Its effect on the U.S. economy so far has proved more moderate than expected. 
Tech sector layoffs surged in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI. In February, Swedish consumer finance firm Klarna announced that AI was now handling two-thirds of its online customer chats, doing the work of 700 full-time agents. The company still relies on human workers to handle complex or sensitive cases. Displaced workers may find new jobs, but those posts may now pay less. That’s happening now for a new class of well-educated workers.Ultimately, AI may improve productivity of customer support workers and lead to better customer satisfaction and reduced worker turnover, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford University’s Digital Economy Lab.“The tools [of AI], when used correctly, will help rebuild the middle class and will help create more widely shared prosperity,” he says. 


The 2023 predictions were scary. Artificial intelligence would:
Replace 300 million full-time jobs worldwide over time.
Encroach on tasks of 2 in 5 workers.
Drive a bigger wedge between rich people and poor people.
So far, the impact of AI on the U.S. economy has proven far more limited. Examples of massive layoffs are less frequent than some expected. Some researchers now say the technology could help low-skilled workers more than it will hurt them. New technology always brings change and some people will lose their jobs even as new opportunities appear. But if the process unfolds over decades rather than a few years, then many employees and employers have time to adjust.

“Disruption is something we’ve seen over and over,” says Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University. “Over time, new industries emerge. People learn how to be productive with the technology. ... But again, the bad news hits first.”Jay Johnson, who works in advertising in Chicago, was laid off recently. His industry is pushing hard to incorporate AI chatbots, which understand and generate humanlike speech, to analyze marketing trends and generate ad copy. As the sole provider for his wife and his two young children, he’s now looking for another job.“Challenges always exist,” he says. “It’s how we adapt and move through them.”How companies are incorporating AICompanies are adopting the new technology in various ways. Some emphasize efficiency.

In March, IBM disclosed a “workforce rebalancing,” reportedly in marketing and communications, that will lay off several thousand employees. Another multinational company is using AI to step up its marketing game in South America, says Dr. Keum. Instead of launching one marketing campaign per month per country, it now targets specific consumers within those countries and updates the plans weekly.

Workers at a Medicaid call center review information regarding eligibility determinations Aug. 16, 2023, in Jefferson City, Missouri. Some companies are beginning to use artificial intelligence, or ""AI assistants,"" to handle online chats with customers.

 One sector feeling the heat: customer service. In February, Swedish consumer finance firm Klarna announced that AI was now handling two-thirds of its online chats with customers, doing the work of 700 full-time agents. Since the company uses contractors, Klarna didn’t have to fire anybody. It announced a hiring freeze instead. The company still relies on experienced workers to handle complex or sensitive cases, according to a spokesperson. It’s this human-machine collaboration – rethinking and redesigning work in light of AI – that will separate winners from losers, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford University’s Digital Economy Laboratory and co-founder of Workhelix, a consulting firm. In a research paper published last year, he and six co-authors found that the introduction of an AI assistant not only improved productivity of customer support workers at a large software firm, but also led to better customer satisfaction and reduced worker turnover. Moreover, the technology didn’t drive a wedge between the most- and least-skilled workers; it instead helped bridge the knowledge gap, Dr. Brynjolfsson adds. AI boosted productivity for new workers and the least skilled workers by 34%, while it had negligible effects for the most skilled. By investing in retraining and work redesign, while keeping people in charge, “you can create a huge amount of value for the customers,” he says. “That is a pretty optimistic story.”Where job losses are landing Which story is winning out – layoffs or happier, more productive employees – is hard to discern.Tech sector layoffs surged in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI. The pace of firings has barely diminished this year with more than 75,000 employees laid off worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker of tech layoffs started by a Bay Area entrepreneur. While companies point to various factors, such as post-pandemic restructuring and cost-cutting, they’re increasingly hesitant to mention AI.

Employees walk through Amazon's headquarters Nov. 13, 2018, in Seattle. Tech sector layoffs rose in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI.

 Why? Companies may want to avoid public backlash for replacing people with machines, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a company press release in March. The Chicago-based outplacement firm started tracking AI-related layoffs last year and found 3,900 in a single month. By the first quarter of this year, that total had dwindled to 383 for all three months.

Job losses are only part of the problem. Workers may find new jobs, but if those positions pay substantially less, their standard of living falls. That’s what happened to many manufacturing workers in the 1980s and 1990s, displaced by robotics and a wave of globalization. It’s happening now for a new class of well-educated workers.Demand for skilled AI workersThose with high-level AI skills are in strong demand from companies eager to take advantage of the technology. “We’re hiring dozens,” says Robert Murphy, chief economist for Infineo, a tech company aiming to revolutionize life insurance through AI and blockchain technology. Some companies pay the most skilled workers $900,000 or more in salary and benefits. Three-quarters of knowledge workers say they already use AI on the job, nearly double the share of just six months ago, according to a Microsoft/LinkedIn survey of workers and employers in the United States and 30 other countries released Wednesday. “2024 is the year AI at work gets real.”Other well-educated workers have found themselves on the wrong side of the technology. After earning her Ph.D in art history in 2017, Allison Harbin became a researcher for academic journals. Once ChatGPT was released publicly in 2022, a fifth of her income dried up. She took a job doing “prompt engineering” – editing AI chatbots’ responses during their training. But the pay was low, and even with a new job, her income still isn’t stable.

“I’m not even going to put this on my résumé,” she says. “Old jobs are going to be eliminated,” says Dr. Brynjolfsson of Stanford. “There’s just a lot of creative destruction and churn. [However], the tools [of AI], when used correctly, will help rebuild the middle class and will help create more widely shared prosperity.”

The stage in an industrial building at Gateway Technical College, with a manufacturing space visible behind it, was decorated with American flags, a Microsoft banner and signs that read, “President Joe Biden Investing in America.”AdvertisementMany of the remarks seemed designed to troll Trump. Biden mocked Trump for repeatedly promising to address the nation’s aging infrastructure without actually doing so.“We had infrastructure week every week for four years and didn’t build a damn thing,” he said.The White House billed the appearance as part of Biden’s “Investing in America” strategy, seeking to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who spent Tuesday posting angry messages on social media about his criminal trial for allegedly falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.Story continues below advertisementThe trip marks Biden’s fourth visit this year to the swing state of Wisconsin, where he narrowly defeated Trump in 2020.In 2018, when Foxconn, at Trump’s urging, announced plans to create 13,000 good-paying jobs in Mount Pleasant, Wis., he celebrated the company’s $10 billion venture as the “Eighth Wonder of the World.”AdvertisementWielding a golden shovel, Trump touted the Foxconn flat-panel display factory as evidence of a broad manufacturing revival stirred by his 2017 tax cuts and tariffs on imported steel. “You know, 18 months ago, this was a field, and now it’s one of the most advanced places of any kind you’ll see anywhere in the world. It’s incredible,” Trump crowed.Story continues below advertisementThe Foxconn facility was to have included dozens of buildings dotting a giant plot of land three times the size of New York’s Central Park. But the project accomplished little more than the destruction of 100 local homes and farms before the company drastically scaled back its ambitions.In 2020, Wisconsin state officials denied the Taiwanese company special tax credits, saying it had abandoned its original commitment, employed fewer than 520 people and spent just $300 million. Local taxpayers were left with a tab of more than $500 million for site preparation.AdvertisementBy last summer, Foxconn had built four structures on one corner of the site, which were in sporadic use, according to locals. One large building that was originally billed as a manufacturing facility was being used as a warehouse, one former employee said. Foxconn at the time said it employed 1,000 people in Mount Pleasant building computer servers. The flat-panel display factory never materialized.Story continues below advertisement“They dug a hole with those golden shovels and then they fell into it,” Biden quipped.Microsoft gave the site new life in March 2023, when local officials announced that the company would build a data center on about one-tenth of the roughly 3,000-acre campus. In November, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) said Microsoft would expand the investment. Wednesday’s announcement confirms that the company plans to spend $3.3 billion on the AI center by the end of 2026, according to the governor’s office.AdvertisementFor Biden, the Microsoft announcement represents evidence that his embrace of industrial policy — the use of government money and dictates to shape the economy — is paying dividends. The president steered three major pieces of legislation through Congress that will pump trillions of dollars into modernizing the nation’s roads, bridges, ports and internet connections; subsidize development of clean-energy technologies; and fund domestic production of advanced semiconductors.Story continues below advertisementTaken together, the policies represented a dramatic shift in the government’s management of the economy after four decades of bipartisan deference to market outcomes.Smith said Biden’s policies had been important for corporate expansions.“When you connect the dots between the infrastructure investment, the chips investment, the climate technology investment, the work to set new AI safety standards and cybersecurity protection — you put those things together? That actually helps substantially in enabling the whole tech sector to invest and grow and create new jobs in the United States,” he said.AdvertisementPrivate companies so far have committed to spending $866 billion on ventures related to the administration’s agenda, according to the White House. More than $537 billion in public spending has been announced, with more to come.Story continues below advertisementThe administration is directing a significant chunk of its industrial policy spending to manufacturing-dependent communities that were hit hard by competition from inexpensive Chinese imports in the 2000s. By 2020, Racine had lost roughly 20 percent of the 21,000 factory jobs it had in 2001. Manufacturing employment has recovered to almost 19,000 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Wednesday’s announcement comes as Microsoft aggressively invests in expanding its footprint in AI development, pouring billions into deals that will cement its place as a key partner for leading AI companies in the United States, Europe and Asia.AdvertisementIn a community where residents have reason to doubt heavily hyped projects, Smith said Microsoft was being careful to “under-promise and overdeliver.”Story continues below advertisementWork on the Mount Pleasant site already has begun. Construction cranes are in place, steel has arrived, and some workers have been hired, he said.Amid concerns about the environmental toll of electricity-hungry data centers, Microsoft also said it would build a 250-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin. The company vowed to ensure water was “managed responsibly” at the site, which will use recycled water for its cooling system.Microsoft — which was battered by antitrust scrutiny throughout the 1990s — has emerged as one of the most sophisticated tech lobbyists in Washington, and it is increasingly seeking to shape the future of AI regulation.As part of its investment in Racine, Microsoft will partner with Gateway Technical College to develop a program that will train residents for data center and other technical careers. The company is also building a “Co-Innovation Lab” on the campus of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, which will connect manufacturers in the state with the company’s AI experts.That undertaking will include TitletownTech, a venture capital partnership between Microsoft and the Green Bay Packers, Evers’s office said.

        Futuristic robots take over Automate 2024 AI conference, but tech experts warn of possible job losses

Watch: The cost of producing robots has reduced, while AI has advanced, and most of the technology is now available to use - leading to a possible robotics boom in the next few years  Credits: Newshub.







Automate 2024 is underway in the US, showcasing both the cutting-edge of robotics and why a sci-fi future could be a lot closer than most of us think.
But technology experts here say the rapid pace of development for robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) could lead to the collapse of some industries.
""We've seen years and years of innovation now starting to come to fruition, so the idea of humanoid robots and a range of other robots, will very quickly become mainstream,"" Gorilla Tech CEO Paul Spain told Newshub.  
""So very soon, we are just going to find robots around us as just normal, everyday life.""

While building advanced robots has been possible for decades, the AI boom of the past two years has unlocked a new frontier.
""[There are] three things that are different about robotics,"" Spain said.
""The cost of producing robots has come down dramatically; where we're at with AI, which really enables robotics, has changed; and basically we've actually reached the point where most of the technology is available - and it's really just joining up the dots and turning it on and starting using it,"" he added.
Intrinsic, an AI company owned by Google, is pairing up with the world's leading AI computer chip manufacturer - NVIDIA - for their next generation of machines.
However, experts here warn the pace of progress in both AI and robotics mean large-scale job disruption is inevitable and we need to start planning.















                Humanoid robots are quickly becoming more human-like.

""We in New Zealand need to start thinking about what sort of society we want to have where we have these very capable machines,"" warns Professor Michael Witbrock, head of the Strong Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Auckland Waipapa Taumata Rau. 
""We've never had a technology before that has the potential to do, well, practically everything, right?"" Prof Witbrock told Newshub.



""That's just true about the combination of AI and robotics and there may be missteps, there may be slow downs. But there are no obvious reasons why we're not on a path to very general capabilities at the moment."" 
Automate 2024 runs until Thursday in Chicago.

The panel warns that regulators could be caught out by the rapid pace of change, referring to the “potential disparity between the pace of technological progress and the pace of a regulatory response”.Other potential risks raised in the report include concerns around bias, reflected by the fact that widely used AI models are trained on data that “disproportionately represents western cultures”, as well as fears over losing control of AI systems.The report concludes that the near future around general purpose AI is “uncertain”, with “very positive” and “very negative” outcomes, and the decisions of societies and governments will play a key role in how the technology progresses.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job lossesComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMichigan man kills himself after running over 80-year-old Trump supporterTrump files complaint against Harris for taking over Biden’s campaign fundsUkraine war briefing: ‘Occupiers’ ship severely damaged’ in Kavkas across from CrimeaNashville struggles to respond as neo-Nazi groups turn focus on to cityTrump team makes complaint about Harris campaign funds – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growth of career options exploding in the field of AI, interest is skyrocketing. To help marketers understand how to break into the field, I sought insight from Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Resumes and The Ladders, and author of seven Amazon Careers #1 bestsellers. To address this complex issue, this is the second part of a two-part series (the first part is available here).


When asked how marketers can land a job in AI, Cenedella suggested that there are 4 things they can do.

Demonstrate Interest. “Marketers should demonstrate they are putting in the time and effort to become experts. This includes practicing daily with AI tools and proving to prospective employers that you have curiosity, capacity, and capability.”

Read. “Demonstrate that you’re reading newsletters in the field, keeping up with research on Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), and engaging in online forums.”

Update Resume and Cover Letter - Carefully. “Many people are attempting to use ChatGPT for this. That is a mistake. ChatGPT is a generic Large Language Model. Generic models produce generic results. Your resume is not the place to be average.”
PROMOTED
Use the Right Tools. “Standout AI resumes require specialized AI tools. A free AI-based resume writing service like Leet Resumes (leet.co) guides you through the process step-by-step (you don’t even have to try to figure out good resume writing prompts). It will create a resume and cover letter that sets you apart from other applicants so you can get that new job faster and easier than ever before.

In brief
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help improve work processes, yet they also carry the risks of liability, penalties, and reputational damage. Companies deploying AI must understand their responsibilities and obligations under the current regulatory frameworks within the EU and the anticipated requirements of the EU AI Act. Particularly for the HR department, it is prudent for HR managers to implement the following basic principles regarding AI.

Recommendation


Introduction of standardized AI rules
Before implementing AI, companies need to carefully plan their AI strategy and introduce internal company guidelines on AI. These guidelines should be set out in a corporate-wide AI policy and should include, among others, the following rules:

The use of AI should only be permitted following the completion of AI introductory training. Employees should only be allowed to continue using AI after completing AI training courses as prescribed by the company.
Employees may only use AI systems approved by the company and only for business purposes.
AI may only be used for certain tasks, e.g., creating tables and texts, revising presentations, summarizing articles, and creating LinkedIn posts.
Employees should ensure that end products or work results produced by AI are clearly labeled as being generated by AI.
Employees should not input business secrets, confidential information and personal data into the AI system.
Employees must check AI-generated content for accuracy and compliance with applicable laws. If they are unclear about whether the content is compliant, employees must seek the opinion of the legal department.
Employees using AI are required to consult with the legal department before publishing AI-generated content to ensure compatibility with IP rights, personal rights, and trademark rights.

Compliance with data protection
AI should only be used in the workplace if the company implements a comprehensive data security strategy. To be compliant with data protection laws, companies must take the following steps before implementing AI systems:

The company must assess the types of data categories that AI can process and ensure that the processing is based on a specific legal basis. For non-sensitive data, processing can usually be justified on grounds of legitimate interest. However, when processing sensitive data (e.g., health data, data on trade union membership, information on the origin or sexual orientation, etc.), the processing must be based on a regulation provided by law or a collective agreement (e.g., on the basis of payroll obligations or to fulfill reporting obligations to authorities) or alternatively be based on a works council agreement.
Furthermore, data processing via AI must serve a specific and legitimate purpose (e.g., organizing working timetables and shift schedules, organizing employee absences) and may only take place if necessary to achieve that purpose.
The company must also inform employees about the data that is being processed, the purpose of the data processing, the means used for the data processing, and the legal basis for the processing.
Depending on the technical capabilities of the AI system, the company must also carry out a data protection impact assessment. This is particularly necessary if the impact of AI on the workforce is difficult to assess.
When transferring employee data to third parties (e.g., the AI software is not hosted on the company’s local servers or if the company allows group companies to access employee data), the company is also obliged to agree terms with third parties on protecting customer and employee-related data. There are further obligations to consider when transferring data to third countries.
If AI systems enable automated decision-making in HR management, the company must ensure that the automated decision-making process is only a preliminary process and that the final decision is made by a human being.

In addition, employees can submit requests to the company for information about their personal data being processed. If necessary, employees can escalate their concerns to the data protection authority.
Compliance with the co-determination rights of the workforce

A company must obtain the works council’s consent via a works council agreement before implementing AI models.
Where there is no competent works council, a company needs to obtain the individual contractual consent of the employees if the AI system is invasive.
Where there is a competent works council, companies must proactively inform the works council about the following before using AI for the first time: the data categories of the processed employee data,.the software used, the specific programs installed, any evaluation and processing procedures (e.g., the possibility of linking, duplicating, changing data), and any recipients of this data.
Furthermore, the works council has a right to be consulted and advised on the health effects of the AI system on the workforce. The works council can also request access to the AI system.

Risks of non-compliance
Penalties: Employees can initiate a complaint against their employer for breaches of data protection obligations. If the data protection authority confirms the existence of violations, this may trigger administrative fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover, whichever is higher.
Damages and discrimination cases: Employees have the right to sue for damages if there are data protection violations and discriminatory AI results and to initiate discrimination proceedings before the authorities and courts.
Injunctions: In the event of non-compliance with co-determination rights, the works council can enforce the deactivation of the AI system via a court ruling, in some cases even via a preliminary injunction.
Reputational damage: Companies will not only be exposed to financial and legal risks. As proceedings before administrative authorities and courts are open to the public, it can also trigger reputational damage.
Recommendation
Several steps must be taken before implementing any AI systems to leverage their potential while ensuring HR compliance. These steps will also help organizations to prepare for their obligations under the EU AI Act. Not only is it necessary to introduce clear AI guidelines, but it is also vital to create awareness within the workforce regarding AI. This is the only way to prevent or at least reduce liability, penalties, and reputational damage. In addition, early engagement with the works council on the potential implementation of AI will help accelerate the implementation process of AI.

The journalism industry has been under immense economic pressure over the past two decades, so it makes sense that journalists have started experimenting with generative AI to boost their productivity.
An Associated Press survey published in April 2024 asked journalists about the use of generative artificial intelligence in their work. Nearly 70% of those who responded said they had used these tools to generate text, whether it was composing article drafts, crafting headlines or writing social media posts.
A May 2024 global survey conducted by the public relations firm Cision found the slice to be somewhat smaller – 47% of journalists said they’d used generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard in their work. 
But does the adoption of the technology pose any moral questions? After all, this is a business where professional ethics and public trust are especially important – so much so that there are fields of study devoted to it.
Over the past few years, my colleagues and I at UMass Boston’s Applied Ethics Center have been researching the ethics of AI. 
I think that if journalists are not careful about its deployment, the use of generative AI could undermine the integrity of their work.
How much time is really saved?
Let’s start with an obvious concern: AI tools are still unreliable. 
Using them to research background for a story will often result in confident-sounding nonsense. During a 2023 demo, Google’s chatbot, Bard, famously spit out the wrong answer to a question about new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope.
It’s easy to imagine a journalist using the technology for background, only to end up with false information.
Therefore, journalists who use these tools for research will need to fact-check the outputs. The time spent doing that may offset any purported gains in productivity.
But to me, the more interesting questions have to do with using the technology to generate content. A reporter may have a good sense of what they want to compose, so they will ask an AI model to produce a first draft. 
This may be efficient, but it also turns reporters from writers into editors, thus fundamentally altering the nature of what they do. 
Plus, there’s something to be said for struggling to write a first draft from scratch and figuring out, along the way, whether the original idea that inspired it has merit. That’s what I am doing right now as I write this piece. And I’m sad to report that I discarded quite a few of the original arguments I wanted to make, because as I tried to articulate them, I realized that they didn’t work.
In journalism, as in art, generative AI emphasizes – indeed fetishizes – the moment in which an idea is conceived. It focuses on the original creative thought and relegates the tedious process of turning that thought into a finished product – whether it’s through outlining, writing or drawing – to a machine. 
But the process of writing out a story is inseparable from the ideas that give rise to it. Ideas change and take shape as they are written out. They are not preexisting entities patiently floating around, perfectly formed, simply waiting to be translated into words and sentences.
AI’s undermining of a special relationship
To be fair, only a portion of the journalists in both surveys were using generative AI to compose drafts of articles. Instead, they were using these tools to accomplish other tasks, such as writing newsletters, translating text, coming up with headlines or crafting social media posts.
Once journalists see that the AI is quite talented at writing – and it is getting better and better at it – how many of them will resist the temptation?
The fundamental question here is whether journalism involves anything more than simply conveying information to the public. 
Does journalism also entail a kind of relationship between writers and their readers? 
I think it does. 
When a reader regularly follows the analysis of someone writing about the Middle East or about Silicon Valley, it is because they trust that writer, because they like that writer’s voice, because they have come to appreciate that writer’s thought process. 
Now if journalism involves that kind of relationship, does the use of AI undermine it? Would I want to read journalism created by what amounts to an anonymized aggregation of the internet any more than I would want to read a novel created by an AI or listen to music composed by one? 
Or, stated differently, if I read a piece of journalism or a novel or listened to a musical piece, which I thought was created by a human being, only to find out that it was largely generated by an AI, wouldn’t my appreciation or trust of the piece change?
If the practice of journalism is based on having this kind of relationship with the public, the increased use of AI may well undermine the integrity of the practice, particularly at a time when the industry is already dealing with trust issues.
Being a journalist is a noble calling that, at its best, helps sustain democratic institutions. I assume that this nobility still matters to journalists. But most readers probably would not trust AI to uphold the social role that journalism plays. 
AI does not care that “democracy dies in darkness”; it does not care about speaking truth to power.
Yes, those are cliches. But they are also widely held precepts that sustain the trade. Journalists neglect them at their peril.

Generative AI can be a skill leveller, even a force multiplier, and marketers need training to understand it. But what it can’t do is replicate core capabilities like creativity, curiosity and communication.
At Econsultancy’s second quarterly Marketing Capability Leaders Forum, senior marketers gathered to discuss the ongoing challenge and opportunity presented by generative AI.
In the event’s opening presentation, Econsultancy’s SVP Learning, Stefan Tornquist, drew attention to the gap between marketers’ use of generative AI in their day-to-day lives and the amount of training they are offered.
One survey of 1,100 US marketing professionals found that 56% of them use generative AI tools every day, while a Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) study found that 47% of European marketing teams and agencies are using AI on a regular basis.
However, according to Econsultancy’s 2024 Digital Trends research with Adobe, only 25% of marketing enterprises already have skill-building programs centred on AI (although an additional 44% say that this is a work in progress).
“This continuum is very interesting … we’ve got about twice as many people actively using ‘desktop AI’ than are getting learning around it,” Tornquist observed.
The use of generative AI by marketers (and business professionals more generally) has been shown to raise the ‘floor’ of marketing ability, giving marketers a higher baseline level of aptitude across the board. But how can enterprises succeed in raising the ‘ceiling’ – the highest quality of work that can be produced with the assistance of generative AI?
Stefan Tornquist, Econsultancy SVP Learning and Research
Generative AI as ‘force multiplier’
A landmark study conducted by Boston Consulting Group with support from Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, The Wharton School and the University of Warwick, set out to quantify the impact of using generative AI (GPT-4) in knowledge work.
Of the 758 consultants involved in the study, 90% of participants improved their performance when generative AI assisted them with a creative product innovation task, performing on average 40% better than the control group who didn’t use generative AI.
Those knowledge workers with a higher level of aptitude benefited less, only seeing a 17% improvement in quality on average (compared with 43% for lower-level performers). This shows how generative AI can have a ‘skill levelling’ effect among professionals.
However, when using generative AI for a business problem-solving task – which is deemed to be outside generative AI’s “current frontier of competence” – participants performed 23% worse on average than those not using generative AI.
Tornquist summarised the role that can be played by generative AI along two axes: mastery of generative AI itself, and mastery of the discipline it’s being applied to.

When mastery of generative AI is high but mastery of the discipline is low, genAI can be a ‘skill leveller’.
When mastery of the discipline is high but mastery of generative AI is low, generative AI acts as an assistant. “It’s a compression algorithm for the mundane,” as Tornquist put it.
When both mastery of both generative AI and the discipline are high: that’s when generative AI becomes a ‘force multiplier’.
How can marketers be exceptional in a world of generative AI?
Beyond mastery of generative AI as a tool, what makes an exceptional marketer in an era where the ‘floor’ is raised for everyone?
Tornquist divided capability into three key areas:

Core capability: what are often deemed ‘soft skills’ – critical thinking, curiosity, creativity, mindset, communication
Knowledge: understanding context and the deeper underpinnings of the marketing discipline
Skills: everything from SEO to writing subject lines.

Skills is the area currently being eroded by generative AI: “the closer we get to the screen … that’s what AI is already able to do,” Tornquist summarised. Generative AI can save marketers time spent learning how to build pivot tables by simply building a pivot table.
What generative AI can’t replicate is the core skills – which is why Tornquist prefers to use this term over ‘soft skills’. “If you were going to build a marketer, you’d start here,” he said. “They have to have critical thinking – because things move so quickly [that] the more we have smart automation doing some of the job, the more important it is that we are critical thinkers [who] know what questions to ask.
“…What I think has already started to happen post-Covid … as a result of AI, and will accelerate, is an increasing focus on knowledge and core [capabilities],” said Tornquist.
How to build core capabilities that stick
Learning is now available to marketers in more forms than ever before, but how can organisations make sure that it has a lasting impact? Tornquist outlined three key steps to take:
Learn together, at the same time
While on-demand learning can be valuable when a marketer has a specific question, it’s less useful for building an underlying foundation for those core capabilities. Additionally, retention of that knowledge can be poor once the question is answered.
By making significant parts of the learning (such as the kick-off) time-dependent and synchronised – whether in person or virtual – organisations can make sure employees are making time for learning and engaging with it.
Build an emotional connection to the learning
This can be accomplished by creating a social dynamic around learning – again, through learning alongside colleagues – and also through incorporating an applied learning component, to set learning in context.
“It’s much more inspiring to see what might happen when it’s your own data and your own problems,” said Tornquist. “And it’s a way that we’re actually going to remember what we learn.”
Implement ‘appointment learning’
Whether it’s time set aside for a week-long training course or a virtual session lasting an hour, appointment learning gives marketers permission to learn.
“[It says] ‘This is really important to us, and it’s important to you – and we’re going to make the time for you’,” said Tornquist.

According to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the past six months with 75% of global knowledge workers now utilising the technology. As per the report, 92% of knowledge workers in India are also using generative AI at work. The report claims that the employees are also independently introducing AI tools into their workflows to grapple with the increasing pace and volume of work. 72% of Indian AI users are bringing their own AI (BYOAI) to work, the report adds. However, leaders have recognised AI as a business imperative and many feel their organisations lack a clear plan and vision to transition from individual benefits to leveraging AI for significant business impact. The pressure to demonstrate immediate ROI is causing hesitation among leaders, despite the undeniable inevitability of AI.How AI has turned out to be an integral part of the workforceAI is being integrated into the workplace at an unprecedented scale. Currently, 3 out of 4 knowledge workers globally use AI in their daily tasks, with 46% having adopted it in the past six months. The report claims90% of users reported that AI helps them save time.85% said it allows them to focus on their most important work.84% find it boosts their creativity.83% enjoy their work more as a result.For instance, the most active Teams users (the top 5%) used Copilot to summarize 8 hours of meetings in March alone, equating to an entire workday.BYOAI is the new workplace trendWithout top-level guidance, employees are discreetly bringing their own AI tools to work, with 78% of AI users engaging in this practice, especially at small and medium-sized companies (80%). The report also claims that this trend spans all generations. Over half of AI users (52%) are hesitant to disclose using AI for important tasks, fearing it makes them appear replaceable (53%). This hidden AI use means missing out on strategic benefits and risks to company data, with cybersecurity being a top concern. The report claims that workload pressures are driving this behaviour, as 68% struggle with the pace and volume of work, leading to burnout. Communication tasks dominate the workday, with 85% of emails read in under 15 seconds.What leaders think about using AI in the workplaceWhile most leaders have recognised AI as essential, the pressure for immediate return on investment (ROI) causes hesitation. 79% believe AI is crucial for competitiveness, but 59% are concerned about measuring its productivity gains. This uncertainty hinders strategic planning, with 60% fearing their leadership lacks a clear AI implementation vision. Leaders familiar with AI see its potential for transformation, expecting to redesign business processes and manage AI bots within five years. They also foresee ensuring ethical AI use as a key responsibility. As employees overwhelmed by digital workloads turn to AI for relief, leaders have the opportunity to harness this momentum into tangible ROI.For this report, Microsoft and surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries and identified the labour and hiring trends from LinkedIn. The company also analysed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as did research with Fortune 500 customers for this report.",,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110238743,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1544836,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/110238745'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe Not For Long - TIME,2024-05-21,TIME,https://time.com,"A new breakthrough by researchers at Anthropic allows them to peer inside neural networks, paving the way for safer AI systems.",,A new breakthrough by researchers at Anthropic could pave the way for safer AI systems.,A new breakthrough by researchers at Anthropic could pave the way for safer AI systems.,,,,,"By Billy Perrigo/San FranciscoMay 21, 2024 11:00 AM EDTToday’s artificial intelligence is often described as a “black box.” AI developers don’t write explicit rules for these systems; instead, they feed in vast quantities of data and the systems learn on their own to spot patterns. But the inner workings of the AI models remain opaque, and efforts to peer inside them to check exactly what is happening haven’t progressed very far. Beneath the surface, neural networks—today’s most powerful type of AI—consist of billions of artificial “neurons” represented as decimal-point numbers. Nobody truly understands what they mean, or how they work.For those concerned about risks from AI, this fact looms large. If you don’t know exactly how a system works, how can you be sure it is safe?Read More: Exclusive: U.S. Must Move ‘Decisively’ to Avert ‘Extinction-Level’ Threat From AI, Government-Commissioned Report SaysOn Tuesday, the AI lab Anthropic announced it had made a breakthrough toward solving this problem. Researchers developed a technique for essentially scanning the “brain” of an AI model, allowing them to identify collections of neurons—called “features”—corresponding to different concepts. And for the first time, they successfully used this technique on a frontier large language model, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet, the lab’s second-most powerful system, .In one example, Anthropic researchers discovered a feature inside Claude representing the concept of “unsafe code.” By stimulating those neurons, they could get Claude to generate code containing a bug that could be exploited to create a security vulnerability. But by suppressing the neurons, the researchers found, Claude would generate harmless code.The findings could have big implications for the safety of both present and future AI systems. The researchers found millions of features inside Claude, including some representing bias, fraudulent activity, toxic speech, and manipulative behavior. And they discovered that by suppressing each of these collections of neurons, they could alter the model’s behavior.As well as helping to address current risks, the technique could also help with more speculative ones. For years, the primary method available to researchers trying to understand the capabilities and risks of new AI systems has simply been to chat with them. This approach, sometimes known as “red-teaming,” can help catch a model being toxic or dangerous, allowing researchers to build in safeguards before the model is released to the public. But it doesn’t help address one type of potential danger that some AI researchers are worried about: the risk of an AI system becoming smart enough to deceive its creators, hiding its capabilities from them until it can escape their control and potentially wreak havoc.“If we could really understand these systems—and this would require a lot of progress—we might be able to say when these models actually are safe, or whether they just appear safe,” Chris Olah, the head of Anthropic’s interpretability team who led the research, tells TIME.“The fact that we can do these interventions on the model suggests to me that we're starting to make progress on what you might call an X-ray, or an MRI [of an AI model],” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei adds. “Right now, the paradigm is: let's talk to the model, let's see what it does. But what we'd like to be able to do is look inside the model as an object—like scanning the brain instead of interviewing someone.”The research is still in its early stages, Anthropic said in a summary of the findings. But the lab struck an optimistic tone that the findings could soon benefit its AI safety work. “The ability to manipulate features may provide a promising avenue for directly impacting the safety of AI models,” Anthropic said. By suppressing certain features, it may be possible to prevent so-called “jailbreaks” of AI models, a type of vulnerability where safety guardrails can be disabled, the company added.Researchers in Anthropic’s “interpretability” team have been trying to peer into the brains of neural networks for years. But until recently, they had mostly been working on far smaller models than the giant language models currently being developed and released by tech companies.One of the reasons for this slow progress was that individual neurons inside AI models would fire even when the model was discussing completely different concepts. “This means that the same neuron might fire on concepts as disparate as the presence of semicolons in computer programming languages, references to burritos, or discussion of the Golden Gate Bridge, giving us little indication as to which specific concept was responsible for activating a given neuron,” Anthropic said in its summary of the research.To get around this problem, Olah’s team of Anthropic researchers zoomed out. Instead of studying individual neurons, they began to look for groups of neurons that would all fire in response to a specific concept. This technique worked—and allowed them to graduate from studying smaller “toy” models to larger models like Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet, which has billions of neurons. Although the researchers said they had identified millions of features inside Claude, they cautioned that this number was nowhere near the true number of features likely present inside the model. Identifying all the features, they said, would be prohibitively expensive using their current techniques, because doing so would require more computing power than it took to train Claude in the first place. (Costing somewhere in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.) The researchers also cautioned that although they had found some features they believed to be related to safety, more study would still be needed to determine whether those features could reliably be manipulated to improve a model’s safety.For Olah, the research is a breakthrough that proves the utility of his esoteric field, interpretability, to the broader world of AI safety research. “Historically, interpretability has been this thing on its own island, and there was this hope that someday it would connect with [AI] safety—but that seemed far off,” Olah says. “I think that’s no longer true.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient representatives involved in a new report were favorable to AI in healthcare but insisted on transparency and the availability of alternatives.  (iStock / Getty Images Plus / zhuweiyi49)
While generative AI holds much promise in alleviating burdens in healthcare, concerns around transparency, bias and clinical deskilling remain, a new report says.The IHI Lucian Leape Institute, a think tank within the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, convened an expert panel to build out the report. The panel was made up of Big Tech players like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as leaders such as Harvard Medical School, The Leapfrog Group and Kaiser Permanente. Together, their goal was to identify the main areas where generative AI is likely to be used as well as its challenges and the potential ways to mitigate them.“There's a lot of conversation about AI in healthcare in general,” IHI President and CEO Kedar Mate, M.D., told Fierce Healthcare. Mate is also president of the Leape Institute. “Before that got fully underway, we wanted to be sure that concerns … were being thought about,” he said.Most generative AI promises detailed in the report came as no surprise: the ability to reduce clinician burnout, improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the costs of care. The risks the report identified included the depersonalization of care, inaccuracies and bias, challenges with integration and workforce deskilling.The 50-page report contained a multitude of specific recommendations for various stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem. It identified six best practices to guide the ongoing development of generative AI tools and their integration into clinical care delivery: Serve and safeguard the patientLearn with, engage and listen to cliniciansEvaluate and ensure AI efficacy and freedom from biasEstablish strict AI governance, oversight and guidance for health systems and the federal governmentBe intentional with the design, implementation and ongoing evaluation of AI toolsEngage in collaborative learning across health systems “Key groups must work together with intention and discipline to implement genAI in ways that enhance patient safety,” the report said. The report built its recommendations around three areas anticipated to be the primary use cases for generative AI in the near future: documentation support, clinical decision support and patient chatbots.Generative AI for documentation support is pretty widely used already, Mate noted, with patient chatbots not far behind. But clinical decision support tools will take longer to roll out, in part due to trust and validation concerns and also the need for a solid regulatory framework to approve algorithms.“That type of technology still needs to evolve,” Mate said. Administrative uses are already further along. “That doesn’t face the same kind of regulatory pressure because they’re not patient-facing,” per Mate.Documentation support GenAI tools can and are being used in an administrative setting, from developing patient history summaries to transcribing conversations to drafting responses to patient messages. These offerings, the report said, can reduce clinical documentation burden, resolve inaccuracies in the EHR, improve the accessibility of documentation and strengthen communication. But several risks and challenges exist for these use cases. There might be a lack of patient transparency or informed consent on the use of a tool. Clinicians may have to spend more time manually reviewing flagged inaccuracies. And, importantly, even if a tool frees up a clinician’s time, that free time might be replaced by new expectations, such as seeing a greater volume of patients. “If we take that newly freed up time … will that actually create more burnout in the end, is the concern,” Mate said. When it comes to who should or is likely to be responsible for ensuring that doesn’t happen, Mate believes it will fall to health systems’ AI governance committees as opposed to outside regulators. What’s more, the onus on these committees will be not only to be proactive about the thoughtful procurement of AI tools, but also the meaningful ongoing auditing of such tools, which are continuously learning.Additionally, deskilling was identified as a threat to generative AI in documentation support. There may be an over-reliance on tools that may then lead to unnoticed errors and inadequate oversight, the report said. To combat this, there should be exercises built into clinician workflows to help keep their memory active on how to manually perform certain automated tasks. One example identified in the report included TSA agents, who are periodically shown images of weapons in luggage to test their level of attention and to promote vigilance. Mate believes deskilling is a real concern, because, as the industry evolves, so, too, do approaches to teaching. For instance, to become a licensed doctor, Mate took a closed-book exam. But a decade later, when he re-certified, it was an open-book exam. “In just 10 years’ time … a very significant difference had emerged,” Mate reflected. Thus, it is inevitable that the way of thinking in medical schools will continue to evolve with the emergence of AI technologies. “I do think this risk, or benefit, of changing skills is very high,” Mate said.Clinical decision support Generative AI tools could offer diagnostic support and recommendations, provide early detection of changes to patient conditions or suggest treatment plans. These applications can potentially improve accuracy, save clinicians time and possibly reduce costs. But many risks related to generative AI clinical decision support remain, per the report.There is not a lot of evidence supporting their effectiveness. Rigorous evaluations of clinical decision support tools, mostly before the advent of generative AI, have yielded small improvements in clinician behaviors, the report highlighted. There are some successful AI-based clinical decision support examples, but they have involved supervised machine learning. One example is the use of AI-based computer aided detection in radiology, now routinely used in mammography. Additionally, any excitement about tools is tempered by evidence that they can contribute to alert fatigue and frustrations with EHRs. There are also concerns about clinical over-reliance, compliance and automation bias. At the same time, it’s unrealistic to expect clinicians to double-check the accuracy of every single generative AI recommendation, per Mate. There need to be new digital ways to audit algorithms.“The volume of these clinical decision supports that AI can offer... will become a new cognitive burden and load that clinicians will have to carry,” Mate cautioned. And these tools must be promoted as an aid to, not a replacement for, clinical decision-making.Chatbots supporting patients Generative AI as a patient-facing chatbot can help collect data and support patient triage, respond to basic patient questions and facilitate care navigation. These functions can expand access to care, democratize access to understandable information and offer more accurate and reliable data, the report said.But there are concerns about the ethics of technology that mimics a human as well as whether that is being properly disclosed to a user. There are also concerns about chatbots’ accuracy, the loss of human connection and information flow—that is, what can help guarantee a patient that is triaged to a high-risk category actually gets the care they need.The report offered several mitigation strategies, including embedding disclosures of a chatbot’s function for patients, designing chatbots with guardrails and ensuring escalation pathways for chatbot users. An example of a guardrail is having certain prompts that a chatbot cannot respond to. Maintaining human oversight of chatbots also remains crucial, the report said. That includes routine auditing of chatbot performance and clinical review of conversations to ensure that patients’ needs are being met.Patient representatives involved in the report were pretty favorable to AI being used in care, Mate said. They have hope in its ability to possibly remove the “chronic headaches” of patient safety and quality—things like human errors in drug interactions or handoffs. But they insist on transparency around AI use.“The patient community was very clear on the fact that at least for now… there would be a clear annotation to whatever work product is created that was aided and augmented by an AI technology,” Mate said.“So much around how this technology is going to be deployed in our environments is not worked out, and I hope this paper and the various audiences in it … will help,” Mate concluded.

The AI Safety Institute will work to establish artificial intelligence testing metrics and standards as detailed by a new guiding document.







































The U.S. Department of Commerce released a guiding document Tuesday for operations of its AI Safety Institute, run out of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The institute was created in November 2023 to support the mandates given to the Department of Commerce under President Joe Biden’s October 2023 executive order.The new Strategic Vision contains three focal goals: advance the science of AI safety; articulate, demonstrate and disseminate the practices of AI safety; and support institutions and entities coordinating AI safety protocols.“Safety breeds trust, trust provides confidence in adoption, and adoption accelerates innovation,” the Strategic Vision says.A key challenge the Strategic Vision aims to confront is the lack of global standards and testing metrics to effectively evaluate safety in AI systems. It also looks to bring more coordinated global effort to developing testing and validation metrics for AI systems, as well as asking for national laboratory and other federal agency participation.Conducting assessments, A/B testing and red teaming efforts in emerging systems to assess various security threats are among the methods the Strategic Visions champions to ensure AI systems are rights- and security-preserving prior to deployment.Three overarching words — “possible,” “actionable,” and “sustainable” — will also serve as guiding principles in AISI’s ongoing work to better evaluate the societal impact of advanced AI systems.The AISI will then work to further evangelize the methodologies and metric systems which arise from thoroughly testing fledgling AI technologies.. “AlSI’s projects may contribute to scientific reports, articles, guidance, and practices to help ensure that rigorous Al safety research, testing, and guidance inform major domestic Al safety legislation or policy,” the guidance reads.Just last month the AISI added several new members to its leadership team.

If you value articles like the one you're reading right now,  give today.(MONTAGE)CNN NEWS ANCHOR: Tonight we're taking a closer look at a new technology that's making waves in the world of AI.FOX NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT.BBC NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT.WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT. A state of the art conversational AI model developed by OpenAI.CHAKRABARTI: Well, since the public release of its demo in November 2022, OpenAI and ChatGPT completely changed the public perception of artificial intelligence in everyday life. And it put one question in the sharpest relief yet: Is generative AI a job killer?(MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFED PERSON ON TIKTOK: Here’s how ChatGPT is going to kill jobs.AL JAZEERA ANCHOR: Let’s talk about AI and whether it’s going to take your job.AdvertisementUNIDENTIFIED PERSON ON TIKTOK: I think it’s just the start of tech layoffs. Let’s break it down.CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs.UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE ON TIKTOK: Will AI take your job? / Yeah. / What do you do for work? / I work at an AI company. / Oh nice.CHAKRABARTI: Well, last March, economists at Goldman Sachs estimated that AI could automate as many as 300 million full time jobs globally by 2030. So at first glance, one might expect a labor economist like David Autor to share those concerns.He's a professor of economics at MIT and co-director of the Labor Studies Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research. And for years, his research has shown that major steps forward in technology and automation have historically hurt middle and low-income American workers. And as generative AI climbs up the income scale in terms of the work it can do, those job loss and income reducing dangers seem to be firmly moving into white collar jobs, too.But David Autor's latest research has revealed something completely unexpected. He says AI could offer benefits and even help restore ""the middle-skill, middle class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization."" He's written that in an essay on Noema magazine called AI Could Actually Help Rebuild the Middle Class.Professor Autor joins us now. Welcome back to On Point.DAVID AUTOR: Thank you, Meghna. It's a pleasure to be here.CHAKRABARTI: So I want to actually start by going back to several years of your prior research about the workplace — or American work and technology. How would you generalize what you've found as each wave of technology and automation, you know, settles into workplaces?AUTOR: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, it's often, the question is often asked, is this time different? And the answer is yes. Actually every time is different. And the era of computerization, which many would say sort of really began in earnest in the early 1980s when it really reached offices and so on had a kind of a polarizing effect.Computers were really ideally suited for carrying out tasks, jobs that could be described by a set of formal rules. So the rules that you would use for doing accounting or proofreading and typesetting, but also in repetitive production and operative environments where people are doing skilled work, but following a very well-defined set of procedures.Traditional computers, pre-AI, are really good at following rules and operating tools. So things that can be codified as a series of steps that a machine that doesn't solve problems, doesn't have novel ideas, doesn't have innovative insights, but that can do that work rapidly and inexpensively, that was very displacing for people in offices and for people in many assembly line jobs.Now, the effect of that was polarizing because on the one hand, if you were a college-educated worker doing professional or technical or managerial work, a lot of your work is decision making. It's deciding how do I treat a patient, or how do I redesign a building, or how do I architect a piece of software, or how do I rewire a house, or, you know, plumb a new building. That's decision making work. And computerization is really helpful for that, because it provides the information and, and calculation that, that helps support good decisions. It doesn't make the decisions for you, but it provides input. So it made people much more effective in that type of work. So, computerization was really great for college educated workers and for many high paid workers.However, if you were in the middle group — in the clerical, office, administrative support, production, operative work, that work started disappearing. And if you couldn't move up into these professions, many people found themselves instead in services — food service, cleaning, security, entertainment, recreation, some low-paid home health care. Now, that's socially valuable work. I don't mean to denigrate it at all. But it's poorly paid. And the reason it's poorly paid is because it doesn't require much training or certification or expertise. It kind of uses a relatively generic skill set so that many people of sound mind and body can do that work without a lot of preparation.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: And that means that wages tend to be low. And this is true across the all industrialized economies. Some pay those jobs better, some worse, but they're always at the bottom end of the earnings distribution.CHAKRABARTI: So let me summarize at least part of your work this way. It wasn't all that long ago I think that you coauthored a paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics called New Frontiers, right? The Origins and Content of New Work from 1940 to 2018. That was a very interesting paper, Professor Autor.AUTOR: Thank you.CHAKRABARTI: Just to sort of quote a couple of things here. One is that the study found that since 1980, that technology replaced more jobs than it generated, right? And that 60% of jobs in 2018 actually never even existed in 1940, which makes a lot of sense due to the changes that you talked about. So there was an overall replacement there that technology did of jobs that outpaced the augmentation, which is the other part of the picture that you talk about that. um, That that augmentation or the ability, I guess, to do more with technology did add some jobs to the economy, but it wasn't as many as that were lost. Is that a fair way to just sort of roughly summarize that paper?AUTOR: That's correct. But let me let me offer a qualification.CHAKRABARTI: Okay.AUTOR: We're not running out of jobs. And so the discussion of the number of jobs, I think, is a little bit — is very alarming to people. But in fact, we're in a  period of sustained labor market scarcity. Our population is growing very slowly. Immigration has been highly restricted. Fertility is really low. And the labor force, the number of adults of working age is basically going to be relatively flat. It's growing at the slowest time in American history. And in fact, in most of the industrialized world, working age populations are declining.Now you might say, well, why is that a problem? We have fewer people. We need fewer jobs. However, there's a growing share of the population that is past their working age and has earned a well deserved retirement. And those young people are going to have to support them. And that requires work, and that requires productivity. And with shrinking numbers of young people, able-bodied workers, and so on, that actually creates a period of great scarcity. In fact, we're seeing this now in the United States with the extremely tight labor market after the pandemic.So the question is not the number of jobs. That's not what we should be worried about. It's the quality of those jobs. Do those jobs require expertise like those professional workers? Or do those jobs tend to use generic skill sets, so like those food service, cleaning, security workers? Again, intrinsically valuable jobs, but poorly paid. And that's what we should be focused on, expertise.And let me give you a concrete example I like to give. Think of the job of air traffic controller and crossing guard. These are basically the same job, right? The job is to prevent things from crashing into one another: planes into planes, cars into children, et cetera. And yet air traffic controllers are paid more than four times what crossing guards are. And again, the reason isn't social value, right? We don't want our children to be run over on the way to school. And if we had to pay crossing guards a lot of money to prevent that from happening, we surely would do so. The difference, again, is expertise. In the U.S., almost any adult of sound mind and body can become a crossing guard with with no training or certification, but to become an air traffic controller requires several years of air traffic control college and then hundreds to thousands of hours of apprenticeship.So, a world in which everyone is a crossing guard, a world in which we don't have much expert work, is less good for labor than a world in which everyone is an air traffic controller or doing some of their professional activity. So that's what we should be concerned about. Whether jobs will use expert skills that reward knowledge and competency and specialization. Or jobs that require, you know, human labor to do menial stuff.  That's not as good as a scenario.CHAKRABARTI: Okay. But I'm just going to go down this automation versus augmentation rabbit hole with you a little bit more, because I have to say I'm emerging right now a little bit confused. And then we'll dig into the AI part of your research here. Because I thought, and maybe I was mistaken, but I was under the impression that your research over many years had shown that regarding automation specifically, that overall the effects on employment of automation were overall negative?AUTOR: The effects on wages.CHAKRABARTI: On wages, okay.AUTOR: Exactly. And, I should say, it's not just me. There's a large set of really distinguished researchers who've worked on this problem. I think it's widely agreed that this polarization has occurred as automation has kind of hollowed out the middle and that has put downward pressure on people without college degrees. Not by reducing the number of workers per se, but by pushing workers into non-expert work that's paid poorly. And that's the primary concern. And so it is — that automation, if automation just takes the work that you're good at and allows the machine to do it better, cheaper, and faster, that is good for productivity potentially, but it's not good for you. (LAUGHS) Right?AdvertisementCHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: And that's the challenge. To give another useful concrete example, I think. Since 1865, London taxi drivers have been required to acquire what's called ""the knowledge.""CHAKRABARTI: ""The knowledge,"" yeah.AUTOR: That's right. And it takes almost three years. And it's a complete memorization of the streets and highways and byways and overpasses and underpasses of London. It's an incredible feat of memorization. Literally brain scans show the changes in people's physiology of their brains coming from this act of memorization. Once smartphone-based routing was introduced, that knowledge was completely economically irrelevant.CHAKRABARTI: Uh-huh.AUTOR: Not only does, you know, Waze know all those highways and byways and streets and underpasses, but it also knows how much traffic is on them at any given point, which is something you could never memorize. So, a friend of a friend of mine is a London taxi driver, and now considers himself to be an entertainer and tour guide, not a driver at all.CHAKRABARTI: So he's trying to find new ways to add value.AUTOR: Exactly.Part IICHAKRABARTI: Some people say AI helps them work smarter, not harder.ELISE AZARA: We have this kind of inside joke in the office where the boss is like, ""Hey, have you tried running this through AI?"" You know, like no matter what the task is. And it has worked and it has proven as a helpful tool in some aspects.CHAKRABARTI: So this is Elise Azara in Spokane, Washington. She's director of marketing for a company called Zero Emissions Northwest, which helps farmers get grant funding for using renewable energy sources.As you heard Elise say, her boss is pretty big on AI, or at least on testing it out. He hopes it'll make their team more efficient. And Elise says so far she has used it to help write things like press releases and blog articles. There's an AI tool built into their project management software.AZARA: If I upload a start or like a headline, it'll start to try to draft it based on that. Or for instance, we used a lot of AI prompts to write the website, you know, just to try to give us, ""Hey, what would be a better way to paraphrase this page?"" It's kind of like having like a friend there that's like, ""Hey, have you thought about doing this?"" I can bounce ideas off of it. I mean, not to like personify AI. (LAUGHS) But I don't necessarily think my first idea is the best. I always want to kind of see what else could be out there. So in that sense, yes, it's very helpful.CHAKRABARTI: Also in that sense, she's doing what she would have usually done with other human beings, but doing it with AI saves her a lot of time. That's time she can now use to work on other things or spend with her two young children. But the AI's writing is not perfect. Elise still has to edit it. And sometimes trying to incorporate AI has actually created more work for her. She says one time her boss wanted to pull data from a bunch of different utility bills, and he spent hours uploading the documents.AZARA: He's copying and pasting, you know, the utility bills, or he's trying to convert it from a PDF to a Word or whatever, so that way he can get the data in there. And then he's asking the AI, he's prompting it, saying, ""Hey, I need total kilowatt hour usage,"" and this and that. And like, it would pull from the wrong columns. Or it would pull — it didn't know exactly what it was looking at. We had to be really careful because we're like, we don't want to rely on that. It was just easier for us to manually go in and kind of like pull that data ourselves.CHAKRABARTI: But in general, Elise says she has been pleasantly surprised by AI. She was initially a skeptic. And she does still get a little nervous about it.AZARA: It kind of was this moment of, ""Oh my gosh, I just wrote a press release in five seconds. That's insane."" It's awesome because it means I can devote more time to other projects, but yeah, I'm like, oh gosh, this is just the beginning. Like, where is it going to go from here? You know, am I writing myself out of a job? I don't know. I hope not! Because I would hope that you would still have — everything still needs an editor. That's kind of where I see my job going is, okay, I can use it as a tool, but it's not going to like overtake what I do.CHAKRABARTI: That's Elise Azara, a marketing director at Zero Emissions Northwest in Spokane, Washington. Well, David Autor is with us. He's a professor of economics at MIT and a very well known labor economist in the United States. And he's recently written an article that appeared in Noema magazine called AI Could Actually Help Rebuild the Middle Class.So, Professor Autor, Elise is a really interesting example there. But use her to make your case that that you state in your essay that unlike automation or technological advances in the past, which we talked earlier generally has had a net negative effect on wages, that perhaps AI could rebuild or help rebuild the middle class. I'll be honest, professor, I'm very skeptical, but give it your best shot. (LAUGHS)AUTOR: (LAUGHS) Great. So, first of all, there was so much in what Alicia (sic) just said. I thought that was terrific. And let me try to draw it out a bit. But I want to just step back a bit. I don't think computerization has lowered wages on average. It's that it's raised wage inequality a lot. So it has raised some people's wages a lot and other people's wages have fallen. And that's not, and I think that's, you know, not a deal I want to take.CHAKRABARTI: Oh yeah, I would agree. And I think actually a lot of the ways that we talk about economic and labor changes due to technology is quite misleading as we keep pointing to those averages. But it's the rise in the extremes that's really problematic. But go ahead.AUTOR: Right. We would be less productive and less wealthy in general, if we didn't have computerization to make many more things more productive, but some people would be certainly be better off.But let's go back to Elisa (sic). What's really, you know, terrific about her example — and many things are terrific about her example — is she's talking about a use of AI for which there was no pre-AI substitute, right? Your word processor previously could check your spelling and look for grammatical errors, but it couldn't complete your thought and write a whole, you know, you take a headline and it produces a new paragraph and suggests different ways to write marketing copy, right?And that's what illustrates something that's really distinct about AI. Previous computer technology followed rules. It just carried out the well-defined steps. But writing isn't like that. It requires actually going beyond the material, beyond the rules and putting in additional ideas and thoughts. And we don't know the formal procedures for doing that. We don't have a script for writing, you know, compelling marketing prose and AI doesn't either. What it's done is it's gone through vast amounts of unstructured text and ferreted out kind of patterns and ways of doing things that it can then replicate back for us.And so it learns from unstructured information. And a lot of the work that we do is ultimately  in that way. It's informal. We do many things that we don't have formal rules for doing. And so, for example, you know, writing or telling a joke or coming up with a great idea or hypothesis or a new product, right? We don't have a program. We haven't historically had a program for that. So AI goes beyond what was previously feasible. You can think of traditional computing is like, you know, studio musicians reading from the sheets of music and AI is more like a jazz musician that can improvise and riff on the material that you give it.But notice that what Elisa (sic) did not say is, ""This does my job for me."" What she said instead is, ""It helps. It speeds things up, but I need to be there supervising it because it comes up with crazy stuff."" (LAUGHS) Right? And so it actually requires her expertise to do this work. She did not say, ""Anybody could take this machine and do my job."" She said, ""I need to be there to supervise."" And this is true of a lot of AI applications. AI, because it's like a coworker, as she said. When you collaborate with someone else, you have to filter their ideas and their suggestions and determine, you just don't take someone else's opinion as ground truth.And we see this with AI all the time. So, for example, some colleagues of mine, Nikhil Agarwal and Tobias Salz and their co-authors, ran an experiment with an an X-ray — an AI radiology tool. It's called CheXpert, Chest X-ray Expert. And what it does is it reads scans, and then makes diagnoses, you know, this might be pneumonia, edema, et cetera.And it turns out this tool is really quite good. Working just with scans, without any ancillary information, it's about as accurate as 60% of radiologists are reading scans. Which is really amazing. And you can see this a beautiful application for AI because there are no clear, bright red lines for reading X-rays. It's a matter of judgment. You've seen many of them, you see patterns and you begin to recognize what it looks like. So AI is perfect for that because you don't have to tell it the rules, you just give it examples and eventually it infers the kind of underlying decision process.So you might think that given that this tool is as good as 60% of radiologists, radiologists using the tool would be even more effective. But it turns out they do worse using this tool than they do on their own reading scans. And there's a reason, and the reason is what my colleagues call ""correlated uncertainty."" So when the doctor is uncertain what a scan shows, the software is also often frequently uncertain, and it will report its level of uncertainty. And when the doctor is certain, the software is also usually very quite confident, and it reports its confidence.What tends to happen is when they're both uncertain, the doctor will defer to the AI. And when they're both confident and yet they disagree, the doctor will tend to override the AI. And in general, neither of those appears to be the right decision. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Huh!AUTOR: When they're both uncertain, the doctor probably ought to go with his or her gut because they have a lot more ancillary information. When they're both certain and yet they disagree, the doctor should at least ask, look, this tool has seen millions of scans, more than I will see in my career, and we have a different diagnosis. The doctor should at least ask why they differ. That doesn't mean that machine can't be wrong. It just means it requires consideration. So here's the point I'm making, this comes back to Alicia's (sic) example — I'm sorry, did you say Elise or Elisa?CHAKRABARTI: It was Elise.AUTOR: Yeah. Elise. I'm sorry. Come back to Elise's example. It takes judgment to use the tool. The radiologist needs to supply his or her own judgment because this machine is opaque. It's error prone, and the fact that it appears confident or unconfident doesn't mean it's necessarily correct. And so when it comes to writing the marketing material, the software will come up with some good ideas, but they may be wrong. And you need someone who has an understanding of the job to filter that. And so she can --CHAKRABARTI: Oh --AUTOR: Yep, go ahead.CHAKRABARTI: Oh, no, no. So let me, so just to cut to the chase here, what you're saying is that — I mean and this was, in fact, I think the meatiest part of your paper — which is that you're saying that AI is transforming what expertise actually is in the labor market and its value.AUTOR: Precisely.CHAKRABARTI: And it sounds like you're saying, well, expertise now is going to be replaced — well, the expertise in terms of the manipulation and synthesis of information, AI will be doing, but the new value add will be the judgment from human beings.AUTOR: That absolutely right. So the most valuable work in the economy is decision-making work, right? When you're a doctor, you say, well, how do I treat this cancer patient? Or you're an architect designing a building or developing piece of software, or even figuring out how to land a plane or how to, you know, rewire a house. And in all those cases, these are high stakes decisions. They're one-off decisions, right? You're not making a decision for thousands. You're making a decision about an individual house or individual, individual patient and so on.And that's where human judgment combines with information, knowledge, and formal training, but often, but usually it's a judgment call. And AI is helpful for supporting those decisions. It doesn't make them for you in most cases, but it's helpful to kind of give you guidance and guardrails. Guidance like had you considered this? Guardrails, as in don't do that, right? Don't prescribe these two drugs together, they're negative, they'll negatively interact.And the good scenario, the way to use AI well, is to enable more people to do valuable decision-making work with this tool. In other words, to open up that high value work to people who are not quite at the elite frontier of the profession in which they are engaged.CHAKRABARTI: Mm.AUTOR: So an example I give frequently — and I want to be clear, this is not about AI specifically — is the occupation of nurse practitioners. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have an additional master's degree in nursing as NPs, and then a lot of training. And they do tasks that used to be limited exclusively to MDs. They do diagnosis, they do prescribing, they do treatment. And this is a great use of talent, of expertise. It lowers costs. It makes the care more accessible. It creates great jobs. Nurse practitioners are well paid.And it didn't come about because of technology. It came about because of actually a social movement where nurses recognized they were underused and fought against the kicking and screaming of the American Medical Association to create this new credential. But at this point, they're very heavily supported by technology, right? They have electronic medical records, they have diagnostic software, they have prescription software that looks for drug interactions, and this enables them to do a greater variety of care tasks. And it's easy to imagine a future where nurse practitioners have a larger scope of practice, where they can do more valuable work.And AI is a tool that can enable more people with the right foundational training and judgment to do more valuable work. So, for example, most software development is done by people with a fair amount of training in computer science. In the future, software development will be open to more people because you won't have to have as much formal knowledge of the tools. You'll just have to know what you're aiming for. Or if you're a contractor remodeling a house, you'll have better tools to visualize and show the customer and consider the engineering side of this.And even in writing, just as in Elise's example, you will have tools that help produce text faster. But very likely, you will need your own judgment and expertise to decide what's suitable, what's valuable, and what should be discarded.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Professor Autor, let me say that I have respected your work for years and years and years, but you're not quite shaking me out of my skepticism here. Because, because I wonder if we — I do think it's a potent argument that you're making. And let me just read a little section of your essay that summarizes what you just said.You said that, ""AI can enable a larger set of workers equipped with the necessary foundational training to perform those higher-stakes decision-making tasks currently arrogated to elite experts."" You mention doctors, lawyers, software engineers, et cetera.AUTOR: Professors. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) ""That AI used well can assist with restoring,"" this is the key part, ""the middle skill, middle class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization."" Okay. I am a little concerned though, or my skepticism rises because are we not falling into the trap of privileging the present, right? That very persistent human bias of not being able to accurately project that far out into the future. Because people probably made similar arguments in the past for previous technological disruptions. And to the point that you're making, it wasn't the number of jobs necessarily that went down, but the value of the new jobs being created.And so I'm not sure I'm convinced that we will have a lot of high value new jobs being created in this AI future that you're describing. I mean, the other thing that Elise said is that she still has that nagging worry that she's training the AI out of her own job, right? Because what would stop her boss in the future from saying, ""Well, I actually now don't even need an Elise. The AI has gotten good enough that I can just say, 'Write the the press release,' and I'm pretty confident that it'll write exactly what I need?""AUTOR: Good. These are great questions So, let me see if I can respond effectively to a subset of them. So the the other thing I actually wanted to come back to on Elise is you might be concerned there's too much of a good thing, right? So if everybody can do it then it's not very valuable, right? Expertise by definition means something that some people can do and not everyone can do. And so one concern is that eventually it'll just displace expertise in some areas completely. And that will certainly happen. I gave you the example of Waze, right? In certain types of software development, the software develop will develop itself. And, uh, and this has happened many times in the past, right?So, you know, we've had incredible productivity growth in agriculture, and as a result, we have very few people working in farming anymore relative to what it used to be, and yet we produce so much food. So we can certainly automate ourselves out of a job. But what has been true for individual sectors of the economy has never been true for the economy as a whole, right? It's not that productivity growth has ever made us poorer or less able to — or let me put it differently. Whenever we see a lot of productivity growth, we see booming employment and booming consumption, not the opposite. But that doesn't mean it isn't really negative for a subset of people, right?CHAKRABARTI: Mm-hmm.AUTOR: And we've seen this in many technological transitions. So in the movement from the kind of artisanal era to the industrial era, you know, skilled artisans were wiped out, the so called Luddites, right? I their replace, we eventually got a huge industrialized workforce in factories and offices, but it took decades for that transition to occur.Part IIICHAKRABARTI: So, Professor Autor, let me get back to you because you were saying that in previous technological transformations, right, the impact really played out over the course of decades and you were headed in a particular direction. Go ahead.AUTOR: That's correct. So the Industrial Revolution, it took about 60 years before it benefited rank and file workers. We had a good century of it from about 1880 to 1980 and it was a very productive way to organize work. It was complementary to people with high school educations and it built the middle class of a lot of the industrialized world.However, the transition was ugly. It displaced a lot of artisans and it created hardship, and also capitalists used it to basically indenture children and unmarried women into dirty and dangerous work. And so it was, it was a rough start. And the era that we're in now also will have real pain.So when I hear people talk about AI, I tend to think they're simultaneously too pessimistic and too optimistic. So let me start with too optimistic. People who are excited about AI will tend to say, ""Oh, you know, no one will be displaced. Everyone will just be more productive and more efficient and they'll have more time for their children, et cetera."" That's not true. There are certainly types of work that are — like those London taxi drivers I talked about — where the expertise that people have developed will be stranded. And there are still people driving London taxis, but their skills are not as valuable. Because most people can drive, or at least most people think they can drive.And we will see that in some software development and some types of advertising writing. I'm very worried about content creators who do visual work and music because I think their intellectual property is being liberated without compensation by AI at present. And I think that's a regulatory issue. So we should be prepared for that. And not to, and I do not mean to dismiss that at all.Why do I think they're too — why people are not sufficiently optimistic? Because I think there's great potential that gets overlooked in the discussion of which jobs will be automated. The most fundamentally important uses of new technologies are not for automation. They're instead things that enable new human capabilities that were not previously feasible, right?So think about, you know, airplane and mechanical powered flight. Airplanes didn't automate the way we used to fly. We simply didn't fly before we had them. Or if you were to go back to ancient Greece and automate everything that the ancient Greeks were doing by hand at that time, you wouldn't have modern America, you'd have ancient Greece without horses. It wouldn't have flight. It wouldn't have electricity, wouldn't have penicillin. Wouldn't have telecommunications, right? Automation — or sorry, new technologies — have been fundamentally important not because they allow us to do the same things faster and cheaper, but because they allow us to do fundamentally new things.And that's why new work is so important in the paper you mentioned earlier. A lot of new work, which is the type of work many of us do, requires expertise that didn't exist prior to the technologies that supported it, right? Those air traffic controllers, if they didn't have a GPS and a radar and a two-way radio, they'd just be a person standing in a field staring at the sky. They wouldn't be able to do their work.Similarly, we wouldn't have pediatric oncologists without all the technology and tools and expertise that goes along with that. The same for all of these computer technologies we use, but even for many of the high-end services that we experience — in tourism, in travel and food. This is this is specialized work. It requires human expertise. That expertise is made valuable and it couldn't exist without the technology and tools that support it, as well as the higher incomes that come from it.CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So, okay. You've half sold me, Professor Autor. (LAUGHS) AUTOR: Oh! Okay.CHAKRABARTI: You're making progress here! (LAUGHS) But so let me refine it, because when you're talking about that new jobs created the nature of expertise and its value will shift, that makes perfect sense because it follows previous patterns as you talked about with each revolution in technology.But when we're talking about rebuilding the middle class, class is a very specific word because we're talking about incomes, really, and people's sense of security in their lives. And you had just said previously, that both you and many, many other economists out there have studied extensively on how even as technology has changed the workforce and required higher levels of education for that elite expertise income, that it has for working class Americans, as we know, for the past 50 years or so, wages have been flatlined. Or, you know, perhaps more accurately, have just gone down relative to the percent of the national wealth that capital gets versus labor. I don't think you're disagreeing with that, right?AUTOR: No, not at all.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so in the case of AI, what I wonder is, is that — why wouldn't that problem get anything but worse, right? Because we're just, we're relying on the vicissitudes of capitalism, right? To make the social and political policy to help keep the middle class robust and strong? I mean, I don't think that that's going to happen. And my concern is that the AI transformation of the nature of work is going to be so rapid. We've already failed to protect the middle class over the past half century. There's no guarantee that in the next five years even that we'll have policy makers who will do what's needed to be done to help, you know, as you're saying, rebuild the middle class with these technological changes.AUTOR: Great. So first of all, there's no guarantee. Absolutely. And in fact, my article, it describes a good scenario, a way we could use it. It does not say it will happen that way. But let me say why I think it's useful for rebuilding middle skill jobs, a phrase I also prefer to ""the middle class."" And that is because we have displaced so much middle skill expertise from offices from factories and so on, pushed people into low paid services. And the opportunity is to use this tool to enable them to do more valuable work, right? To move into the health care services, to move it into software, to move into skilled repair and skilled construction and so on.Now, that doesn't mean anyone can just do it. It means giving the right training and education. So it doesn't mean anyone could just simply do that work. If it were true, it wouldn't be expert work. And why this tool is useful for that — it's really fundamentally different from traditional computing, right? This is the world's leading technology that, by the way, can't do math and can't keep facts straight. It's really opposite. And so it would actually be somewhat surprising if it had exactly the same effects as the technology we used before. Now, I also, I want to underscore another point that you made, which is it is not the technology itself that makes these decisions, right?CHAKRABARTI: Correct.AUTOR: It is the choices of people, the choices and the incentives of the market and the structure of policy. And we have a variety of choices to make, and we could certainly use it badly.For example, China uses AI very effectively to have the world's most comprehensive surveillance state, the world's best real time censorship system, and that's an amazing technological achievement, and it requires AI to do it. But that doesn't mean that's because that's what AI does. That's choice. You can use AI to make healthcare more affordable and accessible, to make education more immersive, more engaging, more like simulation. We can use it to help skilled repair people do a broader variety of tasks. We can use it to enable more people to do software development. So there's many, many ways to use it.And I agree that I'm concerned about the incentives as well. I don't think corporations have necessarily the right incentives. It's not that they're malevolent, but why should they be concerned about aggregate employment? It's not their job. So policy is necessary. And we could talk at greater length about that.I think we'll know we're being successful if we see more people without four year college degrees — which only a third of Americans have — doing high value work in education, in healthcare, in design, in repair, et cetera. And if AI is a threat to work, as we were discussing earlier, the people to whom it is actually most threatening are professionals.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: Doctors and lawyers, software developers and engineers, right? It could make some of their work less expensive, more of it done automatically. Now, that's a mixed bag, but it's not altogether bad. First of all, professionals have seen a terrific last five decades, right? A lot of the growth of inequality is the rising wages of decision makers who are scarce, and yet made more valuable by computing.And if we have a period of declining inequality, which we are in right now, that's not altogether bad, especially if it means that those high-paid professionals see more competition from skilled people who aren't quite as elite. If doctors have more competition from nurse practitioners, I'm all in favor of that. If lawyers have more competition from other legal experts who don't have as much training, but still do a great job, I'm in favor of that. If PhDs in computer science face more competition from people who have an associate's degree and the right tools, that's a good thing.Not only is it good for the people who do those less highly paid jobs, it's also good for the rest of us who buy those services. We all pay for education. We all pay for health care. We all pay for software. I'll stop. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: No, no. So let me just jump in here because the scenario that you're laying out right now, I can begin to see what you're talking about in terms of the increasing competition for work that was previously sort of narrowly defined as high value for a few, relatively few number of people.But okay, we have another little thought experiment here about people who don't feel anywhere near as optimistic, okay? So some of those folks include British voice actor Mike Cooper.MIKE COOPER [Tape]: I received a marketing email from a company that produced voiceovers. So I clicked through to their website, went to listen to their voice samples that they had listed, selected a couple of parameters like male, English, UK, because obviously I have a British accent, to see who they had on their list, and pressed play, and heard a version of myself coming back to me.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so again, this is Mike Cooper, who is a British voice actor, and last February he talked to Scott Tong on NPR's Here and Now.COOPER: It was obviously me, it's the sound and tone of my voice, but it doesn't quite sound like me in the same way because we have nuances in the way we speak which aren't fully replicated in the AI versions.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so here's what he's talking about. We have a recording here that Cooper provided to the Washington Post last year, and that recording will then be followed by an AI replication of Cooper's voice produced by a voice generator called Resemble AI.COOPER: My work has been described as exceptional. My performance is spot on in the first take, and my delivery as having an effortless authority.AI REPLICATION OF COOPER'S VOICE: My work has been described as exceptional. My performance is spot on in the first take, and my delivery as having an effortless authority. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so not a perfect replication, by any means. Cooper's real voice is crisper, warmer, audio quality far better, and it captures really the entire range of human nuance that can be in our voices. But, that was the AI voice clone a year ago, okay? So, in just 12 months, how far has it come?UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Okay, this is probably going to be too easy, but let's try it anyways. Tell me what you think. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Professor Autor, what we just heard now is the voice of one of our producers, On Point producer Jonathan Chang. Or, actually wait, is it his voice? I haven't heard these yet, Professor Autor, so we're gonna listen to a second clip, and then you and I are gonna try and guess which one is Jon's real voice. So here's the other clip.UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Okay, this is probably going to be too easy, but let's try it anyways. Tell me what you think. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, Jon's in the studio. It's the second one. Is that you, Jon?! Oh, he shakes his head yes! I got it! So Professor Autor, it's not like completely accurate yet, but it was pretty close. I mean, could you tell the difference?AUTOR: Not in the second, not in the second instance.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, right. The only reason why I could, I think, is because I know Jon really well and I listen to him talk every day. So just one more thought here from, um, from Mike Cooper. Because that's just the advances that AI in terms of replicating the human voice has made in a year. Like, what's it going to be like in six months or another year? And here's what Mike Cooper says.COOPER: The idea now that you could take a minute of somebody from an audio book that they'd recorded or a minute of somebody giving a speech at a conference, create an AI model and then get Emma Watson to read Mein Kampf, in some ways it's like the the horse is out of the stable already. But as we've seen with things like ChatGPT and Dall-E, it's beginning to impact all kinds of creative people at this point, so we need to be careful.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, Professor Autor, I'm afraid we only have a minute left in this conversation today. There's so much more to talk about. But, you know, again, I just wanted to surface that as the concerns that people continue to have. So what's the last thought you'd leave folks with?AUTOR: Thanks. It's been a great conversation. So first I want to say Mike has a beautiful voice, Mike Cooper, it's fantastic to listen to. Second, as I think I said earlier, I think this is intellectual theft. I don't think — this is a misuse of the technology.  And it's a failure of our legal system that we don't have a framework for dealing with this. Think of music streaming in the days of Napster. Right? People were just recording their CDs and sharing them with everybody and no one was getting royalties for that. And we solved that problem with Spotify and with Apple Music. We need to solve that problem for AI.What is happening right now is not appropriate and it will wipe people out. And in my opinion, it's simply stealing. It can be fixed. There's — it's not a technologically hard problem. This is a question of assigning rights and setting up a system for compensation and for setting up a system of intellectual property ownership, just like we do with publishing novels or patents or movies. So it's very problematic, but that's fixable. It's not intrinsic.CHAKRABARTI: Right. Okay. So that's a great thought to leave us with, because again, it's fixable through human political decision making. (LAUGHS) And therein lies my persistent skepticism, not with what you're saying, Professor Autor, but with the ability for political decision making to be good.AUTOR: But think of what the actors and television writers just did to negotiate this problem for their industry.CHAKRABARTI: True, true. So maybe good positive change is possible. With that, I'm going to have to wrap up.This program aired on May 20, 2024.Thank you for choosing journalism from WBUR and On Point.

ChenKaren Weise reported from Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco.May 20, 2024The race to put artificial intelligence everywhere is taking a detour through the good old laptop computer.Microsoft on Monday introduced a new kind of computer designed for artificial intelligence. The machines, Microsoft says, will run A.I. systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.The new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use A.I. to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read, or websites they have browsed. Their A.I. systems will also automate tasks like photo editing and language translation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe new design will be included in Microsoft’s Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.ImageMicrosoft’s new Surface notebooks, powered by artificial intelligence. Credit...Grant Hindsley for The New York TimesThe A.I. PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the last two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.But A.I. stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.Microsoft wants to run A.I. systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of A.I. systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge A.I. systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.“We are entering a new era where computers not only understand us, but can anticipate what we want and our intents,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnalysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more A.I. capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.Whether the A.I. PC takes off depends on the companies’ ability to create compelling reasons for buyers to upgrade. The initial sales of these new computers, which cost more than $1,000, will be small, said Linn Huang, an analyst at IDC, which closely tracks the market. But by the end of the decade — assuming A.I. tools turn out to be useful — they will be “ubiquitous,” he predicted. “Everything will be an A.I. PC.”The computer industry is looking for a jolt. Consumers have been upgrading their own computers less frequently, as the music and photos they once stored on their machines now often live online, on Spotify, Netflix or iCloud. Computer purchases by companies, schools and other institutions have finally stabilized after booming — and then crashing — during the pandemic.Some high-end smartphones have already been integrating A.I. chips, but the sales have fallen short because the features “are still not sophisticated enough to catalyze a faster upgrade cycle,” Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. It will be at least another year, he said, before enough meaningful breakthroughs will lead consumers to take note.At the event, Microsoft showed new laptops with what it likened to having a photographic memory. Users can ask Copilot, Microsoft’s chatbot, to use a feature called Recall to look up a file by typing a question using natural language, such as, “Can you find me a video call I had with Joe recently where he was holding an ‘I Love New York’ coffee mug?” The computer will then immediately be able to retrieve the file containing those details because the A.I. systems are constantly scanning what the user does on the laptop.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMicrosoft’s Surface notebook and tablets offer access to artificial intelligence tools.Credit...Grant Hindsley for The New York Times“It remembers things that I forget,” said Matt Barlow, Microsoft’s head of marketing for Surface computers, in an interview.Microsoft said the information used for this Recall function was stored directly on the laptop for privacy, and would not be sent back to the company’s servers or be used in training future A.I. systems. Pavan Davuluri, a Microsoft executive overseeing Windows, said that with the Recall system users would also be able to opt out of sharing certain types of information, such as visits to a specific website, but that some sensitive data, such as financial information and private browsing sessions, would not be monitored by default.Microsoft also demonstrated live transcripts that translate in real time, which it said would be available on any video that streams across a laptop’s screen.Microsoft last month released A.I. models small enough to run on a phone that it said performed almost as well as GPT-3.5, the much larger system that initially underpinned OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot when it debuted in late 2022.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)Chipmakers have also made advances, like adjusting a laptop’s battery life to allow for the enormous number of calculations that A.I. demands. The new computers have dedicated chips built by Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones.Though the type of chip inside the new A.I. computers, known as a neural processing unit, specializes in handling complex A.I. tasks, such as generating images and summarizing documents, the benefits may still be unnoticeable to consumers, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University.Most of the data processing for A.I. still has to be done on a company’s servers instead of directly on the devices, so it’s still important that people have a fast internet connection, he added.But the neural processing chips also speed up other tasks, such as video editing or the ability to use a virtual background inside a video call, said Brad Linder, the editor of Liliputing, a blog that has covered computers for nearly two decades. So, even if people don’t buy into the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, they may end up getting an A.I. computer for other reasons.Karen Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.

Generative AI has the potential to change the way professionals work in every industry. In healthcare, it is set to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases, research new medicines and therapies, and manage routine administrative tasks.


Of course, AI will never replace the experience, skills and human touch of doctors and nurses. Instead, it will let them augment their abilities and expertise with super-fast insights and analysis. It can also relieve them of many of the time-consuming and routine tasks that prevent them from spending time with patients and directly improving outcomes.

Healthcare jobs are changing, and whether you are involved in delivering frontline care, developing new treatments or managing resources and infrastructure, understanding the opportunities and challenges is essential.

PROMOTED
So, in this article, I will outline some of the exciting possibilities that generative AI brings to the table for healthcare professionals, as well as some of the challenges they will face as their roles evolve.

 Generative AI In Diagnosis And Treatment
Generative AI will assist doctors and other frontline medical staff in diagnosing patients, thanks to its ability to analyze complex and disparate datasets including medical images and patient notes. Image recognition algorithms can scan x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI and CT scans, with numerous studies now emerging that show they can be as accurate as human experts at doing this. Generative AI then translates the output into human language that can even be personalized for individual specialists involved in treating the patient.

Chatbots powered by generative AI will act as virtual medical assistants, providing triage and gathering patient data, as well as identifying the best human medical professionals to refer patients to. They will also provide specialist and personalized advice; for example, the OneRemission chatbot is programmed to help cancer patients through their recovery by offering diet and lifestyle advice, while Youper is designed to offer advice on mental health.

And it will help healthcare professionals to monitor the wellbeing of patients by providing a narrative around data streams generated by wearable devices and remote monitoring tools, either in hospital or home settings. This will provide early warning signs if a patient’s condition is deteriorating, or alert carers in the case of situations such as an elderly person suffering a fall.
Research And Development
Generative AI is already accelerating the process of discovering new drugs. For example, UK biotech firm Etcembly recently created the first immunotherapy drug for patients that was designed with the help of generative AI.
By generating hundreds of millions of genetic codes for T-cell receptors, scientists were able to complete research that would usually have taken many years in just a few weeks.
As well as generating data in the form of words and pictures, as with generative tools like ChatGPT and Dall-E, algorithms can create synthetic candidates for drug trials. It can create candidates for molecular structures that may have desired effects such as binding to specific receptors, or inhibiting enzyme production, and simulate tests to determine their likely real-world effects.
It can also suggest where drugs previously developed for other conditions might be repurposed to treat specific illnesses, as has been shown by this study into potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.
Generative AI algorithms are also being used to simulate human physiological responses to drugs, creating ethical alternatives to human or animal testing.
Overall, generative AI is already showing remarkable potential for helping researchers and chemists formulate and test new drugs, and we can expect to see it playing an increasingly important role in this field in the near future.
Ethical Implications
Although generative AI offers huge potential for improving patient outcomes and driving new frontiers of medical research, it also creates challenges around ethics and regulation.
Medical professionals, perhaps more so than any other professionals, will be required to understand issues around data, privacy and bias and how they might impact their roles.
Many of the use cases we’ve discussed here, particularly those involving personalization, will require access to highly sensitive and personal information. Healthcare professionals will need a comprehensive understanding of how this data can be securely and responsibly collected, processed and stored. They will also need to develop an awareness of when work can be delegated to AI and when a human touch is irreplaceable.
We can also expect that the use of AI, and particularly generative AI, in the healthcare sector will be subject to more stringent regulations than it might be elsewhere. Professionals will need to understand their own legal responsibilities and obligations. It will also be important to develop a thorough grounding in the principle of AI accountability and liability – after all, humans must always take ultimate responsibility for the provision of patient care. New, specialized roles are likely to emerge here, concerned with ensuring generative AI is only implemented in an ethical and accountable way.
AI And The Future Of Healthcare Jobs
Overall, as generative AI tools become more deeply embedded across the day-to-day responsibilities of caregivers, their responsibilities will evolve. Less time will be taken up with routine and administrative work, meaning more time can be spent consulting with patients as well as updating their own skills and knowledge.
We’re only in the early stages of this revolution but its impact is already starting to be felt, and by preparing for it now, doctors, nurses, paramedics, therapists, researchers and managers can ensure they play a pivotal role in ensuring it benefits as many patients as possible.

Vibhor Rastogi

Cagla Kaymaz







April 29, 2024




 








Matt Carbonara, head of enterprise tech investing, Vibhor Rastogi, head of AI investing, and Cagla Kaymaz, principal of Citi Ventures, highlight the importance of understanding customer needs, navigating competition, ensuring safety and compliance, and finding the right balance between automation and human involvement for GenAI entrepreneurs.
From both the top down and the bottom up, large enterprises are eager to implement generative AI (GenAI) solutions that can help them increase productivity and improve business outcomes. Many are still early in their adoption process and are working through such considerations as whether to build or buy the solutions they need and which vendors to partner with.

This is creating a rare greenfield opportunity for entrepreneurs looking to build enterprise-grade GenAI tools. But while the time to move on GenAI is now, selling a GenAI solution to a large enterprise is an especially complex undertaking given the field’s additional tech requirements, data privacy concerns, and fast-evolving regulatory landscape.
Having spent the last decade-plus investing in AI startups and the last couple of years following the GenAI revolution closelyOpens a new window , we know well what it takes to sell a GenAI product to a large and heavily regulated enterprise. Here are four best practices for doing just that.
1. Decide if GenAI Is the Best AI for the Job
AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) offer tremendous power and potential, but they’re not the right fit for every use case. Traditional machine learning (ML) models or even decision trees can still perform some tasks better than LLMs. For example, fraud detection, marketing and risk models that primarily work on structured data are still best served by ML, which is great at dealing with large statistical models, making predictions and recommending the next best action with high confidence.

So before you embark on building a GenAI product, make sure you’re doing so not to capture the hype cycle but because LLMs actually help you build a best-in-class solution to a key customer problem. Using LLMs over the models’ enterprises are more familiar with means both taking on significant compute or API costs and undergoing more intensive security scrutiny and onboarding processes — so if you don’t need them, it will be hard to justify the extra effort. 
Furthermore, you may lose credibility with stakeholders for trying to use a sports car when a sedan will do. No matter how cool and cutting-edge the technology is, in order for a large enterprise to spend resources on it, there must be a clear, high-priority business need.

2. Find a Way To Take on or Dodge the Incumbents
Unlike prior technological shifts that were largely led by startups, Big Tech incumbents like Microsoft and Amazon have been fast to adopt GenAI and are even driving key advancements in the space. To beat them at their own game, you’ll need to understand which use cases they’re going after and how they’re embedding GenAI into their product suites. That will help you find a unique value proposition that incumbents aren’t in a good position to offer in the near term and/or to execute well for reasons such as deficits in their employee talent profile or limitations in their core competency.
3. Make Safety and Security Your Top Priority
Large enterprises place immense value on data security and regulatory compliance, particularly when it comes to AI—so to get in the door with them, you’ll have to have strong guardrails for your product. In general, you should embrace the principles of responsible AI, implementing the right policies and standards or partnering with vendors that do so.
For example, many enterprises are worried about data leakage,  and will not let you use their data for model training; make sure they are able to opt out of that and still use your product effectively. It is also important to provide them with role-based access controls so only the people authorized to perform certain tasks or see certain documents are able to do so (this is particularly pertinent to retrieval-augmented generation systems). 
Enterprises tend to have a low-risk tolerance for hallucinations and bias as well, and depending on the use case might have zero tolerance. For example, while it might be okay for a GenAI product drafting marketing copy to hallucinate on occasion, it’s unacceptable when giving financial advice to customers.
Lastly, make sure you’re staying on top of the fast-evolving landscape of global AI regulation and articulate clearly the policies and standards you have in place to remain compliant over the long term.
4. Figure Out How Much You Want Humans To Be in the Loop
As excited as we are about GenAI’s potential to automate a wide range of human tasks, it still has a long way to go—the non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes it difficult to produce repeatable outputs, even when given the same input. Given many large enterprises’ low-risk appetite, we recommend creating a GenAI product that falls into one of the three categories below depending on the use case and the end-users error tolerance:

Copilot: So-called AI copilots are tools meant to foster collaboration between a human user and an AI system; the AI makes suggestions so the user can better perform their task (e.g., GitHub Copilot suggests code to developers as they type). Tolerance for error is high for AI copilots, as the human is still in full control.
Human-in-the-loop (HIL): In HIL tools, the AI does most of the work while the human oversees and makes final decisions—for example, an AI-based wealth management tool could draft a portfolio construction recommendation that the human wealth advisor would review and revise as needed before sending it to a client. Though there is some tolerance for error in HIL tools, the AI should be fairly reliable.
Autopilot: Here, the AI is fully autonomous and makes all the decisions, such as a customer service bot that converses with a user and can purchase products for them.

At this stage of the GenAI adoption curve, we expect AI copilots and HIL tools to be the most common types available and your best bet in ensuring enterprises will be comfortable using your technology. However, we suspect this will change in the next few years as better testing and monitoring systems make autopilots more viable.

Quick Hits

With Governor Jared Polis’s signing into law SB 24-205, Colorado becomes the first U.S. state to enact comprehensive legislation regulating the use and development of AI systems.
The law addresses, among other things, the risk of algorithmic discrimination “arising from the intended and contracted uses of … high-risk artificial intelligence system[s].”
The Colorado AI Act will take effect on February 1, 2026.

Colorado’s AI Act, SB 24-205, is designed to regulate the use of “high-risk” AI systems, imposing compliance obligations on both “developers” (i.e., creators) and “deployers” (i.e., users) of AI systems. Structurally, the law is similar to the European Union’s recently adopted Artificial Intelligence Act. The Colorado AI Act will become part of Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act. While the Colorado AI Act does not appear to authorize private rights of action (providing the Colorado attorney general with exclusive enforcement authority), there is some ambiguity regarding enforcement, as the legislation also provides that a violation of the act will be a deceptive trade practice under Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act—which law does allow for private rights of action.
What Employers Need to Know
Colorado’s AI Act contains different requirements and rules depending on whether an entity is a developer or a deployer. Because the employer community will largely fall into the “deployer” definition, this article highlights aspects of the law that are most pertinent to deployers/employers using AI as part of their people practices.
Colorado Employers Using Certain AI Systems Will Be Subject to the Law
The Colorado AI Act is designed to cover the employment context. Specifically, it is intended to address the use by any persons or entities in Colorado of AI systems in employment decisions and to protect any “consumers,” defined as Colorado residents. The framework provides a narrow exemption for employers with fewer than fifty employees that do not use their own data to train or further improve their AI systems.
Colorado Has Developed Its Own “Algorithmic Discrimination” Definition
The Colorado AI Act defines “algorithmic discrimination” to mean any condition in which the use of an AI system “results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived age, color, disability, ethnicity, genetic information, limited proficiency in the English language, national origin, race, religion, reproductive health, sex, veteran status, or other classification protected under the laws of [Colorado] or federal law.”
High-Risk AI Systems Are in the Crosshairs
As AI laws continue to be proposed, developed, and implemented throughout the world, employers are continually facing evolving and different definitions of what qualifies as a covered AI system. Colorado’s AI Act is focused on “high-risk” AI systems, defined as any AI system that “makes, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision.” (Emphasis added.) Importantly, a “consequential decision”—i.e., “a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect” on the provision or denial to Colorado residents of a broad array of essential services, opportunities, and entitlements—includes a decision related to “employment or an employment opportunity.” A “substantial factor” means one that (1) “assists in making a consequential decision”; (2) “is capable of altering the outcome of a consequential decision”; and (3) “is generated by an artificial intelligence system.” “‘Substantial factor’ includes any use of an artificial intelligence system to generate any content, decision, prediction, or recommendation concerning a consumer that is used as a basis to make a consequential decision concerning the consumer.” There are also certain enumerated exclusions from the definition of high-risk AI systems. The current definitions leave much room for ambiguity that will hopefully be the source of refinement in future guidance.
Various New Obligations Will Exist for Deployers/Employers
Under the Colorado AI Act, deployers/employers are required to use “reasonable care” to protect consumers from any “known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.” The law creates a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care if certain compliance steps are taken, including:

Risk-management policies and programs. Deployers/employers must implement a risk management policy and program meeting certain defined criteria. This risk management policy and program must be an “iterative process” that is regularly and systematically reviewed and updated. Further, the risk management policy and program must be reasonable in consideration of various listed factors, including: risk management frameworks published by the Colorado attorney general or guidance and standards issued by various identified national or international risk management frameworks for AI (such as the “Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework” published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)); the size and complexity of the deployer/employer; and the nature and scope of the high-risk AI system used by the deployer/employer.


Impact assessments. Covered employers must also complete annual impact assessments for high-risk AI systems (or even more frequently if there is an intentional and substantial modification of the system). These impact assessments are similar to the annual bias audits required by New York City’s AI law. Among other things, an impact assessment must include:


a statement of the purpose, use cases, and benefits of the AI system;
an analysis of whether there are “known or reasonably foreseeable” risks of algorithmic discrimination, and, if so, the steps taken to mitigate the risks;
a description of the categories of data processed as inputs and the outputs of the AI system;if the system has been customized by the deployer/employer, “an overview of the categories of data … used to customize” the system;“metrics used to evaluate the performance and known limitations” of the AI system;a “description of any transparency measures taken concerning” the AI system, “including any measures taken” to notify Colorado consumers of the use of the system; and
“a description of the post-deployment monitoring and user safeguards provided” relating to the AI system.


Notices to consumers. Colorado employers are also required to provide various notices. Among other provisions in Colorado’s AI Act is one requiring consumers to be notified that a deployer/employer has deployed a covered AI system “to make, or be a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision before the decision is made.” (Emphasis added.) Under the law, deployers/employers must also provide consumers with a statement disclosing the purpose of the covered AI system, the nature of the consequential decision, and a description of the covered AI system. Additionally, for a consumer adversely affected by an AI system, further notifications must be provided, such as a statement disclosing the principal reason(s) for the consequential decision; “an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data” used by the covered AI system; and “an opportunity to appeal an adverse consequential decision … which appeal must, if technically feasible, allow for human review.” An employer also must post in a “clear and readily available” manner a notice on its website containing various information regarding covered AI systems, such as the types that are currently used, how the employer manages risks of algorithmic discrimination, and “in detail, the nature, source, and extent” of data collected and used by the employer.


Notice to attorney general. Additionally, employers must disclose to Colorado’s attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination—within ninety days after the date of the discovery—that the high-risk AI system has caused.

Colorado Has Provided Affirmative Defenses
Interestingly, the law provides for potential affirmative defenses in any enforcement action by the Colorado attorney general if a deployer/employer discovers and cures a violation as a result of (i) feedback, (ii) “adversarial testing or red teaming” (as those terms are defined by NIST), or (iii) an internal review process and the deployer/employer is otherwise in compliance with NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework or another internationally recognized framework for artificial intelligence management.
What’s Next?
In addition to closely monitoring for guidance on or amendments to the Colorado AI Act, employers may want to consider the following:

Inventorying AI uses as part of human resources practices and weighing whether any or all of the uses fall within the current definition of covered high-risk AI systems for the purposes of the act.
Evaluating whether the organization has or should develop AI policies or frameworks to manage AI systems.
Commissioning a cross-disciplinary team to monitor AI systems used by the organization, as well as relevant legal developments.
Assessing whether the organization provides notices about AI systems used. The requirement of notices is a growing trend in AI laws and is also a “promising practice” recommended by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

Currently, many states are actively considering similar AI legislation and regulations. Ogletree Deakins’ Technology Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the Cybersecurity and Privacy, State Developments, and Technology blogs as additional information becomes available.

Barnes, Jeffrey W. Brecher, Joseph J. Lynett & Katharine C. WeberThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has published a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) on the application of federal labor standards to employers’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated systems in the workplace. Bulletins provide guidance to field staff on enforcing the federal statutes administered by the WHD.FAB No. 2024-1 emphasizes that statutory protections apply as usual, irrespective of the new tools and systems employers are using. However, the use of AI may pose some compliance challenges. “Regardless of the exact AI or other technologies used, the principles described here provide guidance for evaluating how to comply with the law,” the FAB states.In addition to addressing the potential implications of AI in properly tracking hours worked and calculating wages owed under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the FAB addresses the potential impact of AI on compliance with the FLSA’s protections for nursing employees. The FAB also provides detailed guidance on the challenges that may arise with the use of AI and compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).Tracking Hours Worked, Calculating Wages OwedThe takeaway for employers from the FAB is to “exercise responsible human oversight” when using AI and other automated systems to track employees’ working time or determine wage rates to ensure the tools count all compensable time under the FLSA and properly calculate wages owed.Tracking work time. Employers increasingly use automated monitoring tools to analyze whether employees are “active” or “idle.” Monitoring tools measure computer keystrokes, mouse clicks, and website browsing to analyze employee productivity. Facial recognition technologies track employee eye movements by webcam. However, the productivity metrics obtained by these tools do not determine whether an employee is performing “hours worked” for FLSA purposes. If the tools erroneously conclude an employee is not “working” and incorrectly categorize working time as noncompensable, the employer may violate the FLSA by undercounting compensable time and failing to pay wages for all hours worked.Auto-deduct break time. Some automated timekeeping systems or software that track employee breaks incorporate AI to predict and auto-populate break time entries based on past time entries, regular shift and break schedules, and other factors. Employers using “auto-deduct” tools still need to ensure that employees are completely relieved of duty during recorded breaks, that time records accurately reflect employee breaks actually taken, and that employees are properly compensated for breaks not taken.Waiting time. Waiting time is compensable if employees are expected to be fully available to work, must remain near the workstation, and do not have enough time between tasks for their own non-work pursuits. When employees are on duty but are waiting for their next assigned task, AI technologies that assign task routes and adjust schedules based on real time data must accurately account for those periods of compensable time during which employees are “engaged to wait.” For example, some hotels use automated systems to assign tasks to housekeeping staff. When a hotel guest checks out of their room, the system automatically delegates a cleaning assignment to a particular housekeeping employee based on their availability and reassigns tasks throughout the day based on current data. These tools allow managers to track employee activities in real time. The employees are still working if they are “engaged to wait” between the assignments, even as tasks are reassigned over the course of a shift. However, the use of AI tools to automate scheduling and assign work tasks may result in a FLSA violation if the tools do not accurately identify whether employees’ waiting time is compensable.Multiple locations. The location of work is not determinative of whether the employee has performed hours worked under the FLSA, and use of location monitoring to track employees and determine whether they are “working” may create compliance problems if the system fails to properly account for compensable time worked in different locales. Geolocation software that tracks an employee’s location relative to a job site, automatically clocking in and clocking out the employee when entering and leaving a job site, may fail to account the employee’s compensable time before arriving at the designated job site. The start of an employee’s workday may include picking up tools at the employer’s plant and the travel time to the job site. Likewise, the workday may continue after leaving a job site if the employee has to unload supplies or perform administrative or other tasks off-site. Such a system also must account for the compensable travel time between jobs at different job sites.Calculating wages owed. Some AI technologies can automatically recalculate and adjust an employee’s pay rate (including piece rates or rates paid on a per task basis) throughout the workday. The variable pay rates may mean significantly different regular rates from week to week. Employers that use these systems must make sure they accurately calculate the applicable minimum wage, regular rate of pay, and overtime premium. In addition to factoring multiple wage rates in a single workweek, AI systems must account for the many types of payments, including nondiscretionary bonuses, commissions, or other compensation, that go into an employee’s regular rate of pay.AI and FMLA ComplianceThe FAB also emphasizes “responsible human oversight” when using AI and other automated systems to administer FMLA leave.Processing leave requests. AI or other technologies are sometimes used to process leave requests, track time off, and integrate absence calendars. The WHD emphasizes, “[W]ithout responsible human oversight, relying on automated systems to process leave requests, including determining eligibility, calculating available leave entitlements, or evaluating whether leave is for a qualifying reason, can create potential compliance challenges.” For example, a timekeeping program that incorrectly determines the number of hours an employee has worked may lead to a failure to correctly determine the employee’s FMLA eligibility.Certifications. Use of AI to administer FMLA leave can create potential risk of violating the FMLA certification requirements if the AI system fails to comply with the FMLA’s limitations on the information that can be requested or notification or deadline requirements. For example, the WHD points out that an automated system that results in an employee being asked to disclose more medical information than the FMLA allows could violate the FMLA.Interference and retaliation. AI and other automated systems that track leave may not be used “to target FMLA leave users for retaliation or discourage” use of leave. If the use of AI or an automated system leads to adverse action against employees because of their use of FMLA leave, that may result in unlawful retaliation or interference. For example, employers are prohibited from using systems to count FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions such as hiring, promotions, or disciplinary actions or assigning negative attendance points.AI and Nursing Employee ProtectionEmployers must provide employees reasonable break time and space to express breast milk under the FLSA, as amended by the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act. The WHD cautions against the use of AI to limit the length, frequency, or timing of breaks for nursing employees. The WHD also advises that the use of productivity scoring and monitoring systems that penalize a worker for failing to meet productivity standards due to the worker having taken pump breaks would violate the FLSA. Such productivity monitoring would need to be adjusted so employees are not being required to meet production requirements during the time they are taking pump breaks.Other ProvisionsThe FAB notes that the use of AI to gauge an individual’s truthfulness may be subject to the restrictions on lie detector tests under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. Finally, it cautions against the use of AI to take adverse actions against employees for engaging in activities protected under any of the federal statutes enforced by the WHD.The FAB, written by Wage and Hour Administrator Jessica Looman, was issued April 29, 2024. The guidance was prepared in response to President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14110, which calls for a coordinated U.S. government approach to ensuring the responsible and safe development and use of AI.Contact your Jackson Lewis attorney if you have questions about compliance with federal and state employment laws when using AI tools in the workplace.©2024 Jackson Lewis P.C.

Felsberg, Joseph J. Lazzarotti & Michelle L. DuncanEnacting what is perhaps the first comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) at the state level in the United States, Colorado’s governor signed the Artificial Intelligence Act, Senate Bill (SB) 24-205, on May 17, 2024.Colorado is not alone in advancing AI regulation. The new law joins the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s technical assistance documents, the Department of Labor’s recent pronouncement, the New York City automated employment decision tools law, Tennessee’s regulation of deepfakes, Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, Maryland’s facial recognition law, and the European Union’s AI Act, to name a few.SB 24-205 targets “developers” and “deployers,” categories that will very likely reach organizations in their capacities as employers. It requires both to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination in high-risk artificial intelligence systems. In each case, satisfying specified provisions will establish a rebuttable presumption that reasonable care was used, creating a compliance roadmap for deployers and developers to consider.The statute takes effect on February 1, 2026.Definition of High-Risk AI SystemsUnder the statute, high-risk AI systems are defined as those that when used make or are a substantial factor in making “consequential” decisions. Consequential decisions could affect:Employment or employment opportunityEducation enrollment or opportunityFinancial or lending services Essential government services Healthcare services Housing InsuranceLegal servicesHigh-risk systems do not include AI that either (i) performs narrow procedural tasks or (ii) detects decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not intended to replace or influence human assessment or review.The statute also excludes certain technologies, such as cybersecurity technologies and spam filtering, from high-risk AI systems when they are not making or a substantial factor in making consequential decisions.Developer ObligationsA developer as defined in the statute is a person doing business in Colorado who develops or intentionally and substantially modifies an AI system.Under the statute, developers of high-risk AI systems are required to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination. The statute includes a rebuttable presumption that a developer used reasonable care if the developer complied with specific requirements, including:Making available to deployers of the AI system a statement disclosing specified information about the system  Providing deployers the information and documentation necessary to complete an impact assessment  Making a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the developer has developed or intentionally and substantially modified and currently makes available to a deployer and how the developer manages any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination that may arise from the development  Disclosing to the state attorney general and known deployers any known or reasonably foreseeable risk of algorithmic discrimination within 90 days after discoveryDeployer ObligationsA deployer is a person doing business in Colorado who uses high-risk AI systems. Deployers such as employers using AI for certain purposes also have an obligation to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination.As with developers, there is a rebuttable presumption that deployers used reasonable care if they comply with the following:Implement a risk management policy and program for high-risk AI systems  Complete an impact assessment of high-risk AI systems Notify consumers of specified items if the high-risk systems make decisions about a consumer  Make a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the deployer currently deploys Disclose to the attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination within 90 days of discoveryCertain deployers may be exempt from requirements such as notice to consumers if at the time of deployment and at all times while using high-risk AI systems:They employ fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees; Do not use their own data to train the AI system; The AI system is used for the intended uses disclosed by the developer; and Makes certain information related to impact assessment available to consumers.EnforcementSB 24-205 makes clear there is no private right of action under the law, leaving exclusive enforcement to the state attorney general’s office. The attorney general’s office also has discretion under the statute to implement further rulemaking.TakeawaysThere is no time like the present to consider risk management plans and disclosures for the use of AI, particularly in areas like employment and especially as the federal government sharpens its focus on the use of AI and other states consider similar requirements.If you have questions about compliance with the Colorado statute or similar AI regulation, contact a member of our Artificial Intelligence Group or the Jackson Lewis attorney with whom you regularly work.©2024 Jackson Lewis P.C.

Sectors more exposed to AI are experiencing almost fivefold greater labour productivity growth, new report states

 A new report has starkly illustrated the benefits that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in the workplace, despite concerns over widespread job losses.
Accountancy firm PwC announced on Tuesday a new report, the 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer, which claimed that sectors more exposed to AI (i.e. AI can be readily used for some tasks) are experiencing almost fivefold (4.8x) greater labour productivity growth.
This will be welcome news for employers, but may be not assuage concerns from employees, concerned at their job security.
In March the left-of-centre thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), had warned that almost 8 million UK jobs could be lost to artificial intelligence in a “jobs apocalypse”.

AI jobs, skills
PwC in its 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer report analysed over half a billion job ads from 15 countries, suggested that AI could allow many nations to break out of persistent low productivity growth, generating economic development, higher wages, and enhanced living standards.
The report found that for every job posting requiring AI specialist skills (i.e., machine learning) in 2012, there are now seven job postings.
PwC research also found that growth in jobs demanding AI skills has outpaced all jobs since 2016, with postings for jobs requiring AI skills growing 3.5x faster than for all jobs.
The findings also highlighted economic opportunity for labour forces: jobs that require AI skills carry up to a 25 percent average wage premium in some markets.
The report also found that skills sought by employers are changing much faster in occupations more exposed to AI, with old skills disappearing – and new skills appearing – in job ads at a 25 percent higher rate than in occupations less exposed to AI.

The report said that in order to stay relevant in these occupations, workers will need to demonstrate or acquire new skills.
Labour market impact
“AI is transforming the labour market globally and presents good news for a global economy hindered by deep economic challenges and concerns around long-term business viability,” noted Carol Stubbings, global markets and tax leader at PwC UK.
“For many economies experiencing labour shortages and low productivity growth, the findings highlight optimism around AI with the technology representing an opportunity for economic development, job-creation, and the creation of new industries entirely,” said Stubbings.
“However, the findings show that workers will need to build new skills and organisations will need to invest in their AI strategies and people if they are to turbocharge their development and ensure they are fit for the AI age.”
Job worries
The PwC report also found that AI penetration is accelerating, particularly in knowledge work sectors.
Despite the productivity increase, there remains deep concern at the prospect of widespread job losses from AI.
Last week Reuters noted that the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva had said AI was hitting the global labour market “like a tsunami” and was likely to have an impact on 60% of jobs in advanced economies in the next two years.
It comes after the IMF in January 2024, had warned that nearly 40 percent of jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, which could result in replacing jobs and worsening inequalities.

The uptick in productivity in sectors more exposed to AI – such as financial services, information technology, and professional services – was marginally higher in the UK than the global average.Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 there has been much debate about the employment implications of the new era of smart machines but PwC said AI had been having an impact on the jobs market for more than a decade. From a low base, postings for specialist AI jobs were seven times higher than in 2012, compared with a doubling for all other jobs.PwC’s 2024 global AI jobs barometer found that companies were currently using AI as a solution to a lack of available workers.“This could be good news for many nations facing shrinking working age populations and vast unmet needs for labour in many sectors,” it said. “AI can help to ensure that the labour supply is available for the economy to reach its full potential.”The report said the fact that employment in AI-exposed occupations was still growing suggested that the arrival of generative AI did not herald an era of job losses. One study, from the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, has predicted that up to 8m posts could go in the UK in a jobs “apocalypse” within the next few years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In terms of the economic impact, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg – currently, our findings suggest that the adoption of AI is concentrated in a few sectors of the economy, but once the technology improves and diffuses across other sectors of the economy, the future potential could be transformative.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Global economyProductivityPwCTechnology sectorEconomicsChatGPTnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMichigan man kills himself after running over 80-year-old Trump supporterTrump files complaint against Harris for taking over Biden’s campaign fundsUkraine war briefing: ‘Occupiers’ ship severely damaged’ in Kavkas across from CrimeaNashville struggles to respond as neo-Nazi groups turn focus on to cityTrump team makes complaint about Harris campaign funds – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fear of Getting Replaced in the Age of Generative In the age of generative AI, white-collar jobs may be replaced within 5 to 10 years. According to some experts, AI can excel in data entry, writing articles for companies, customer service, and numerous other tasks. Network engineers, data scientists, and developers are also wary of the impact AI is having on some tasks.

New research from Pearson shows how Generative AI could help UK workers to save 19 million hours a week by 2026

New research from Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), the world’s leading learning company, shows the massive potential of Generative AI to boost workplace productivity by helping UK workers to save 19 million hours a week on the routine and repetitive tasks that often fill their day and lead to burnout.

The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, ‘Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work’ - looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).


Pearson’s workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.


The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the UK are:



Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (679,000 hours)



Develop educational programs, plans, or procedures (665,000 hours)



Create visual designs or displays (525,000 hours)



Maintain operational records (512,000 hours)



Prepare legal or regulatory documents (490,000 hours)



Maintain health or medical records (406,000 hours)



Prepare reports of operational or procedural activities (401,000 hours)



Advise others on products or services (387,000 hours)



Explain regulations, policies, or procedures (386,000 hours)



Monitor individual behaviour or performance (383,000 hours)



By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership.


At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with Generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance.


Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:


“In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”

Methodology

At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.


Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the UK on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years' time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing HR by improving employee experiences and organization operations. Geoffrey Peterson, VP of data and analytics at Alight Solutions, discusses critical areas where AI can enhance HR practices and offers guidance to HR leaders on effectively leveraging its potential.
Artificial intelligence (AI) permeates many facets of the modern enterprise, transforming how businesses function and interact with their employees and customers. The Human Resources (HR) organization has not escaped this trend, where leaders are being pushed to demonstrate how AI is reshaping processes and enhancing employee experiences –all while coming up to speed on how to be AI intrapreneurs and how to ensure AI is being introduced responsibly. 
For example, GartnerOpens a new window  reports that “By 2025, 60% of enterprise organizations will adopt a responsible AI framework for their HR technology, and in turn, achieve a greater employee experience and trust in the organization.” 
However, amidst the promise of AI-driven efficiencies and innovations, there lies a complex interplay of both potential and peril that demands careful consideration and management. Though AI brings new and exciting capabilities to HR, it also inherits the risks and governance needs inherent to all software, as well as a few additional ones. 
For example, while AI might be alluring for HR functions like recruitment and performance management to automate resume or performance reviews, errors or bad outputs in these domains can have unacceptable real-world consequences. 
As HR executives navigate this landscape, it’s crucial to separate fact from fiction and understand how to leverage AI effectively to enhance the employee experience.
Dispelling 5 Myths About AI in HR
Before diving into the practical applications of AI in HR, it’s essential to debunk some common myths surrounding its implementation:
1. AI will replace HR professionals
Contrary to popular concerns, AI is not poised to replace HR professionals. Current AI technology isn’t autonomous intelligence, it is scaled intelligence. This means every process that is automated or augmented with AI still needs to have some number of humans who are in the loop to monitor its actions and insights for correctness and quality. 
Additionally, many HR tasks cannot be “AI-ed away,” including strategic planning, relationship management, and ensuring ethical HR practices. An HR professional’s ability to understand psychological factors, foster workplace diversity, maintain data security, provide clear communication, relate to employees on a human level, and monitor AI systems! cannot be fully replicated by AI.
2. AI decision-making is a Black Box
Some AI algorithms are opaque, but there are many (e.g., linear regressions, decision trees) whose decision-making can be more easily understood. By considering the surrounding business context of a proposed use case – including how explainable good/ bad decisions will need to be – the right AI algorithms can be chosen for an application that offers the right level of understandability.
3. Employee data security is at risk with AI
AI is, ultimately, just software. Companies with robust cybersecurity and third-party management programs already have the mechanisms needed to manage the risks related to employee data security.  
A specific scenario that seems to be causing recent concern is that of SaaS vendors training AI models using aggregated, anonymized employee data from across their client base. However, this is not a new risk – SaaS vendors have used aggregated employee data for a long time to understand the performance of their products and make improvements – and the recent focus on this happening with AI models is misplaced. 
4. It is possible for AI to be bias-free 
All AI produces bad output occasionally, and when those bad outputs concentrate in certain parts of the user population, that is called bias. All models have the bias of some form—if you think yours doesn’t, you just haven’t found it yet.  
It is important to understand what types of bias you are especially worried about and continuously check and monitor for those. You may not care if “bad outputs” concentrate on people whose first names start with “A,” but you may care if “bad outputs” concentrate only on older or younger users of the AI system.
5. HR teams need numerous complex AI use cases to be successful
Success in AI implementation does not hinge on the number of use cases but rather on their quality and alignment with organizational objectives. Any meaningful implementation of an AI system will be a large undertaking requiring significant investment (both to implement and to monitor on an ongoing basis). Achieving impact with two to three new use cases is ambitious and an enormous win for most organizations.

Understanding AI in HR

AI encompasses various techniques that enable machines to simulate human intelligence. In HR, AI manifests in different forms, from basic algorithms used in recruiting software to complex machine learning models that personalize the employee experience. It’s sometimes helpful to also include robotic process automation (RPA) under the AI umbrella since the objectives (automating repetitive tasks) are the same, and it’s often a precursor to AI-based automation.
There are several key areas where AI can drive substantial improvements in HR practices; these include:

Personalization: AI can tailor digital experiences to individual employee needs and preferences, whether through personalized onboarding experiences, benefits recommendations, nudges, or learning paths.
Assistance: AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots provide immediate support to employees, answering questions and directing them to resources.
Recommendations: AI analyzes data to offer guidance in complex circumstances, such as health plan options during enrollment or development courses based on career goals.
Insights: By analyzing data from various sources, AI provides insights into employee sentiment, experience hotspot areas that need improvement, and the effectiveness of HR initiatives.
Operations: AI automates repetitive tasks like document processing and scheduling, creating faster turn-around times for employees and allowing HR professionals to focus on more strategic initiatives.

As organizations embark on their AI journey in HR, it’s essential to manage expectations and adopt a measured approach. Success relies on the rigorous measurement of performance, error rates, biases, and business impact designed around humans-in-the-loop that can monitor and improve any AI solutions. This journey requires time, experimentation, robust controls and governance to ensure ethical and effective use of AI in enhancing the employee experience.

The law is to regulate use of AI in ""high-risk"" sectors, such as law enforcement and employment.https://p.dw.com/p/4g5xLCopy linkEU lawmakers are hoping to regulate the use of AI early on as it infiltrates ever more sectorsImage: Oliver Berg/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementEU ministers on Tuesday signed off on a landmark law that sets out rules for using artificial intelligence in situations and sectors that are deemed particularly sensitive.
Under the law, AI systems used in areas such as law enforcement and employment will have to demonstrate that they are adequately transparent and accurate, fulfill cybersecurity standards and meet criteria regarding the quality of the data used to train them.
The vote by EU countries came two months after the European Parliament backed the AI legislation.
The bloc's law goes well beyond the voluntary compliance approach to AI in the US, for example, and could have a signal effect across the globe.
What is the law and how will it be implemented?
The law stipulates that systems meant for use in ""high-risk"" situations will have to obtain certification from approved bodies before they can be put on the EU market.
Such situations include those where use of AI could potentially harm health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, elections and the rule of law.
Systems such as the social credit scoring used in China will be banned outright, as will biometric categorization systems based on people's religious or other worldviews, sexual orientation and race.AI's role in life & death decisions To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video04:07
The final law does generally ban real-time facial recognition in CCTV, but makes exceptions for law enforcement uses, such as finding missing persons or victims of kidnapping, preventing human trafficking, or finding suspects in serious criminal cases.
AI systems that are deemed to pose limited risks will have to meet much lighter transparency standards, among other things being obliged to disclose that their content is AI-generated to allow people to decide how much trust they have in it.  
A new ""AI Office"" within the European Commission is to be established to make sure the law is enforced at EU level.
The law must now be signed by the presidents of the EU legislature and then published in the EU's statute book. It then technically goes into force 20 days later, but most of its provisions won't take effect until two years after that.
Companies make safety commitments
In another sign of widespread concern surrounding the potential damage that could be caused by AI, more than a dozen of the world's leading AI firms made fresh safety commitments at a global summit in Seoul on Tuesday, according to the UK government.
These commitments ensure the world's leading AI companies will provide transparency and accountability on their plans to develop safe AI,"" UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement released by Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.
The companies included Alphabet's Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others from China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.
The summit was hosted by South Korea and Britain.The facial recognition weaponTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video03:52

Artificial Intelligence Trained to Draw Inspiration From Images, Not Copy Them


















Powerful new artificial intelligence models sometimes, quite famously, get things wrong — whether hallucinating false information or memorizing others’ work and offering it up as their own. To address the latter, researchers led by a team at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a framework to train AI models on images corrupted beyond recognition.
DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are among the text-to-image diffusion generative AI models that can turn arbitrary user text into highly realistic images. All three are now facing lawsuits from artists who allege generated samples replicate their work. Trained on billions of image-text pairs that are not publicly available, the models are capable of generating high-quality imagery from textual prompts but may draw on copyrighted images that they then replicate.
The newly proposed framework, called Ambient Diffusion, gets around this problem by training diffusion models through access only to corrupted image-based data. Early efforts suggest the framework is able to continue to generate high-quality samples without ever seeing anything that’s recognizable as the original source images.
Ambient Diffusion was originally presented at NeurIPS, a top machine-learning conference, in 2023 and has since been adapted and extended. The follow-up paper, “Consistent Diffusion Meets Tweedie,” was accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning. In collaboration with Constantinos Daskalakis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the team extended the framework to train diffusion models on data sets of images corrupted by other types of noise, rather than by simply masking pixels, and on larger data sets.
“The framework could prove useful for scientific and medical applications, too,” said Adam Klivans, a professor of computer science, who was involved in the work. “That would be true for basically any research where it is expensive or impossible to have a full set of uncorrupted data, from black hole imaging to certain types of MRI scans.”
Klivans; Alex Dimakis, a professor of electrical and computer engineering; and other collaborators in the multi-institution Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning directed by the two UT faculty members experimented first by training a diffusion model on a set of 3,000 images of celebrities, then using that model to generate new samples. In the experiment, the diffusion model trained on clean data blatantly copied the training examples. But when researchers corrupted the training data, randomly masking up to 90% of individual pixels in an image, and retrained the model with their new approach, the generated samples remained high quality but looked very different. The model can still generate human faces, but the generated ones are sufficiently different from the training images.
“Our framework allows for controlling the trade-off between memorization and performance,” said Giannis Daras, a computer science graduate student who led the work. “As the level of corruption encountered during training increases, the memorization of the training set decreases.”
The researchers said this points to a solution that, though it may change performance, will never output noise. The framework offers an example of how academic researchers are advancing artificial intelligence to meet societal needs, a key theme this year at The University of Texas at Austin, which has declared 2024 the “Year of AI.”
The research team included members from the University of California, Berkeley and MIT.
Funding for the research was provided by the National Science Foundation, Western Digital, Amazon, Cisco and a variety of sources of fellowship and endowment support for the authors.

What Studies Show about AI Salaries 
Recent studies and reports have shed light on the growing impact of AI skills on salaries and career trajectories. These trends point to the increasing value that employers place on AI expertise and the competitive edge it provides for job seekers.

Higher Skills, Higher Wages: An Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership study found that employers are willing to pay higher wages to employees with AI skills and expertise. This data supports the increasing value placed on AI proficiency in the job market, underscoring a competitive edge for candidates with these specialized skills.
Specialized Knowledge Beats Experience: Microsoft and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Annual Report showed that 71 percent of leaders would hire a less-experienced candidate with AI skills over a more-experienced one without them. This statistic emphasizes the growing importance of AI skills in recruitment and career advancement, positioning AI knowledge as a notable asset in today’s competitive workforce.
AI Expertise Demands Premium Wages: Additionally, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute and Center for Social Data Science at the University of Copenhagen indicates that workers with AI skills command salaries 21 percent higher than average. This salary premium reflects the scarcity of AI talent and the high demand for professionals who can use AI technologies effectively.

Salary Ranges of Popular Jobs
As AI continues to transform industries globally, the demand for skilled professionals in this field has skyrocketed.

They assess client needs, design AI solutions, and oversee implementation to deliver tangible outcomes. Salary for AI consultants can vary widely based on consulting firm, experience level, and project scope. Geographic location also influences compensation, with major consulting hubs offering higher salaries.

Expert Insights on AI Job Salaries and Careers
Insights from industry experts highlight the growing importance of AI expertise across industries, emphasizing the need for continuous learning and upskilling, and the potential impact of AI on job roles and compensation.
“The widening pay gap between tech and non-tech roles underscores the influence of AI across industries, suggesting salaries will increasingly revolve around AI expertise,” according to Young Pham, a project manager at BizReport. This showcases how AI skills command higher pay as organizations seek to take advantage of this transformative technology.
Sheila Jordan, SVP and Chief Digital Technology Officer for Honeywell, said her company is taking a proactive approach to AI.
“We’ve made AI training a priority to ensure everyone can use Copilot and other AI solutions,” she said. “We also launched the GenAI Academy to support employee growth and increase AI ambassadors.” Jordan’s insight stresses the significance of ongoing professional development to stay competitive in the AI job market.
The benefits to skills development in this field are clear, even if the future is not. “If your job is affected by AI, your salary might actually increase,” said Sander van’t Noordende, CEO of talent company Randstad. This suggests that as AI automates tasks, the remaining human roles may become more specialized and valuable, leading to higher compensation for those with the skills necessary to work with AI.
How Do I Get Paid More as an AI Professional?
To increase your earning potential and get paid more as an AI professional, a number of strategies to boost your skills and marketability can be effective. Here are some of the more common ones:

Hone Your AI Skills: Continuously improving and refining your skills is key to increasing your value in the job market. Stay updated with the latest AI trends and technologies in your sector. Take online courses, attend workshops, and actively seek opportunities to deepen your expertise.
Get a Technical Certification: Obtaining relevant AI certifications can significantly boost your credentials and marketability. Certifications validate your expertise and demonstrate your commitment to professional development.
Get an Advanced Degree: While not always necessary, having an advanced degree (such as a master’s or MBA) can enhance your earning potential, especially in certain fields like business, healthcare, or technology.
Build a Portfolio of Work: Showcase your skills and accomplishments through a strong portfolio. This could include projects you’ve worked on, case studies, articles, or designs. A compelling portfolio demonstrates your capabilities and can differentiate you from other candidates when negotiating higher compensation.
Network with Professionals: Attend industry events, join professional associations, and connect with peers and mentors in your field. Networking can lead to new job opportunities, referrals, and valuable insights into salary trends.
Negotiate a Higher AI Job Salary: Finally, if you’re offered an AI job, negotiate a higher salary. Research market rates and present your unique skills. Approach discussions confidently and professionally to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.

Bottom Line: The Future of AI Salaries is Bright
AI jobs can be highly lucrative, especially if you have the right skills, experience, and qualifications. Salaries for AI-related roles vary based on job title, location, industry, level of expertise, and labor market demand-supply dynamics—but in all cases, they’re some of the highest across the tech sector. Studies have also shown that workers with AI capabilities can earn substantially more than their counterparts. The increasing demand for AI expertise is driving the overall salary outlook upward, as organizations are willing to invest in top talent, which remains scarce.
To maximize earning potential in AI jobs, you focus on continuous learning, skill development, and staying abreast of industry trends. While many may be afraid that AI will take their jobs, the reality is that AI won’t replace your job—but someone who knows how to work effectively with AI will.

The DOL issued guidance for businesses that create or deploy AI in the workplace.
The White House issued a separate fact sheet concerning “critical steps to protect workers from risks of artificial intelligence.” 
Both documents are non-binding but indicate the federal government is taking an increased interest in AI in employment.





On May 16, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released a document entitled, “Department of Labor’s Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-being: Principles for Developers and Employers.” The document outlines several artificial intelligence principles (“AI Principles”) to provide employers and developers that create and deploy AI with guidance for designing and implementing these emerging technologies in ways that enhance job quality and protect workers’ rights. The DOL’s AI Principles emphasize ethical development; transparency and meaningful worker engagement in AI system design, use, governance, and oversight; protection of workers’ rights; and use of AI to enhance work. This document was issued in response to President Biden’s Executive Order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” (“AI Executive Order”), issued on October 30, 2023, which directed the DOL to develop best practices for employers, agencies, and federal contractors.
The document states that the DOL’s AI Principles apply during the entire lifecycle of AI, from development, testing and deployment of AI systems in the workplace, to oversight, use and auditing. The document further states that the AI Principles are applicable to all sectors and intended to be mutually reinforcing, though not all principles will apply to the same extent in every industry or workplace. Importantly, the DOL states that “[t]he Principles are not intended to be an exhaustive list but instead a guiding framework for businesses. AI developers and employers should review and customize the best practices based on their own context and with input from workers.” This statement underscores that the AI Principles are not prescriptive. The AI Principles include:

[North Star] Centering Worker Empowerment: The DOL’s document states that workers and their representatives, especially those from underserved communities, should be informed of and have genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use, and oversight of AI systems for use in the workplace. This principle reflects a strong emphasis on empowering workers and their representatives, which is aligned with President Biden’s historically pro-union position. Employers should follow related developments at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which may rely on this principle as the basis for issuing unfair labor practice complaints alleging violations of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).


Ethically Developing AI: The document emphasizes that AI systems should be designed, developed, and trained in a way that protects workers. This echoes guidance from the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which provides that automated systems should be developed in consultation from experts and include pre-deployment testing, identification of risks, mitigating efforts, and ongoing monitoring.


Establishing AI Governance and Human Oversight: The DOL’s AI Principles also stress that organizations should have clear governance systems, procedures, human oversight, and evaluation processes for AI systems for use in the workplace.


Ensuring Transparency in AI Use: Employers should be transparent with workers and job seekers about the AI systems that are being used in the workplace. This principle is similar to guidance in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights regarding notice, explanation and, insofar as possible, the grant of agency to those affected, regarding the collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of their data in automated systems. Technical guidance issued from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also contains a similar provision regarding notice of use and function of AI tools in employment decisions. The EEOC also recommends providing alternatives unless this would cause undue hardship.


Protecting Labor and Employment Rights: AI systems should not violate or undermine workers’ right to organize, health and safety rights, wage and hour rights, and anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation protections.


Using AI to Enable Workers: AI systems should assist, complement, and enable workers, and improve job quality.


Supporting Workers Impacted by AI: Employers should support or upskill workers during job transitions related to AI. The DOL provides no details on how employers can support workers displaced by AI. In fact, the AI Executive Order directed the DOL to issue a report on how the government can support workers displaced by AI by the end of April of 2024, but the DOL has not yet issued the report.


Ensuring Responsible Use of Worker Data: Workers’ data collected, used, or created by AI systems should be limited in scope and location, used only to support legitimate business aims, and protected and handled responsibly. This is similar to the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights guidance that people should, to the maximum extent possible, have agency regarding the collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of their data in automated systems.

The same day the DOL issued its AI Principles, the White House issued a fact sheet concerning “critical steps to protect workers from risks of artificial intelligence.”  In the fact sheet, the Biden administration outlined additional principles targeting the use of AI in the workplace, including not simply informing workers of the use of AI in the workplace, but also ensuring workers “have genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use, and oversight” of such AI. Additionally, the principles include informing applicants of AI systems used by employers in hiring, ensuring AI systems do “not violate or undermine workers’ right to organize” and seeing that AI systems “improve job quality” and “support or upskill workers.” The Biden administration directed that employees’ data “should be limited” and used only “to support legitimate business aims.” These principles, like the DOL’s AI Principles, do not specify what may run afoul of the documents.
AI Principle Key Takeaways 
First, the Biden administration and the DOL’s AI Principles make clear that the federal government is taking a comprehensive approach to AI in the workplace, from hiring through leaves and accommodation, day-to-day performance tools, wage and hour policies, and worker organization under the NLRA. While the DOL has no jurisdiction to enforce the NLRA, we anticipate this “whole of government” approach will bring additional scrutiny from other applicable agencies, such as the EEOC and NLRB. Indeed, the EEOC has already issued its technical assistance document on “assessing impact in software, algorithms, and artificial intelligence” for issues that could arise under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo has stated her concern that “employers could use these technologies to interfere with the exercise of Section 7 rights under the National Labor Relations Act by significantly impairing or negating employees’ ability to engage in protected activity.”
Second, the AI Principles from the DOL are merely one of the latest in a string of guidance, statements, and other resources issued by federal agencies targeting AI. The DOL’s AI Principles underscore that much of this guidance is descriptive to protect against some of the potential harmful risks of AI, but not federally mandated or binding. Indeed, the DOL emphasizes that its AI Principles are not “intended to be an exhaustive list but instead a guiding framework for businesses.”
Third, the AI Principles state that the DOL developed the document “with input from workers, unions, researchers, academics, employers, and developers, among others, and through public listening sessions,” without acknowledging any input from employers or developers regarding AI in the workplace related to the AI Executive Order.
Fourth, while the document is newly issued, many of the DOL’s AI Principles recycle key principles from earlier federal guidance documents and are in some cases considerably weaker. For example, when compared to the Blueprint for the AI Bill of Rights the White House issued in October of 2022, the document’s use of the word “should” reiterates that these best practices are not prescriptive.
Fifth, DOL’s AI Principles track recent federal legislative developments related to AI. Most notably, on May 15, 2024, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators released their legislative plan for AI called, “Driving U.S. Innovation in Artificial Intelligence.” The plan calls for annual spending of $32 billion by 2026 for research and development of AI, creation of a federal data privacy law, and efforts to prevent deepfakes in elections. However, the plan did not offer more specific information, instead calling for Congress and federal agencies to regulate AI because, Senator Chuck Schumer stated, “It’s very hard to do regulations because A.I. is changing too quickly.” And while the Senate’s legislative plan is based on a belief that AI changes too quickly and should be addressed by regulation, such regulation would involve a notice and comment period, delaying implementation of any substantive regulatory guidance. The European Union (EU), on the other hand, was able to enact its AI Act, which sets forth specific requirements for any U.S. companies using AI systems in the EU market, including prohibitions on risks the AI Act deems unacceptable, such as systems that manipulate an individual’s behavior, systems that infer characteristics, such as religious beliefs or sexual orientation, and systems that are used in the workplace for emotion recognition. Employers with operations in the EU should pay particular attention to the EU’s AI Act and consult with counsel if they are currently using AI systems.
Conclusion
Ultimately, the DOL’s AI Principles show how the Department is attempting to regulate AI without new legislation from Congress. More AI guidance is expected in the future. The press release accompanying the DOL’s AI Principles notes that DOL “will soon provide employers and developers with best practices to consider as they implement the AI principles.” Ultimately, the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape requires that employers and their counsel pay close attention to current and developing legal authority concerning AI.

<p>Building on President Joseph Biden&rsquo;s October 30, 2023 Executive Order 14110 (Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence), the guidelines acknowledge both the promises and risks of applying AI in hiring, show an intent to treat and investigate AI models in a similar manner to other selection procedures, and emphasize that the burden is on employers to maintain adequate records and answer questions involving AI models. </p>
<p>In a potential nudge to large-scale industries, such as defense and utilities, the OFCCP presents an example of using AI as an initial filter when filling positions that draw thousands of applicants. </p>
<p>The guidance recognizes AI&rsquo;s usefulness but also stresses the need for guardrails and proactive monitoring, noting that &ldquo;AI has the potential to embed bias and discrimination into a range of employment decision-making processes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The guidance is broken into two major sections: (1) &ldquo;Common Questions About the Use of AI and EEO&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;Promising Practices for the Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in the EEO Context.&rdquo; Together, these sections provide employers with a roadmap for compliance with the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of contractor obligations relating to affirmative action and the prevention of unlawful discrimination. The guidance also reinforces the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&rsquo;s existing position that equal employment opportunity obligations apply fully to any use of AI in employment decision-making. </p>
<p>Although the guidelines only apply to federal contractors, private employers should take note of the ways in which AI can implicate anti-discrimination law. </p>
<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
<p>The OFCCP provides insights on how the agency will treat AI models when evaluating federal contractor compliance, such as during audits. The OFCCP plans to treat AI models like other selection procedures, so federal contractors need to be able to articulate how their AI models operate and maintain records that substantiate these explanations. </p>
<p>Likewise, federal contractors also need to provide adequate justification for any adverse impacts on protected groups that result from the application of AI. Federal contractors cannot shield themselves from liability through the use of third-party tools or delegate these obligations to vendors. Consistent with the &ldquo;Promising Practices&rdquo; noted in the guidance, employers can design and proactively monitor their use of AI systems to comply with the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of their obligations. </p>
<p><strong>EEO Obligations Apply to Federal Contractors&rsquo; Use of AI in Employment Decisions</strong></p>
<p>The OFCCP states that federal contractors must comply with all equal employment opportunity (EEO) obligations in their use of AI systems for employment decisions.</p>
<p>The guidance takes an expansive view of AI, which it defines as a &ldquo;machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.&rdquo; Likewise, the OFCCP&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;employment decisions&rdquo; is broad and covers &ldquo;all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment&rdquo; including hiring or termination, pay or promotion decisions, workplace training programs, and workplace surveillance or management systems. </p>
<p>The guidance also states that federal contractors must</p>
<ul>
    <li>maintain records on AI models and ensure confidentiality consistent with OFCCP regulatory requirements; </li>
    <li>cooperate with the OFCCP by providing requested information on their AI systems; and</li>
    <li>make available reasonable accommodations for physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified applicants or employees with a disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the contractor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if a selection procedure that relies on AI has an adverse impact on members of any race, sex, or ethnic group, employers must validate the system consistent with nondiscrimination laws and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. This includes articulating the business needs for the AI model, analyzing job-relatedness, engaging in bias audits and independent assessments, and exploring less discriminatory, alternative selection procedures. </p>
<p><strong>Obligations and Liability Remain on the Employer</strong></p>
<p>The guidance also emphasizes that federal contractors cannot shield themselves from EEO obligations and potential liability with the use of third-party products. Even where an employer obtains an AI system from a third-party vendor, the employer remains responsible for meeting its nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations under the laws enforced by the OFCCP. These laws do not impose separate obligations on vendors so federal contractors cannot escape liability by deferring to a third party. </p>
<p>Relatedly, federal contractor employers should ensure that any third-party AI models they use are transparent, substantiated with adequate documentation, and subject to regular independent bias audits. </p>
<p><strong>Federal Contractors Should Proactively Mitigate Risks Associated with the Use of AI</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the OFCCP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Promising Practices&rdquo; for the use of AI provides a framework for federal contractors to consider when designing or utilizing an AI system in making employment decisions. The Promising Practices address four core areas: (1) notice to applicants; (2) using an AI system; (3) obtaining a vendor-created AI system; and (4) ensuring adequate accessibility and disability inclusion. </p>
<p>Before adopting an AI system, federal contractors should provide advance notice to applicants or employees that it intends to use AI, provide information on how employees or applicants can request an accommodation, explain what data will be captured and whether it can be reviewed/corrected, and safeguard the privacy of jobseekers and employees. </p>
<p>Once the AI model goes live, the employer should engage with applicants/employees, follow standard processes for accommodation requests, routinely monitor any adverse impacts, verify that documentation is easily accessible, and ensure that there is sufficient human oversight from trained individuals and broader oversight from governance structures. </p>
<p>The guidance also provides additional recommendations when contracting with a third-party vendor for an AI system. Employers should ensure that vendor contracts include specific provisions on maintaining easily accessible records and strong data privacy guardrails consistent with OFCCP regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Federal contractors should also confirm that, beyond making accommodations available, the AI system is accessible and incorporates inclusive design elements. Employers should perform ongoing testing and monitoring of the accessibility for the system. </p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Federal contractor employers now have a roadmap for OFCCP compliance in the AI space. While other developments may provide additional details for this roadmap, at a minimum, federal contractor employers should understand that equal employment opportunity obligations apply fully to any use of AI in employment decision-making. Private employers should also take note of the ways in which AI can implicate anti-discrimination law.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The US Department of Labor&rsquo;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) recently issued guidance for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by federal contractors in employment decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAN FRANCISCO—Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero today launched a new judicial branch task force to evaluate generative artificial intelligence (AI) for its potential benefits to courts and court users while mitigating risks to safeguard the public.
“Generative AI brings great promise, but our guiding principle should be safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process,” said Chief Justice Guerrero. “That means it will be essential for the branch to assess what protections are necessary as we begin to use this technology.”
Members of the task force will include Administrative Presiding Justice Brad Hill (chair), Justice Carin Fujisaki, Judge Kyle Brodie, Administrative Presiding Justice Mary Greenwood, Judge Arturo Castro, and council members David Yamasaki and Gretchen Nelson.
Earlier this year, Chief Justice Guerrero asked Justice Greenwood and Judge Castro to help identify the foundational questions the California court system must consider regarding the appropriate uses of AI.
In response to their report and recommendations presented today, Chief Justice Guerrero announced the following next steps for the judicial branch:
Create an AI task force to oversee the consideration and development of branch actions that address generative AI, such as rules of court, technology policies, educational programs, and legislative proposals
	 
Work with Supreme Court ethics committees to develop guidance on how judicial officers should navigate ethical issues associated with generative AI
	 
Provide education for judicial officers, court professionals, and council staff that focuses on the uses, benefits, and risks of generative AI 
AI Issues to Be Considered
During their presentation to the council, Justice Greenwood and Judge Castro recommended the judicial branch should use generative AI, but with limitations and safeguards, as avoiding this easily accessible technology may deprive the branch of significant benefits. They identified some potential uses of AI, which include improving court administration and management, and enhancing research and analysis. 
“Generative AI could also increase access to justice for the public,” said Judge Castro. “I think about the potential for AI to help walk self-represented litigants through the process, forms, and procedures they will encounter at the courthouse.”
In addition to the potential benefits of AI, the presenters emphasized the need for litigants to interact with the court and its judicial officers to feel that they’ve been heard. “It’s important to note that generative AI is only a tool,” said Justice Greenwood. “It’s not an end, and it’s not a substitute for judicial decision making and due process.” Watch(link is external)
Other Items on the Council Meeting Agenda:
Presiding Remotely in Civil Cases: The council approved a new rule of court(link is external) on when a judicial officer may preside remotely over a civil proceeding from a location other than a courtroom. With approval from the presiding judge, the rule allows for presiding remotely in limited circumstances when doing so is in the interest of justice, such as when safety is an issue, no courtrooms are available, or to prevent a significant delay that would substantially prejudice the litigants.

Changes to CARE Act Rules and Forms: The council approved revisions to rules of court and forms(link is external) related to the sealing of records, communications between the CARE Act court and the juvenile court, notification of respondent’s attorney in certain parallel or related legal proceedings, and limits on authorized communication.
Report on Pretrial Programs: The council received a report on court programs and practices(link is external) that promote the safe, efficient, fair, and timely pretrial release of individuals booked into jail. Data collected from the pretrial program showed pretrial release rates increased for both felonies and misdemeanors while rearrest/rebooking rates decreased.
Increasing Numbers of Court Interpreters: The council approved a proposal on how to allocate money(link is external) provided in the 2023-24 state budget for a five-year pilot program to increase the number of court interpreter employees. Funding will go toward reimbursing potential interpreters for costs associated with their training, coursework, and examination fees.
Trial Court Financial Policies and Procedures Manual: The council approved updates to the Trial Court Financial Policies and Procedures Manual(link is external), which provides a system of fundamental internal controls that helps trial courts monitor their use of public funds, provide consistent and comparable financial statements, and demonstrate accountability. Watch(link is external)
Appointment to Board of State and Community Corrections: The council approved the reappointment of Judge Janet Gaard (ret.)(link is external) to the Board of State and Community Corrections, an independent statutory agency that provides leadership to the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems and expertise on public safety realignment issues.
The complete meeting agenda and council reports are posted to the California Courts Meeting Information Center(link is external)--an archived webcast of today’s meeting will be posted to the center as soon as it is available.

ranks first in adoption of Generative AI technology across Asia Pacific: Deloitte survey May. 17, 2024 at 6:47 amPress ReleaseIndia ranks first in adoption of Generative AI technology across Asia Pacific: Deloitte surveyCXOtoday News Desk2 months agoDeloitte released the India findings of its Asia Pacific report Generative AI in Asia Pacific: Young employees lead as employers play catch-up today, highlighting India’s exceptional response to Generative AI (GenAI), with 93 percent of students and 83 percent of employees actively engaging with the technology. Surveying 11,900 individuals in Asia Pacific, the report positions India as a frontrunner among 13 countries for GenAI use and adoption. Emphasizing the need for employers and policymakers to adapt to this rapidly evolving technology.According to the survey, the robust adoption of GenAI has been driven by tech-savvy, young employees, known as “Generation AI,” who are driving GenAI adoption, presenting new challenges and opportunities for employers as they adapt to these changes. Per the report, “Generation AI” is leading the way in saving work hours, creating new skill development opportunities, creating more sustainable workloads and increasing productivity.The dynamic business impact of GenAI adoption, coupled with a projected 182 percent increase in daily usage over the next five years, reflects a dynamic trajectory towards deeper integration. Such optimism is echoed in the belief of 75 percent of Indians regarding GenAI’s potential to elevate Asia Pacific’s role in the global economy, with 83 percent expressing confidence in its ability to enhance social outcomes.Key findings from the reportGeneration AI leads the way: Students and employees lead the GenAI revolution across Asia Pacific, but only 50 percent believe their managers know they are using it.Significant impact: GenAI could significantly affect 17 percent of working hours across Asia Pacific, amounting to almost 1.1 billion work hours annually.Traditional technology hierarchy: This may be disrupted with the rapid adoption of GenAI in developing countries at 30 percent, which is higher compared with developed economies across Asia Pacific.Talent benefits: GenAI users across Asia Pacific save ~6.3 hours per week, with Indian users saving 7.85 hours per week, enabling employees to acquire new skills.Saves time: GenAI can support more sustainable workloads and productivity, with 41 percent of time savers believing this has improved their work-life balance.Managing risks: Three-quarters of businesses are falling behind on GenAI adoption, according to their own employees.Commenting on the report, Chris Lewin, Deloitte Asia Pacific’s AI & Data Capability Leader, said, “One of the most exciting aspects of working with GenAI is that across the globe, it is happening to everything, everywhere, all at once. What we have experienced in the last 12 months is that the challenges faced by our clients in Indonesia or India are almost immediately relevant to teams in Italy and Ireland. One key lesson is that the rapid adoption of AI will not directly eliminate jobs, but the impact will be felt by businesses that fail to adapt. Their employees, and in particular, talent new to the workforce, will be drawn to rival businesses offering AI applications that can redraw the future of modern work.”Anjani Kumar, Partner, Consulting, Deloitte India, added, “GenAI has revolutionised the approach and future of work. Unlocking newer possibilities can help us do things faster, better and in a more creative way leading to more meaningful experiences for talent. To fully use this transformative technology, it is crucial to address implementation challenges and deepen our understanding of its capabilities. Despite its clear benefits, obstacles such as implementation complexities, risk aversion and knowledge gaps impede widespread adoption.” “Leaders should use these technologies not only for efficiency gains but also to fundamentally reshape business models and processes. Overcoming implementation hurdles requires proactive engagement and a comprehensive understanding of AI’s capabilities among stakeholders” he added.GenAI holds enormous potential to reshape our work and innovation landscape. With its promise of improved efficiency, enhanced quality and amplified creativity, businesses and universities stand to unlock unprecedented growth opportunities. Notably, 86 percent of Indian users report faster task completion, 85 percent note improved output quality and 83 percent emphasize enhanced ideation capabilities. A big bang, short fuse scenarioTo further unpack GenAI’s impact on the Asia Pacific region, Deloitte Access Economics mapped 18 industries in terms of the extent of GenAI’s impact—the “bang”—and how soon those industries will be affected—the length of the “fuse.” It is estimated that USD5 trillion of economic activity within industries will face a big bang, short fuse scenario.Finance, ICT and media, professional services and education are the four industries affected, which account for an average of one-fifth of the economies of each market in Asia Pacific. This share is expected to increase as some markets shift towards service industries such as professional services, finance and ICT that face higher impact. These industries are also where over 40 percent of students who are using GenAI to start their careers, further accelerating the pace of transformation. Three key actions for businesses to adopt The rise of GenAI means that business leaders and employees need to think strategically and act proactively to respond to the rapidly changing environment. Based on the analysis of the report’s findings, businesses should take the following high-impact actions:Develop and implement a GenAI strategy that brings your employees on the journey.Empower employees to own their AI journey.Develop data infrastructure iteratively as needed to embrace GenAI.

						Navigating a New Era: Department of Labor’s Guidance on AI Compliance with FLSA and FMLA

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in personnel management has ushered in a new era of efficiency and productivity, but it also raises important questions about compliance with labor laws. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) recently issued guidance regarding the employment law impact of certain AI features used in performance management, wages and hours, timekeeping, leave management, and other human resources technology systems.
While acknowledging that “AI and other automated systems can provide ways to streamline tasks for employers, improve workplace efficiency and safety, and enhance workforce accountability,” the DOL cautioned that, “without responsible human oversight, the use of such technologies may pose potential compliance challenges with respect to federal labor standards.” The new guidance specifically addresses compliance with leave management under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and minimum wage and overtime compliance under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
As a refresher, the FLSA governs fair labor practices such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and recordkeeping. The FMLA guarantees eligible employees unpaid leave for specified family and medical reasons. These laws were crafted long before the advent of AI, presenting challenges in their application to modern workplaces infused with automation and machine learning.
New AI technology leverages employee monitoring, measuring and analyzing metrics of worker productivity or activity in real time, such as computer keystrokes, mouse clicks, website browsing, web camera monitoring, and other data to determine whether and when an employee is active or idle. Employers can use these tools to more accurately determine hours worked and thus increase efficiency in payroll management. While these are helpful tools, employer reliance on such technology without regular, consistent human oversight may create FLSA compliance challenges when employees are actually performing “work” (as defined by the FLSA), but the AI system docks pay because it perceives that an employee is not working. 
Addressing this concern, the DOL noted “an AI program that incorrectly categorizes time as noncompensable work hours based on its analysis of worker activity, productivity, or performance could result in a failure to pay wages for all hours worked.” Employee start times, end times, break times, and waiting time are particular risk areas if timekeeping errors occur.  As we have previously advised, employers utilizing these tools should therefore conduct regular audits and provide for active human monitoring to ensure accuracy in timekeeping. Similarly, employers using AI for payroll management purposes should develop clear and consistent policy guidance, including avenues of recourse for employees who believe they may be underpaid.
Developing a policy with reporting and appeal mechanisms — and clearly communicating these procedures to employees — is crucially important to ensuring fairness and accuracy in employee compensation. In all cases, employers must exercise diligence to ensure that AI-driven recordkeeping complies with FLSA requirements to prevent disputes and potentially costly liability over unpaid wages or overtime.
For purposes of FMLA compliance, the DOL cautions that AI presents unique challenges regarding leave eligibility and accommodation, emphasizing that AI systems must appropriately handle requests for FMLA leave, accommodate eligible employees, and avoid discriminatory practices. For example, an AI system that manages FMLA leave certification which requires employees to disclose excess medical or other personal information could violate the FMLA or the Americans with Disabilities Act’s (ADA) limitations on requesting certain information. Further, an AI system’s failure to consider extenuating circumstances in determining whether employees have complied with their obligations for FMLA certification (or the interactive process for ADA accommodations) could violate either the FMLA, the ADA, or both, implicating an interference or discrimination claim.
Thus, as with wage and hour management, employers should establish clear communication channels for employees to seek FMLA-related information or ADA accommodations as well as reporting/appeal procedures to ensure that AI systems do not hinder access to essential benefits. The DOL’s guidance underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptation. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too must compliance strategies. Employers should prioritize regular audits and assessments of AI systems to identify and address any potential compliance gaps or biases. Furthermore, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity within the organization is crucial for ensuring equitable outcomes in AI-driven decision-making. As we venture further into the age of AI, the commitment to upholding the principles of fairness, equality, and equity remains paramount.

Some 52% of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks. — AFP Relaxnews





The coming years may hold many challenges as artificial intelligence is deployed in the workplace. While some workers see this technology as a tremendous opportunity to boost productivity, others have more mixed feelings. They fear that these new tools could be detrimental to their careers. Such are the findings of the latest edition of the “Work Trend Index” report from Microsoft and LinkedIn. Over 30,000 workers in 31 countries were polled for this major annual survey. It turns out that 52% of them are reluctant to let their colleagues know that they are using artificial intelligence tools to carry out complex professional tasks. The reason? They're afraid that it will harm their career development. Indeed, 53% of those surveyed fear that their superiors might be tempted to replace them with AI if they learned that they were using software incorporating this technology to carry out important tasks. Whether it's a real or an imagined fear, no one really knows. Experts and economists can't agree on the number or type of jobs potentially threatened by the arrival of AI. American investment bank Goldman Sachs has estimated that 300 million full-time jobs in Europe and the USA could be threatened by the technology. But it's difficult to predict with any certainty the impact that generative artificial intelligence systems will have on the world of work in the next few years.


 In any case, the employees surveyed by Microsoft and LinkedIn are convinced of the need to master artificial intelligence tools in order to shine professionally. Three quarters believe that AI skills will help them stand out on the job market, while 69% are convinced that these skills will help them get promoted faster. Eight in ten respondents believe they will be able to broaden their professional horizons thanks to this technology. Indeed, employers are looking to surround themselves with people who are able to work effectively with generative AI tools. Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed for the ""Work Trend Index"" report say they would not hire a worker without AI skills. Seventy-one percent even said they'd rather recruit a junior with strong AI skills than a more experienced candidate who doesn't know how to handle ChatGPT, for example. Many professionals have understood this and now clearly state on their LinkedIn profile that they have mastered popular AI tools, in the hope that this will attract the attention of recruiters. In this context, workers seem to have no choice but to jump on the AI bandwagon. Those who refuse to do so risk being overtaken, not by the technology itself, but rather by those who know how to use it. – AFP Relaxnews

Q&A with chief technologist
NEW YORK (AP) – Knowledge advantage can save lives, win wars and avert disaster. At the Central Intelligence Agency, basic artificial intelligence – machine learning and algorithms – has long served that mission. Now, generative AI is joining the effort.
CIA Director William Burns says AI tech will augment humans, not replace them. The agency’s first chief technology officer, Nand Mulchandani, is marshalling the tools. There’s considerable urgency: Adversaries are already spreading AI-generated deepfakes aimed at undermining US interests.
A former Silicon Valley CEO who helmed successful startups, Mulchandani was named to the job in 2022 after a stint at the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre.
Among agency projects: A ChatGPT-like generative AI application that draws on open-source data (meaning unclassified, public or commercially available). Thousands of analysts across the 18-agency US intelligence community use it. Other CIA projects that use large-language models are, unsurprisingly, secret.
This Associated Press interview with Mulchandani has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: You recently said generative AI should be treated like a “crazy, drunk friend.” Can you elaborate?
A: When these generative AI systems “hallucinate,” they can sometimes behave like your drunk friend at a bar who can say something that pushes you outside your normal conceptual boundary and sparks out-of-the box thinking. Remember that these AI-based systems are probabilistic in nature, so they are not precise (They are prone to fabrication). So for creative tasks like art, poetry, and painting these systems are excellent. But I wouldn’t yet use these systems for doing precise math or designing an airplane or skyscraper – in those activities “close enough” doesn’t work. They can also be biased and narrowly focused, which I call the “rabbit hole” problem.
Q: The only current use of a large-language model at enterprise scale I’m aware of at CIA is the open-source AI, called Osiris, that it created for the entire intelligence community. Is that correct?
A: That’s the only one we have disclosed publicly. It’s been an absolute home run for us. We should broaden the discussion beyond just LLMs though — as an example, we process huge amounts of foreign language content in multiple media types including video, and use other AI algorithms and tools to process that.
Q: The Special Competitive Studies Project, a high-powered advisory group focused on AI in national security, is out with a report saying US intelligence services must rapidly integrate generative AI — given its disruptive potential. It sets a two-year timeline for getting beyond experimentation and limited pilot projects and “deploying Gen AI tools at scale.” Do you agree?
A: CIA is all in 100 per cent on utilising these technologies and scaling them. We are taking this as seriously as we’re taking probably any technology issue. We think we’ve beaten the initial timeline by a big margin, as we’re already using Gen AI tools in production. The deeper answer is that we’re on the early side of a huge number of additional changes, and a large part of the work is to integrate the technology more widely into our applications and systems. These are early days.
Q: Can you name your large-language model partners?
A: I’m not sure naming the vendors is interesting right now. There is an explosion of LLMs available on the market now. As a smart customer, we are not tying our boat to a specific set of LLMs or a specific set of vendors. We are evaluating and using practically all the high-runner LLMs out there, both commercial-grade and open source. We are not viewing the LLM market as a singular one where a single lab is better than the others. As you’re noting in the market, models are leapfrogging one another with each new release.
Q: What are the most important use cases at CIA for large-language models?
A: Primary is summarisation. It’s impossible for an open-source analyst at CIA to digest the firehouse of media and other information we collect every day. So this has been a game-changer for insights into sentiment and global trends. Analysts then dig into specifics. They must be able — with full certainty — to annotate and explain data they cite and how they reach conclusions. Our tradecraft has not changed. The additional pieces give analysts much broader perspective – both the classified and open-source pieces we gather.
Q: What are the biggest challenges of adapting generative AI at the agency?
A: There isn’t a lot of cultural resistance internally. Our employees deal with AI on a daily basis competitively. Obviously, the whole world is on fire with these new technologies and the amazing productivity gains. The trick is grappling with constraints we have on information compartmentalisation and how systems are built. In many cases, the separation of data is not for security but legal reasons. How do we efficiently connect systems to get the benefits of AI while keeping all that intact? Some really interesting technologies are emerging to help us think this through – and combine data in ways that maintain encryption and privacy controls.
Q: Generative AI is currently about as sophisticated as an elementary school student. Intelligence work, by contrast, is for grown-ups. It’s all about trying to pierce an adversary’s deception. How does Gen AI fit into that work?
A: First, let’s emphasise that the human analyst has primacy. We have the world’s leading experts in their domains. And in many cases of incoming information, a huge amount of human judgment is involved to weigh its importance and significance – including of the individuals who may be providing it. We don’t have machines replicate any of that. And we’re not looking for computers to do the jobs of domain experts.
What we are looking at is the co-pilot model. We think Gen AI can have a huge impact in brainstorming, coming up with new ideas. And in boosting productivity – and insight. We have to be very deterministic about how we do it because, wielded properly, these algorithms are a force for good. But wielded incorrectly, they can really hurt you. – FRANK BAJAK

AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm also uses the technology to crack down on fake reviews. A simple guide to help you understand AIBill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decadesWhat are AI programs like ChatGPT and Midjourney?ChatGPT and Midjourney are examples of what is called ""generative"" AI. These programs learn from vast quantities of data, such as online text and images, to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. So-called chatbots - like ChatGPT - can have text conversations.Other AI programs like Midjourney can create images from simple text instructions.Generative AI can also make videos and even produce music in the style of famous musicians.But these programs sometimes generate inaccurate answers and images, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.Many artists, writers and performers have warned that such AIs allow others to exploit and imitate their work without payment.The most recent people to add their names to these calls include Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj, who are among 200 artists calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.'Most of our friends use AI in schoolwork' Can you pass your degree using ChatGPT?Why do critics fear AI could be dangerous?Many experts are surprised by how quickly AI has developed, and fear its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted.In 2023, the UK government published a report which said AI might soon assist hackers to launch cyberattacks or help terrorists plan chemical attacks.Some experts even worry that in the future, super-intelligent AIs could make humans extinct. In May, the US-based Center for AI Safety's warning about this threat was backed by dozens of leading tech specialists.Similar fears are shared by two of the three scientists known as the godfathers of AI for their pioneering research, Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio.But the other - Yann LeCun - dismissed the idea that a super-smart AI might take over the world as ""preposterously ridiculous"".Getty ImagesUS comedian Sarah Silverman is unhappy about her writing allegedly being used to train AIsThe EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager previously told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern than futuristic fears about an AI takeover.In particular, she worries about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications.In March, a black Uber Eats driver received a payout after ""racially discriminatory"" facial-recognition checks prevented him using the app, and ultimately removed his account.Others have criticised AI's environmental impact.Powerful AI systems use a lot of electricity: by 2027, one researcher suggests that collectively, they could consume each year as much as a small country like the Netherlands.What rules are in place to govern AI? The US and UK have signed a landmark deal to work together on testing the safety of such advanced forms of AI - the first bilateral deal of its kind.US President Joe Biden has also announced measures to deal with a range of problems that AI might cause.The UK government previously ruled out setting up a dedicated AI watchdog.But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants the UK to be a leader in AI safety, and the country hosted the first global summit on AI safety in 2023. Twenty eight nations at the summit - including the UK, US, the European Union and China - signed a statement about the future of AI.This acknowledges the risks that advanced AIs could be misused - for example to spread misinformation - but says they can also be a force for good. The signatories resolved to work together to ensure AI is trustworthy and safe.Can Sunak’s big summit save us from AI nightmare? Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might thinkIn the EU, the Artificial Intelligence Act, when it becomes law, will impose strict controls on high risk systems.Which jobs are at risk because of AI?A report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe.It concluded many administrative, legal, architecture, and management roles could be affected.But it also said AI could boost the global economy by 7%.And the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) estimates that up to eight million workers in the UK could be at risk of losing their jobs as the tech develops. But the tech has also been used to support workers, such as byhelping doctors spot breast cancers, and developing new antibiotics.

Less than half of journalists say they are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard) in their work, according to a new global survey.
Some 53% of 3,016 journalists in 19 markets surveyed for Cision’s annual State of the Media report said they are not using generative AI “at all”.
Just 5% are using these tools “often”. Some 12% are using them a “moderate amount” while 28% are using them “a little”. 
 
Many publishers have taken a cautious approach to the use of generative AI for published content, advising their journalists not to do so until full guidance has been created.

Among those journalists who have used generative AI tools in their work, 23% said it was to research certain topics, 19% said it had helped create outlines or early drafts of content, and 13% said it was to brainstorm new story ideas.

Mather Economics and InsurAds combine to help publishers boost revenue



 Press Gazette 



Last year's report did not include comparable questions as that survey was carried out just two months after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. However, the 2023 report did feature some early concerns about AI, with one respondent saying journalists who hide from innovations like ChatGPT ""are at a disadvantage"" and another stressing the importance of being ""aware of the opportunities and pitfalls of AI"".

This year, journalists ranked the emergence of artificial intelligence as their sixth biggest challenge for the journalism industry over the past year. Just over a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said it was among their three biggest concerns for the industry.
What journalists say are the biggest challenges facing the industry
""Maintaining credibility as a trusted news source and combating accusations of 'fake news'"" remained the top-ranked challenge for the industry, with 42% of respondents choosing it as one of their three biggest issues.
It was seen as a bigger issue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) on 44% versus 41% in North America and 35% in the Asia-Pacific (APAC).
Last year, when respondents were asked to select just one biggest challenge for journalism, it was top on 27%.
In second place this year was the challenge of ""adapting to changing audience behaviours around media consumption"", narrowly behind on 41%.
In third place was a ""lack of staffing and resources"" on 36%. This was in joint second place in 2023 with 20% of respondents choosing it as their biggest challenge of the year, the same proportion as ""declining advertising and circulation revenues"".
Job cuts were a bigger concern in North America (41%) and EMEA (37%) than APAC (22%). 
In 2023 Press Gazette estimates there were more than 8,000 journalism job cuts in the UK and North America with at least a further 1,700 in 2024 so far.
In comparison the challenge of ""competing with social media influencers and digital content creators for audience attention was a much bigger concern in APAC (39%) than EMEA (27%) or North America (24%). APAC countries also struggled the most with ""verifying information and finding credible sources"", with 31% agreeing that was a concern versus 22% in EMEA and 15% in North America.

Meanwhile ""media downsizing and reduced resources"" was ranked as the biggest personal challenge for journalists in the past year with 60% citing it as one of their top three.
""Keeping up"" amid downsizing and reduced resources was similarly top last year, with 38% citing it as their single biggest challenge.
In second and third place this year were ""balancing reporting on important topics against pressure to drive business"" (42%) and ""having to compete with misinformation online"" (33%). 

Just over a fifth (22%) of journalists surveyed for the report identified as freelance or independent. They were less concerned with challenges facing journalism from a lack of staffing and resources (22% ranking it in their top three concerns for the industry versus 42% of staff journalists) but were more worried about the emergence of AI (34% versus 23% of staffers).
Which social media platforms will get more attention this year?
Over the next year, Instagram is the social media platform most targeted for growth by media outlets, according to the survey respondents.
Some 44% of the journalists who took part in the survey said their brand/media outlet planned to get more active on Instagram.
It was followed by Linkedin (39%) and Facebook (34%) - even though referral traffic to major news sites from Facebook has fallen by 50% over the past year.
Tiktok, where many publishers have seen rapid growth while seeking younger audiences despite a relatively late arrival to the platform, remains behind X (formerly Twitter) as a priority for activity over the year ahead (21% versus 24% respectively). This is despite speculation last year that a new platform like Meta's Threads or Bluesky could take its place after Elon Musk's takeover. Threads was seen as an area of growth for 10% of the journalists surveyed.
Chinese-founded Tiktok was slightly more prominent in the survey in North America (24% versus 18% in EMEA and 20% in APAC) despite the possibility it will be banned in the US within a year. But it was still behind X everywhere except APAC (27% for North America, 24% for EMEA and 17% in Asia-Pacific).
Meanwhile Whatsapp, which has seen major UK publisher Reach win multiple innovation awards for its use of the recently-launched Channels and Communities functions, was only seen as a growth area by 11%. It is much bigger in EMEA, where 18% expect increased use over the next year, versus just 4% in North America and 6% in APAC.

Lacking AI skills on your resume can lead to lower salaries and fewer job opportunities in the coming years. The good news? It's still possible to future-proof your career by developing in-demand AI skills.The fear of robots replacing humans is nothing new. Since the arrival of ChatGPT in late 2022, the conversation surrounding generative AI's impact on the workforce has taken on a new urgency and a compelling reason drives this trend.The World Economic Forum's 2023 Future of Jobs Report predicts that over 75 percent of companies plan to adopt AI and other technologies within the next five years, potentially transforming how we work.This shift will likely require a new skill set, with research from Inteliligent.com suggesting that 49 percent of business leaders believe expertise in tools like ChatGPT will become increasingly important.Further solidifying this trend, a separate study by Pluralsight found that 87 percent of organisations plan to increase AI spending next year, highlighting the urgency for skilled personnel. However, more than simply investing in AI is required.The study revealed that 95 percent of executives believe AI initiatives will only succeed with staff who can effectively utilise these tools. This concern is further amplified by Gallagher's State of the Sector report, where 71 percent of HR and Communication leaders admitted their organisations need guidance on when, where, or how to use this transformative technology.Why AI Expertise is the New Must-Have SkillAs AI adoption increases, those who don't upskill may face challenges. However, the good news is that AI isn't here to replace us but rather to augment our capabilities.Pluralsight's report also identified that 25 percent of organisations must catch up on AI deployment due to a talent gap. They need a more skilled workforce to utilise this technology effectively and are content with their current tools.

This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.
Internal Testing and Development
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Giannandrea established a team that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.
For the last several months, Apple has been testing an ""Apple GPT"" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an ""Ajax"" framework for large language models.
Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.
Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are more powerful than Ajax. Apple reportedly does not have a ""clear strategy"" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with Siri enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.
Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars a day on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend more than $4 billion on AI servers in 2024.
""Ask"" for AppleCare Support Advisors
Apple is testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool with its AppleCare support employees. Called ""Ask,"" the tool is designed to generate responses to technical questions and provide information from Apple's internal knowledge base to speed up support replies.
The feature is in beta right now. Advisors can rate a provided question as helpful or unhelpful, and can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple says the Ask tool is useful for solving complex issues, and because it is pulling from Apple's internal knowledge base, Apple has told advisors that the information is factual, traceable, and useful.
AI for Siri
Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its ‌Siri‌ voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 held an AI summit and briefed employees on its large language model work.
Because of the way ‌Siri‌ is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former ‌Siri‌ engineer John Burkey told The New York Times that ‌Siri‌'s ""cumbersome design"" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the ‌Siri‌ database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.
There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to ‌Siri‌. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused ‌Siri‌ to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.
The Information suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let ‌Siri‌ automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.
According to Bloomberg, Apple is aiming for a smarter version of Siri that's deeply integrated with AI. Apple is planning to update the way that ‌Siri‌ interacts with the Messages app, allowing users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. 
Rumors suggest that Siri will have better natural conversation capabilities and improved user personalization. The new functionality will be available across device, so ‌Siri‌ may retain conversation information from one device to another.
AI for Apps
Apple is rumored to be planning to add AI to as many Apple apps as possible. In Apple Music, for example, Apple could use AI to create auto-generated playlists, while in Xcode, AI support could help developers write and troubleshoot code. 
In Pages and Keynote, AI could be used for writing and creating slide decks, while Apple's internal customer support apps could be updated with generative AI to assist with ‌AppleCare‌. 
Apple's full generative AI vision will take time to fully scale, so the complete suite of AI features that Apple has planned might not arrive until 2025.
On-Device AI
The first AI features coming to the iPhone with iOS 18 will run entirely on-device using the ‌iPhone‌'s hardware rather than relying on a cloud server. Apple may add new capabilities in the future through a potential partnership, but on-device AI will be the focus to begin with.
News and Publisher Deals
Apple wants to partner with major publishers to get permission to use their content for AI training purposes.
So far, Apple has approached Condé Nast, NBC News, and IAC about possible AI deals. Condé Nast publications include Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, Ars Technica, Glamour, The New Yorker, GQ, and more, while IAC owns publications like People, The Spruce, Serious Eats, Martha Stewart Living, Real Simple, Entertainment Weekly, and Better Homes & Gardens.
Proposed deals have been worth at least $50 million, and would allow Apple to license archives of news articles. Publishers are said to be ""lukewarm"" on Apple's offer because Apple has been vague about how generative AI will be applied to news and because Apple has been asking for terms that are ""too expansive.""
Third-Party AI Bans at Apple
Apple employees have been banned from using ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other artificial intelligence tools. Apple is concerned that AI tools could leak confidential company data.
The U.S. government, healthcare institutions, and banks have also prevented employees from using ChatGPT because of similar fears. Tech companies like Verizon, Google, Samsung, and others have banned generative AI tools too.
Possible Partnerships
Apple is in discussions with Google about integrating the Gemini AI engine into the ‌iPhone‌ in ‌iOS 18‌. Apple wants to license Google's large-language models, but terms and branding have not yet been decided on. 
Apple is developing new AI features that will run on device, but it wants a partner with large-scale hardware infrastructure to power cloud-based generative AI features like creating images and writing essays based on a prompt. Apple does not plan to develop its own ChatGPT-style chatbot at this time.
In addition to Google, Apple is also holding discussions with OpenAI. The two companies are talking about how Apple could use OpenAI technology to power features in ‌iOS 18‌, and Apple is said to be finalizing a deal to include OpenAI's ChatGPT features in ‌iOS 18‌. In China, Apple may be considering a deal with Baidu.
Apple is pursuing a deal with Photobucket to use the more than 13 billion images and videos from the Photobucket library to train AI models. Apple has already licensed millions of images from Shutterstock. 
AI Competition
Almost every major tech company has some kind of AI product in the works. In addition to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all adopted generative AI for various purposes.

Google - Google has developed Bard, a chat-based AI tool. Google has also integrated generative AI into its search products and apps, plus Bard can integrate with Google Flights, Maps, Drive, and more.
Microsoft - Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI for a version of ChatGPT that is integrated with its Bing search engine, plus Microsoft has the Copilot AI app.
Amazon - Amazon is working to enhance its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI.
Meta - Meta is incorporating generative AI into several of its apps. WhatsApp and Messenger, for example, can use generative AI to make custom stickers, while there's a Meta AI beta available for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.

Apple's Current Use of AI and Machine Learning
Apple is already using artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long list of functions in its products. AI is used for almost everything, with a small sampling below.

Photos - Apple uses machine learning to enhance photos that are taken with the ‌iPhone‌'s camera. This includes everything from Deep Fusion for cutting down on noise in images to the new iPhone 15 Portrait Mode tools that let you enable portrait images after a photo has been taken.
Spotlight Search - Spotlight search and search throughout the iOS operating system is powered by AI.
Visual Lookup - The feature that lets the ‌iPhone‌ detect the content in photos is a machine learning feature.
Crash Detection and Fall Detection - Fall Detection and Crash Detection both use machine learning to determine whether someone has been in a crash or had a fall based on the information collected by the various sensors in Apple devices.
ECG - The ECG feature on the Apple Watch looks at heart rhythm data to determine whether someone is likely to be experiencing atrial fibrillation.
Autocorrect - Apple's autocorrect system and word suggestion options are powered by machine learning.
Siri Suggestions - When your ‌iPhone‌ suggests something, such as sending someone a birthday message or adding an event in your Mail app to the Calendar, it's using machine learning algorithms.

Apple's devices have dedicated Neural Engines inside specifically for powering machine learning capabilities.
Tim Cook on AI
Back in May 2023, Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ said that the potential of artificial intelligence is ""very interesting,"" but he said there are a ""number of issues that need to be sorted"" with the technology. He explained that it is ""very important to be deliberate and thoughtful"" when deciding how and when AI should be used.
Cook has also said that AI and machine learning are ""core fundamental technologies integral to virtually every product"" that Apple has created, and that AI work is ""absolutely critical"" to the company. Cook has confirmed that Apple has been experimenting with generative AI ""for years.""
Potential Launch Date - iOS 18
Apple is widely rumored to be planning to add AI features to ‌iOS 18‌, and the update is said to be the biggest update to the iOS operating system in years. Apple hinted at AI features coming to ‌iOS 18‌ with its WWDC announcement. Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak said WWDC will be ""Absolutely Incredible,"" with the words capitalized in a play on AI.
For more on everything that we expect to see in ‌iOS 18‌, including more on the AI features coming, we have a dedicated iOS 18 roundup.

Why It Matters		



Leaders should look beyond productivity gains when evaluating where to deploy generative artificial intelligence, according to Microsoft chief scientist Jaime Teevan.

As the chief scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft, Jaime Teevan is responsible for integrating artificial intelligence into Microsoft products. She was still skeptical about the powers of generative AI when she met with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman about a year and a half ago to discuss GPT-4, the large language model that fuels ChatGPT.

Teevan, SM ’01, PhD ’07, knew the right questions to ask and how to break the model. Yet “it was really cool to sit there iterating with the model, seeing the way it maintained context and the way it was able to handle ambiguity and deal with conflicting constraints in a really nuanced way,” she said.
That was a “switch in time” as she realized the potential of the technology, Teevan said. She even found herself pulling over on her short drive home.
“I sat there, and I screamed. I didn’t think we would ever be where we are today in my lifetime, honestly,” she said.
During a keynote talk at the 2024 MIT Sloan AI & ML Conference, Teevan discussed how GPT-4 has evolved, how generative AI is changing work in the short and long terms, and the future of online search.
How AI will change work 
That eye-opening meeting began a sprint to bring LLMs to everyday workers, Teevan said.
The model itself was just the start. It also needed an infrastructure — the computing power necessary to run the model continuously, and the ability to securely input and analyze sensitive data and integrate models into the workflows of knowledge workers.
Microsoft’s research has found that generative AI helps people work faster while retaining relative consistency in quality. “People are feeling more efficient, and they’re enjoying work more,” Teevan said. One study demonstrated that generative AI can be most beneficial to workers with the least experience, helping them match the performance of colleagues with longer tenures.
Teevan said she is seeing AI change how people work in a few ways. In the short term, users are taking advantage of gains in efficiency or production, such as using ChatGPT to create content and to summarize documents, such as meeting transcripts.
“We can help you generate content to reply to an email or start a new document so you don’t have this blank-page challenge anymore,” she said.
There’s even more opportunity in the longer term, Teevan said. This includes using AI in entirely new ways.
“I don’t think we’re being imaginative enough,” she said. “We’re thinking about how it’s going to help us do our tasks better. We’re not thinking about how it’s going to help us collaborate and work together. We’re thinking about how it can do stuff that we know more efficiently and faster. We’re not thinking about how it can help us do new things or think of things in new ways.”
Teevan herself uses AI to see things in new ways and for brainstorming and collaboration. “I really like the way the model helps me see other perspectives really quickly, helps me ideate and think through new things,” she said.

It’s time to make sure everyone understands generative AI  


Looking ahead, Teevan said she expects generative AI to change online search. Instead of simply aggregating webpages, she said, a search engine could provide personalized feedback and serve a larger function. “In many ways, search is just a part of the larger task that you’re doing, and you’re seeing people go to search engines to do those larger tasks, to think things through, to get feedback, to create new content,” she said.
And it’s only a matter of time before models can turn the tables and ask users questions, Teevan said. “That ability to pull more knowledge from people and figure out what’s in your head, to help you bring more to the table, feels like a real opportunity,” she said.
A key challenge to using AI is a lack of imagination, she said — it’s hard to envision all the possibilities, given that the technology is evolving and people are still learning how to use it. “It’s a real sociotechnical problem, actually, where the way people are using the technology is going to shape the way that it evolves, and the technology is going to shape the way that we use it,” Teevan said.Watch all the sessions from the 2024 MIT AI & ML Conference

Get personalized advice61. Find inspiration for a presentationMaking a killer pitch deck is an art form, and one that usually takes hours. Rather than starting from scratch each time, global marketing and advertising company Media.Monks is using generative AI to make sure great ideas don’t go to waste. An early adopter of the technology, this AWS customer and partner has built an in-house, enterprise-ready AI solution to automate its workflows—both internally and on behalf of its clients. The platform, Monks.Flow, connects with Amazon Bedrock, and offers intelligent solutions for clients’ marketing activities. Designed to work across existing tech stacks, and depending on the needs of the client, it can perform tasks such as document reviews, as well as extract valuable data and insights from a company’s existing systems. For example, let’s say the Media.Monks team is preparing a presentation for a prospective client. Monks.Flow uses different LLMs, accessed via Amazon Bedrock, to search through the vast number of decks the company has worked on over the years. Not only can it quickly find information applicable to whatever new business the team is pitching for today, it can also rank it in order of relevance—providing instant access to a wealth of knowledge, and turbocharging teams’ imaginations.Amazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitmentAmazon’s AI Ready initiative comes as new AWS study finds strong demand for AI talent and the potential for workers with AI skills to earn up to 47% more in salaries.Read moreabout Amazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitment2. Compare product reviews in different languagesIf you’re an Amazon seller, or any other business that sells products online, customer reviews hold a treasure trove of information. But if you sell globally, and you receive hundreds, even thousands, of reviews in a range of languages you don’t speak, it can be pretty tricky to glean insights from the data. Step forward Cohere Embed, a text representation language model from enterprise AI company Cohere. Available on Amazon Bedrock, it can work across more than 100 languages. Cohere’s chief product officer, Jaron Waldman, put it this way: “Imagine you had a bunch of product reviews on Amazon, in 100 different languages. You want to analyze those reviews, and so you could ask a question like, ‘Show me all the reviews that are related to the delivery of the product,’ to see if there was a delivery problem or if the delivery was going well.’ You can do all that with Cohere Embed.”3. Streamline schedulingIt can be hard for business owners to organize staffing schedules that suit the needs of both their customers and employees. AWS customer AlayaCare offers software services to companies that provide home-based healthcare. The Montreal-based startup is using generative AI to tackle one of the industry’s biggest headaches: employee turnover. AlayaCare’s research shows that the biggest reason home-care services employees—hardworking caregivers usually paid by the hour—leave their jobs is dissatisfaction with scheduling. “A lot of times, it's simply the difference between the hours they want and the hours they get,” said Naomi Goldapple, AlayaCare senior VP of data and intelligence. Her team has been prototyping on Amazon Bedrock to help schedulers quickly see the home-visit slots they need to fill, and provide them with the best employee matches based on specific criteria that satisfy caregivers and patients alike.4. Summarize documents in a flashAlayaCare is also using generative AI to gather and then summarize what Goldapple affectionately calls “note droppings”: notes made by different caregivers and nurses who go into a patient’s home to provide care. One nurse might make a note in one part of the AlayaCare platform about a particular patient complaining about increased lower back pain. Then another nurse, visiting the same patient the following day, might make a note in a different part of the platform about that patient experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath. LLMs can read all of these notes left in different places, pull together the most important information (such as continued mentions of pain), and summarize it in a way that allows a clinician to spot trends and intervene earlier, to avoid having the patient hospitalized.5. Get personalized adviceIf you need advice or want to brainstorm, but no one’s around, why not ask your digital doppelgänger? Media.Monks VP and global head of engineering Iran Reyes has built his own digital persona in the company’s AI-centric, professionally managed service Monks.Flow. “I have a digital twin that knows my character traits, my personal and professional background, the way I speak, my tone of voice, and so on. For this interview, I asked it what I should keep in mind. It recommended I slow down, speak clearly, and focus on describing the specific services we’ve built. It was great advice.” Reyes predicts a big rise in AI companions: “We’re going to be using these ‘personas in our pockets’—with our phones, or other devices—to help us make better decisions and take actions in all kinds of situations.”Find out how to transform your business with generative AI on AWS.Learn more about the latest additions to Amazon Bedrock.Amazon Bedrock represents the middle layer of the three-layered ‘generative AI stack’.

It was rumoured last week to be launched as a search engine to challenge Google but Reuters reported that OpenAI delayed it.OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman denied any launches – only to post on X that the company has ""been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love"".The ""o"" in the name stands for ""omni"" and the California-based company is touting GPT-4o as something for all, which makes sense as ""omni"" means ""all"" or ""everything"" – does OpenAI want to be omnipresent in our lives?What is GPT-4o?Short answer: GPT-4o, according to OpenAI, is its ""new flagship model that can reason across audio, vision and text in real time"".Shorter answer: it's OpenAI's fastest AI model.The ""omni"" name refers to ""a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction"", OpenAI said in a blog post on Monday.It is also natively multimodal, meaning it can accept any combination of text, audio and image as input, and also generate any combination of text, audio and image outputs.
How fast is GPT-4o?OpenAI claims GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation, according to several studies.Consequently, GPT-4o requires the use of fewer tokens in languages, the basic unit in AI that calculates the length of text and can include punctuation marks and spaces. Token counts vary from one language to another.Among the languages highlighted by OpenAI that use fewer tokens with GPT-4o are Arabic (from 53 to 26), Gujarati (145 to 33), Hindi (90 to 31), Korean (45 to 27) and Chinese (34 to 24).For perspective, we can make some comparisons to a 1968 study from Robert Miller – Response time in man-computer conversational transactions – which detailed the three magnitudes of computer mainframe responsiveness.The research revealed a response time of 100 milliseconds is perceived as instantaneous, while one second or less are fast enough for users to feel they are interacting freely with the information. A response time of more than 10 seconds would lose user attention completely.How does GPT-4o work?The simplest answer is that OpenAI, well, simplified the process of converting input into output.In OpenAI's previous AI models, Voice Mode was used to talk to ChatGPT at latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. Voice Mode used three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in and outputs text, and a third simple version converts that text back to audio.""This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information – it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion,"" OpenAI said.But with GPT-4o, OpenAI was able to merge all these functions into a single model, with end-to-end capabilities across text, vision and audio, significantly reducing the amount of time consumed and information processed.""All inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network,"" OpenAI said. A neural network is an AI technique that teaches computers to process data similarly to the human brain.Still, OpenAI said it was ""still just scratching the surface"" of GPT-4o capabilities and limitations, given that it is their first model that merges all of these modalities.What can GPT-4o not do?Speaking of limitations, OpenAI acknowledged ""several"" of them across the GPT-4o model, including inconsistencies in responses featured in a blooper reel. It even demonstrated how GPT-4o can be adept in sarcasm.In addition, OpenAI said it continues to refine the model's behaviour through post-training – which is critical in addressing safety concerns, a key sticking point in modern-day AI.The company said it has created new safety systems to serve as guardrails for voice outputs, in addition to testing the model, with more than 70 experts in the fields of social psychology, bias, fairness and misinformation to identify any risks that may seep through.""We will continue to mitigate new risks as they’re discovered. We recognise that GPT-4o’s audio modalities present a variety of novel risks,"" OpenAI said.How much does GPT-4o cost?Good news – it's free for all users, with paid users enjoying ""up to five times the capacity limits"" of their free peers, OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said in the unveiling presentation.However, if you're not a paying OpenAI user, it will set you back $5 and $15 for one million tokens of input and output, respectively.Allowing the free use of GPT-4o should serve OpenAI well, which would also complement the company's other paid offerings.READ MOREAbu Dhabi's TII unveils Falcon 2 series that aims to take on Google and MetaUAE-developed Arabic chatbot Jais Chat unveiledIn August, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Enterprise monthly plan, the price of which varies depending on user requirements. It's the third tier after its basic free service and the $20-a-month Plus plan.The company in January launched its online ChatGPT Store that gives users access to more than three million custom versions of GPTs, developed by OpenAI's partners and its community.OpenAI hopes to attract more users as competition heats up in the generative AI world – and there are a lot coming for them.How does OpenAI stack against its biggest rivals at this point?OpenAI's move to introduce a new, free and faster large language model is an indication of how it has its hands full against its competition in generative AI.Google, arguably its biggest rival in the space, has Gemini, which was the first AI model to beat human experts on massive multitask language understanding, one of the widely used methods to test the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of AI.Gemini can be accessed on the Google One AI Premium plan for $19.99 a month, which includes 2TB of storage, 10 per cent back from purchases made on the Google Store and more features across Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides and Google Meet.In February, it launched Gemma, aimed at assisting developers and researchers in “building AI responsibly” and is more for modest tasks such as basic chatbots or summarisation jobs.Anthropic, meanwhile, in March launched Claude 3 – its direct challenge at generative AI leader OpenAI.The company backed by Google itself and Amazon has three tiers – Haiku, Sonnet and Opus – each offering increasing capabilities that will suit user needs.Haiku is priced at $0.25 per million tokens (MTok) for input and $1.25 for output, while Sonnet costs $3 and $15. Opus is the most expensive at $15 and $75.For comparison, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo comes in at $10 for input and $30 for output, and also with a smaller context window of 128,000 MTok.Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest backer, charges $20 a month for its Copilot pro service, which guarantees faster performance and ""everything"" the service offers. If you're not willing to pay, there's a free Copilot tier, which, obviously, has limited functionalities.And then, there's xAI's Grok, from OpenAI's friend-turned-enemy, Elon Musk.Grok's current version, Grok-1.5, is only available to subscribers of X's Premium+ tier, which starts at $16 per month, or $168 a year.Regional entities are also taking aim at the leaders: on Monday Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute introduced the second iteration of its large language model, Falcon 2, to compete with models developed by Meta, Google and OpenAI.Also on Monday, Core42, a unit of Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence and cloud company, G42, launched a bilingual Arabic and English chatbot developed in the UAE, Jais Chat.

They can be used for fun, or even for scientific research, but sometimes they're used to impersonate people like politicians or world leaders, in order to deliberately mislead people.Keep reading to find out more, and get some top tips on how to work out if something is real, or not.More like this:AI used to target kids with disinformationRoboKlopp: How Liverpool FC is using AI to help with tacticsWhat is artificial intelligence?How do deepfakes work?Using artificial intelligence, deepfakes can mimic a person's voice and facial features. The technology uses an audio recording of someone's voice to make it say things that the person might never have said. It can mimic someone's facial movements from videos of them, or even just a picture of their face. Image caption, What do you think of AI Ricky? Researchers at the University of Southampton produced a video of him speaking by just using clips of his voice and a picture of his faceA lot of deepfake videos or pictures can look very strange, so they can be easy to spot as imitations. However, sometimes they can look quite realistic, and the technology that people use to make them is improving constantly.Sometimes they can also be used for fun - you might have seen some AI-generated videos that you laugh about with your friends.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Disinformation experts recommend that if you see something that looks unusual or seems untrue on the internet, it's important to question itWhen can deepfakes be helpful?Researchers at the University of Southampton say that the technology can be used to help people hear their own voice again, if they are no longer able to speak - often because of a medical condition or treatment for one.

It's her job to hunt down misinformation, and work out what's right, and what's wrong.Marianna's top tips for spotting a deepfake:1. Features - Take a closer look at the person's fingers and face in the video. Do their eyes look like they do in other pictures? Have they got the right number of fingers?2. Fact-check - When are people claiming that this picture or video was taken? Does the weather match up with the day, or the location?3.

KYIV — On a sunny, balmy Tuesday in late April, a line of cars formed outside a military proving ground near Kyiv, their passengers eager to catch a glimpse of the future of warfare. As the drivers waited to enter, hosts of maybugs swarmed overhead. Above them buzzed bigger, robotic competitors: military drones crisscrossing the sky.
The grounds were full of techies and soldiers, gathering on a field scarred by Russia’s foiled assault on Kyiv to test-drive their latest innovations. Among them was a Ukrainian startup called Swarmer. Registered in Delaware and with offices in Romania and Poland, it had something special to demo: drones that use artificial intelligence to work together as a coordinated swarm.
It took about 20 minutes for Swarmer’s team of five engineers to prepare the drones for their mission: to find and destroy two targets hidden somewhere in the field. Usually, drones need pilots equipped with video-game-style controllers and goggles to see through their cameras. For this test, Yaroslav Sherstyuk, a former Ukrainian army officer, planned to run three reconnaissance drones and two larger bombers. “I will be in charge,” Sherstyuk said. “But that only takes pushing three buttons.”

He indicated the targets on a map, pushed start and leaned back in his chair. Two reconnaissance drones zoomed off. “Each of them decided on the best trajectory on their own, based on a possible terrain relief or other possible obstacles we pointed out on the map,” said Sherstyuk, watching their progress on his screen. The two bombers followed. Only the last, small drone stayed back.
The bombers found their targets. Sherstyuk approved the attack, then hopped on a phone call with his son while the drones carried out the strike. The last drone whirred forward. “It’s checking whether the bombers destroyed the target,” Sherstyuk said. “Command usually demands destruction or damage confirmation, so it’s doing that.”
Mission accomplished, the drones floated back to Sherstyuk. Swarmer’s team toasted the demo’s success with alcohol-free beer.
As its war against Russia drags on, Ukraine is emerging as a testing ground for cutting-edge warfare, including drones and other vehicles capable of carrying out parts of their mission on their own. Serhii Kuprienko, Swarmer’s 39-year-old founder and chief executive, thinks his swarms might be deployed this year. “We have already passed the first combat tests,” he said.
By allowing a single pilot to control multiple drones, Swarmer aims to alleviate the manpower shortages that have put Ukraine’s armed forces on the back foot in recent weeks. Using artificial intelligence, or AI, the company’s drones will react autonomously to changing circumstances and communicate with each other to orchestrate a sortie.
“AI-powered drones can do in seconds what would take a human several hours, simply because we are slow to process a large volume of information,” Kuprienko said. “The swarm is effective because one experienced drone pilot can work effectively with dozens of drones at the same time.”

He stressed that the decision to attack a target would always be made by a human. Still, he couldn’t resist making the Arnold Schwarzenegger-sized sci-fi reference that inevitably looms over any conversation about AI-powered combat robots.
“My goal,” he said, “is to make a proper version of the Terminator that will protect us and help our army.” 
Ukraine turns to AI to maintain its drone advantage
Technology has been the linchpin of Ukraine’s fightback from the very moment Russian tanks rolled over its borders in February 2022. Demography — Russia’s population of 144 million versus Ukraine’s 38 million — made Moscow’s preponderance in manpower and materiel unmatchable. There was no fighting fire with fire. You had to douse it with bits.
Drones — military-grade or cheap hobbyist models — epitomize that strategy. On the battlefield, they are ubiquitous, scanning the ground to spot targets with ammo-saving precision, dropping grenades or ramming kamikaze-style into Russian vehicles, gear and troops. Telegram, a laxly moderated social network popular in Russia and Ukraine, is awash with videos of Ukrainian drones rigged with explosives fluttering around Russian soldiers and tanks like angry, deadly mosquitos. Russia has also leaned heavily on drones, both imported from allies and domestically produced.

Drones have broadened the buffer zone between Ukrainian and Russian combatants from a couple of kilometers to as much as 20 km, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation Alex Bornyakov told POLITICO. “Anything you put in this ‘gray area’, it can be destroyed by drones,” he said.
Their pivotal role was officially acknowledged in February 2024, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy launched a new branch of the military: the Unmanned Systems Forces, entirely dedicated to working with aerial, ground and sea drones. Days later, his government announced that Ukraine was on track to manufacture more than a million drones by the end of 2024.

Even if the recently announced inflow of U.S. ammo helps Ukraine diversify its approach, drones are not going away. “Once additional artillery is available again, the Ukrainians will use [commercial drones] less,” said Torsten Reil, co-CEO of the pan-European AI defense company Helsing, which works with the Ukrainian government. “[But] midterm, we will see a development of much more capable drones, strike drones, that will complement and mirror artillery in terms of their effect.”
The challenge for Ukraine is that Russia has recognized the disruptive power of the technology and turned to electronic warfare — deploying vehicles covered in dish antennas to jam the radio frequencies relied on by Ukrainian drone pilots. “Russia has jamming stations every 10 kilometers at the front line, so Ukraine’s previously successful drone-based approach doesn’t work as well as it used to,” Reil said.
In addition to cutting off drones from their pilots, jamming can interfere with navigation systems like GPS. Worse, the Russian technology can work out the location of drone pilots — who in many cases need to remain within line of sight of their vehicles — and tag them for artillery strikes. Concerns about jamming and other types of electronic warfare have contributed to reluctance in Washington to providing Kyiv with American-made Reaper spy drones.
To try to maintain its edge, Ukraine has launched an effort to restyle itself as a tech accelerator in the field of drone warfare, working with local and Western companies to develop countermeasures and test them and deploy them on the battlefield. 
At the forefront is a government program called Brave1, a joint venture encompassing six ministries modeled on the U.S.’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a Department of Defense outfit tasked with facilitating military deployments of commercial technologies.   
“Everyone was like: ‘Let’s build Ukrainian DARPA’,” said Bornyakov, referring to the Department of Defense’s military research agency. “But DARPA is more about complex theoretical innovations.” Brave1 is focused on developing solutions that can be rolled out, stat.

Roughly a year after its launch, some 700 inventions that went through Brave1’s program were approved for use by the Ukrainian Armed Forces; around 40 have found their way to the front. Once a working prototype is identified, government certification can be obtained in as little as 21 days, Bornyakov said.
Brave1 supports startups working on medical technologies, logistics and cybersecurity, among other areas. But its top priority is unmanned systems. “The goal [is] that robots, not humans, should fight on the battlefield,” Bornyakov said.
Given the Russian jamming, achieving that goal often boils down to one thing: AI, the use of vast troves of data — images, text, audio, video, radio signals — to teach drones to act on their own. Reconnaissance drones use image-recognition to do away with GPS or spot and identify camouflaged military targets. Explosive kamikaze drones can be trained to forge on even if they lose contact with their pilots.

“AI can help lock in on targets and then automatically — without communication, or in conditions of suppression by the enemy’s electronic warfare systems — make it possible for the drone to hit the target,” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and technology chief Mykhailo Fedorov said in an interview in a high-security governmental building in April. He said that 10 companies active in Ukraine are developing AI technology to help drones close in on their targets.
The technology on offer may fall far short of Terminator-style robots: in Ukraine, the call to engage with a given target still lies with a human decisionmaker. But for how long? 
“If you think of AI as drones autonomously and independently making some decisions to strike or not to strike something, there is no such thing yet,” said Fedorov. “But I think that there is a certain future for it.”

In an interview with the Associated Press in 2023, he was more explicit: Autonomous killer drones, he said, are “a logical and inevitable next step.”
The future of warfare is being written in Ukraine
Just how much of a difference AI is making on the battlefield is a matter of some debate. Jim Acuna, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and the founder of the Baltic Ghost Wing Center of Excellence drone pilot school in Estonia, is skeptical. “It’s all wishful thinking, it’s not a reality,” he said.
Autonomous weapons systems still don’t make sense from a “cost-benefit analysis” perspective, said Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies think tank. “None of these platforms currently are at a stage where they can genuinely be deployed at scale, consistently, and without a huge support infrastructure.” 
Technologists, unsurprisingly, have a different take. “If you zoom in, it’ll look like pilot projects,” said Louis Mosley, vice president for Europe for the U.S. artificial intelligence giant Palantir, which works in Ukraine. “But when you zoom out, you can see that this is now the way the war is being fought.”
Peter W. Singer, a defense analyst and author of 2009 best-seller “Wired for War”, sees the war in Ukraine as playing a similar role to the Spanish Civil War, which served as a dress rehearsal for new techniques and technologies ahead of World War II. Modern tank warfare and aerial bombing — as captured in Pablo Picasso’s dramatic oeuvre Guernica — were arguably forged in the Spanish crucible.
“There’s a bit of debate in defense circles that in Ukraine, yes, you’ve got drones but also trenches and cannons, so nothing’s really changing,” Singer said. “That’s like looking at Spain in 1936 and saying, ‘They are still using rifles’ and ignoring that they are bringing together these new technologies like aerial bombing.”

As Ukraine and Russia fight, Singer said, “everyone else is watching and learning.And they’re not watching and learning about trenches, but about the use of drones and AI and how it’s being brought together,” he said.

Ukraine has attracted dozens of Western defense and technology companies eager to test — or advertise — their offerings in a live-fire situation. “If companies want to do something in the field of defense innovations, they have to be in Ukraine,” said Brave1’s Chief Operating Officer, Nataliia Kushnerska. “Ukraine is definitely the most dynamic innovation ecosystem in the world.”
One of those companies is Quantum Systems, a company that has deployed 400 reconnaissance drones in Ukraine, with a contract to deliver 800 more and eventually build a factory in the country, according to its CEO Florian Seibel, who accompanied Germany’s Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck on a mission to the country last month. 
The company has made waves as far away as Silicon Valley: German-American billionaire Peter Thiel is an investor and Seibel met emissaries from the venture capital firm Sequoia just before sitting down with POLITICO in his office, a squat, drone-filled building in an industrial park outside Munich.
Quantum Systems’ drones are expensive, at €200,000 each, but they use AI to overcome electronic warfare with preloaded maps and landmarks to navigate a GPS-denied environment, and machine vision to flag foes. “You can completely take operators out of the loop,” Seibel said.
While Quantum System’s drones only work as spotters, Seibel said the Ukrainian experience convinced him to form a new company called Stark Defense to develop autonomous weapons with full-strike capability. “If we don’t want our kids to fight Chinese war robots in the future, we have to get going and work on robots ourselves,” he said. Crucially, he added, Stark’s systems will be “capable of operating without a human in the loop.”

He acknowledged that this was a controversial approach. “We will prepare the grounds so that it is possible, but in the end, it’s not my decision,” he said. “If the decision of the German government is that we cannot have autonomous weapons with no human in the loop, well, then this will not be used.”
Stark is still, to a certain extent, in “stealth” mode — recruiting, seeking venture capital investment — but it would theoretically be able to deploy its products on short notice, he said. “We will deploy whenever we think it’s ready to be viable, and whenever the Ukrainians decide to,” he says.
Has the company already tested its drones in Ukraine?
“Maybe,”  Seibel said. 
Autonomous weapons: ‘The Oppenheimer moment of our generation’
Among the people watching what’s happening in Ukraine are those seeking to prevent the technology from ever coming to fruition. In late April, delegates from 143 countries joined activists, academics and at least one journalist in the caryatid-graced hall of the Hofburg imperial palace in Vienna to attend the biggest ever conference on autonomous weapons systems. 
Above a bust of the 19th-century Emperor Franz Joseph, a screen displayed digital images of autonomous drones devastating cities with firework-like effects. Nearby, a blueish cut-out of Austria-born Schwarzenegger’s Terminator fixed visitors with glowing red eyes and a skeletal steel grin.

“This is the ‘Oppenheimer moment’ of our generation,” Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told the assembled audience. “Autonomous weapons systems will soon fill the world’s battlefields … Technology is moving ahead with racing speed, while politics is lagging behind.”
He ceded the floor to Jaan Tallinn, an Estonian tech entrepreneur who has warned against the dangers posed by AI. The risk that comes with autonomous weapons (or killer robots, as their critics call them) is of a “suicidal arms race” to more autonomy, he said. Mass killing will become a mechanized, easy affair. AI-controlled drones will be deployed in assassinations or by terrorists targeting civilians. “When you opt for speed, you give up control,” Tallinn said. 
For Anthony Aguirre, the executive director of the Tallinn-backed think tank the Future of Life Institute, the problem is not so much what is taking place in Ukraine right now — but what will happen when powerhouses like China and the U.S. get in the game. “If you end up with half a million drones in a shipping container able to go out and kill roughly half a million people — that’s a WMD,” he said. 
The solution, Schallenberg said in an interview after the event, is “a legally binding international instrument” — a treaty banning fully autonomous weapons whose actions cannot be predicted or explained (AI algorithms are notoriously opaque) by their operators. 
Alexander Kmentt, the Austrian diplomat who organized the conference, said that the goal is to ban “weapons designed in a way that they could not be used in accordance with international humanitarian law.”
The Austrian foreign minister acknowledged that many countries, including the United States and Russia, oppose the initiative and made that clear during the conference.

Last summer, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Pentagon is seeking to build thousands of “attritable, autonomous systems” able to “overcome [China’s] biggest advantage, which is mass.” In early May, the secretary of the U.S. Air Force Frank Kendall took a ride in an AI-controlled F16, an early version of what the service hopes to be a fleet of 1,000 unmanned warplanes, with the first deployed by 2028. The U.S. Marines are reportedly testing rifle-equipped robotic dogs capable of scanning a battlefield for targets before requesting permission to attack. 
In early 2023, France’s Defense Innovation Agency put out a call for tenders for two national efforts to develop kamikaze drones, some of which will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming months. And on Thursday, the Bundestag was expected to begin discussion on a motion entitled “Building a Drone Army.”
China too is developing AI-augmented drones. Its military has test flown drones that were capable of carrying an assault to its explosive conclusion after they were cut off from their operators. On the other side of the Taiwan strait, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has said she had drawn “great inspiration” from the use of autonomous weapons in Ukraine and pledged to close the drone gap with Beijing. Iran and — of course — Russia are also working to integrate AI into their fleets.
“The fact that maybe not everybody would agree at the very beginning is maybe an obstacle, but not an excuse,” said Schallenberg. He pointed to earlier treaties on landmines and cluster munitions as examples of rules that, while not backed by everyone, including the U.S., established a baseline of decency. “Countries that do not abide by the rules — even if they’ve not ratified the treaty — now feel obliged to explain themselves,” he said. 
For Singer, the military futurist, the Rubicon on autonomous weapons has already been crossed. “Autonomy was this big red line, and we crossed it without a lot of hullabaloo,” he said. 
“If your vision of the future is using more robotic systems at the end of a long leash — a physical wire or wireless … The enemy is going to cut that wire through electronic or cyber warfare,” he added. “Then you will have the option of either doing nothing about it — or going for more autonomy.”

Ukraine’s delegation at the Vienna conference did not make a statement, but Fedorov told POLITICO he did not believe in “quick decisions to limit such technologies, because they are actively developing and there is still no stable experience of how they can have a negative impact.”
“I am sure that the question of limiting the use of AI should be resolved,” he said. “After our victory.”

ChatGPT has seen traffic flatline and dip over the past year, by some estimates, after an early explosion in user growth. Much of the newsflow around the new generation of AI has focused on its downsides — a tendency to perpetuate harmful biases, or its effectiveness in amplifying misinformation.

AI Hitting Job Markets Like a ‘Tsunami’, Says IMF Chief



May 14, 2024

 “We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said

The International Monetary Fund chief voiced concerns this week about the impact of artificial intelligence on job markets, adding that the world has had little time to “prepare” for the technology.
AI is hitting global labour forces “like a tsunami,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told an event in Zurich on Monday.
“We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” she added.

Speaking at the Swiss Institute of International Studies, Georgieva noted that artificial intelligence was likely to impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% of jobs around the world in the next two years.
For several businesses, however, that impact has already started to manifest.
Employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. noted in a February report that AI-related job cuts were on the rise in the US since May 2023. That was because firms were either moving towards developing the tech or depending upon it to replace certain duties and roles.
Rapid advancement of AI was currently affecting jobs in media and technology, but its effect was “beginning to be felt” across other sectors, the report added.
In March, US tech giant IBM reportedly began laying off employees in non-customer-facing roles, aiming to replace them with AI.
The company’s chief had said last year that the company was planning to slow or suspend hiring in 26,000 roles which could be carried out by AI and automation, CRN magazine reported. That number accounted for about 10% of the firm’s workforce.
Meanwhile, about 40% and 26% of jobs in emerging markets and low-income countries, respectively, are at risk from AI, the IMF has previously noted.
According to accounting firm PwC, AI and related technologies could displace around 26% of existing jobs in China.
Georgieva has previously called on policymakers to manage this “troubling trend” and prevent the technology from “stoking social tensions”.
On Monday, she reiterated that call. AI “could bring a tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society.”

Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) refers to technology that employs machine learning techniques to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, and Midjourney have gained popularity worldwide, including among teachers, due to their potential to save time and generate new ideas and resources.
Given the novelty of this technology, relatively little is known about the role of generative AI in teaching and learning. This gap is important to address to help guide policy and practice as education departments integrate generative AI into teaching and learning at schools (Commonwealth of Australia, 2023).



Because teachers will be in the front line of these practices and policies, it is vital to understand how they perceive generative AI and the ways in which they are using it in their work. In a recent study (Collie & Martin, 2024), we examined how much teachers value the usefulness of generative AI, how they were integrating generative AI in their work, and the role of school leadership practices and teachers’ own occupational experiences in supporting or thwarting these experiences.
By looking at these factors together, this research offers multipronged insights into how generative AI may be integrated into classroom and school life.
What did our research involve?
We collected data from a sample of 339 Australian school teachers in June and July 2023, approximately 6 months after the release of the first generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Many additional generative AI tools had been released by that point too (including, GPT 4, Grammarly AI, Midjourney, Bing Chat AI, and Dall-E 2). 
As indicated, we looked at teachers’ valuing of generative AI and their integration of this technology in teaching and learning. 
Generative AI valuing captures teachers’ perceptions that generative AI will play a useful and beneficial role in their work. 
Generative AI integration reflects teachers’ use of this technology for assisting with their own work tasks (such as planning, teaching, and assessing) and in student learning activities (such as by asking students to generate ideas, check work, and develop outlines). 
The factors we examined as predictors of the generative AI variables included teacher reports on their perceptions of 2 school leadership practices and 2 occupational experiences: 
Autonomy-supportive leadership practices
denote efforts by school leaders to foster teachers’ self-initiative by, for example, acknowledging their viewpoints, seeking their input, and understanding their individual needs.Autonomy-thwarting leadership practices
denote approaches by school leaders that require compliance in how teachers undertake their work tasks, or prompt feelings of guilt or shame among teachers if they conduct their work in ways that are different from the leaders.Professional growth striving
denotes teachers’ deliberate efforts to plan for their ongoing professional learning and development.Change-related stress denotes teachers’ stress from recent changes in their work and workplace. 
What did our study find?
Our findings showed that higher levels of autonomy-supportive leadership and professional growth striving were linked with greater valuing of generative AI. This means that teachers who felt their school leaders supported their self-initiative and those who were invested in their own professional development tended to value generative AI more. This makes sense and aligns with prior research showing supportive leadership and growth-oriented teachers are more likely to report greater valuing and motivation at work (Collie, 2023a).
Unexpectedly, we found that change-related stress was also associated with greater valuing of generative AI. This requires further research to unpack, but we speculate it may be that stressed teachers value generative AI because it offers the opportunity to assist with their tasks and streamline their workload. 
When it came to generative AI integration, our study showed that higher levels of generative AI valuing were associated with greater levels of generative AI integration. This finding is understandable. When we value something, we’re more likely to engage in actions related to that perception.
In addition, we found that higher levels of autonomy-thwarting leadership and professional growth striving were linked with greater generative AI integration. For the former finding, it may be that generative AI offers teachers a chance to take back some control over their work when they experience pressuring leadership. With regard to professional growth striving, we suggest that generative AI integration offers an opportunity to further build professional skills. 
What does this mean for school leaders and teachers?
Our findings suggest that leadership practices and teachers’ occupational experiences might be important to address in relation to supporting generative AI valuing and integration. 
As relevant to our study, strategies to boost autonomy-supportive leadership practices include seeking out teachers’ perspectives, providing rationales for work task assignments, and incorporating teachers’ input into decisions about how to integrate generative AI into teaching and learning (Collie, 2023b). 
At the same time, it is important to reduce autonomy-thwarting leadership practices (Collie, 2023b). Leaders can do this by avoiding pressuring practices, such as demanding how things must be done, providing teachers little choice in how they integrate generative AI, or making teachers feel guilty if they do things differently. 
Efforts to boost professional growth striving might include encouraging teachers to set goals for their learning with generative AI, giving them opportunities to engage in relevant and effective training to meet those goals, and building professional learning communities within the school to boost collective goals (Garet et al., 2001). 
Finally, to reduce change-related stress, any efforts by schools to reduce or streamline reforms might be helpful, including around expectations for integrating generative AI (Putwain et al., 2019). Autonomy-supportive leadership practices are also helpful because these ensure that teachers’ perspectives are considered (Collie, 2021), which may help teachers feel more control over decisions that impact their work.

In Rebecca Collie and Andrew Martin’s study, ‘teachers who felt their school leaders supported their self-initiative and those who were invested in their professional development tended to value generative AI more’. 
As a school leader, do you seek out teacher perspectives on integration of new programs or technologies? Is their input incorporated into decision-making? 
When introducing new technologies, do you encourage teachers to set goals for their own learning and provide opportunities for training to meet these goals? What role do professional learning communities within the school play?

Video: Can Laws Keep Up With AI’s Fast Pace?  They come amid growing concerns about how use of the technology can lead to worker displacement, intrusive employee surveillance, and unintentional discrimination based on race, sex, and other protected characteristics.“Workers must be at the heart of our nation’s approach to AI technology development and use,” Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a Thursday statement. “These principles announced today reflect the Biden-Harris administration’s belief that, in addition to complying with existing laws, artificial intelligence should also enhance the quality of work and life for all workers.”When it comes to oversight of AI systems, the principles say that companies should have “governance systems,” evaluation processes, and humans involved in monitoring the technology.Fears of “robot bosses” making hiring and firing decisions, as well as surveiling workers has also garnered the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have introduced some bills to rein in AI use in the workplace.The principles caution that any worker data collected by AI systems should be “used only to support legitimate business aims,” and that the technology cannot run afoul of workers’ labor rights and anti-discrimination protections. The White House has already secured commitments from tech companies Microsoft Corp. and Indeed Inc. to integrate the principles into their workplaces, according to the announcement. The principles aren’t an “exhaustive list,” and are meant to serve as a “guiding framework” for businesses on workplace protections and risks as artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday life, the White House said. They were requested by President Joe Biden as part of his October executive order on responsible AI use.The principles apply to all industries, the White House said, but it also noted that AI developers and employers can and should “review and customize” these practices “based on their own context and with input from workers.”The DOL is still due to issue a set of “best practices” outlining examples of how employers can apply the principles.As part of Biden’s requests under the EO, the DOL on April 29 issued an FAQ focused on federal contractors’ equal employment opportunity obligations when using AI technology, and instructions to its Wage and Hour Division offices on how the Fair Labor Standards Act still applies when AI is used to determine break periods or for timekeeping purposes, among other areas.

In a recent US survey, 30% of junior employees polled said they
use Generative AI for work - but 70% of them haven't told their
bosses! Time to do an audit, and put a policy in place for the
purchase and deployment of AI in your business.
On Wednesday, 24 April, 
Victor Timon, Head of the 
ByrneWallace LLP Technology Group, joined by John Clancy, CEO
of Galvia, and Elaine Burke, journalist and host of the podcast For
Tech's Sake, discussed the implications of Generative AI for
businesses. They explained the nuances of Generative AI, examined
the key risks and how to mitigate them. They also outlined what
should be in your own business's AI Policy and why you need
one.
With the introduction of the EU AI Act in April 2024, being
prepared and informed about Generative AI is more important than
ever.

Large Language Models (LLMs ) are everywhere, but how exactly do they work under the hood? [Miguel Grinberg] provides a great explanation of the inner workings of LLMs in simple (but not simplistic) terms that eschews the low-level mathematics of how they work in favor of laying bare what it is they do.
At their heart, LLMs are prediction machines that work on tokens (small groups of letters and punctuation) and are as a result capable of great feats of human-seeming communication. Most technical-minded people understand that LLMs have no idea what they are saying, and this peek at their inner workings will make that abundantly clear.
Be sure to also review an illustrated guide to how image-generating AIs work. And if a peek under the hood of LLMs left you hungry for more low-level details, check out our coverage of training a GPT-2 LLM using pure C code.

Here’s some advice on how to navigate it. And if you want to turn AI Overviews off, you have a few options.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveLet’s say you just searched Google to learn more about this new AI Overview feature that everyone’s talking about. If your query triggers an AI Overview—and not every query will—then you might see an AI-generated summary of this very article at the top of your results. These new AI Overviews in Google Search present users with AI-generated answers to queries that are culled from information on the web, and they’re presented in a way that gives you the answer you seek without ever requiring you to click on a web link or even learn the names of the publications that the AI used as sources.Google has already released a nascent version of AI Overviews within something called the Search Generative Experience, but it was only available to users who opted in. However, at the company’s I/O developer conference this week, Google announced that the newly renamed AI Overviews is now receiving a wider launch; everyone in the US who uses Google to search the web or ask a question will now see AI Overviews at the top of their results—again, if their question can be answered by a summary.Can I Turn Off AI Overviews?What if you’d rather just see web links? Unfortunately, AI Overviews are baked into the default search results page now. You can’t opt out of seeing them in your results. While there’s no way to fully disable AI Overviews for your Google account, there are a couple of methods you can use to get a search results page filled with web links.Featured Video$2M vs. $63,000: Luxury Racing SimulatorsFirst, there's the manual method of selecting a special filtered view after each individual query. After landing on the search result page topped with the AI Overview, click on the More tab—it should now appear among other filter options like Images, Videos, Shopping—and click Web. You’ll see a results page just showing links to actual websites.Second, you can install a browser extension that automatically forces this web-only view of the search results page. Developers have been hard at work since I/O; there are already options available for Chrome and Vivaldi, as well as add-ons for Firefox.

Google via Reece RogersOne of my core hesitations about this feature as it rolls out is the continued potential for AI hallucinations, more commonly known as lies. When you interact with Google’s Gemini chatbot, a disclaimer at the bottom reads: “Gemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses.” There’s no such disclaimer added to the bottom of the AI Overview, which often simply reads, “Generative AI is experimental.”When asked why there’s no mention of potential hallucinations for AI Overviews, De Leon emphasizes that Google wants to still offer high-quality search results and mentions that the company did adversarial red-teaming tests to uncover potential weak points for the feature.“This implementation of generative AI is rooted in Search’s core quality and safety systems, with built-in guardrails to prevent low-quality or harmful information from surfacing,” she says. “AI Overviews are designed to highlight information that can be easily verified by the supporting information that we surface.”Knowing this, you might still want to click through the webpage links to double-check that the information is actually correct. Though it’s hard to imagine many users, who are often looking for quick answers, will spend extra time reading over the source material for Google’s AI-generated answer.Liz Reid, Google’s head of Search, recently told my colleague Lauren Goode that AI Overviews are expected to arrive for countries outside of the United States before the end of 2024, so over a billion people will likely soon encounter this new feature. As someone whose job relies on readers actually clicking links and spending time reading the articles, of course I’m apprehensive about this change—and I’m not alone.Beyond concerns from publishers, it also remains unclear what additional impacts might trickle down to users from Google’s AI Overviews. Yes, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI tools are quite popular in Silicon Valley tech circles, but this feature will likely expose billions of people, who have never used a chatbot before, to AI-generated text. Even though AI Overviews are designed to save you time, they might lead to less trustworthy results.Update, May 23 at noon EDT: We added more information about how to disable AI Overviews in search results.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterGadget LabThe latest news, expert guides, and in-depth reviews from WIRED's Gear team.

However, at the company’s I/O developer conference this week, Google announced that the newly renamed AI Overviews is now receiving a wider launch; everyone in the US who uses Google to search the web or ask a question will now see AI Overviews at the top of their results—again, if their question can be answered by a summary.
Can I Turn Off AI Overviews?
What if you’d rather just see web links? Unfortunately, AI Overviews are baked into the default search results page now. You can’t opt out of seeing them in your results. While there’s no way to fully disable AI Overviews for your Google account, there are a couple of methods you can use to get a search results page filled with web links.
First, there's the manual method of selecting a special filtered view after each individual query. After landing on the search result page topped with the AI Overview, click on the More tab—it should now appear among other filter options like Images, Videos, Shopping—and click Web. You’ll see a results page just showing links to actual websites.
Second, you can install a browser extension that automatically forces this web-only view of the search results page. Developers have been hard at work since I/O; there are already options available for Chrome and Vivaldi, as well as add-ons for Firefox. Other browsers will likely get extensions soon.

Building your portfolio will ensure you have proof of your AI-specific skill set. To build a portfolio, complete AI projects that pertain to your chosen career path. For example, build a machine learning model or algorithm or design a AI chatbot.
Apply to Entry-Level Jobs
Once you have obtained the necessary education and built a portfolio, it’s time to start applying for entry-level AI jobs. Look for opportunities at AI companies or departments within larger organizations. You can also network with professionals in the field and attend industry events to increase your chances of finding job openings.
The Future of AI Career Paths
The artificial intelligence industry is in the middle of a boom. According to recent data, the market size was $95.60 billion in 2021. However, by 2030, the market size is forecasted to reach $1.8 trillion, growing at a stunning CAGR of 32.9%.
This growth will drive AI companies and other organizations to look for additional support. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and information technology jobs will increase by 15% between now and 2031. This is much faster than average growth when compared to all other occupations.
Job opportunities range from those specific to AI to those specific to data and machine learning. Due to the nature of AI and its complexities, there are virtually endless career paths to choose from.

Although generative AI is a relatively new technology, it’s already enjoying an insane adoption rate: according to a new study by LinkedIn and Microsoft, some 75 percent of “global knowledge workers” are using it in some way.

LinkedIn and Microsoft’s 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report suggests this adoption (which has nearly doubled in the past six months) comes with a thorny issue for companies everywhere: rather than follow their employers’ protocols when it comes to AI use, many employees are deploying their own AI to help them complete their own tasks. Call it “BYOAI” (Bring Your Own AI), an update of “BYOD” (Bring Your Own Device) which drove IT and corporate cybersecurity professionals crazy for so many years in the 2010s. 

“This approach means missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale. It also puts company data at risk in an environment where leaders’ #1 concern for the year ahead is cybersecurity and data privacy,” the report added.

Compounding the issue: many workers are reluctant to admit they’re using AI to help them with tasks: “Fifty-three percent of people who use AI at work worry that using it on important work tasks makes them look replaceable.”

Of course, Microsoft has an interest in companies everywhere taking a top-down approach to AI adoption—it sells a growing portfolio of AI-powered services, after all. But that aside, it’s true that more workers, including tech pros, are figuring out how AI can impact their workflows, and it behooves managers and executives to figure out how to make that transition as safe and effective as possible.

If you haven’t yet begun to learn about generative AI, there are a variety of online courses that can help you learn about its intricacies, along with certifications to prove your knowledge.

Microsoft Unveils New Generative AI Features for Copilot 365 With Report Showing Everyone is Using AI at Work



Eric Hal Schwartz  on May 13, 2024 at 8:00 am

Microsoft is streamlining the process of writing good prompts for generative AI tools in an update to Copilot for Microsoft 365. The upgraded suite of AI features comes with the release of the newest Work Trend Index report from Microsoft and LinkedIn showing the growing integration of AI into daily work activities, with 75% of surveyed individuals are already using AI tools at work
365 Prompts
Copilot for Microsoft 365 augments the platform with a generative AI assistant throughout the connected Office apps. The new features are designed to streamline the process of crafting effective prompts, a crucial element in leveraging AI tools for content generation and query resolution. With the auto-complete feature, users who ask the AI to “summarize” without additional information will be presented with refined options, such as summarizing the last ten unread emails in their inbox. This addition aims to optimize the user’s interaction with AI by suggesting contextually relevant tasks based on their Office data.



Meanwhile, the new “elaborate your prompt” feature can enhance initial prompts with additional details to improve the AI’s output. This feature is intended to assist users in specifying their requests when interacting with files, ensuring they obtain the most relevant information or action from the AI. Microsoft also plans to introduce a new “Catch Up” chat interface within Copilot for Microsoft 365. This interface will highlight key information such as upcoming meetings and surface relevant documents to aid in meeting preparation, enhancing workplace productivity and efficiency. In addition to these user-facing enhancements, Microsoft will enable Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscribers to create, publish, and manage custom prompts via Copilot Lab. This feature is tailored for use within business teams, facilitating the sharing and standardization of effective AI prompts across colleagues.
“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”
AI At Work
As the Microsoft and LinkedIn Work Trend Index showed, there’s plenty of demand for AI tools in offices. In the survey of 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, LinkedIn hiring trends, and Microsoft 365 data usage, 75% of surveyed individuals are already using AI tools at work, and 78% of these users are bringing personal AI tools into their workplaces, indicating a proactive approach to leveraging AI technologies despite organizational offerings. The survey also identifies a new category of “AI power users,” employees who have fully integrated AI into their workflows to optimize their productivity, reportedly saving an average of 30 minutes per day.
This initiative comes at a crucial time for Microsoft as it seeks to demonstrate the value of its AI investments to shareholders. With a significant 31% revenue increase in its Azure and other cloud services in the recent fiscal quarter, AI services contributed seven percentage points to this growth, underscoring the expanding role of AI in Microsoft’s business strategy.
“AI is redefining work and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky.“It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
Microsoft has been keen to make its Copilot generative AI assistant as widely used as possible, both by users and third-party partners. Ongoing upgrades like implementing the more powerful Deucalion model to power Copilot, along with enhanced features from Copilot Pro, make it clear that Microsoft wants to make its generative AI service the default regardless of the environment where it’s employed.

Young employees propel generative AI adoption in Asia-Pacific

        Approximately 1.1 billion work hours are projected to be impacted annually by AI, and it is the young generation who are driving this trend.

Tech-savvy young employees, dubbed Generation AI, have been driving the adoption of generative AI technologies across Asia-Pacific, presenting new challenges and opportunities for employers.
According to a recent report from Deloitte Insights, titled Generative AI in Asia-Pacific: Young employees lead as employers play catch-up, these young employees have been leveraging AI to save work hours, develop new skills, manage workloads more sustainably, and boost productivity.
The report, which surveyed 11,900 individuals in the region, revealed that Generation AI is significantly impacting workplace dynamics. These employees are at the forefront of AI usage, although only half believe their managers are aware of their AI activities. Furthermore, generative AI is projected to affect nearly 1.1 billion work hours annually, representing 17% of total working hours.
In developing countries, the adoption rates of generative AI surpass those in developed economies by 30%, potentially disrupting traditional technology hierarchies. AI users report saving an average of 6.3 hours per week, which they can reinvest in acquiring new skills. Additionally, 41% of those who benefit from these time savings said it has improved their work-life balance.
Despite these advancements, three-quarters of organisations are reportedly lagging in AI adoption, according to their employees.

Chris Lewin, AI & Data Capability Leader at Deloitte Asia-Pacific, commented, “One of the most exciting aspects of working with generative AI is that across the globe it is happening to everything, everywhere, all at once. What we’ve experienced in the last 12 months is that the challenges faced by our clients in Indonesia or India are almost immediately relevant to teams in Italy and Ireland.”
“One key lesson is that the rapid adoption of AI won’t directly eliminate jobs, but the impact will be felt by organisations that fail to adapt. Their employees and in particular, talent new to the workforce, will be drawn to rival organisations offering AI applications that are capable of redrawing the future of modern work.”

 Now, criminals are taking advantage of AI tools to scrape for personal information and make fake job opportunities even harder to spot.TRENDING STORIES:A full litter box is not a reason to call 911, APD says2 dead, 3 injured after single car crashes at Alpharetta intersection2024 NFL schedule release: Here are the first 3 games for the Atlanta FalconsChannel 2 Consumer Investigator Justin Gray looked into how scammers use sites like Indeed, LinkedIn and Facebook to target people.Jessica Brown got an email from what she thought was Synterex, a well-known medical consulting company.The email said,“We reviewed your resume for the Junior Recruiter at Synterex. We think you could be a good fit for the opportunity.”[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]Brown filled out a few screening questions and got an offer of $30 per hour and health benefits to work from home.Brown needed the money. She has a child and her husband recently suffered a severe stroke.“I was vulnerable at that time,” Brown said. “It was hard for me.”All she had to do, according to the “recruitment” letter was cash a nearly $5,000 check to pay for a mini office, including a laptop.The letter said that if Brown was able to work for the company for a period of 12 to 16 weeks, the materials would automatically become hers.Luckily, a bank spotted the situation as a scam right away. But that’s becoming harder to do because of artificial intelligence.Eva Velasquez is the president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, which saw a 545% increase in reports in one month from December to January. Velasquez said that the quality of the fake checks and letters have gotten better because of AI.“It’s a lucrative scam. It doesn’t take any time and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles so it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those AI-generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails. Crooks use AI to scrape your personal information online, then create and send a targeted attack.The real Synterex said they have been digitally impersonated. The FTC said you should verify the job by visiting the official company website and applying there instead.Syterex issued a statement to Channel 2 Action News, writing:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.Suspected burglars use power drill to break into several Atlanta storage units ©2024 Cox Media Group",NewsArticle,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/05-16-2024/t_a9570aa9b7d8410eae763873d9d3bb0d_name_AISCAM.png', 'height': 295, 'width': 439}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Justin Gray'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WSB-TV Channel 2 - Atlanta', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wsbtv.com/pf/resources/images/sites/cmg-tv-10010/station-logo-small.png?d=856', 'width': 270, 'height': 60}}",‘I was vulnerable:’ Artificial Intelligence work-from-home job scams targeting victims  ,2024-05-16T03:30:04.782Z,2024-05-16T03:30:04.931Z,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/scammers-using-ai-take-advantage-job-hunters-heres-what-you-need-know/4S34UYWVM5FFJPTHMOUZGV24TE/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, corporate risk departments are more likely to have already implemented some GenAI tools, and many more say that they plan to do so in the near future. Nonetheless, like their peers, many risk & fraud professionals are proceeding with caution and showing a bit of concern along with their enthusiasm.Not surprisingly, concerns about GenAI’s well-publicized drawbacks, such as those around inaccuracy or privacy, are what is tamping down this enthusiasm, according to the findings of the Thomson Reuters Institute report, 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services. The report surveyed legal, tax, risk, and government professionals about their feelings about the use of GenAI in their respective industries.In fact, the most focal sentiment expressed by risk & fraud professionals surveyed was hesitance about the introduction of GenAI into their industry: More than one-third of respondents (35%) said they were hesitant, and 18% said they were concerned or fearful. In general, it’s understandable that risk mitigation has become a top priority for corporations.While respondents are hopeful and excited about the future of GenAI, the majority are hesitant.For the industry as a whole, however, even the consideration of GenAI tool adoption is still in its infancy — yet, in many areas, corporate risk & fraud professionals are moving first and faster than other professionals. In the survey, for example, only 23% of all respondents said their organization is actively using or has plans to use GenAI — among risk & fraud professionals alone, it’s 30%. And they are the group most likely to say that they are considering the use of GenAI in the near future (41%, compared to 32% of overall respondents). Indeed, it is very likely that risk & fraud professionals currently are, and will be, the first ones to experience the potential gains and challenges of GenAI use.Finding uses for GenAI in their workMore than 80% of corporate risk & fraud professionals said that they already could think of use cases for GenAI in their work. Almost half (49%) said they were hopeful or excited about the possibilities opened up by GenAI-powered tools, compared to 44% of all respondents.Overall, cost reduction and cost savings, as well as increased efficiency, are the top reasons most survey respondents gave for considering GenAI adoption. And at a time when corporate legal, tax, and risk functions are seeking cost reductions and a further streamlining of work processes, GenAI-powered tools are becoming increasingly attractive to achieve those goals.For risk & fraud professionals, the most often cited potential benefits of using GenAI in their work are around gaining ready access to valuable industry insights and being better able to detect fraud trends — mainly through the use of better GenAI-powered data analytic tools.On the other hand, some corporate risk & fraud professionals shared their peers’ top concerns about GenAI, around the accuracy and reliability of GenAI work products.“While generative AI has the potential to be a useful tool, uncontrolled and unthinking use carries significant risks,” said one general counsel within a corporate risk & fraud department, echoing a widespread concern.Organizationally, risk & fraud professionals tend to be more risk averse; however, regarding the adoption of GenAI tools to aid their day-to-day work, these professionals are at the point of the spear, despite some wariness. Among all survey respondents, more than half (54%) said they believed GenAI should be applied to their work, while just 16% said it should not. Yet, more corporate risk & fraud professionals — almost two-thirds (62%) — said GenAI should be applied to their work.The majority of respondents believe that GenAI should be applied to industry work.Clearly, and despite hesitancies and concerns that mirrored their peers with the impact of AI on the future of professionals, corporate risk & fraud professionals have still moved faster to incorporate GenAI tools and remain at the forefront of leveraging this innovative technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness and enhance their value to the organization.Where do corporate risk & fraud professionals go next with GenAI?So far, corporate risk & fraud professionals are not only ahead of their peers in incorporating GenAI, but also in developing education and training around it. Risk & fraud professionals are nearly twice as likely as other professions in the survey to say they have begun education and training activities surrounding the use of GenAI (38%, compared to just 19% of all respondents).When it comes to employee education or training, corporate risk professionals are ahead of their peers.Indeed, part of the reason for this focus on education and training may be to reduce some of the inflated expectations around what GenAI tools can do.One chief legal officer in a corporate risk & fraud function said the industry hesitance is understandable: “[GenAI] can’t replace human reasoning yet may be relied upon to do so.”However, because corporate risk & fraud specialists will likely be first-past-the-post in routine GenAI use, the perceptions and experiences that these professionals have today are of critical importance, especially when it comes to using AI to manage risks. Indeed, their experiences could well shape the speed and specificity of how organizations approach their own GenAI adoption now and in the near future.You can download a full copy of the Thomson Reuters Institute survey report, 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services here.Thomson Reuters is not a consumer reporting agency and none of its services or the data contained therein constitute a ‘consumer report’ as such term is defined in the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. sec. 1681 et seq.

Co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to leave OpenAI, after role in Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring last year

 OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever is leaving the AI pioneer, and has teased a new project that ‘personally meaningful’ to him.
The departure of Ilya Sutskever was confirmed in a blog post by CEO Sam Altman, who described Sutskever as “easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend.”
It comes months after Sutskever had played a role in the shock firing and rehiring of Sam Altman last November.

Ilya Sutskever departure
Sutskever had been on the board of directors that had fired Altman, and soon after he changed his mind and publicly tweeted that he “deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions”, and would do everything he could to reunite the company.
Altman was soon reinstated and Sutskever was removed from the new board of directors.
However there does not seem to any hard feelings between the two men, with Sutskever tweeting it was his decision to leave OpenAI.
“Ilya and OpenAI are going to part ways,” wrote Sam Altman in the blog post. “This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend. His brilliance and vision are well known; his warmth and compassion are less well known but no less important.”
“OpenAI would not be what it is without him,” Altman added. “Although he has something personally meaningful he is going to go work on, I am forever grateful for what he did here and committed to finishing the mission we started together. I am happy that for so long I got to be close to such genuinely remarkable genius, and someone so focused on getting to the best future for humanity.”
OpenAI is appointing Jakub Pachocki as the new Chief Scientist.
Pachocki has previously served as OpenAI’s director of research and led the development of GPT-4 and OpenAI Five.
“Jakub is also easily one of the greatest minds of our generation; I am thrilled he is taking the baton here,” wrote Altman. “He has run many of our most important projects, and I am very confident he will lead us to make rapid and safe progress towards our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits everyone.”
Sutskever has been a notable figure in the AI industry for year now.
Before cofounding OpenAI, he worked as a researcher at Google Brain, but began his career working with Dr Geoffrey Hinton, one of the so-called “godfathers of AI”.
New project
Meanwhile Ilya Sutskever tweeted that it had been a honour and a privilege to work at OpenAI, but he was going to working on a new project that “is very personally meaningful to me.”


Sutskever’s exit comes a day after OpenAI said on Monday that it would release a new AI model called GPT-4o, that features an improved text, video and audio capabilities, as well as a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface.

Researchers discover that 80% of employees ‘bring their own AI’ to work



By Jill Barth

May 16, 2024 

Data indicates that many employees use AI independently at work. However, business leaders may overlook potential opportunities without a strategic plan outlining how artificial intelligence aligns with overall business strategy.

Microsoft and LinkedIn have jointly unveiled the 2024 Work Trend Index report, titled “AI at work is here. Now comes the hard part.” Based on insights from a survey of 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, LinkedIn labor trends, Microsoft 365 productivity data and input from Fortune 500 clients, the report looks at ways AI reshapes global work dynamics.
The report shows a shift from employers simply endorsing casual AI experimentation to leveraging this new technology to achieve concrete business outcomes. This transition represents a typical challenge encountered amid technological disruptions. “AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chairman and CEO. He says the research is an “opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration—and ultimately business outcomes.”
The study findings also reveal a surge in the adoption of generative AI at work, with professionals increasingly showcasing AI skills on their LinkedIn profiles. Moreover, many leaders emphasize the importance of AI proficiency when hiring. However, despite this momentum, there are concerns about the lack of a clear AI strategy within their organizations, compounded by the influx of employee-introduced AI tools.
The report indicates that nearly 80% of AI users are branching out independently, a trend the survey calls “Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI).” This phenomenon creates a data security risk and causes organizations to miss out on the benefits of strategic AI use at scale.
“AI is redefining work, and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. “It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
HR tech in action
Workforce platform Cornerstone introduced Cornerstone Galaxy, an AI-driven platform designed to enhance workforce agility. Spatial learning elements, an AI-powered talent development assistant, data visualizations and more are meant to pinpoint skills gaps and build workforce readiness.

AWS has rolled out Amazon Q, a generative AI assistant tailored to expedite software development and harness internal data within companies. Alongside this debut, AWS introduced Amazon Q Apps, designed to help employees construct generative AI applications using their organization’s data. Jenni Troutman, director of products and services at AWS Training and Certification, told HRE that Amazon’s “AI-ready” commitment will help to bring more diverse skills to workforce populations around the globe. AWS research shows employers are willing to pay an average of 35% more for human resource workers with AI skills.
After nearly a decade of dedicated service, Al Smith will retire from his role as chief technology officer at iCIMS at the end of the summer. During a transition period, Smith—who leaves behind a legacy of impactful contributions—will continue to serve as an advisor. In the wake of Smith’s retirement announcement, Joseph Benjamin will join iCIMS as its new CTO. Benjamin is poised to collaborate closely with Eric Connors, iCIMS’ chief product officer, who recently gained recognition on HRE’s 2024 Top 100 HR Tech Influencer list.

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

But now, a year later, the question isn’t really whether A.I. is too smart and will take over the world. It’s whether A.I. is too stupid and unreliable to be useful. Consider this week’s announcement from OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, who promised he would unveil “new stuff” that “feels like magic to me.” But it was just a rather routine update that makes ChatGPT cheaper and faster.It feels like another sign that A.I. is not even close to living up to its hype. In my eyes, it’s looking less like an all-powerful being and more like a bad intern whose work is so unreliable that it’s often easier to do the task yourself. That realization has real implications for the way we, our employers and our government should deal with Silicon Valley’s latest dazzling new, new thing. Acknowledging A.I.’s flaws could help us invest our resources more efficiently and also allow us to turn our attention toward more realistic solutions.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Julia Angwin, a contributing Opinion writer and the founder of Proof News, writes about tech policy. You can follow her on Twitter or Mastodon or her personal newsletter.

News Release
Biden-Harris administration announces groundbreaking AI principles for worker well-being
WASHINGTON — The Department of Labor today announced the release of a far-reaching set of principles that provide employers and developers that create and deploy artificial intelligence with guidance for designing and implementing these emerging technologies in ways that enhance job quality and protect workers’ rights.Developed as a result of President Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence(link is external), this initiative underscores the administration's commitment to ensuring AI technologies strengthen worker empowerment and well-being while addressing risks to workers.“Workers must be at the heart of our nation’s approach to AI technology development and use,” said Acting Secretary Julie Su. “These principles announced today reflect the Biden-Harris administration’s belief that, in addition to complying with existing laws, artificial intelligence should also enhance the quality of work and life for all workers. As employers and developers implement these principles, we are determined to create a future where technology serves the needs of people above all.Specifically, the AI principles emphasize ethical development; transparency in its use; meaningful worker engagement in system design, use, governance and oversight; protection of workers’ rights; and use of AI to enhance work.The department remains committed to monitoring AI’s impact on the workforce and partnering with companies, unions, and other stakeholders to protect and empower workers. As part of this effort, the department will soon provide employers and developers with best practices to consider as they implement the AI principles.

NASA has given a new role to David Salvagnini as the agency’s Chief Artificial Intelligence (AI) Officer. This is an addition to his current job as Chief Data Officer. The appointment shows NASA’s commitment to using AI technology responsibly.
AI Helps NASA’s Missions
NASA has been using different AI tools for a long time to support its missions and research projects. AI helps analyze data, find patterns, and develop systems that can work on their own to control spacecraft and aircraft.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, “AI has been used safely at NASA for decades, and as it grows, it can speed up discoveries. It’s important that we stay ahead and use AI responsibly. In this new role, David will lead NASA’s efforts to ensure we use AI responsibly in space and on Earth to benefit everyone.”
Following President’s Orders
Salvagnini’s appointment follows President Biden’s order on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI. In his expanded role, Salvagnini will be responsible for the strategic planning and vision for how NASA uses AI across the agency.
Promoting AI Innovation
Salvagnini will champion AI innovation at NASA. He will support the development and risk management of AI tools, platforms, and training. NASA will continue to work with other government agencies, universities, industry partners, and experts to stay at the forefront of AI technology.
Experienced Leader
Salvagnini joined NASA in June 2023 after over 20 years of leadership in technology for the intelligence community. Before NASA, he was the chief architect and director of a group at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Salvagnini has led research, development, engineering, and operations for data, IT, and AI programs. He served in the Air Force for 21 years as a communications and computer systems officer.
AI for Space Exploration
NASA is developing ways to use emerging AI technology for its goals and missions. AI can help analyze images from Earth science, search for data on planets outside our solar system, schedule communications for Mars rovers, and more.
Before Salvagnini, NASA’s Chief Scientist Kate Calvin served as the acting official for responsible AI. With Salvagnini leading AI efforts, NASA aims to embrace new technology responsibly for space exploration and scientific discoveries that benefit humanity.

In 2017, Savannah Thais attended the NeurIPS machine-learning conference in Long Beach, California, hoping to learn about techniques she could use in her doctoral work on electron identification. Instead, she returned home to Yale with a transformed worldview.At NeurIPS, she had listened to a talk by artificial intelligence researcher Kate Crawford, who discussed bias in machine-learning algorithms. She mentioned a new study showing that facial-recognition technology, which uses machine learning, had picked up gender and racial biases from its dataset: Women of color were 32% more likely to be misclassified by the technology than were White men. The study, published as a master’s thesis by Joy Adowaa Buolamwini, became a landmark in the machine-learning world, exposing the ways that seemingly objective algorithms can make errors based on incomplete datasets. And for Thais, who’d been introduced to machine learning through physics, it was a watershed moment.“I didn’t even know about it before,” says Thais, now an associate research scientist at the Columbia University Data Science Institute. “I didn’t know these were issues with the technology, that these things were happening.”After finishing her PhD, Thais pivoted to studying the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in science and in society. Such work often focuses on direct impacts on people, which can seem entirely separate from algorithms designed to, say, identify the signature of a Higgs boson in a particle collision against a mountain of noise. But these issues are interwoven with physics research, too. Algorithmic bias can influence physics results, particularly when machine-learning methods are used inappropriately. And work done for the purpose of physics likely won’t stay in physics. By pushing machine-learning technology ahead for science, physicists are also contributing to its improvement in other areas. “When you’re in a fairly scientific context, and you’re thinking, ‘Oh, we’re building these models to help us do better physics research,’ it’s pretty divorced from any societal implications,” Thais says. “But it’s all really part of the same ecosystem.” Trusting your modelsIn traditional computer models, a human tells the program each parameter it needs to know to make a decision—for example, the information that a proton is lighter than a neutron can help a program tell the two types of particles apart.  Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, are programmed to learn their own parameters from the data they’re given. An algorithm can come up with millions of parameters, each one with its own “phase space,” the set of all possible iterations of that parameter.Algorithms don’t treat every phase space the same way. They weight them differently according to their usefulness to the task the algorithm is trying to accomplish. Because this weighting isn’t decided directly by humans, it is easy to imagine that making decisions by algorithm could be a way to remove human bias. But humans do still add their input to the system, in the form of the dataset that they give the algorithm to train on.In her thesis, Buolamwini analyzed an algorithm that created parameters for facial recognition based on a dataset comprised largely of photos of White people, mostly men. Because the algorithm had a variety of examples of White men, it was able to come up with a good rubric for differentiating between them. Because it had fewer examples of people of other ethnicities and genders, it did a worse job differentiating between them.Facial-recognition technology can be used in a variety of ways. For example, facial-recognition technology can be used to verify someone’s identity; many people use it every day to unlock their smart phones. Buolamwini gives other examples in her thesis, including “developing more empathetic human-machine interactions, monitoring health, and locating missing persons or dangerous criminals.”When facial-recognition technology is used in these contexts, its failure to work equally well for all people can have a range of consequences, from the frustration of being denied access to a convenience, to the danger of being misdiagnosed in a medical setting, to the threat of being falsely identified and arrested. “Characterizing how your model works across phase space is both a scientific and an ethical question,” Thais says.Cosmologist Brian Nord has been thinking about this for years. He began using machine learning in his work in 2016, when he and his colleagues realized machine-learning models could classify objects observed by telescopes. Nord was particularly interested in algorithms that could decode the weirdness of light bending around celestial bodies, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Because such models excel at classifying items based on existing data, they can identify the stars and galaxies in images far better than a human can.But other uses of machine learning for physics are far less trustworthy, says Nord, a scientist in Fermilab’s AI Project Office and Cosmic Physics Center. Where a traditional program has a limited number of parameters that physicists can manually tweak to get correct results, a machine-learning algorithm uses millions of parameters that often don’t correspond to real, physical characteristics—making it impossible for physicists to correct them. “There is no robust way to interpret the errors that come out of an AI method that we can look at in terms of how we think of statistics in physics,” Nord says. “That is not a thing that exists yet.”  If physicists aren’t aware of these issues, they may use models for purposes beyond their capabilities, potentially undermining their results. Nord is working to push machine-learning capabilities to aid with all steps of the scientific process, from identifying testable hypotheses and improving telescope design to simulating data. He envisions a not-too-distant future where the physics community can conceive of, design, and execute large-scale projects in far less time than the decades such experiments currently take. But Nord is also keenly aware of the potential pitfalls of driving machine-learning technology forward. The image-recognition algorithm that enables a cosmologist to distinguish a galaxy cluster from a black hole, Nord points out, is the same technology that can be used to identify a face in a crowd. “If I’m using these tools to do science and I want to make them fundamentally better to do my science, it is highly likely I am going to make it better in other places it’s applied,” Nord says. “I’m essentially building technologies to surveil myself.”Responsibilities and opportunitiesPhysics is behind one of the most famous scientific ethical quandaries: the creation of nuclear weapons. Since the time of the Manhattan Project—the government research program to produce the first atom bomb—scientists have debated the extent to which their involvement in the science behind these weapons equates to a responsibility for their use. In his 1995 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance lecture, physicist Joseph Rotblat, who walked away from the Manhattan Project, appealed directly to scientists’ ethical sensibilities. “At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role, and conduct themselves accordingly,” Rotblat said. He noted that “doing fundamental work, pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge… often you do it without giving much thought to the impact of your work on society.” Thais says she sees the same pattern being repeated among physicists working on artificial intelligence today. There’s rarely a moment in the scientific process when a physicist can pause to consider their work in a larger context.As physicists increasingly learn about machine learning alongside physics, they should also be exposed to ethical frameworks, Thais says. That can happen at conferences and workshops and in training materials online. This past summer, Kazuhiro Terao, a staff scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, organized the 51st SLAC Summer Institute, which centered around the theme “Artificial Intelligence in Fundamental Physics.” He invited speakers on topics such as computer vision, anomaly detection and symmetries. He also asked Thais to address ethics. “It’s important for us to learn not just the hype about AI, but what kinds of things it can do, what kinds of things it can be biased about,” Terao says. Artificial-intelligence ethics research can teach physicists to think in ways that are also useful for physics, Terao says. For example, learning more about bias in machine-learning systems can encourage a healthy scientific skepticism about what such systems can actually do.Ethics research also provides opportunities for physicists to improve the use of machine learning in society as a whole. Physicists can use their technical expertise to educate citizens and policymakers on the technology and its uses and implications, Nord says.And physicists have a unique opportunity to improve the science of machine learning itself, Thais says. That’s because physics data, unlike facial-recognition data, is highly controlled—and there’s a lot of it. Physicists know what kinds of biases exist in their experiments, and they know how to quantify them. That makes physics as a field a perfect “sandbox” for learning to build models that avoid bias, Thais says. But that can only happen if physicists incorporate ethics into their thinking. “We need to be thinking about these questions,” Thais says. “We don’t get to escape the conversation.”

Customers and prospective buyers are gathering in Las Vegas this week for ServiceNow’s annual Knowledge event, where many will be seeking out guidance on how to progress generative AI projects in their organizations.
This time last year ServiceNow was making its early announcements regarding a partnership with NVIDIA and how it saw generative AI impacting enterprise workflows - but 12 months have passed and attendees will now be looking for more practical guidance about the impact of the rapidly advancing technology on their systems and work. 
Just a few weeks ago ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott told financial analysts during the vendor’s quarterly earnings call that process optimization is the “single biggest generative AI use case in the world”, where he believes that the company’s Now Assist tool will play a critical role. However, as diginomica has noted time and time again in recent months, buyers are facing some ridiculously difficult decisions at the moment, in the context of tough macro-economic conditions and in a market that’s progressing at a rapid rate. 
CEOs and board members are being told the generative AI is the future and that companies need to invest, whilst lines of business and technology leaders are being presented with an array of options by their chosen technology partners. With every vendor in the market announcing their own version of what generative AI looks like, and with buyers also having to decide whether it’s worth investing in their own models, it’s a confusing time - where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. 
And so, this week, ServiceNow’s primary objective is to present buyers with a compelling choice about why it is one of the platform choices that is worth pursuing, when it comes to generative AI. No announcements have been made yet, but on the eve of the event diginomica got the chance to speak with ServiceNow’s Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith, to get a better understanding of the choices facing buyers at this moment in time and what they should be thinking about as they make them. 
Smith agrees that enterprises are grappling with difficult decisions, saying that they are being asked to make choices that deliver value quickly. Up until now, he adds, enterprises have fallen into two camps: they’ve either been investing in popular offerings like Microsoft’s Copilot for productivity, or they’ve been taking a scattergun approach with multiple LLMs across multiple pilots. 
However, looking ahead, Smith argues that buyers will likely frame their decision making in a similar way to how cloud purchasing decisions have played out over the longer time - in that a few core platforms will win. He says: 
My personal point of view is it takes just as much corporate effort and energy to run those smaller pilots as it does to go and make a bold platform choice. And I personally believe that the organizations that are making those bets early, will get more gains…real gains.
The pendulum is definitely swinging more in favour of those platform choices. They’ve done the pilots, done some experimentation, they know this stuff works, they know they can derive value from it - but now they need to make some hard choices in terms of who their platform partners are going to be. 

The few that will make the most difference
Smith argues that enterprises have had the past year or so to experiment, but that now it is time for prioritization. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, ServiceNow believes that buyers will look to existing platforms to surface most of the value that they need. Smith says:
Every single week there's a new LLM…only by choosing what you truly want to prioritize are you going to make very very swift progress in this. It’s not that dissimilar to the world when you had a million different collaboration tools out there - but you choose your particular flavour. 

Smith acknowledges that there’s currently a fight in the enterprise software industry to be the ‘compiler’, the platform that mediates and manages all the other generative AI offerings. However, businesses are going to have to choose - and Smith believes that this choice will come down to the platforms that are going to make the most difference to employees and organizations, delivering the most value as quickly as possible. He adds: 
I do see the world coalescing around two or three [platforms] and I'm confident that we're going to be one of those two or three

It could be argued that ServiceNow is well positioned to take advantage of this decision making time amongst buyers, given that its core proposition for the past few years has been that it is the ‘platform of platforms’. McDermott has consistently said that the purchase of the Now platform is not a zero sum game in the cloud industry, given that ServiceNow integrates into systems of record and acts as a unifier across the enterprise to get work done. I expect this proposition will become more critical to the vendor over the coming months and years, as it argues that it can surface enterprise data for generative AI use across all silos. As Smith notes: 
ServiceNow comes along and provides one pane of glass across all, [allowing you to] get work done, as it moves across those different silos. That now goes into the world of generative AI where human language is the primary interface into the business, whether that’s written or spoken - it just amplifies that even more. I can now go into a single pane of glass, or even a single virtual agent, to accomplish all of that work.
All of that automation you've already invested in, all of the digitization and the value you're getting from ServiceNow, you're actually just surfacing that, making it even more useful, because now you're able to call upon it and do it from simple conversational tasks.

My take
It was good to catch up with Smith, who is now leading a large team in the US, framing his go to market strategy around generative AI. I believe his sentiments will likely also frame the coming week at Knowledge ‘24. I expect ServiceNow to argue that its role over the past few years has been to automate the flow of work across the enterprise, by integrating into systems of record, and that it makes sense for buyers to choose its platform as the ‘service-based’ generative AI tool for business, given that already acts as a ‘unifier’. 
If Microsoft or Google are going to ‘own’ generative AI for productivity and collaboration, ServiceNow wants to be the vendor that owns generative AI for work fulfilment and service execution. It’s becoming clear to me that these are how the bubbles will form around generative AI in the industry - which vendor has the best data for the jobs humans currently do in the enterprise? If you use Microsoft or Google for collaboration, they probably have the best data for that. As we saw last week with Qualtrics, it probably has the best data for experience management. Marketing, you’re probably going to look to Adobe or similar. Equally, for service-based work, you’re probably going to look to a vendor like ServiceNow. 
There’s likely lots of change to come, as we saw with the advancements in cloud computing - new vendors and companies emerged as buyers sought out new operating and business models. However, what we should be looking at is: who holds data around specific knowledge tasks? Because it looks like generative AI will now be able to play a big role there and those vendors will be pushing aggressively on that front. And what impact will this have on those roles in the enterprise as a result? 
Plenty more to come over the coming week, so stay tuned to diginomica for all the announcements and analysis from Knowledge, on the ground in Vegas.

Nvidia continues to invest in AI initiatives and the most recent one, ChatRTX, is no exception thanks to its most recent update. ChatRTX is, according to the tech giant, a “demo app that lets you personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) connected to your own content.” This content comprises your PC’s local documents, files, folders, etc., and essentially builds a custom AI chatbox from that information.Because it doesn’t require an internet connection, it gives users speedy access to query answers that might be buried under all those computer files. With the latest update, it has access to even more data and LLMs including Google Gemma and ChatGLM3, an open, bilingual (English and Chinese) LLM. It also can locally search for photos, and has Whisper support, allowing users to converse with ChatRTX through an AI-automated speech recognition program.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksGoVisionaryProfitMan Who Picked Nvidia Before Jump Reveals New PredictionGoVisionaryProfitLearn MoreUndoNvidia uses TensorRT-LLM software and RTX graphics cards to power ChatRTX’s AI.

Can AI escape its ethical dilemma?The concept of an AI chatbot using local data off your PC, instead of training on (read: stealing) other people’s online works, is rather intriguing. It seems to solve the ethical dilemma of using copyrighted works without permission and hoarding it. It also seems to solve another long-term problem that’s plagued many a PC user — actually finding long-buried files in your file explorer, or at least the information trapped within it.However, there’s the obvious question of how the extremely limited data pool could negatively impact the chatbot. Unless the user is particularly skilled at training AI, it could end up becoming a serious issue in the future. Of course, only using it to locate information on your PC is perfectly fine and most likely the proper use. But the point of an AI chatbot is to have unique and meaningful conversations. Maybe there was a time in which we could have done that without the rampant theft, but corporations have powered their AI with stolen words from other sites and now it’s irrevocably tied.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Given that it's highly unethical that data theft is the vital part of the process that allows you to make chats well-rounded enough not to get trapped in feedback loops, it’s possible that Nvidia could be the middle ground for generative AI. If fully developed, it could prove that we don’t need the ethical transgression to power and shape them, so here's to hoping Nvidia can get it right.You might also likeI finally found a practical use for AI, and I may never garden the same againMy jaw hit the floor when I watched an AI master one of the world's toughest gamesI tried to give an AI an existential crisis, and it tricked me into leaving it alone

  There is considerable disagreement about the growth potential of artificial intelligence. Though emerging micro-level evidence shows substantial improvements in firm productivity and worker performance, the macroeconomic effects are uncertain. This column argues that the promise of AI-related economic growth and social welfare hinges on the rate of adoption and its interplay with labour markets. Policies should focus on both domestic and global governance issues – including threats to market competition and increased inequality – and do so rapidly to keep pace with fast-evolving AI.

As the burden of documentation and various other administrative duties has increased, physician burnout has reached historical levels. In response, EHR vendors are embedding generative AI tools to aid physicians by drafting their responses to patient messages. However, there is a lot that we don’t yet know about these tools’ accuracy and effectiveness.
Researchers at Mass General Brigham recently conducted research to learn more about how these generative AI solutions are performing. They published a study last week in The Lancet Digital Health showing that these AI tools can be effective at reducing physicians’ workloads and improving patient education — but also that these tools have limitations that require human oversight.
For the study, the researchers used OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model to produce 100 different hypothetical questions from patients with cancer.

The researchers had GPT-4 answer these questions, as well as six radiation oncologists who responded manually. Then, the research team provided those same six physicians with the GPT-4-generated responses, which they were asked to review and edit.
The oncologists could not tell whether GPT-4 or a human physician had written the responses — and in nearly a third of cases, they believed that a GPT-4-generated response had been written by a physician.
The study showed that physicians usually wrote shorter responses than GPT-4. The large language model’s responses were longer because they usually included more educational information for patients — but at the same time, these responses were also less direct and instructional, the researchers noted.




Overall, the physicians reported that using a large language model to help draft their patient message responses was helpful in reducing their workload and associated burnout. They deemed GPT-4-generated responses to be safe in 82% of cases and acceptable to send with no further editing in 58% of cases.

But it’s important to remember that large language models can be dangerous without a human in the loop. The study also found that 7% of GPT-4-produced responses could pose a risk to the patient if left unedited. Most of the time, this is because the GPT-4-generated response has an “inaccurate conveyance of the urgency with which the patient should come into clinic or be seen by a doctor,” said Dr. Danielle Bitterman, who is an author of the study and Mass General Brigham radiation oncologist.
“These models go through a reinforcement learning process where they are kind of trained to be polite and give responses in a way that a person might want to hear. I think occasionally, they almost become too polite, where they don’t appropriately convey urgency when it is there,” she explained in an interview.




Moving forward, there needs to be more research about how patients feel about large language models being used to interact with them in this way, Dr. Bitterman noted.

                No longer mere ‘infatuation’: Generative AI interest now shapes talent strategy, employers say
            
Talent limitations are slowing down the ability to scale, leaders said, prompting organizational changes.

Many AI-savvy companies are moving past the Generative AI infatuation stage and beginning to make serious changes to turn workplace adoption into a reality, according to an April 29 report from Deloitte’s AI Institute. 
The report, based on a survey of nearly 2,000 director to C-suite leaders who are directly involved in piloting or implementing AI at their organizations, found that three-quarters of leaders said they’re looking to change their talent strategies in the next two years due to generative AI, particularly with a focus on work processes and upskilling or reskilling employees.




















“As we move from possibilities to practicalities in enterprise Generative AI adoption, scaling up and skilling up go hand in hand,” Deborshi Dutt, artificial intelligence strategic growth offering lead and principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP, said in a statement.
“Organizations are hiring new talent and training their workforce, with both technical and human-centered skills remaining valuable to successful deployment,” Dutt said. “To help stay competitive in an ever-evolving market, it is crucial for leaders to foster trust and remain focused on AI fluency when evolving their workforce to meet this moment of transformation.”
Only 37% of respondents said their organizations were slightly or not at all prepared to address talent concerns related to generative AI adoption. In addition, 39% said they plan to increase head count during the next 12 months due to generative AI initiatives.
Leaders pointed to efficiency and productivity as the most anticipated benefits of generative AI adoption, and although many are reporting benefits, most aren’t realizing the full extent so far. 
At the same time, lack of trust continues to be a top barrier to large-scale adoption. Although most leaders reported their organization’s trust in all forms of AI has increased since 2022, only 36% said they measure worker trust and engagement as part of their talent strategy. Beyond that, fewer than half said they’re focused on processes to build trust in generative AI. 
In a Pearl Meyer report, many company leaders said they’re shifting their organizational structure in response to AI adoption at work. They’re making significant AI talent investments, developing change management strategies and implementing employee communication plans.

Amid the shifting AI landscape, talent leaders said they face uncertainty in 2024 due to AI and work design changes, according to a Mercer report. About 40% of HR pros said they have “AI workflows” on their agenda and plan to prioritize ways to redesign work to incorporate AI and automation.
Although 82% of companies appear to be investing in AI, half aren’t sure about the business impact or implementation, according to an Orgvue report. Leaders cited barriers to AI adoption such as a lack of organizational expertise, employee skepticism and lagging regulations.

Nearly 65,000 people were cut from their jobs at U.S. based companies in April according to a report released Thursday by career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas , with continued cuts in the technology sector, a large layoff at Tesla and the replacement of jobs by artificial intelligence largely to blame.

Key Facts


At 64,789, April's job cuts were down significantly from the 90,000 cuts announced in March and slightly down from the 66,995 announced in April of 2023.



So far this year, almost 325,000 jobs have been slashed, down 4.6% from the jobs that had been eliminated by this time last year, according to the report.



Tesla's announcement that it would cut roughly 14,000 employees—about 10% of its workforce—made automotive the single sector with the largest number of cuts last month, and automakers have cut more than 20,000 jobs this year, twice as much as were cut by April of 2023.



Technology remains the sector with the highest number of job cuts on the year at 47,436. Of the cuts across sectors, 800 lost jobs were blamed on AI, the highest number of layoffs citing the reason since May of 2023.


Employers announced plans to hire 9,802 new workers in April, bringing the total number of new jobs announced this year to 46,597, the lowest total in the first four months of the year since 2016.

Surprising Fact
The Challenger report this month said 80 cut jobs could be directly blamed on Texas Senate Bill 17, which prohibited higher education institutions in the state from participating in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Among those cuts were 60 employees who lost their job at the University of Texas alone. The college announced the cuts in a message to campus last month.
PROMOTED
Big Number
5 months. That was the average duration of unemployment in March, compared to 4.4 months during the same period in 2023. Unemployment is expected to rise slightly to 3.9%.
Contra
Despite the slow hiring, the unemployment rate has remained largely unchanged over the last year. Unemployment was 3.8% in March, down slightly from 3.9% in February, but continuing a trend that hasn’t seen the rate rise above 4% in 26 consecutive months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on Friday.

Joanna Andreasson/DALL-E4 The term wicked problem has become a standard way for policy analysts to describe a social issue whose solution is inherently elusive. Wicked problems have many causal factors, complex interdependencies, and no ability to test all of the possible combinations of plausible interventions. Often, the problem itself cannot be articulated in a straightforward, agreed-upon way. Classic examples of wicked problems include climate change, substance abuse, international relations, health care systems, education systems, and economic performance. No matter how far computer science advances, some social problems will remain wicked.

Could that technological advance give bureaucrats the tool they have been missing to allow them to plan a more efficient economy? Many advocates of central planning seem to think so. Their line of thinking appears to be:  Chatbots have absorbed an enormous amount of data. Large amounts of data produce knowledge. Knowledge will enable computers to plan the economy.  These assumptions are wrong. Chatbots have been trained to speak using large volumes of text, but they have not absorbed the knowledge contained in the text. Even if they had, there is knowledge that is critical for economic operations that is not available to a central planner or a computer.

The Promise of Pattern Matching The new chatbots are trained on an enormous amount of text. But they have not absorbed this data in the sense of understanding the meaning of the text. Instead, they have found patterns in the data that enable them to write coherent paragraphs in response to queries. Loosely speaking, there are two approaches to embedding skills and knowledge into computer software. One approach is to hard-code the sort of heuristics that a human being is able to articulate. In chess, this would mean explicitly coding formulas that reflect how people would weigh various factors in order to choose a move. In loan underwriting, it would mean spelling out how an experienced loan officer would regard a borrower's history of late credit-card payments in order to decide whether to make a new loan. The other approach is pattern matching. In chess, that would mean giving the computer a large database of games that have been played, so that it can identify and distinguish positions that tend to result in wins. When the computer then plays the game, it would select moves that create positions that fit a winning pattern. In loan underwriting, pattern matching would mean looking at a large historic sample of approved loans to find characteristics that distinguish the borrowers who subsequently repaid the money from those who subsequently defaulted. It would then recommend approving loans where the credit report resembles the pattern of a borrower who is likely to repay. Human beings use both pattern matching and explicit heuristics. An experienced chess player will not try to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of every single possible move in a position. Instead, the player will immediately recognize a pattern in the position, and this will intuitively suggest a few possible moves. The player will then make a more careful analysis to choose from among those moves. In speed chess, a player relies more on pattern recognition and less on heuristics and careful thought. If you are on a hike, you may instinctively flinch when you see something that resembles the pattern of a snake. But then you will stop and reason about what you see. If it is not moving, you may conclude that it is merely a stick. In American football, the quarterback may call a play based on careful reasoning about what the defense is likely to do in a situation. But once the play starts, the quarterback has to make instantaneous decisions based on what his instinct tells him about what the defense is doing. For these decisions, the quarterback is pattern matching. We tend to pride ourselves on our ability to use heuristics and careful reasoning. When we examine our own thought processes, we do not think of ourselves as mere pattern matchers. But the latest advances in computer science rely heavily on pattern matching. ChatGPT has studied an enormous corpus of text in order to find patterns in how words are used in relation to one another, without having been given any instruction about what the words mean. Many experts, who assumed computers would have to be programmed to know the meaning of words, are surprised that this pattern matching works as well as it does. When you type a comment or a question into ChatGPT, not only will it respond by putting words in proper order; the response is usually meaningful, relevant, and appropriate. It is almost mysterious how this happens. To a chatbot, a word is a mere ""token,"" like a tiny square of cloth with a particular color. All it knows is which squares of cloth tend to appear near each other in the patterns that are in its training dataset. One at a time, it places squares of cloth in a sequence, and when the sequence is read as words it makes sense to a human reader. Pattern matching also works with images. You can give a computer a prompt to draw an image; based on the patterns it finds, it will produce an image that follows the instructions in the prompt. The same pattern-matching technique can be applied to working with computer code, sounds, and video. A Natural Language Revolution These new tools revolutionize the way that people and computers communicate, because now computers can respond to our language. Before, we had to learn the computer's language. The first computers only understood ""machine language,"" consisting of sets of zeroes and ones. An improvement was provided by ""assembly language."" Beyond assembly language were ""programming languages,"" such as COBOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC. About 40 years ago, most of us began communicating via the ""user interface."" We learned to manipulate a cursor and click on a mouse. Later we learned to use gestures on a phone. With ChatGPT, we can communicate with a computer using ""natural language."" We type something in English, and we get a response in English. This is a superpower, and we are just starting to learn how to take advantage of it. I wanted to be able to judge essays based on how well they address differing points of view. Can a computer do this for me? If I had to design, code, and test a program to do so, it would take months of work. But after spending a few hours experimenting with and refining prompts, I can get ChatGPT to perform this essay-grading task. Pattern matching also lets computers respond to and mimic the emotional content of human writing. Chatbots do not merely retrieve information—for that purpose they may actually be less reliable than a Google search. They respond in paragraphs, using human phrasing and tone. Because they communicate in natural language, ChatGPT and its relatives can do impersonations. Economist and public intellectual Tyler Cowen used a chatbot to conduct an ""interview"" with Jonathan Swift, the early 18th century satirist. Prompted to impersonate Swift, the chatbot responded to questions from Cowen. For example, Cowen asked about Swift's attitude toward the Church of Ireland. The chatbot responded, in part: ""Ah, dear reader, it is indeed true that I, Jonathan Swift, harbored a certain degree of skepticism towards religious doctrine. Yet, one must not confuse this skepticism with a lack of faith or an aversion to the church altogether. Indeed, I was ordained a priest in the Church of Ireland, and throughout my life, I served in various capacities within its structure. ""Now, you may wonder how a man of my disposition could reconcile these seemingly contradictory stances,"" it continued. ""The answer, I daresay, lies in the understanding that the church and the state must work in concert to maintain order and stability within society. The Church of Ireland, as an established state church, served as an important institution that promoted social cohesion and provided moral guidance to the people."" Chatbots can impersonate celebrities, therapists, companions, and romantic partners. They are able to connect to us emotionally to an extent that far exceeds any previous computer programs. The implications of this advance may be profound. A few decades ago, math teacher Jaime Escalante became famous for motivating teenagers in a high-poverty school to learn calculus at an Advanced Placement level. His demanding, confrontational style and striking accomplishments were immortalized in a film, Stand and Deliver. Imagine being able to clone Escalante and put him in classrooms across the country. Or consider the problem of training a robot. Today that involves working in computer code, but within a few years we should be able to communicate with robots using natural language. Customer support calls are another area with obvious potential. All of us have experienced the frustration of menu systems (""If you are calling about , press 1""). Thankfully, those systems may soon be obsolete. Instead, a chatbot can quickly catch on to the customer's question or respond sympathetically to the customer's complaint. Some enthusiasts see chatbots becoming lifelong companions. Futurist Peter Diamandis has predicted that ""you'll ultimately give your personal AI assistant access to your phone calls, emails, conversations, cameras…every aspect, of every moment, of your day. Our personal AIs will serve (and we may become dependent upon them) as our cognitive collaborators, our on-demand researcher, our consigliere, our coaches…giving us advice on any and all topics that require unbiased wisdom."" Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has argued similarly that within a few years every child will grow up with a personal chatbot as a lifelong partner. Your personal chatbot would have the ability to understand your abilities and desires. It would be able to motivate you, coach you, train you, and serve you. It is too early to know which of these forecasts will actually pan out and which will fail to materialize, let alone what unexpected uses will appear out of nowhere. This is reminiscent of the World Wide Web circa 1995, when many of us anticipated rapid disruptions in education or the real estate market that have yet to occur. Meanwhile, nobody was predicting real-time driving directions or podcasting. Limited Knowledge Chatbots use pattern matching to provide coherent, relevant responses. But that does not mean that they have encyclopedic knowledge. The answers that a chatbot gives are not necessarily wise. They are not even necessarily true. I have written several papers on the 2008 financial crisis, in which I make a case for what I believe were the most important causal factors. But when I asked ChatGPT to summarize my views on the crisis, it included explanations that are favored by other economists but not me. That is because the chatbot is trained to identify word patterns without knowing what the words mean. Some knowledge is not available in any corpus of data. For example, we cannot predict how an innovation will play out. As of this writing, Apple has introduced a revolutionary product it calls the Vision Pro. No one knows exactly how this product will be used, or whether it will be successful. This knowledge will emerge over time, with the market providing the ultimate judgment. As economist Friedrich Hayek wrote, market competition is a discovery procedure. Even if a computer possessed all of present knowledge, it could not replace this discovery procedure. Central Planning Still Won't Work Economic organization is a wicked problem. Your intuition might be that the best approach would be for a department of experts to determine what goods and services get produced and how they are distributed. This is known as central planning, and it has not worked well in reality. The Soviet Union fell in part because its centrally planned economy could not keep up with the West. Some advocates of central planning have claimed that computers could provide the solution. In a 2017 Financial Times article headlined ""The Big Data revolution can revive the planned economy,"" columnist John Thornhill cited entrepreneur Jack Ma, among others, claiming that eventually a planned economy will be possible. Those with this viewpoint see central planning as an information-processing problem, and computers are now capable of handling much more information than are individual human beings. Might they have a point? F.A. Hayek made a compelling counterargument. In a famous paper called ""The Use of Knowledge in Society,"" first published in 1945, Hayek argued that some information is tacit, meaning that it will never be articulated in a form that can be input to a computer. He also argued that some information is dispersed, meaning that it is known only in small part to any one person. Given the decentralized character of information, a market system generates prices, which in turn generate the knowledge necessary to efficiently organize an economy. A central computer is not going to know how you as an individual would trade off between two goods. You may not be able to articulate your preferences yourself, until you are confronted with a choice at market prices. The computer is not going to know how consumers will respond to a new product or service, and it is not going to know how a new invention might change production patterns. The trial-and-error process of markets, using prices, profits, and losses, addresses these challenges. Economists have a saying that ""all costs are opportunity costs."" That is, the cost of any good is the cost of what you have to forgo in order to obtain it. In other words, cost is not inherent in the nature of the good itself or how it is produced. It is impossible to know the cost of a good until it is traded in the market. If central planners do away with the market, then they will not have the information needed to calculate costs and make good decisions. Forced to use guesswork, planners will inevitably misallocate resources. In a market system, bad decisions result in losses for firms, forcing them to adapt. Without the signals provided by prices, profits, and losses, a central planner's computer will not even be aware of the mistakes that it makes. Learning From Simulations The problem of organizing an economy is too wicked to be solved by computers, whether they use pattern matching or other methods. But that does not mean that advances in computer science will be of no help in improving economic policy. New software tools can be used to create complex simulations. The tools that gave us chatbots could be used to create thousands of synthetic economic ""characters."" We could have them interact according to rules and heuristics designed to mimic various economic policies and institutions, and we could compare how different economic policies affect the outcomes of these simulations. Among economists, this technique is known as ""agent-based modeling."" So far, it has been of only limited value, because it is difficult to create agents that vary along multiple dimensions. But it may be improved if we can use the latest tools to create a richer set of economic characters than what modelers have used in the past. Still, this improvement would be incremental, not revolutionary. They will not permit us to hand off the resource allocation problem to a central computer. The latest techniques for using large datasets and pattern matching offer new and exciting capabilities. But these techniques alone will not enable us to solve society's wicked problems.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence holds the promise of delivering new
waves of efficiency and productivity in the workplace, but it also
carries risk for employers who don't mitigate operational,
reputational, and legal risks associated with unauthorized use.
Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and
Microsoft Copilot are free tools at the fingertips of employees.
Surveys conducted by KPMG and Salesforce have demonstrated that
generative AI is already widely used in Canadian workplaces, often
without employer knowledge.
Without a comprehensive policy governing the internal use of AI,
unauthorized use of AI by employees could jeopardize an
organization's data security, intellectual property, and create
issues of liability and reputational damage.
Generative AI Use in the Workplace
KPMG recently carried out a Generative AI Adoption survey of over
4,500 Canadians which identified that one in five Canadians are
using generative AI daily with 61% percent of generative AI users
using the technology multiple times per week for work purposes.
Salesforce also recently carried out a survey collecting data from 14,000
global workers, including over 1,000 in Canada. The findings show
that 28% of professionals are using generative AI at work, while
55% of these professionals are using AI without approval from their
employers.
While the use of generative AI tools offers significant benefits
such as enhanced efficiency, creativity, and problem-solving
capabilities, it simultaneously introduces a plethora of challenges
and uncertainties, particularly when these tools are integrated
into the workplace.
Employer Concerns with Generative AI
Despite the growing buzz around generative AI, many
organizations remain on the fringes and are contemplating its
integration. In 2023, the Human Resources Professional Association
(HRPA) ran a pulse survey of its membership to
gain insights into their attitudes and behaviours regarding the use
of generative AI technology in the workplace. 205 respondents
across numerous industries participated in the survey.
While 67% of respondents indicated their organizations had no
plans to use generative AI technology, 47% of respondents were
either concerned or potentially concerned about employees using
generative AI in an unauthorized way to carry out their work
tasks.

Workplace – HRPA Survey Report, 2023
While many organizations may not have plans to implement
generative AI, the results of the KPMG and Salesforce surveys
demonstrate that employees may have different ideas.
With the rapidly expanding landscape of artificial intelligence,
one term has increasingly gained attention: Democratized
Generative AI. This term represents a shift from AI being a
tool of the few to a resource of the many. This poses a particular
challenge for employers as free and easy access generative AI tools
means those without technical backgrounds and training have access
to a resource which presents significant risks if misused.
The HRPA reported that those respondents who did have concerns
about unauthorized use of generative AI in the workplace listed
privacy and security risks, lack of originality and plagiarism, and
poor output from the generative AI tools as common reasons.
Risks with Generative AI
Misuse of generative AI by employees can bring about
consequential legal, ethical, and operational risks. A few
illustrative examples include:

Intellectual Property and Data Security:
Without explicit guidelines, employees might unwittingly compromise
sensitive information, leading to legal, financial, and
reputational damage.
Ethical and Legal Concerns: The absence of
ethical guidelines could result in the creation of content that
infringes on copyright laws or perpetuates bias, attracting legal
scrutiny and eroding public trust.
Operational Inefficiency: A lack of coherent
AI use policy may result in inconsistent and inefficient
operations, diminishing the potential benefits of generative AI
technologies.

Despite 47% of respondents expressing concerns about employees
using generative AI in the workplace, only 0.5% of respondents
reported that their organizations had a formal policy in place
addressing the use of generative AI in the workplace.

Workplace – HRPA Survey Report, 2023
Regardless of whether an organization aims to use generative AI
in their operations, the vast number of tools currently available
are particularly appealing to employees, meaning that organizations
may have exposure to the risks presented by generative AI without
realizing it. This presents a critical blind spot in organizational
strategies.
Implementing Generative AI in the Workplace
Implementing a comprehensive Generative AI Workplace Policy not
only mitigates legal and operation risks but ensures ethical use,
protecting the organization's intellectual property and data
security. It offers a framework for maximizing the benefits of
generative AI while maintaining control over its deployment and
usage.
The planned implementation of Canada's Artificial
Intelligence Data Act (AIDA) underscores the urgency for employers
to recognize and address the use of generative AI in the workplace.
AIDA is anticipated to introduce a risk-based regulatory framework,
mandating that employers assess and mitigate risks associated with
high-impact AI systems – which could include generative AI
tools employed by staff. With requirements for transparency, data
anonymization, and robust accountability frameworks, AIDA will
likely significantly sharpen the legal and ethical responsibilities
surrounding AI. Notably, it is planned that the Act will carry
substantial penalties for non-compliance, emphasizing the legal and
financial imperatives of managing AI use.
The discrepancy between an employer's perceived and actual
risk exposure is particularly relevant here; even if a business
does not officially deploy generative AI, it may still be liable
for its employees' use of such technologies. Therefore,
developing comprehensive AI governance policies is not just prudent
– it is necessary to navigate the intricate landscape AIDA
will soon establish.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general
guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought
about your specific circumstances.

Revised by Generative AI, Written and Reviewed by Humans.  At last week’s Biomedical HIV Prevention Summit in Seattle, Washington (hosted by NMAC), HIV.gov facilitated a workshop on the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Washington State Department of Health’s Director of Communications, Maranatha Hay. The workshop, Generative AI for Extending the Reach of HIV Communications Work, provided over 100 Summit attendees with information regarding how Generative AI has the potential to extend the work of the HIV community. Immediately following the workshop, Maranatha shared, via a video conversation, some strategies for using Generative AI. We also had a conversation with Harold Philips, MRP, NMAC’s Deputy Director of Programs, about the importance of exploring these tools. (You can watch it at the top fo this article and on YouTube.)   Workshop Reflections As Maranatha recapped the workshop, she encouraged individuals to start trying out these tools. She continued, “we are currently in this […] new […] world where AI is so brand new, but right now we are writing the future of what’s to come.” She also noted, “we need a variety of people with a variety of different backgrounds—perspectives—to come to the table,” when developing and using Generative AI.  Miguel Gomez, Director of HIV.gov, stressed, “Please do the homework. Check with those you work with and those you serve and see if Generative AI tools can help you extend your reach and the reach of us as an HIV community.”  Later that day, Miguel had a conversation with Harold on his perspective about this exciting and quickly evolving tool.  Harold’s Insights on Generative AI Use in HIV Work In the video, Harold shared that “Generative AI is a really important tool […] that can help us address our workforce and workflow issues when it comes to HIV service delivery, HIV prevention, and HIV treatment.” He followed this by saying he’s excited about using the tools, and he encouraged HIV service organizations, particularly those that serve people of color to “think about what the role of AI is in addressing health disparities.”  To learn more about HIV.gov’s use of Generative AI, check out our December 2023 blog. Also, stay tuned to HIV.gov, as we share more insights from the Biomedical HIV Prevention Summit. Be sure to follow us on our social media channels (Facebook, X, and Instagram) to stay abreast of the different topics of interest to the HIV community.   This blog post was published April 25, 2024, on HIV.gov.

While the guidance is addressed to federal contractors, all private-sector employers using or considering using artificial intelligence should pay attention. The guidance makes clear that long-standing nondiscrimination principles fully apply to AI and outlines “Promising Practices” designed to mitigate AI risks in employment, including the risk of unlawful bias from the use of AI. While not a binding standard, the Department of Labor’s issuance of these “Promising Practices” demonstrates regulators’ evolving expectations surrounding employers’ use of AI. 
President Biden’s comprehensive Executive Order on AI, issued in October 2023, directed multiple federal agencies to issue AI-related guidance.[1] As part of this “whole of government” approach, the Department of Labor was specifically tasked with publishing guidance for federal contractors on “nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.”
The April 29 AI guidance issued by the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) consists of two parts: (1) a Q&A section addressing how OFCCP will apply existing nondiscrimination laws to AI tools, and (2) a list of “Promising Practices” for the development and use of AI in employment.
While the Department of Labor’s guidance is specifically addressed to federal contractors, it has far-reaching implications for employers generally, not just federal contractors. Consistent with the EEOC’s position, the guidance makes clear that long-standing nondiscrimination principles fully apply to AI, and the “Promising Practices” represent OFCCP’s attempt to capture best practices for mitigating AI risks in employment, drawing from the prior work of stakeholders in the responsible AI ecosystem. While not a binding standard, OFCCP’s issuance of these “Promising Practices” represents a significant marker of the evolving expectations surrounding employers’ use of AI.
Applying Existing Laws to AI: OFCCP Reinforces Foundational Principles
In the Q&A portion of the guidance, OFCCP makes clear that federal contractors are fully responsible for affirmatively ensuring their AI tools comply with existing nondiscrimination laws. The agency also emphasizes federal contractors’ obligations to maintain records related to AI tools, and reminds contractors that their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations extends to the contractor’s use of automated systems. OFCCP also explains how it will use its existing authorities to investigate federal contractors’ use of AI in employment decisions. Key takeaways include:

AI tools can constitute “selection procedures” subject to OFCCP's existing regulations. Consistent with prior statements from OFCCP in 2019[2] and the EEOC in May 2023,[3] OFCCP again emphasizes and confirms that AI-based tools used to make employment decisions can be “selection procedures” under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) from 1978, and validation processes required under UGESP.
Reasonable accommodations obligations fully apply. Federal contractors must make reasonable accommodations to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal access to jobs, including in the contractor's use of AI-based selection procedures.
Employers are responsible for their AI tools, whether they developed them themselves or if they are using an AI vendor. OFCCP unambiguously warns that federal contractors cannot delegate or avoid their nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations by using third-party AI products. During an OFCCP audit, contractors must be able to provide the information and records needed for OFCCP to assess compliance, including information about the impact and validity of AI-based selection procedures. In addition, information regarding the design of tool as well as information regarding whether alternative approaches were considered and tested for adverse impact may be requested during audits.  

While these principles are not new, OFCCP’s firm stance serves as a call-to-action for employers to proactively examine their use of AI. As OFCCP Acting Director Michelle Hodge recently warned, federal contractors “can't just pull something off the shelf and decide to use it” without ensuring compliance with OFCCP regulations. Just like federal contractors should not rely solely on an affirmative defense of, “I thought my AI vendor was handling that,” private-sector employers should be mindful of these evolving standards and how these defenses may be received if accusations of unlawful bias from the use of AI arise. Now is an excellent time for employers using AI – whether or not they are federal contractors – to work closely with trusted legal counsel to develop a comprehensive approach to AI risk management.
OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” Reflect an Evolving Consensus on AI Risk Management
The “Promising Practices” portion of OFCCP's guidance outlines recommendations to help federal contractors “avoid potential harm to workers and promote trustworthy development and use of AI.” These recommendations span the AI lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring, and include “big picture” concepts like the creation of internal AI governance frameworks. Many of the practices identified in the “Promising Practices” closely align with concepts from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI Risk Management Framework.
OFCCP’s guidance acknowledges that these “Promising Practices” are “not expressly required,” and that it is “not an exhaustive list but rather an initial framework"" and further cautions that ""the rapid advancement and adoption of AI in the employment context means that these practices will evolve over time.""
Despite their non-mandatory nature, employers should not ignore OFCCP’s guidance. In that regard, the impact of OFCCP's April 29 “Promising Practices” on employer behavior may follow a trajectory similar to the EEOC’s 2017 “Promising Practices” for preventing harassment, which had a significant impact on the way employers thought about harassment prevention. By 2017, some proactive employers had already implemented policies and procedures aligned with the EEOC’s recommendations. But with the #MeToo movement contemporaneously gaining momentum in late 2017, increased public awareness of harassment and demand for action prompted further employer action. This provided the impetus for some employers to re-evaluate and revise their harassment policies and training programs to align with the EEOC’s recommendations. The ultimate goal was to prompt the implementation of more proactive, comprehensive, and systemic approaches to preventing harassment, rather than relying solely on reactive measures like complaint reporting and investigations.
OFCCP may be hoping that its “Promising Practices” on AI will follow a similar trajectory. Like the EEOC’s 2017 effort on harassment, OFCCP's AI ""Promising Practices"" did not emerge from thin air; they reflect principles identified by various stakeholders, contain similar themes articulated in the White House’s recently issued guidance to federal agencies, emphasizing the need for “stakeholder engagement, validation and monitoring, and greater transparency” in the federal government’s own use of AI, and closely align with NIST AI RMF, which has gained significant traction as a foundational resource for organizations seeking to manage AI risk.
Key themes and recommendations in OFCCP's “Promising Practices” include:

Transparency and notice to employees and applicants. OFCCP advises federal contractors to provide clear notice about their use of AI, what data is being collected, and how employment decisions are being made.
Stakeholder engagement. OFCCP advises federal contractors to consult with employees and/or their representatives in the design and deployment of AI systems.
Fairness assessments and ongoing monitoring. OFCCP advises federal contractors to analyze AI tools for discriminatory impact before use, at regular intervals during use, and after use. Where issues are identified, OFCCP advises employers to take steps to reduce adverse impact or consider alternative practices. While some of this advice may sound obvious to those experienced in AI risk management, OFCCP’s inclusion of these concepts emphasizes their importance.  Likewise, OFCCP also advises employers to ensure meaningful human oversight of AI-based decisions. While OFCCP does not provide greater clarity regarding how it might be defining “meaningful human oversight,” the inclusion of this concept in OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” invites contractors and employers to examine and consider how human oversight mechanisms may or may not be present in their existing AI processes.
Documentation and recordkeeping. OFCCP advises federal contractors to retain information about the data used to develop AI systems, the basis for decision-making, and the results of any fairness assessments or monitoring.
Vendor management. OFCCP advises federal contractors to carefully vet AI vendors. Among other things, OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” discuss the desirability of verifying the source and quality of the data being collected and analyzed by the AI system, the vendor's data protection and privacy policies, and critical information about the vendor's algorithmic decision-making tool, such as the screening criteria, the predictive nature of the system, and any differences between the data used for training and validation and the actual candidate pool. OFCCP also discusses the desirability of having access to the results of any assessment of system bias, debiasing efforts, and/or any study of system fairness conducted by the vendor and cautions that relying on vendor assurances alone is not enough – emphasizing the importance of being able to verify key information about the vendor's practices.
Accessibility for individuals with disabilities. OFCCP advises federal contractors to ensure AI systems are accessible, allow for reasonable accommodation requests, and accurately measure job-related skills regardless of disability.

As federal contractors or other employers consider whether changes to their AI risk management practices are warranted in light of OFCCP’s issuance of these “Promising Practices”, contractors and employers should be mindful of legislative activity mandating or otherwise incentivizing employers to implement an AI risk management framework similar to the “Promising Practices” described in OFCCP’s guidance.  OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” are not mandatory, but aspects of them may soon be mandatory under future legislative or regulatory efforts.[4]
Implications for Employers
Federal contractors and private-sector employers should expect continued coordination between OFCCP, EEOC and other enforcement agencies on AI issues. While OFCCP’s April 29 AI guidance is addressed to federal contractors, OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” reflect progress toward regulatory consensus regarding AI risk management, and their issuance invites both federal contractors and other employers to evaluate their existing AI risk management practices and to consider whether further proactive processes may be warranted or desirable.

[4] For instance, the version of Connecticut SB2 passed on April 24, 2024 by the Connecticut Senate specifically requires deployers of “high-risk” AI systems to implement a risk-management policy and program, and makes specific reference to the NIST AI RMF. Likewise, legislation introduced in California (AB 2390), New York (S5641A), Illinois (HB 5116), Rhode Island (H 7521), Washington (HB 1951) contain similar language mandating AI deployers to implement a governance program that contains reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to map, measure, manage, and govern the reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination – concepts that are core to the NIST AI RMF. Additionally, on May 3, 2024, Colorado SB 205, a bill with similar legislative language, passed the Colorado Senate.

New NSF grant targets large language models and generative AI, exploring how they work and implications for societal impacts



May 2, 2024





The U.S. National Science Foundation has announced a grant of $9 million to Northeastern University for research to investigate how large language models (LLMs) and generative AI operate, focusing on the computing process called deep inference and AI’s long-term societal impacts.The research seeks to establish a National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF), a collaborative research platform. The goal is to provide U.S. researchers with access to cutting-edge LLMs within a transparent experimental platform that reveals the systems’ internal computations — a capability currently unavailable in academia.“Chatbots have transformed society’s relationship with AI, but how they operate is yet to be fully understood”, said Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the U.S. National Science Foundation. “With NDIF, U.S. researchers will be able peer inside the ‘black box’ of large language models, gaining new insights into how they operate and greater awareness of their potential impacts on society.”LLMs, such as those behind chatbots like ChatGPT, have emerged as a transformative force in AI with profound capabilities including general-purpose knowledge and language skills. However, their sheer size — often more than 100 billion parameters — poses a significant challenge for researchers investigating how the systems operate, especially without adequate computing resources.The NDIF project aims to address that gap by creating a platform for exploring such large-scale AI systems. NDIF will leverage the resources of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications DeltaAI project, a high-capacity AI-focused cluster in the NSF computing portfolio that combines high-performance data processing and high-speed storage, ideal for designing and deploying new software resources to study LLM inference.The broader impacts of the NDIF project extend beyond academia. The project has significant implications for a range of scientific disciplines, including computing, medicine, neuroscience, linguistics, social sciences and the humanities.""In the always evolving realm of emerging technologies like AI, understanding the inner workings of LLMs is paramount,” said Dilma DaSilva, NSF's acting assistant director for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. “As we navigate the complexities of these transformative systems, we must ensure transparency and accountability, paving the way for inclusive and beneficial applications of AI-powered solutions. This investment in deep inference research not only empowers academic exploration, it fosters a culture of ethical and responsible AI development.""NDIF will actively collaborate with public interest technology groups to ensure that innovations in AI uphold principles of ethics, transparency and social responsibility in the deployment of LLMs.""Understanding the mechanisms behind the strength of modern LLMs is one of the most pressing mysteries facing scientists today, raising fundamental questions about cognition as well as the many societal impacts of AI,"" said David Bau, principal investigator and assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University. ""NDIF defines a new, fully transparent way to access the largest models that is both powerful and cost-effective. It will democratize scientific access to the largest open AI models.""In addition, the project will help build a next-generation, AI-enabled workforce by providing comprehensive training to students and equipping them to serve as networks of experts. NDIF will support and train graduate students in AI, disseminate educational materials for university and professional use, and make tools for the science of large-scale AI widely available to users in other disciplines.“NDIF will create a research framework that helps the research community explore the factors that ensure LLMs are safe and secure, which aligns with the goals of the White House Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,” said Eleni Miltsakaki, the NSF program director for NDIF. “Launching NDIF will break new ground in the scientific study of very large language models, equipping researchers with deep inferencing tools that will enable them to study the internal mechanisms of these models. This investment in knowledge itself will unlock important research problems in every field impacted by large-scale AI.""

A May 1 symposium convened by Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) considered the many ways AI is already changing the nature of academic research, teaching, and administration.  | PHOTOGRAPH BY JS/HARVARD MAGAZINE


























How is artificial intelligence reshaping the notion of original scholarship? How are faculty using the technology in their research and teaching, and what are administrators doing with the tools to streamline their work? A May 1 symposium convened by Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) considered the many ways AI is already changing the nature of academic research, teaching, and administration. Because large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have initiated dramatic upheavals in the way students and faculty acquire and process information, even the Harvard Library, as a trusted curator of knowledge, must respond. Preeminent library collections like Harvard’s could play an important role in future iterations of LLMs, once the legal issues surrounding fair use of copyrighted materials are settled.





FAS dean Hopi Hoekstra reflected on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI during the past nine months. “We’ve been investing in the positives,” she said “looking for all the ways that we can channel this powerful technology to create a better world, from the sciences to the arts.” Paul professor of the practice of government and technology Latanya Sweeney, who has co-chaired the FAS Artificial Intelligence Systems Working Group since the summer of 2023, emphasized in her introductory remarks that “this is a pivotal moment for all of us in society,” and—on the same day that Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, spoke in Memorial Church—urged community engagement and collaboration to help shape AI’s future impact. Students in two of Sweeney’s classes, Government 1430, “Tech Science to Save the World,” and Democracy, Politics, and Institutions 642, “Grand Challenges in Technology-Society Clashes,” presented posters of their coursework during the break between sessions.Original Scholarship in an AI WorldThe day opened with a panel discussion on the meaning of original scholarship in the age of AI. The speakers brought their distinct disciplinary perspectives to the question of what constitutes original work, and what represents acceptable use of AI tools.





Providing an historical perspective, professor of the history of science Alex Csiszar began by questioning the idea that authorship itself is a stable notion. Shifts in the understanding of what it means to publish an original text, including the twentieth-century emergence of “contributorship” on scientific papers with a large number of authors, suggest that while AI may accelerate the need for new models to meet the needs of a highly collaborative digital era, the unattributed, digest-like forms in which ChatGPT presents information are not new. Commonplace books of the seventeenth century, he explained, gathered quotations and information from “all over the place” without attribution. AI will “not necessarily revolutionize anything,” he said, “but it’s going to force us to take seriously a whole bunch of problems that already existed.”Kingsley professor of art, film and visual studies David Joselit said that similar questions arose in the arts when technologies such as photography and film became ubiquitous. He advocated for understanding AI not just as a tool but as a genre that will reshape creative and scholarly outputs. And he called for critical engagement with the training data used to create LLMs, pointing to their highly curated nature and potential biases.Furer professor of economics Melissa Dell highlighted the problem of duplication of original material—one that is poised to become much worse as LLMs parrot and essentially replicate existing information without citing sources. She highlighted the important role that libraries (the subject of a later session—see below) could play to counteract that diluting effect: “How do we get the information that’s in Widener, buried, and in the offsite storage,” she asked, and work out the legal obstacles to “make it all accessible” which will enhance scholarship in social science disciplines?





Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor Mike Smith, Finley professor of engineering and applied sciences, a computer scientist, suggested taking a practical approach to the use of AI in student work in his field. He views the tool as a means of enhancing scholarly work, without necessarily altering the nature of authorship. In his own courses, Smith said, he encourages the use of AI, but emphasized the importance of dialogue between students and instructors to ensure that the tool supplements, rather than defeats, the engagement of students in their own learning.Research, Teaching, Administration, and TrainingThat featured opening panel was followed by three concurrent sessions on the use of AI: in faculty research; in teaching tools and innovation; and in the practical preparation of undergraduates and doctoral candidates alike for a world transformed by AI-driven change.Faculty researchers highlighted the fact that ChatGPT allows users to make natural language queries—the form of questions posed most often to Google—of large, complex databases. The technology is also useful for generating new ideas and predicting human preferences, including for political issues and candidates. Moncher professor of astronomy Christopher Stubbs, who is Hoekstra’s special adviser for AI, described how he has used AI to automate tasks, analyze data, generate code, and even predict the windspeed at a telescope in Chile that produces blurred images in heavy wind. (Selected students from his course, General Education 1188: “Rise of the Machines? Understanding and Using Generative AI,” presented their final projects later in the day.) Assistant professor of computer science Stephanie Gil hailed the utility of generative AI for improving the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles and robots.





In the realm of pedagogy, innovative uses abound. One professor has begun using AI models to analyze how ballet has changed over time. And Harvard’s information technology services organization (HUIT) has developed a specialized tutor bot that runs on Slack, a messaging tool. The bot uses “retrieval-augmented generation” to provide accurate information to students: instructors can upload documents, papers, and readings, and the bot will draw upon that information, citing its sources when answering questions.Administrators at the symposium described how they have used AI to make transcripts of meetings (recorded with participant assent), generate high-level summaries, and highlight action items that need to be followed up. Strategic director of endowment and gifts Naveen Reddy gave a particularly memorable example when he described creating a custom GPT model to help him manage Harvard’s 8,000 restricted-use endowment funds. The original donors earmarked their gifts for specific uses, and Reddy’s role is to help the University advance its teaching and research mission by allocating the funds appropriately and efficiently. The gift terms were in one Excel spreadsheet, balances in another, and prior year expenditures in yet another database. Reddy provided this information to his GPT model, and can now make natural language queries to quickly query multiple datasets through a single interface.Among the fascinating presentations were several by leaders of the Harvard Library, one of the world’s largest. University librarian Martha Whitehead began by drawing a parallel between generative AI and research libraries, noting that both “draw upon a broad corpus of existing information to answer questions and generate new information.” The fundamental value of the Harvard Library, she continued, is that it provides “access to trustworthy information spanning centuries, regions, and voices around the globe.” And part of the library’s aspiration is to make their curated datasets available through LLM-enabled interfaces. The library aims to do so in the same spirit that it makes the pre-1923 Google Books corpus available—and according to similar legal reasoning: the library can share its legally acquired collection with students and researchers according to the principles of fair use. “We’re immersed in the ethics of information,” Whitehead emphasized, from intellectual property, to copyright, to plagiarism: what director of copyright and information policy Kyle Courtney has referred to—tongue-in-cheek—as “copyright’s close cousin.”





Other presentations covered patterns of student AI use (by the fall of 2023, 65 percent of surveyed students said they had used or planned to use generative AI for academic work, 80 percent using ChatGPT specifically); legal aspects of copyrighted information (libraries, with their vast and legitimate content collections, are well-positioned to support the ethical development of AI technologies, although the legal landscape will evolve slowly); and a pilot project that allows patrons to “Talk to HOLLIS,” the library’s online catalog.“The grand challenge for the Harvard Library,” concluded associate University librarian and managing director for library technology Stu Snydman, “is to enable researchers and students to find the right content when needed to support world-class research, teaching, and learning, amidst a massive and ever-growing sea of information. And to ensure that users have confidence that the Library is connecting them to trustworthy sources.” The challenges facing libraries in an age of AI are a microcosm of those confronting institutions of higher learning: how to ensure that they advance knowledge and educate students who will bring an informed and ethical perspective to their contributions to society. The FAS symposium was one of many efforts underway across the University in pursuit of those aims.

How Dice Can Help
There are key elements to what makes any city a “tech hub,” including how many tech or tech-focused companies have headquarters or offices there, how many tech jobs are available in the locale on average, and what these cities do to specifically attract tech talent. The meteoric rise of generative AI all but ensures there will be another layer added on top, with some cities doing everything they can to vie for the hottest AI and ML talent available now.
It's important to remember that, just like every company today is a technology today, you don’t have to live in a “tech hub” to have a successful career as a tech professional. After all, your career is a deeply intimate, personal thing. It’s something that’s very uniquely “you,” and that means “success” is defined by how where you live and the work you do fits in with your most important personal and professional goals. Setting all else aside, you make these decisions the right ones more so than what the city can provide.
So how you decide what you really want, need and value in your tech career? Start with Dice, the only tech career marketplace designed exclusively for tech professionals. We create content each week to highlight both the established and emerging tech hubs around the country (including what makes them attractive for tech professionals), what to look for when evaluating tech jobs and companies, the top AI and ML skills you can use to position yourself for your next role, how to set attainable and realistic career goals, and so much more.

DOL’s Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs released guidance documents governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace.
The documents address employers’ and federal contractors’ potential legal and business risks associated with AI, and provide recommended practices to help avoid them.





On April 29, 2024, the White House released a statement entitled, “Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces Key AI Actions 180 Days Following President Biden’s Landmark Executive Order.” A few hours later, the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) released guidance documents about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. Both sets of guidance documents were issued following President Biden’s Executive Order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” (“AI Executive Order”) issued on October 30, 2023. Specifically, the AI Executive Order directed these agencies within DOL to develop best practices for employers, agencies, and federal contractors.
WHD Guidance. The AI Executive Order directed DOL to “issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq., and other legal requirements.” WHD’s AI guidance was issued as a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB). According to WHD, FABs aim to “provide [WHD] investigators and staff with guidance on enforcement positions and clarification of policies or changes in the policy of WHD.”1
The thrust of the FAB is that employers are responsible for ensuring employees are properly paid if AI tools are used for scheduling, timekeeping, employee tracking purposes, or calculating wages owed. The FAB identifies certain recommended practices such as ensuring proper human oversight to make sure that any AI tools or systems—when used to track/monitor work, break, and waiting times—pay employees the applicable minimum wage and accurately calculate and pay an employee’s regular rate and overtime premium.
In addition to FLSA risks, the FAB also addresses risks that might arise under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) if employers use AI for processing leave requests. The FAB briefly explains that the use of AI tools to administer FMLA leave can create potential risks of violating the FMLA’s certification requirements for determining whether leave is FMLA-qualifying. Moreover, the FAB notes that AI tools used “to track leave use may not be used to target FMLA leave users for retaliation or discourage the use of such leave.”
The FAB also addresses certain risks that might arise under the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act (PUMP Act), which requires covered employers to provide nursing employees with reasonable break time and space to express breast milk while at work. The FAB states that AI tools or systems that restrict or penalize employees for taking pump breaks (e.g., by limiting break length or frequency), penalizing productivity, or requiring makeup hours, would be illegal under FLSA.
In addition, the FAB addresses the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, which generally prohibits employers from using polygraph tests for applicants. The guidance explains that AI tools such as eye-tracking and voice-monitoring software, which are intended to gauge “truthfulness,” might qualify as polygraph tests. In that case, they would be regulated in the same manner as more traditional polygraph tests.
Finally, the FAB recognizes that, while AI tools may commonly be used to manage many aspects of employees’ work, the use of such tools to surveil the workforce for protected activity and to take adverse action could violate anti-retaliation laws.
The FAB concludes by acknowledging that “[w]hen used responsibly, AI has the potential to help improve compliance with the law.” WHD reinforces that “employers must ensure the responsible use of AI in order to continue to comply with the laws WHD enforces.”
The FAB has several notable shortcomings. First, it was not subject to public notice-and-comment. Indeed, the FAB fails to cite any resources WHD relied upon in making its assertions about how employers are using AI.
Second, it does not address other areas of FLSA concerns in the age of AI. Perhaps most notably, some have argued that the use of AI and algorithmic technologies may fundamentally alter workers’ primary duties, thus impacting FLSA exemption status.2
Third, WHD ignores the employer-vendor relationship. Employers usually engage third-party software vendors that develop and sell the AI-powered tools, which are then used to perform a wide variety of employment tasks. The FAB ignores this reality, which reinforces why notice-and-comment is so important for any actions on AI.
Fourth, the FAB reflects the Biden administration’s “whole of government” approach to promote a pro-union agenda across the entire spectrum of the government. This “whole of government” approach has relied on executive orders, interagency task forces, councils, interagency agreements, individual agency actions such as rulemaking and enforcement strategies, attempts to influence Congress, and a variety of other means to achieve a pro-union agenda. The FAB notes, without any reason or citation, that “employers have reportedly created systems to predict the likelihood that particular locations will unionize based on employee surveys and data analytics.” The FAB further states in a footnote that “[t]he use of electronic monitoring or AI systems to identify organizing activity may raise compliance challenges under the National Labor Relations Act” and cites a memorandum issued by the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. WHD does not enforce the National Labor Relations Act, however, nor has it entered into an interagency agreement on AI with the National Labor Relations Board.
OFCCP Guidance. President Biden’s AI Executive Order also directed DOL to “publish guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.” In line with this mandate, the OFCCP issued guidance addressing AI in the federal anti-discrimination context vis-à-vis obligations enforced by OFCCP. As an initial matter, the OFCCP’s guidance addresses primarily federal contractors’ use of predictive AI, as opposed to generative AI, which is a type of AI that can create new content. Indeed, AI is defined in the OFCCP’s guidance, in relevant part, as “a machine-based system that can … make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.”
While acknowledging the benefits that may be conferred in terms of efficiency and productivity when leveraging AI systems in employment decisions, OFCCP emphasizes that federal contractors’ EEO obligations not to discriminate in employment extend to their use of AI in employment decisions. Federal contractors’ compliance obligations related to AI include:

Maintaining and ensuring confidentiality of records consistent with all OFCCP regulatory requirements;
Cooperating with OFCCP by provided information on their AI systems;
Reasonably accommodating known disability of otherwise qualified applicants or employees unless doing so is an undue hardship;
When a selection procedure, including one utilizing AI, results in an adverse impact3 on a protected group, validating the systems in accordance with applicable OFCCP-enforced non-discrimination laws and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP); and
Being responsible, i.e., not delegating non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations, for use of third-party products and services, including AI screening tools.

OFCCP emphasizes that because improperly designed or implemented AI may perpetuate bias and discrimination in the workplace, federal contractors using these systems in employment decisions must be aware of the risk of infringing on workers’ civil rights.
OFCCP confirms that it will investigate federal contractors’ use of AI during compliance evaluations and complaint investigations to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination obligations.
Finally, OFCCP’s guidance impresses that, whenever AI systems are being used in the employment lifecycle, federal contractors should possess a baseline understanding of the system’s design, development, intended use, and consequences. To that end, OFCCP outlines several of what it considers best practices pertaining to disclosure of use to applicants and employees; use of the AI system; vetting third-party vendor AI systems; and prioritizing accessibility and disability inclusion.
Many of OFCCP’s recommendations reflect recent legislative efforts at regulating AI. For instance, the guidance document suggests that contractors must regularly assess their AI tools for potential bias and maintain records of the assessments. This same requirement is already the law in New York City and has generally appeared in state proposals across the country.
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The White House’s announcement claims that the administration has “[r]eleased resources for job seekers, workers, and tech vendors and creators on how AI use could violate employment discrimination laws” since the AI Executive Order was issued in October. But the EEOC has not issued any AI guidance in about a year. Indeed, the EEOC has not released any resources within the 180 days of the AI Executive Order. It is also worth noting that none of the EEOC’s guidance documents have been voted on by the full Commission or subject to notice-and-comment.
Conclusion
Ultimately, the White House’s announcement and DOL’s guidance documents show how the administration is attempting to regulate AI without new legislation from Congress. More AI guidance is expected in the future, including a DOL report on how the government can support workers displaced by AI. The AI Executive Order directed DOL to issue the report by the end of April, but DOL has not yet issued the report.
The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape requires that employers and their compliance counsel remain especially attentive to current and developing legal authority regarding the use of AI in the workplace. Relatedly, employers and federal contractors should ensure that their AI-based algorithms are compliant with all federal and state laws and regulations. Finally, employers and federal contractors should examine ways to minimize the potential legal and business risks associated with AI such as implementing an AI usage policy and establishing internal practices.

Journalism in Canada has suffered a devastating decline over the last two decades. Dozens of newspapers and outlets have shuttered. Remaining newsrooms are smaller. Nowhere is this erosion more acute than in the coverage of foreign policy and international news. It’s expensive, and Canadians, oceans away from most international upheavals, pay the outside world comparatively little attention.
At Open Canada, we believe this must change. If anything, the pandemic has taught us we can’t afford to ignore the changing world. What’s more, we believe, most Canadians don’t want to. Many of us, after all, come from somewhere else and have connections that reach around the world.
Our mission is to build a conversation that involves everyone — not just politicians, academics and policy makers. We need your help to do so. Your support helps us find stories and pay writers to tell them. It helps us grow that conversation. It helps us encourage more Canadians to play an active role in shaping our country’s place in the world.

Surpassing the demand witnessed in developed nations, the Philippines showcases a fervent enthusiasm for integrating generative AI into various facets of daily operations and personal endeavors.In an online press briefing, Aparna Bharadwaj, Global Leader of Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) Global Advantage Practice, shed light on the remarkable adoption of generative AI within the Philippine landscape. Bharadwaj underscored its pivotal role in propelling career trajectories and fostering economic growth, reflecting a broader trend across emerging markets where generative AI is viewed as a catalyst for success.Filipino professionals’ mixed sentiments toward AI advancementThe latest report from the BCG unveiled a nuanced perspective among Filipino professionals, with 43% expressing conflicting emotions toward the rising tide of generative AI. This significant segment reflects the diverse sentiments prevailing within the Filipino workforce.While a substantial 38% of Filipino professionals expressed enthusiasm for AI’s transformative potential, a contrasting 19% harbor concerns, highlighting a spectrum of attitudes towards AI integration. These findings underscore the complex interplay of optimism and apprehension within the Filipino professional landscape.Global perspectives on AI sentimentsThe report also offers a comprehensive view of global AI sentiments, with 43% of respondents worldwide expressing excitement, 29% voicing concern, and 28% displaying conflicted emotions regarding AI advancement. This diversity of perspectives underscored the multifaceted nature of societal responses to technological innovation.Globally, respondents anticipate AI to revolutionize daily life, drive scientific breakthroughs, and inspire new artistic expressions. However, concerns persist regarding data privacy, uncertainty surrounding AI’s implications, and its environmental footprint, reflecting broader societal apprehensions.Factors influencing AI sentimentBharadwaj explained there are contextual factors shaping AI sentiment, emphasizing the pivotal role of resources, infrastructure, and technological accessibility. This insight underscores the divergence in attitudes between emerging and mature economies towards AI integration.Across major economies such as France, Australia, the U.K., Sweden, the U.S., and Germany, heightened levels of concern regarding AI advancement are observed, indicating localized apprehensions amidst rapid technological evolution.Job security amid AI integrationDespite prevailing apprehensions, a majority (55%) of respondents assert the resilience of their jobs against AI replacement, underscoring confidence in their professional roles. However, sector-specific variations highlight distinct vulnerabilities in certain industries.The report delineates sector-specific concerns, with industries like marketing and communications exhibiting heightened apprehensions regarding AI-induced job displacement. In contrast, other sectors demonstrate varying degrees of concern, reflecting the diverse impact of AI integration.Insights into global workforce sentimentsJessica Apotheker, BCG’s Chief Marketing Officer, underscored the nuanced impact of AI on the global workforce, emphasizing the differential vulnerability of process-intensive, office-based functions compared to relationship-centric roles.

						OpenAI claims that its use of data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require payment.		

By Mercury News & East Bay Times editorialUPDATED: May 3, 2024 at 11:27 a.m.There is no artificial intelligence without the vast trove of human knowledge.Today’s generative AI applications were built on a foundation of such information, drawn from across the internet and from various databases totaling, according to at least one estimate, somewhere around 300 billion words.That’s a lot of intellectual property, much of it produced by generations of professional writers, honed and polished by editors and sent out into the world by publishers in newspapers, magazines, books and more.Hard to put an exact price on such a thing or even to measure the collective value of such an incredible library.It definitely should not be free.But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.

About ConnatixV512852 Here’s what happened to California Gov. Newsom’s quietquest for the presidencyIf you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?That’s why newspapers, including this one, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.

Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the Internet and it’s possible to copy it. They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.For decades, newspapers have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed, and followed fights over public works. In most every U.S. city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.Related Articles

			Q&A: AI vs. the metaverse — How artificial intelligence might change the future of the internet		

AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognize the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was $90 billion.Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps — to develop the code, as it were — has value.That value must be recognized and these companies must be held accountable.

Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be.

How we’re upskilling and preparing our workforce for the age of generative artificial intelligence 















PUBLISHED

Global Capability Lead – Digital, Data, AI and 
Learning Agility, AstraZeneca











Marc Howells
Vice President, Talent & Development, 
AstraZeneca










We stay at the forefront of innovation by prioritising our people’s learning and development (L&D) journeys and creating opportunities where we can all learn, adapt and grow in the face of new challenges and technologies. Discover more from Dr. Bonnie Cheuk, Global Capability Lead – Digital, Data and Learning Agility, and Marc Howells, Vice President, Talent & Development, about our journey to be more agile with digital and data insights, and what we’re doing to upskill our workforce in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). 







The prevalence of AI across all aspects of our lives is growing every day. From creativity to productivity, AI provides us with limitless opportunities to become more efficient and simplify the way we work. Rather than replacing the need for humans, these technologies work alongside our teams to augment human intelligence, transform and simplify our ways of working, and help drive innovation across our organisation. 
Now generative AI technologies have become widely accessible, we want to make sure we upskill our employees through a series of activities designed to increase awareness and readiness, so they feel equipped to use emerging generative AI tools and feel confident to experiment with generative AI in a responsible way. As one of the first pharmaceutical companies to publish principles for AI and Data Ethics, we’re committed to building a continuous learning environment where people can enhance their digital capabilities.
As the world becomes increasingly more integrated with technology, so too have our learning practices. Technology gives our people autonomy over how they choose to learn and empowers individuals to engage with materials in a style and at a pace that suits them best. Today there’s an increased demand for personalised learning experiences that are accessed via user friendly and convenient technologies, anytime and anywhere. Our global learning platform offers a number of digital and AI learning content pathways in 12 languages, creating a digital community of learners across our company. 
The generative AI accreditation programme 
Leaders from across IT, HR, AI governance, business and corporate communications worked with internal and external experts to create a programme that focuses on how we can use generative AI in our daily work and be intentional about our relationship with AI.
Our generative AI accreditation programme is a self-guided training course to upskill our workforce in using generative AI tools, through practical, peer-to-peer activities to enhance the learning process. Open to all our employees globally (who are not AI/Data Science specialists), no matter their experience or comfort level with the technology, it aims to increase people’s confidence in using generative AI tools ethically and responsibly, as well as nurturing the human skills needed to thrive in the age of AI so we can better prepare for the future.  
We ask participants to undertake a range of learning experiences; from keynote seminars and lab sessions to reflection activities and strategic thinking workshops, everyone is invited to take an active role in their learning. It’s about encouraging our people to be curious, to think critically, ask questions, speak up, and use the tools in an informed and ethical way. 
The data and insights gained from questions, comments and reflection activities shape the future of the programme so that it continuously evolves. Currently, there’s over 3,300 people in the cohort, with over 2,000 joining online forums, and more than 1,000 employees participating in each live session – demonstrating our culture of curiosity and lifelong learning, as well as the mass appeal of understanding generative AI technology no matter your job role or location. Over 90% of the participants reported the learning is relevant to their work and has increased their work performance.
The connection to our wider L&D philosophy 
According to Marc Howells, one of the sponsors of the programme, its structure demonstrates our commitment to inclusive learning practices that empower our people to learn in their own way and help to make learning digital, data and AI part of a lifelong learning habit.
“We make no assumptions about prior knowledge or experience and invite everyone to learn together, at their own pace, so we can create a high impact programme and maintain a psychologically safe learning environment for everyone to think together, experiment together and learn together.
Our journey began five years ago, when we started to build digital skills, adapting to more collaborative and agile ways of working, evolving from ‘doing digital’ to ‘being digital’. Over the years, we have created resources that increased awareness, empowered our people and enabled them to thrive in an ever-changing world.  And now, the generative AI programme is not just about mastering new tools, it's about cultivating a mindset of curiosity and lifelong learning within our company. By encouraging our people to explore the possibilities, we not only enhance our digital capabilities but also support our drive for innovation. Staying true to our Values, we recognise that curiosity is part of the fuel that drives us to push the boundaries of science.”
By upskilling our employees in generative AI, we enable our people to make informed generative AI related business decisions whilst we accelerate innovative science and the delivery of life-changing medicines to patients. 
Note: In addition to this programme, we offer a range of learning programmes for AI and data science specialists, and support colleagues who have an ambition to gain deeper AI expertise.

The Madonna della Rosa, a painting of the Virgin Mary thought to be by Raphael and now hanging in the Prado in Madrid, was recently revealed to have an unexpected extra dimension: an image of Joseph that the Renaissance master did not create himself. 
It came to light thanks to analysis with facial recognition technology trained in Raphael’s style by experts at the University of Bradford.
This is just one eye-catching example of the role that artificial intelligence (AI) might play in art history.
While AI has been used behind the scenes in museums for some years, the revolution is gathering momentum. This is driven partly by generative AI and online tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which are igniting much wider interest in how the technology could improve efficiency and how it might open the door to new ways of working.
What do we mean by AI?
AI is an umbrella term for a range of sophisticated technologies that can perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, analytical skills or judgement, such as understanding speech or recognising images.

“Most AI is a form of machine learning – statistical models, usually created from data scraped from the internet – that tries to generate text, images, video or audio based on the ‘training data’ it has access to,” says Mia Ridge, a digital curator with the Western Heritage Collections digital research team at the British Library. 
“It’s not ‘intelligent’ and doesn’t have knowledge or semantic understanding of what the words and images mean. AI is a great marketing term and a not-that-accurate shorthand name for machine learning.”
Generative AI is the form that has captured public attention since ChatGPT emerged in late 2022. Generative AI models, trained on data from across the internet, respond to prompts and can generate detailed answers in human-like terms.
They can replicate a specific tone of voice and can also adapt to format (for example, bullet-point summaries, social media posts or news item). Most significantly, they can do it in a matter of seconds.
ChatGPT was followed by other software including Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard) and Microsoft’s Co-pilot.
Models such as Midjourney and DALL-E can produce visual content to a written text prompt, drawing on existing images. There are also tools that can produce audio and video to written instructions.

The latest version of Adobe Premiere, one of the most widely used video-editing applications, now includes a facility for writing a text instruction directing the AI to edit raw footage into a package: the human is still the director-editor, but the AI does the fiddly cutting and assembling.
A comprehensive report for the National Lottery Heritage Fund last year entitled Artificial Intelligence: A Digital Heritage Leadership Briefing explores how AI is already being used.
It identifies three key areas: 
1. Heritage and collections management use and research
Heritage and collections management use and research This is the area in which AI is most deployed. It is helping to expedite some of the more labour-intensive, time-consuming tasks around the labelling of objects, indexing and generally making collections more searchable.
At the Science Museum, machine learning is used internally to help provide more relevant results in searches via the collections website, and to automatically identify elements of images that may be useful to users when returning results.

“We can use it to generate alternative spellings and synonyms – as well as related people, companies and subject areas – and add those entities to the underlying index to help improve discoverability,” says Jamie Unwin, the museum’s head of digital technology and a member of the Museums + AI Network, a 12-month research project that took place in 2019-20 and was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
The Science Museum also uses a technique called “entity recognition” to scan its internal catalogue records for identifiable people and places, which it then links to third-party sources such as Wikidata, making the content easier to find and enabling institutions to share data and perform other functions more efficiently.
“We’ve got over half a million objects in our database,” says Unwin. “Going through every one and trying to link everything to Wikidata or other institutions’ systems by hand would be impossible.”
Although machine learning works to a high degree of accuracy and can improve how searches work, Unwin says the museum does not “present as fact” anything that is produced with AI.
At the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth, staff have taken textual collection descriptions written by curators and used AI technologies to generate the keywords.
AI is able to generate these 20 times faster than a human, according to Amy Adams, the museum’s collections information and access manager. “But the accuracies around some of them are still debatable,” she says.
2. Visitor experience
AI applications are already embedded in some museum functions. These include chatbots to interact with visitors online, automate translations for people for whom English is not a first language, and automated transcription of events such as conferences.
The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam incorporated a chatbot into Facebook Messenger to answer people’s questions about Anne Frank’s story, while the National Library of Scotland uses tools such as the transcription app Otter.ai to transcribe live events and write captions for videos, which are proof read by staff before publication.
3. Business and management
There is potential for AI to support functions such as forecasting ticket salesor visitor attendance. The National Gallery, London, developed AI tools to predict how popular temporary exhibitions would be, drawing on two decades of its visitor data, which helped staff to manage room capacity at events in real time.
Departments such as marketing and comms seem ideal candidates for the use of ChatGPT and other generative tools to undertake tasks such as sending out emails, exhibition flyers or social media posts, but evidence of its use – at least institutionally approved use – seems limited.

Other uses of AI

Even if one shies away from using the generative tools for original writing, there are plenty of straightforward tasks that it could be assigned, always with the caveat that a human needs to check the final output. Such tasks include:
 

Writing report summaries– feed in the 20-page document and prompt the AI to summarise it in 500 words.
Email responses to common queries.
Session planning outlines for schools and other workshops.
One of the more creative applications popular in other sectors is brainstorming ideas. Ask ChatGPT for 10 ways to mark Black History Month as a museum and it might generate seven you’re aware of, a couple you had overlooked, and one you’d never even considered.



The importance of data
A cornerstone of the efficient use of AI tools is effective data. For collections purposes, for example, effective linkages in search depend on accurate data – and this can be a challenge.
“Whether you’re using tools that are tailored to you or those that are bought off the shelf, you need to have digitised data,” says Mathilde Pavis, author of the Heritage Fund report and an expert in intellectual property law.
“It needs to be properly labelled and structured, even before you start looking at AI tools. This is the bread and butter of digitisation – digital data management and rights management. Without that, it will be difficult to get the most out of your data and what you do with AI.”
Tools such as ChatGPT are by no means perfect and may “hallucinate” and produce an answer or text that sounds plausible but is factually flawed, with invented quotes and references. Even when generally accurate, it can be superficial and generic.
More insidious, still, is the risk of bias: a generative text tool is likely to have trained on biased text, meaning that bias – whether racial, colonial, historical or gender – will form part of the result.
It means human editing is vital; not just proof reading for spelling and grammar (which AI tools are actually pretty good at) but detailed checking of content, links and sources. 
But some argue that the use of generative AI tools to perform even straightforward writing tasks will always be too great a risk for museums.
Writing object labels, for example, might be seen as a task that, in future, could be outsourced to an AI tool such as ChatGPT. But the result would inevitably lack depth, argues Rachel Coldicutt, founder of research consultancy Careful Industries and a member of the Museums + AI network.
“A subject matter expert in a museum will be bringing lots of separate contexts to include in the label – knowledge that doesn’t sit in an online database but is about how to engage specific audiences and what’s culturally relatable to visitors,” she says.
The Science Museum’s Unwin says: “ChatGPT works by guessing what the most likely next word or sentence should be in a text, based on what others have written.
""A system that just says the obvious probably isn’t what we should be doing for a museum website. Where we’ve got a vast wealth of information, we should be the primary sources for that information.”
Coldicutt also points to the economic impact on some parts of the workforce in that generative AI potentially poses a threat to jobs on the lower rungs of a career ladder, such as copywriting, which people do as freelancers or on an otherwise precarious basis to allow them to get a foothold in the creative industries.
Skills
AI is bringing a wave of disruption across the sector – as it is across society. The good news is you don’t need great technological aptitude to grasp at least some of the opportunities.
The British Library’s Ridge suggests people play around with AI to understand what might be coming.
“AI literacy is an important part of good governance,” she says. “People need a solid understanding of where biases are likely to appear, how to review and contest decisions made by algorithms and where sharing data might have privacy or legal implications, so that they can make good decisions about the products they buy or implement. It also helps people plan so that AI tools enhance jobs, rather than attempting to replace them.”
Pavis, an expert in intellectual property law, pinpoints training for staff and volunteers in areas such as data management, rights and compliance, AI systems and risks in all departments of the organisation, as part of workforce development.
One fundamental is to agree on a common language.
“Everyone needs to know that they are talking about the same thing when they use the term ‘AI’ in their institution – what does it mean, and when we are talking about ‘data’, do we all mean the same thing?” asks Pavis.
The future
The potential for even greater transformation is huge, says Dave Thomas, chief technology officer with Axiell, which provides specialised content management systems to museums worldwide.
The key to success will be greater interoperability, fuelled by AI, which will potentially allow museums to collaborate seamlessly for collections management and for public benefit.
The problem is people don’t share knowledge effectively and swathes of collections are yet to be digitised, says Thomas.
“My concern is around how we connect collections, because digital audiences don’t see institutional silos,” he says. “If I’m a digital visitor interested in the second world war, I’m not just interested in one collection in one place.”
That could, for example, mean a visitor starting with the Imperial War Museum online then following links to, perhaps, Tate Britain’s war artists and Cumbria’s Museum of Military Life.
“Museums have to be much more digitally inspirational when it comes to things like education, which they can’t do very well at the moment unless they work together,” says Thomas.
Coldicutt foresees museums following in the footsteps of some retailers and using AI-led tech to streamline areas such as customer service.
“It may be that we will get to a place where seeing an actual person front of house becomes unusual,” she says.

One doctor says it saved her career.,http://schema.org,,,,"
During the summer of 2023, Dr. Rosemary Lall, a family physician working at a bustling medical clinic in Scarborough, hit her breaking point.
After nearly three decades on the job, Lall was ready to throw in the towel as she found herself buried under inescapable patient-related paperwork that often cut into precious family time.“I lost all my joy of work,” Lall told Global News. “I was coming into work really dreading the day.”That dread, Lall said, had less to do with the patient experience and instead came from the work associated with the “aftermath” — mandatory record-keeping that front-line health-care workers are expected to input into Ontario’s electronic medical records system.Physicians, Lall said, are expected to update patient charts, fill out medical forms, provide sick notes and provide specialist referrals.

 The administrative burden would often take her up to two hours per day. Ontario’s Medical Association has estimated family doctors spend 19 hours per week on administrative tasks, including four hours spent writing notes or completing forms for patients.“I came to a crossroads where I’m going to quit, I’m going to give this up, or I’m going to find a solution,” Lall said.The solution, Lall said, was new artificial intelligence note-taking apps that are designed to mimic doctor’s notes and reduce the amount of paperwork a physician would have to manually compile.

Patients who give consent have a routine conversation about their ailment with the physician, while the doctor verbalizes their thoughts during the physical exam. The AI Scribe software is able to create and process a real-time transcript during the appointment.Lall said the true benefit comes after the appointment when the AI Scribe compiles the information into a so-called SOAP note, a standard requirement for family physicians as prescribed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.Artificial intelligence technology separates the information it hears into subjective information, as relayed by the patient, objective information, as relayed by the doctor, assessment information, as verbalized by the physician during a physical exam, and a plan of action for patient care. The four areas — subjective, objective, assessment and plan — make up the acronym SOAP.  Story continues below advertisement



 Lall said it takes minutes for AI Scribe to collate the information, allowing her to move on to other patients while the SOAP note is being created in the background.If the physician is unhappy with the note, Lall said, they can ask the AI model to regenerate the information or add more detail to any one of the categories. While the tool has some imperfections, she said, the improvements have been noticeable over the 10 months since she began using it.“I really feel this should be the next gold standard for all of our doctors. It decreases the cognitive load you feel at the end of the day,” she said.The Ford government has been so impressed with the technology that it announced a pilot program to allow 150 family physicians to use AI Scribe as part of their practices. The health minister said the early signs were promising but stressed the government would proceed carefully.“We’re doing it in a very measured way so we can look at those results and see that the impact is there,” Deputy Premier Sylvia Jones told Global News. “Anecdotally, patients really appreciate it. Clinicians are seeing benefits.”Still, some have questions about the data collected by AI Scribe, privacy and the potential for misuse.“I would have significant concerns if it’s not properly executed,” said Liberal health critic and physician Dr. Adil Shamji.  Story continues below advertisement



 “There are going to be important things to do in terms of ensuring patient confidentiality, ensuring accuracy,” Shaji said. “If it’s going to be truly autonomous with minimal oversight that would need to be very carefully implemented.”France Gélinas, the Ontario NDP’s health critic, said artificial intelligence would be “part of the future of health care” in Ontario but needed to be carefully managed.“You have to maintain the trusting relationship between the providers and the patient,” she said.“That means respect their privacy. Are we there yet? I don’t think so. Will we be there? Absolutely. It will become part but let’s take the proper steps, finish the pilot, see what we learn from it.”Lall said that after 29 years as a family physician, last Christmas was the first celebration that wasn’t interrupted by the need to update patient notes thanks to the AI notetaking software.“For me, this has changed things,” Lall said. “It’s made me really happy.“I will never go back.”

Few tech innovations have made headlines and impacted lives as the rise of generative AI, with the capacity to create and curate content that resembles humans, Multiple AI platforms have taken center stage, tech VCs are pouring millions of dollars into the sector, and generative AI will be altering the very nature of work and the modern workplace. It can do many things, ranging from writing poems or stories, breaking down complex manuals into understandable text-sized nuggets, and occasionally even helping folks write code and more.
In due course, as more data sets get analyzed, stored, and used, generative AI will be finishing tasks such as making predictions, getting accurate business forecasts, and eliminating redundant ones that took a great deal of hours and capital. In essence, it will make our lives better by cutting out the tedium of everyday work by finishing it in the background. It will ensure employees get more time to exercise their creative muscle, innovating and creating solutions that can transform their business vertical. Business owners can use their power to eliminate redundancies and drive the business to growth and profitability. We shall discuss how generative AI is changing all aspects of human life, from work to recreation and play.
Work redefined
Take a step back and think about the first AI innovation one may have encountered. It is the humble chat bot and virtual assistant, popping up multiple times on websites and apps from banks to delivery platforms and offering quick fixes to the occasional problem. More often than not, though, one tends to prefer having an actual human at the other end, getting a human angle to resolve complex issues.
This is a problem statement that generative AI is trying to fix at the moment, as new-age chatbots use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to offer interactive and conversational details. They do not rely on specific keywords and are able to grasp the context, offering a natural flow to a larger conversation. Moreover, these chat bots can learn from ongoing conversations and offer customer care executives information using internal and external data on the main issues consumers face. In due course, these tools can write out basic marketing copy and send out mass mailers, leaving support executives with more time and energy to look at big-picture events.
The next area where generative AI might be a game changer is using the large volumes of information to gauge mood and employee sentiment, potentially flag any employee burnout issues, and be deployed by companies to take corrective measures. Moreover, AI tools can be deployed to track general employee performance, suggest personal training paths, and look at proactive measures to improve and upskill employees. Generative AI at work is a major disruptor that is bound to change the workplace in many ways. It is, however, a force for good that will ensure human creativity will be able to reach its acme, while AI picks up the tasks that can be easily automated.
However, it would be amiss to talk about generative AI and miss its impact on the creative fields, where the changes are numerous.
Shaking it up 
In the creative arena, generative AI often amplifies existing experiences and makes them sharper and more entertaining. The data sets can be tapped by artists, designers, and creators to sharpen their skills and offer a better experience for the end user. In music, for instance, in due course, tools can create and generate novel melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.
It can also help build more personalized tracks and lists, swift through volumes of musical databases, learn patterns, and eventually help compose pieces that can potentially mimic the style of classical composers and create novel sounds. A combination of human creativity and machine learning tools can aid in creating musical scores that create compositions that do not fit in the regular genres.
In the visual arts, AI algorithms can be used by artists to generate intricate designs, digital paintings, and sculptures. For writers and those creating content, the system can analyze vast amounts of text, understand context, and generate coherent and engaging narratives. For instance, it can help one draft quick mass mailers and basic marketing copies and aid in drafts for simple functions.
Of course, a human voice and input will be needed to tweak the content and add more data points and information, but generative AI can provide the barebones for the creation of a superstructure in terms of content. It can help writers sharpen their research skills, go through reams of content, deliver sharper insights, come up with incisive writing, and make the writer’s block a relic of the past. Its impact is also seen in gaming and entertainment. In video games, generative algorithms can help create dynamic and immersive experiences. It creates vast and diverse game worlds that adapt to player actions, ensuring a unique and engaging experience for all individual users. Think different storylines, character arcs, and so on.
Suffice it to say, generative AI and its tools are changing multiple aspects of our lives, from the workplace to entertainment and more. Most experts believe its integration into various aspects of daily life will result in a leap in workplace efficiency, with a trust for strategic thought and a renewed imagination of creative processes and entertainment options.
It is early days in space, but we should look forward to a future of harmonious coexistence between human creativity and the efficiency of AI tools, making the world a better place in multiple ways.

Is generative AI so important that you need to buy customized keyboards or hire a new chief AI officer, or is all the inflated excitement and investment not yet generating much in the way of returns for organizations?
Gen AI takes us from single-use models of machine learning (ML) to AI tools that promise to be a platform with uses in many areas, but you still need to validate they’re appropriate for the problems you want solved, and that your users know how to use gen AI effectively.
For every optimistic forecast, there’s a caveat against a rush to launch. Multiple studies suggest high numbers of people regularly use gen AI tools for both personal and work use, with 98% of the Fortune 1000 experimenting with gen AI, according to a recent PageDuty study. But now organizations appear to be taking a more cautious approach when it comes to official deployments.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, a quarter of IT decision-makers in Foundry’s 2023 AI Priorities Study are piloting gen AI technologies, but only 20% have moved on to deployment. Senior leaders in CCS Insight’s Employee Technology and Workplace Transformation Survey gave similar responses: by the end of 2023, 18% had already deployed gen AI to their full workforce, and 22% were ready to deploy. “People want to see it be real this year,” says Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight. But talking to IT teams like the AI professionals in Intel’s 2023 ML Insider survey suggests only 10% of organizations put gen AI solutions into production in 2023.

Ready to roll 
It’s shorter to make a list of organizations that haven’t announced their gen AI investments, pilots, and plans, but relatively few are talking about the specifics of any productivity gains or ROI. But that may be as much about protecting any competitive advantage as it is about any lack of success.
For example, many Google customers, like Goldman Sachs, IHG, and Mercedes Benz, talking about building with its Gemini gen AI tools at the recent Google Cloud Next conference turned out to still be at the pilot stage rather than in deployment.
 
 
 













 
 

Pilots can offer value beyond just experimentation, of course. McKinsey reports that industrial design teams using LLM-powered summaries of user research and AI-generated images for ideation and experimentation sometimes see a reduction upward of 70% in product development cycle times. But it also emphasizes that those design teams need to do significant evaluation and manipulation of gen AI output to come up with a product that’s realistic and can actually be manufactured, and the recommendation is still to set policies, educate employees, and run pilot schemes. Similarly, Estée Lauder sees value from pilots like an internal chatbot trained on customer insights, behavioral research, and market trends to make those analytics more broadly available in the business, but is still working on how to actually deliver that value.
When it comes to dividing gen AI tools into task and role-specific vertical applications, or more general tools that can be broadly useful to knowledge workers, organizations seem able to adopt the latter more quickly.
As expected, Microsoft claims its own staff gets significant value from the gen AI tools it has in market, like Copilot for Microsoft 365. “Our best users are saving over 10 hours a month,” says Jared Spataro, CVP, modern work and business applications at Microsoft, and 70% of Copilot users say it makes them more productive, working up to a third faster.
 
 
 













 
 

Customers like Telstra report similar time savings for their early adopters, although Forrester lead analyst on Copilot for Microsoft 365 JP Gownder suggests five hours a month is a more common gain. The other question is how well that will scale across the organization. Large Japanese advertising agency Dentsu, for instance, is very enthusiastic about Copilot for Microsoft 365, claiming staff save up to 30 minutes a day on tasks.

Ask




Adoption of Copilot so far tends to be in what he refers to as pockets, which matches how McKinsey reports that most gen AI deployments are happening in specific departments: marketing and sales, service and support, and product development.
Telcos surveyed by McKinsey demonstrated the same blend of optimism and restraint as other industries, with a majority claiming to have cut costs with gen AI, and seen increases in call center agent productivity and improvement in marketing conversion rates with personalized content — both with models deployed in weeks rather than months. On the other hand, the impact has been low outside customer service or mapping network infrastructure.
 
 
 













 
 

Organic growth
Some of Microsoft’s original test customers have already moved from pilot to broad deployment. One of the earliest Microsoft 365 Copilot trials was at global law firm Clifford Chance, and the company is now deploying it to the entire workforce, alongside its custom AI tool, Clifford Chance Assist, built on Azure OpenAI. The company is careful to note that any legal output from gen AI is clearly labelled and checked by a qualified lawyer but, again, the main benefits are productivity gains for knowledge workers: live transcripts, meeting summaries, and both implicit commitments and agreed-on tasks from those meetings.
“This is an incredible technology that can raise productivity, save time, and be a great human assistant,” says Gownder. “But it’s different from the tools we’ve been releasing over the last 40 years in computing. It has these characteristics you need to learn about to be truly successful.”
He offers a string of questions to assess the AI quotient of your organization:
 
 
 













 
 


Do you have a basic understanding of how AI and prompt engineering work?
Have you had training?
Do you feel confident about being able to learn these things?
Are you motivated to get involved?
Are you aware of what can go wrong and how you can be an ethical user of these things?

Another issue is getting staff to make gen AI tools part of their workflow. “Some people are really bullish on Copilot and say they’re having a great experience with it,” adds Gownder. Others find bumps in the road, though, where half of users see productivity gains and the other half doesn’t use the tools. Frequently, that’s because enterprises are underinvesting in training by an order of magnitude.
Almost every major company evaluating Copilot for Microsoft 365 is only planning on an hour of training for staff instead of the 10 he suggests. “This is a core skill and you need to invest in training here because otherwise it’s going to bite you,” he says. That’s key both for gen AI deployments to succeed, and to get the most out of the gen AI features and natural language interfaces that’ll become common in commercial software, from Photoshop to Zoom.
Very specific successes
There are gen AI success stories in verticals like document engineering, where Docugami offers custom small language models that build a knowledge graph from a customer’s own complex documents, and can be used for both document generation and to extract data.
 
 
 













 
 

And commercial insurance is a vertical Docugami CEO Jean Paoli says has been an early adopter, including statements of value, certificates of insurance, as well as policy documents with renewal dates, penalties, and liabilities. That’s critical information describing the risk of both individual customers and the entire portfolio, which has been difficult to manually extract and consolidate to use for generating new quotes, or representing the portfolio to reinsurers. “These are real scenarios that save you millions of dollars, not few hundred bucks,” Paoli says.
Like everyone else, large Docugami customers created gen AI committees and started pilots in 2023, but many have already moved from discovery to implementation, starting production deployments at least six months ago and seeing real returns, chief business officer Alan Yates says. In life sciences, one customer uses the platform for clinical trial documentation, compliance, and data exploration. “It took them six months to do this work previously and now it takes them a week,” he says.
Coding is another vertical where adoption of gen AI in production is increasingly common, whether that’s GitHub Copilot, Google’s new Gemini Code Assist, AWS CodeWhisperer, or tools like ChatGPT that aren’t developer specific.
 
 
 













 
 

Productivity improvements can be much lower initially, though. When Cisco first rolled out GitHub Copilot to 6,000 developers, they only accepted the generated code 19% of the time. Now nearly half of code suggestions are accepted. Saving just six minutes of developer time a month is enough to cover the cost, according to Redfin, although there are other metrics like code quality that organizations will want to track as well.

But the gen AI gains can also be much higher for low code platforms where citizen developers with less expertise get more benefit from the assistance. Digital insurance agency Nsure.com was already using Power Automate extensively, but describing an automation flow in natural language is much faster than even a drag and drop interface. Workflows that took four hours to create and configure take closer to 40 minutes with Copilot for Power Automate, an improvement of over 80%.
Then there’s Microsoft customer PG&E, which built an IT helpdesk chatbot called Peggy with the low code Copilot Studio gen AI tool in Power Platform that handles 25 to 40% of employee requests, saving over $1.1 million annually, principal program manager for Microsoft Copilot AI Noa Ghersin says. And having Peggy walk employees through unlocking their access to SAP saves the helpdesk team 840 hours a year alone.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations that have already adopted Power Platform for low code and RPA find they can make that automation more powerful using Copilot Studio to orchestrate processes where there are multiple workflows to choose from, like ticket refunds for Cineplex. Agents used to spend five to 15 minutes processing a refund even with automation, and now that’s 30 to 60 seconds.
Counting the cost
Set monthly subscriptions can seem expensive, but it’s hard to accurately estimate costs for on-demand gen AI tools, which may gate some deployments. The costs for individual gen AI tasks can be pennies, but even small costs add up.
“Cost is a primary thing you have to take into account in gen AI, whether you go to third-party vendors or even internally,” says LinkedIn principal staff software engineer Juan Bottaro. His team recently rolled out a new gen AI feature for premium users that uses your profile to suggest if you’re a good match for a job posting, and what skills or qualifications might improve your chances.
 
 
 













 
 

“There were several times where we would’ve liked to move much faster because we felt the experience was a lot more mature, but we had to wait because we just didn’t have enough capacity and GPUs available,” he says.
It’s hard to predict costs for novel workflows, and any assumptions you make about usage will probably be wrong because the way that people interact with this is very different, he adds. Instead, deploy to a small percentage of users and extrapolate from their behavior.
Initially, you may see cost savings because the speed of prototyping is dramatically and almost deceptively fast. Training and testing a classifier to understand intent typically takes one to two months, but his team was able to get prototypes of what they wanted to deliver in just a couple of days. “In a week, you can get something that looks like a finished product,” says Bottaro. “We managed to build something that looks very close to what you see today in the premium experience in a month or two.”
 
 
 













 
 

But getting from something that’s 80% of what you want to the level of quality you need to deploy will often take much longer. In this case, another four months.
It’s still too early to learn lessons from either technical or cost control failures in gen AI pilots, CCS Insight’s Rotibi says, but users can consider quotas and rate-limiting outbound requests to cloud AI services through API management gateways, just like other cloud services. The majority plan to limit the use of gen AI to targeted roles, individuals, or teams because of the pricing. “That’s a lot of money if you want to go across the organization,” she says.

What are you measuring?
Self-reported productivity isn’t necessarily the best way to measure gen AI deployment success, and successful deployments may even change what metrics matter, Gownder says. “If you’re pushing your entire tier-one support off to generative AI and you have really good natural language, the success rate will go up, so everything that gets to a human is a harder problem,” he says. “It’s more long tail and white-glove hand holding, and the metric is more about customer satisfaction than the length of the call.”
 
 
 













 
 

Just measuring the quality and accuracy of gen AI results is difficult given that it’s non-deterministic; the same inputs will likely give you a different result every time. That’s not necessarily a flaw if they’re correct and consistent, but does make it harder to evaluate, so unless you have an existing tool to compare it to, you have to create a benchmark for evaluating performance.
“Defining whether something is right or wrong becomes very subjective and difficult to measure,” Bottaro says.
To evaluate the tool, the team created shared guidelines for what a good response looks like. Similarly, for the Ask Learn API powering Copilot for Azure, Microsoft built a ‘golden dataset’ of representative, annotated questions and answers with reference data for ground truth to test against — and metrics to represent — answer quality.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations are often more interested in whether they make money than save it by deploying gen AI, notes Rotibi. “I can see this as a productivity capability and an efficiency improvement for my workforce,” she says. “But where am I going to make money as an organization?”

There’s pressure to demonstrate the uptake of true ROI, Gownder adds, but warns we’re not at that point yet. It may be easier to connect role-specific tools like Copilot for Sales to improvements in conversion rate, deal flow, or the mean time to resolution of a call, but he cautions against assuming a direct causal relationship when there are so many variables.
Less quantifiable benefits can still be valuable in terms of TCO, though. “Let’s say giving people Copilot not only saves them time, but takes tedious tasks off their plates,” says Gownder. “That could improve their employee experience. We know employee experience benefits tend to lower attrition, and make people more motivated and engaged. There’s a lot of positive productivity from the psychological side of that.”
But sheer enthusiasm for gen AI and LLMs complicates things, says Bottaro: “We’re faced with a problem of, ‘Let’s find out how to measure value because I definitely want to build it.’ That’s looking at it the wrong way round.” He suggests going back to the same objective function of success metrics you’d use for any product, and being open to the possibility that for some use cases, traditional AI will be good enough.
 
 
 













 
 

Is gen AI failing?
There are valid questions about where it’s appropriate to adopt gen AI, how to stop users accepting inaccurate answers as irrefutable truths, and the concerning inclusion of both copyright and inappropriate material in training sets. But negative publicity and scaremongering can exaggerate risks and ignore the useful things you can already do if you adopt gen AI responsibly.
Reported gen AI failures are often as much about irresponsible behavior by users testing boundaries, or organizational failure to launch AI-powered tools to put sufficient guardrails in place, as it is about the inherent issues of the models themselves. Embarrassingly, at one point in 2023, OpenAI’s own $175 million VC fund was under the control of a fake identity, but that appears to be just another example of someone using AI-powered tools to help them with good old-fashioned business fraud.
Other concerns about gen AI involve deepfakes or simpler digital forgeries, potential legal risks around copyright of data used for the training set, and questions about compliance when using gen AI with sensitive or confidential data.
As with any cloud model, the notion of shared responsibility is key. AI providers need to supply models and services that are safe to use, but organizations adopting AI services must read the model cards and transparency notes, and test they’re adequately constraining the way they can be used.
“Some organizations have overextended to the customer with chatbots and realize they’re getting inconsistent answers,” Gownder says. But that doesn’t usually mean abandoning the project. “Maybe they pull it back and try to iterate offline before they launch it to customers,” he adds.
Organizational maturity in gen AI tends to track maturity in AI generally, and most companies adopting it say it’s helping them invest elsewhere. “They’re investing more in predictive AI, computer vision, and machine learning,” says Gownder. Businesses building their own AI tools are using multiple technologies and treating gen AI as a component rather than a solution. 
The best correction to gen AI hype is to view it as both a groundbreaking technology and just another tool in the toolbox, says Bottaro.

Canadian companies’ AI policies aim to balance risk with rewards

When talent search platform Plum noticed ChatGPT sending ripples through the tech world and beyond, it decided to turn right to the source to lay out how staff could and couldn’t use the generative artificial intelligence chatbot.
ChatGPT, which can turn simple text instructions into poems, essays, emails and more, churned out a draft document last summer that got the Kitchener, Ont.-based company about 70 per cent of the way to its final policy.
“There was nothing in there that was wrong; there was nothing in there that was crazy,” Plum’s chief executive Caitlin MacGregor recalled. “But there was an opportunity to get a little bit more specific or to make it a little bit more custom to our business.”
Plum’s final policy — a four-page document building on ChatGPT’s draft with advice from other startups cobbled together last summer — advises staff to keep client and proprietary info out of AI systems, review anything the technology spits out for accuracy and attribute any content it generates.
It makes Plum one of several Canadian organizations codifying their stance around AI as people increasingly rely on the technology to boost their productivity at work.
Many were spurred into developing policiesby the federal government, which released a set of AI guidelines for the public sector last fall. Now scores of startups and larger organizations have reworked them for their own needs or are developing their own versions.
These companies say their goal is not to curtail the use of generative AI but to ensure workers feel empowered enough to use it — responsibly.
“You’d be wrong to not leverage the power of this technology. It’s got so much opportunity for productivity, for functionality,” said Niraj Bhargava, founder of Nuenergy.ai, an Ottawa-based AI management software firm.
“But on the other hand, if you use it without putting (up) guardrails, there’s a lot of risks. There’s the existential risks of our planet, but then there’s the practical risks of bias and fairness or privacy issues.”
Striking a balance between both is key, but Bhargava said there’s “no one size fits all” policy that works for every organization.
If you’re a hospital, you might have a very different answer to what’s acceptable than a private sector tech company, he said.
There are, however, some tenets that frequently crop up in guidelines.
One is not plugging in client or proprietary data into AI tools because companies can’t ensure such info will remain private. It might even be used to train the models that power AI systems.
Another is treating anything that AI spits out as potentially false.
AI systems are still not foolproof. Tech startup Vectara estimates AI chatbots invent information at least three per cent of the time and in some instances, as much as 27 per cent of the time.
A B.C. lawyer had to admit to a court in February that she had cited two cases in a family dispute that were fabricated by ChatGPT.
A California lawyer similarly uncovered accuracy issues, when he asked the chatbot in April 2023 to compile a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed someone. It incorrectly named an academic and cited a Washington Post article that did not exist.
Organizations crafting AI policies also often touch on transparency issues.
“If you would not attribute something that somebody else wrote as your own work, why would you attribute something that ChatGPT wrote as your own work?” questioned Elissa Strome,executive director of Pan-Canadian artificial intelligence strategy at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
Many say people should be informed when it’s used to parse data, write text or create images, video or audio, but other instances are not as clear.
“We can use ChatGPT 17 times a day, but do we have to write an email disclosing it every single time? Probably not if you’re figuring out your travel itinerary and whether you should go by plane or by car, something like that,” Bhargava said.
“There’s a lot of innocuous cases where I don’t think I have to disclose that I used ChatGPT.”
How many companies have explored all the ways staff could use AI and conveyed what’s acceptable or not is unclear.
An April 2023 study from consulting firm KPMG of 4,515 Canadians found 70 per cent of Canadians who use generative AI say their employer has a policy around the technology.
However, October 2023 research from software firm Salesforce and YouGov concluded 41 per cent of the 1,020 Canadians surveyed reported their company had no policies on using generative AI for work. Some 13 per cent only had “loosely defined” guidelines.
At Sun Life Financial Inc., staff are blocked from using external AI tools for work because the company can’t guarantee client, financial or health information will be kept private when these systems are used.
However, the insurer lets workers use internal versions of Anthropic’s AI chatbot Claude and GitHub Copilot, an AI-based programming assistant, because the company has been able to ensure both abide by its data privacy policies, said chief information officer Laura Money.
So far, she’s seen staff use the tools to write code and craft memos and scripts for videos.
To encourage more to experiment, the insurer has encouraged staff to enrol in a self-directed free online course from CIFAR that teaches the principles of AI and its effects.
Of that move, Money said, “You want your employees to be familiar with these technologies because it can make them more productive and make their work lives better and make work a little more fun.”
About 400 workers have enrolled since the course was offered to them a few weeks ago.
Despite offering the course, Sun Life knows its approach to the technology has to keep evolving because AI is advancing so quickly.
Plum and CIFAR, for example, each launched their policies before generative AI tools that go beyond text to create sound, audio or video were readily available.
“There wasn’t the same level of image generation as there is now,” MacGregor said of summer 2023, when Plum launched its AI policy with a hackathon asking staff to write poems about the business with ChatGPT or experiment with how it could solve some of the business’s problems.
“Definitely a yearly review is probably necessary.”
Bhargava agrees, but said many organizations still have to play catch up because they have no policy yet.
“The time is now to do it,” he said.
“If the genie is out of the bottle, it’s not like we can think ‘maybe next year we’ll do this.'”

The financial services industry is investing heavily in the technology that makes artificial intelligence work. Now it needs to make the same investments in the talent that will make AI work for their businesses.


Almost all large financial services firms are introducing artificial intelligence to their strategies. In fact, more than 95% of firms participating in a new Broadridge study say they are investing in AI. These firms are working to integrate AI into client-facing, front-office functions such as customer service and research, as well as into operations, data management, risk, fraud and virtually every other area of the business.

Senior leaders at these companies are making AI a priority because they understand the potential impact AI and machine learning could have on their businesses and also on society, in general. Experts project that generative AI (GenAI) applications could add up to $4.4 trillion in value to the global economy—every year!

PROMOTED
Digital Transformation
Estimates like those have prompted financial service firms around the world to make AI a key part of ongoing efforts to remake their businesses with digital technology. Although the financial services industry has been slow to adopt new technology, firms are investing heavily in digital transformation. Once firms modernize their technology platforms by moving to the cloud, centralizing data and making other upgrades, they are in position to integrate powerful innovative tools such as AI and ML. Among financial service firms categorized as digital leaders, 44% are making moderate to large investments in GenAI—more than twice the level of nonleaders.

These early adopters are laying out a road map for other firms to follow when it comes to building the technology platforms needed to support AI. However, even among these advanced companies, one critical element is being neglected. Firms will never realize the ultimate potential of their AI investments if the people within the organization don’t know how to use it effectively. Despite the push to build out AI capabilities, the majority of financial services firms have not implemented a defined strategy for reskilling their workforces for the coming era of AI.

Upskilling Across The Board
The need for upskilling is apparent for IT staff such as developers, security professionals and data engineers. However, since AI is being integrated into nearly every business function, it’s equally important for companies to train teams outside of tech roles, creating GenAI experts throughout the company and teaching employees across the organization how to integrate AI into their workflows.

Roughly 46% of companies in the survey have implemented a reskilling plan to help employees manage the general impact of AI, and about 45% allow staff to use GenAI for general work purposes. However, only about a quarter of companies are directly training staff on how to use GenAI tools.

Empowering Employees
Even fewer companies are talking to employees about the bigger issue of how to best apply AI to their jobs and get the most out of the technology. AI and ML applications will automate many of the routine tasks that now take up time. That will free up staff to work directly with clients and focus on higher value-added activities. In so doing, it will change the nature of many positions and could change the skill sets needed for many roles. For example, LTX’s new BondGPT+ solution has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of time bond traders spend collecting and analyzing market information. By instantly processing information about more than 30,000 corporate bonds, the AI-powered tool will dramatically increase the amount of real-time data traders have on hand to make decisions, while freeing up hours of traders’ time. Companies should be working closely with professionals in all fields to determine how best to use this time.
About 55% of survey respondents say the rise of AI will create a greater need for strong analytical and critical thinking skills. Of course, employees will have access to AI tools designed to boost those exactly those capabilities. Organizations are already using large-language models (LLMs) to improve data-driven decision-making and analysis.
Figuring out ways to integrate these tools that empower staff and enhance business results will be one of the biggest challenges facing financial service firms and, indeed, all companies. As companies build out the technology platforms that will enable AI, they should also be building out programs to educate employees about the practical, legal and ethical aspects of AI. Upskilling the workforce to thrive in an environment fueled by AI applications is the only way to unleash the full benefits of this powerful technology for companies and employees alike.

Whatever your feelings about artificial intelligence (AI), one thing is clear: businesses are rapidly adjusting to a reality where AI has been baked into a plethora of workflows. How that might impact your own job is an open question.

A new study by Ernst & Young LLP suggests that A.I. adoption will force 50 percent of businesses to unleash layoffs alongside new hiring in an attempt to adjust. Companies are reshaping their workforce to be more AI savvy. With this transition, we can anticipate a continuous cycle of strategic workforce realignment, characterized by simultaneous layoffs and hiring, and not necessarily in equal volumes,” Vamsi Duvvuri, EY Technology, Media and Telecommunications AI Leader, wrote in a statement accompanying the study’s data. “But it’s not all doom and gloom. Employees and companies alike continue to show enthusiasm around AI, specifically when it comes to opportunities to scale and compete more effectively in the marketplace.”

Of the 255 business leaders surveyed for the study, some 72 percent said their employees were using AI at least daily in the workplace. Top uses included coding and software development (51 percent), data analysis (51 percent), and internal and external communication (47 percent). Moreover, 82 percent of these leaders plan increasing their AI investment in the next year.

Amidst this changing landscape, these leaders are hiring for key roles, including:
Cybersecurity Analyst
AI will increasingly automate threat detection and other aspects of the cybersecurity business, freeing analysts to focus on strategic response and investigation.

AI Tools to Know: Anomaly detection systems, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), Machine learning for threat hunting.
Languages: Python (Scikit-learn for ML), scripting (bash, PowerShell) for automation.
Takeaway: Upskill in AI to understand and leverage automated tools. Hone soft skills like communication and critical thinking for effective incident response.

Data Scientist
AI will impact data cleaning and feature engineering, allowing data scientists to focus on model building and sharing their results with other stakeholders throughout their organization.

AI Tools to Know: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, Deep Learning for complex pattern recognition.
Languages: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep learning), R for statistical analysis.
Takeaway: Learn AI fundamentals to build and interpret complex models. Strengthen communication skills to translate insights into actionable business strategies.

AI Engineer
Although a relatively new role, AI engineering is evolving quickly. The focus is shifting from designing algorithms to building robust and secure AI systems for real-world applications.

AI Tools to Know: Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Explainable AI (XAI) for model transparency.
Languages: Python (core language for AI development), C++ for high-performance computing.
Takeaway: Deepen your understanding of AI theory and practical application. Master software engineering principles to build scalable and secure AI systems.

If you want to expand your career to incorporate A.I., consider the following:

Online Courses: Numerous online platforms offer AI and ML courses with varying depths. Choose reputable providers with career-oriented curriculums.

The shares of the high-end ecosystem of Drone solutions gained up to 3.5 percent after the company received a work order from Alter Dynamics & Artificial Intelligence worth Rs 53.00 lakhs. 



With a market capitalization of Rs 371.82 crore, the shares of Droneacharya Aerial Innovations Ltd were trading at Rs 155.80 per share, increasing around 3 percent as compared to the previous closing price of Rs 151.35 apiece.  
According to the company filing, Alter Dynamics & Artificial Intelligence has issued a work order to Droneacharya Aerial Innovations Ltd for Rs 53.00 lakh. The project involves the use of drones to check piles above water, meeting the demanding criteria of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Note: If you want to learn Candlesticks and Chart Trading from Scratch, here’s the best book available on Amazon!

As companies are scramble to get ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, one problem the face is finding and retaining AI talent.
For example, Meta has been extending job offers to candidates with AI experience without even interviewing them, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg went so far as to email researchers at Google’s DeepMind unit to recruit talent.
According to a recent study led by the Oxford Internet Institute, “AI skills are particularly valuable as they have high levels of skill complementarity, increasing worker wages by 21% on average.”
 
 
 













 
 

Foote Partners, a consulting and research firm, recently published its latest IT skills and pay index, which found, not surprisingly, that companies are paying premiums for workers with AI-related abilities.

Foote Partners recognizes 47 “critical A.I. skills,” and on average, employees who obtain those skills get a pay premium of 7% to 21%. Those premiums can come in different  forms, including bonuses and cash compensation.
“This is cash paid out, not as a salary increase but in addition to salary,” said David Foote, chief analyst at Foote Partners. “In fact, 28 of these core AI skills can add between 15% and 21% in pay, well above the 9.6% average premium across all 632 non-certified skills we report. They are very hot right now.”
 
 
 













 
 

Cash premiums for skills such as AI chatbot app developer and large language model (LLM) tuning are paid out separately from salaries so that as needs are met and the value of those talents declines, the payouts can be reduced or eliminated.
“Perhaps the main difference with skills pay is, unlike a bonus, skills pay premiums are typically paid out at every pay period —  same as salary — instead of a lump sum at the end of year, which is more common with bonuses,” Foote said.
In addition, more than a dozen AI-related certifications “are showing real market value strength,” he said. Those skills include prompt engineering, neural networks, AI engineer, AI scientist, and AI model optimization.
 
 
 













 
 

According to Foote, a Certified Artificial Intelligence Scientist earns the highest pay premium, ranging 8% to 12%, with the average being 10% of base salary equivalent,. The next highest cash pay premium in this cluster is for a Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate, who can earn 9% of base equivalent in skills premium pay.
Averaging 8% of base salary equivalent in skills pay premium are: SAS Certified Professional: AI and Machine Learning; IBM Certified Specialist — AI Enterprise Workflow V1; Artificial Intelligence Engineer (AIE – all tracks); and Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer certifications.
“We’ve been tracking some of these AI-related skills for many years, updating every 90 days,” Foote said. “Others have been recently added. So, given all the volatility in the marketplace for skills cash pay premiums, there have been remarkable changes over time ,including most recently.”
 
 
 













 
 

Foote Partner’s findings are echoed elsewhere. Freelance work platform Upwork, which recently published its 2024 list of most in-demand skills, found that the rise of AI — especially generative AI in the last couple of years — has changed the top skills businesses seek from independent professionals. In particular, generative AI modeling, machine learning and data analytics are the top three fastest-growing data science and analytics skills, as well as among the most in-demand skills.
“In particular, skills in key programming languages commonly used in the development of AI — Python, Java, and SQL — rank among the top five most sought-after skills on the technical side in the US,” Ya Xu, head of data and AI at LinkedIn, said in a blog post.
Machine learning skills can command at least a 10% premium compared to the average tech worker, according to a survey conducted at the end of 2023 by tech staffing firm Dice. “But this is a fast-moving market where the demand is growing rapidly,” said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. “I predict that this premium will only continue to grow as the gap between supply and demand for AI talent grows, and offering benefits such as continuous professional development and training will be key to retaining this top talent.”
 
 
 













 
 

A key differentiator in the job interview process now involves how a tech professional has upskilled themselves in the face of the growing demand for AI, Zeile noted.
“Now is the time to ensure that their skill sets encompass [LLM] theory and programming architecture, areas that may have been overlooked or haven’t been delved into fully,” he said. “Recruiters are looking for tech professionals who are quick on their feet and able to adapt to changes with agility and curiosity.”
In January 2023, AI or machine learning-related skill sets were referenced on 9% of tech job postings. Just over a year later, in February 2024, that figure had climbed to nearly 14% of all tech job postings, according to Zeile.
 
 
 













 
 

“As AI continues to evolve, its impact on organizations will be most prominent in key departments such as research and development, data analytics, and operations,” Zeile said.
To secure top AI talent in these areas, Zeile advised that companies:

Invest in comprehensive recruiting strategies that show a full understanding of what a particular AI role actually requires — whether it’s machine learning, Python, or data science skills for tech jobs, or other content-centric skills such as copy writing and graphic design. 
Establish competitive salaries and provide opportunities for professional growth and development. 
Offer flexibility in the form of hybrid/remote work environments. Dice’s 2023 Tech Sentiment Report noted that remote work remains very important to tech professionals: 73% of those surveyed said it is “extremely” or “very” important to have the opportunity to work remotely at least three days a week.

While Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are among the top 15 companies hiring for AI talent right now, according to Dice, there are a variety of factors tech pros must consider determining if Big Tech is right for them.
 
 
 













 
 

“While these Big Tech companies offer many opportunities for individuals with AI skills, candidates should also consider startups and other industries that align with their career goals and work/life balance preferences that would also still give them the ability to learn and flex their AI muscles,” Zeile said.  “Ultimately, it is up to tech professionals to decide what companies most align with their values and what kind of industries they want to work in.”

Startups, Zeille said, often provide more room for innovation and growth, but may have less rigorous AI programs in place. At the same time, compensation at Big Tech companies might be higher, but work/life balance lower. Once a candidate has decided what is important to prioritize in their future role, they can job search accordingly.

Generative AI has captured everyone’s attention — and for good reason. But getting from potential to profitability does not come without risks, such as assuming that your established processes for deploying mainstream enterprise IT infrastructure will work in the new era of complex AI superclusters.
A solid technology infrastructure has always been essential. Still, CIOs who want to ensure AI delivers on its promise will need a better idea of what’s required to design, deploy, and manage this foundational component at scale, including:

Infrastructure requirements

AI-based environments are relatively new, and trying to align traditional enterprise computing design and architecture with high-powered processors, low-latency networks, and scheduler-driven workload environments introduces a new set of challenges. Physical data center design is foundational, and the silent, longtail impact of an incorrectly provisioned system can mean launching into a “false start” deployment based on incorrect power, cooling, and network elements.
2. Performance optimization
Second to good design is the impact of complex, low-latency GPU networking fabrics. These systems require precision configuration, and while untuned systems remain functional, teams sit blissfully unaware of low-performance levels on AI workloads and, ultimately, substantial missed ROI.
Mark Seamans, Vice President of Global Marketing at Penguin/SGH, likens it to Formula 1 Racing. “An improperly configured system may seem like it’s running like a Formula 1 car, but it’s only when you put five other cars on the track that you realize your competition is blowing past you,” he says. “Making sure you work with a prescriptive set of criteria during design, build, and deployment means you can hit full Formula 1 speeds even if you’re the only one on the track.”
3. Scalability, flexibility, and reliability
When you consider AI infrastructure and its building block nature, precision becomes even more important for handling varying AI workloads effectively. Yes, that’s scalability and flexibility to accommodate changing computational demands. But, as Mark notes, “It’s also about stability as teams go through security, software, and firmware updates, or in cases of adding new AI nodes to expand cluster capacity. If the building blocks were done non-optimally, future changes could destabilize systems.”
4. Data management
Organizations are used to environments where other servers can pick up the load if one goes down. Yet, AI systems don’t operate the same way. Misconfigured networks, node failures, or even the loss of an individual GPU, can kill a job that may have been running for weeks – frustrating users and adding work for heavily burdened IT teams.  
“Penguin has developed many innovations for improving cluster performance and reliability – including a solution that isolates pending GPU failures, where we can evacuate those nodes, triage it outside of production configuration, remediate the problem, and then reprovision and put it back as a healthy node into the cluster,” says Mark.
5. Cost considerations
Cost is always a consideration, but the implications associated with AI workloads are on a larger scale. Consider a system with 1,000 nodes, each connected by ten network cables and multiple complex network fabrics. The hardware procurement, significant energy consumption for power and cooling, and maintenance costs can stretch budget constraints upfront if not balanced with deployment timelines and performance requirements. With these multi-million-dollar AI configurations, delays in bringing a system to production drives significant unnecessary costs from depreciation and missed ROI. 
Proof points from an experienced AI infrastructure partner
Over 25 years of HPC experience and more than seven years of deploying AI infrastructure at scale has made Penguin Solutions the go-to for AI platforms. With more than 50k GPUs deployed and customers like Meta relying on their specialized expertise, Penguin is ready to be the trusted partner to help every customer on their race to the future.

However, its influence on the job market has raised huge concerns. Over the past few months, we’ve witnessed a noticeable impact, particularly with the unsettling trend of layoffs at major tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon. Adding to the apprehension, ﻿NVIDIA﻿ CEO Jensen Huang has raised the alarm, suggesting that AI advancements could render coding, a cornerstone skill in computer science, obsolete in the near future.In a rapidly evolving job market influenced by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need for education to align with emerging employment trends has become increasingly crucial. Recent data reveals significant shifts in both academic preferences and industry demands, necessitating a data-driven approach to educational adaptation.MBAs becoming less lucrative or just another cyclical downturnData from educational institutions worldwide points to a concerning trend: a decline in admissions to traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. The Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) revealed a significant 13% drop in global MBA applications between 2018 and 2021. This trend persisted, with NDTV reporting a further 5% decline in 2023. Notably, European schools experienced a sharp decrease, with a 13% drop in all international applications in 2023.The dwindling interest in MBAs reflects shifting preferences among prospective students. Increasingly, individuals are seeking specialised skills tailored to emerging industries like technology and data science. This begs the question: is the MBA market experiencing a cyclical downturn, or is a more profound shift underway in the demand for full-time MBAs.Employment trends in the tech sectorA 2020 McKinsey report estimates that up to 800 million jobs globally could be lost to automation by 2030, with jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and administrative support most at risk. However, the report also highlights that up to 950 million new jobs could be created in areas like ‘data analysis’, ‘technology development’, and ‘creative content production’. Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsAnalysis of job market data reveals a growing demand for professionals with expertise in AI-related fields such as machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering. A report by LinkedIn indicates that AI-related skills, including proficiency in ‘machine learning’, ‘data structures’ and ‘natural language processing’, are among the fastest-growing in-demand skills globally (Dec 2022 onwards). Globally, professionals with bachelor’s and graduate degrees stand to see a slightly greater level of disruption (55% and 52%, respectively) than professionals with high school diplomas and associate degrees (50% and 47%, respectively), which suggest that they may face relatively more urgency to adapt their skills by adopting AI tools. Education trends in the AI driven marketAs the demands of the job market shift in response to technological advancements, educational institutions are reassessing their course offerings to remain relevant in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data-driven insights suggest that traditional courses focused solely on theoretical concepts may soon become redundant, while those integrating AI and emerging technologies are witnessing a surge in demand. For instance, enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicates a notable increase in computer science programs with specialisations in AI and data analytics in the USA.So, which skills will see an upsurge?Data fluency: In the AI era, proficiency in data fluency is paramount. Students need to master statistical analysis, programming languages like Python (as preferred by 88% of data scientists according to a 2023 poll by KDnuggets), and data visualization tools to thrive in data-driven environments.Critical thinking and problem-solving: With AI automating routine tasks, human-centric skills like critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and creativity are more crucial than ever. Educational programs should prioritise these skills to equip students for the unpredictable challenges of tomorrow.Continuous learning: Given the rapid pace of technological change, fostering a culture of lifelong learning is imperative. Educational institutions must instill in students the value of continuous skill development and adaptation to new technologies to remain competitive in the evolving job market.In an intriguing twist, it’s noteworthy how rapidly the relevance of certain fields of study is evolving. What was once considered knowledge for a lifetime now faces redundancy in less than a decade—a phenomenon previously unheard of.ISRO like Institute for TechnologyTo ensure India doesn't fall behind in the next technological wave, there's a pressing need to establish institutions akin to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) but tailored for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies. Just as ISRO propelled India into the space race, these institutions could spearhead our efforts to catch up with other countries in the realm of AI and new technologies.Given that we are behind many countries in the AI race, it's imperative for India to invest in building robust research and development infrastructure focused on AI and related fields. By fostering innovation and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, we can position ourselves as leaders in the global AI landscape.""Universal Basic Income: Addressing mass unemployment debateAs mass unemployment becomes a stark reality in the wake of technological advancements, it's time to initiate discussions on implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI). With automation and AI displacing traditional jobs at an unprecedented rate, UBI offers a pragmatic solution to ensure financial stability for individuals facing job loss. By providing a guaranteed income floor, UBI not only alleviates immediate financial hardships but also promotes economic resilience and empowers individuals to adapt to the changing job market through retraining and upskilling initiatives. It's imperative to engage in open dialogue and explore innovative policy measures to address the challenges posed by mass unemployment effectively.The adaptation of education to the needs of the AI-driven job market requires a data-driven approach informed by empirical evidence and industry trends. By analyzing academic preferences, employment trends, and skill demands, educational institutions can tailor their offerings to equip students with the competencies needed for success in the digital age. Through the strategic integration of AI-driven technologies, education can become equitable, accessible, personalised, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of learners and employers alike.Edited by Megha Reddy(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)Advertise with usArtificial IntelligenceEducationUnemploymentAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1Union BudgetUnion Budget 2024: Live updates2FundingStable Money raises over Rs 123 Cr in Series A CCPS round3EventsStartup TN on a mission to encourage world-class, deeptech, ground-breaking startups4NewsIndia's renewable energy sector to attract Rs 30.5 lakh Cr investment by 2030: Economic Survey5FundingCoworking startup Incuspaze raises $8M from Indian Inflection Opportunity FundAdvertise with usAdvertise with us

However, its influence on the job market has raised huge concerns. Over the past few months, we’ve witnessed a noticeable impact, particularly with the unsettling trend of layoffs at major tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon. Adding to the apprehension,  CEO Jensen Huang has raised the alarm, suggesting that AI advancements could render coding, a cornerstone skill in computer science, obsolete in the near future.
In a rapidly evolving job market influenced by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need for education to align with emerging employment trends has become increasingly crucial. Recent data reveals significant shifts in both academic preferences and industry demands, necessitating a data-driven approach to educational adaptation.
MBAs becoming less lucrative or just another cyclical downturn
Data from educational institutions worldwide points to a concerning trend: a decline in admissions to traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. The Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) revealed a significant 13% drop in global MBA applications between 2018 and 2021. This trend persisted, with NDTV reporting a further 5% decline in 2023. Notably, European schools experienced a sharp decrease, with a 13% drop in all international applications in 2023.
The dwindling interest in MBAs reflects shifting preferences among prospective students. Increasingly, individuals are seeking specialised skills tailored to emerging industries like technology and data science. This begs the question: is the MBA market experiencing a cyclical downturn, or is a more profound shift underway in the demand for full-time MBAs.
Employment trends in the tech sector
A 2020 McKinsey report estimates that up to 800 million jobs globally could be lost to automation by 2030, with jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and administrative support most at risk. However, the report also highlights that up to 950 million new jobs could be created in areas like ‘data analysis’, ‘technology development’, and ‘creative content production’. 
Analysis of job market data reveals a growing demand for professionals with expertise in AI-related fields such as machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering. A report by LinkedIn indicates that AI-related skills, including proficiency in ‘machine learning’, ‘data structures’ and ‘natural language processing’, are among the fastest-growing in-demand skills globally (Dec 2022 onwards). 
Globally, professionals with bachelor’s and graduate degrees stand to see a slightly greater level of disruption (55% and 52%, respectively) than professionals with high school diplomas and associate degrees (50% and 47%, respectively), which suggest that they may face relatively more urgency to adapt their skills by adopting AI tools. 
Education trends in the AI driven market
As the demands of the job market shift in response to technological advancements, educational institutions are reassessing their course offerings to remain relevant in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data-driven insights suggest that traditional courses focused solely on theoretical concepts may soon become redundant, while those integrating AI and emerging technologies are witnessing a surge in demand. For instance, enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicates a notable increase in computer science programs with specialisations in AI and data analytics in the USA.
So, which skills will see an upsurge?
Data fluency: In the AI era, proficiency in data fluency is paramount. Students need to master statistical analysis, programming languages like Python (as preferred by 88% of data scientists according to a 2023 poll by KDnuggets), and data visualization tools to thrive in data-driven environments.

Critical thinking and problem-solving: With AI automating routine tasks, human-centric skills like critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and creativity are more crucial than ever. Educational programs should prioritise these skills to equip students for the unpredictable challenges of tomorrow.

Continuous learning: Given the rapid pace of technological change, fostering a culture of lifelong learning is imperative. Educational institutions must instill in students the value of continuous skill development and adaptation to new technologies to remain competitive in the evolving job market.

In an intriguing twist, it’s noteworthy how rapidly the relevance of certain fields of study is evolving. What was once considered knowledge for a lifetime now faces redundancy in less than a decade—a phenomenon previously unheard of.
ISRO like Institute for Technology
To ensure India doesn't fall behind in the next technological wave, there's a pressing need to establish institutions akin to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) but tailored for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies. Just as ISRO propelled India into the space race, these institutions could spearhead our efforts to catch up with other countries in the realm of AI and new technologies.
Given that we are behind many countries in the AI race, it's imperative for India to invest in building robust research and development infrastructure focused on AI and related fields. By fostering innovation and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, we can position ourselves as leaders in the global AI landscape.""
Universal Basic Income: Addressing mass unemployment debate
As mass unemployment becomes a stark reality in the wake of technological advancements, it's time to initiate discussions on implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI). With automation and AI displacing traditional jobs at an unprecedented rate, UBI offers a pragmatic solution to ensure financial stability for individuals facing job loss. 
By providing a guaranteed income floor, UBI not only alleviates immediate financial hardships but also promotes economic resilience and empowers individuals to adapt to the changing job market through retraining and upskilling initiatives. It's imperative to engage in open dialogue and explore innovative policy measures to address the challenges posed by mass unemployment effectively.
The adaptation of education to the needs of the AI-driven job market requires a data-driven approach informed by empirical evidence and industry trends. By analyzing academic preferences, employment trends, and skill demands, educational institutions can tailor their offerings to equip students with the competencies needed for success in the digital age. Through the strategic integration of AI-driven technologies, education can become equitable, accessible, personalised, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of learners and employers alike.

UT Partners With Grammarly to Guide Effective Generative AI Use in Higher Education

                          By:
                        Hannah Conrad


















The University of Texas at Austin has teamed up with Grammarly for Education, an AI-enabled writing assistant, to investigate the adoption of generative artificial intelligence in a broad academic setting.
This project, led by UT’s Office of Academic Technology and in alignment with the University’s Year of AI initiative, will be broken into two phases. First, there will be a testing phase during which students, faculty and staff will interact with Grammarly’s generative AI assistant. Faculty and staff participants will design generative AI activities relevant to their own work areas and test those activities with students and peers. Second, faculty will create more detailed lesson plans to engage students in generative AI learning activities — all vetted to meet UT’s academic standards.
“We strive to be involved in projects that will influence higher education on and beyond the Forty Acres,” said Art Markman, vice provost for academic affairs. “We are in an era with a lot of uncertainty surrounding AI and education. This is a chance to demonstrate how to use generative AI as a positive source for education, teach responsibility to our students, and engage an industry leader to improve our understanding of classroom AI.”
Grammarly’s GenAI assistant
All participants in the project will receive a short-term Grammarly for Education pilot license. Training on Grammarly for Education and the AI assistant will be provided.
“We’re thrilled to partner with UT on such a forward-looking project,” said Mary Rose Craycraft, head of customer success at Grammarly for Education. “We know that innovating with AI while preserving academic integrity and critical thinking is a key challenge that all institutions are grappling with right now. We look forward to working with UT to develop best practices that can scale responsible AI adoption across the sector.”
Projects like the Grammarly adoption are carefully assessed and vetted by the Office of Academic Technology through a Learning Technology Adoption Process (LTAP). LTAPs provide a strategic and coordinated approach to data-driven adoption of academic technology ensuring the University only adopts and promotes tools on campus that align with its principles of effective teaching. The process protects students and faculty from adopting short-term technologies or those unsuitable for information security regulations.
Ultimately, the University’s coordination and partnership with emerging learning technology platforms leads to decisions that are in the best interest of students, staff and faculty. By collaborating with those who will be using generative AI tools most through case studies and active feedback, the Office of Academic Technology aims to engage in both AI-forward and AI-responsible teaching and learning at UT Austin.
“Our primary generative AI strategy is to use evidence-based decision-making to drive effective, forward and responsible AI use in ways that advance the teaching and learning mission of the University,” said Julie Schell, assistant vice provost of academic technology. “We are very excited to work with Grammarly to engage the UT community and create generative AI activities and lesson plans vetted by UT faculty, staff and students that can be scaled with any generative AI tool.”

Artificial intelligence is predicted to impact 17% of Saudi Arabian jobs in the next 3 years, according to international experts.
According to Arab media, Najla Najam, a professional business manager of an American consulting business company, said that AI is expected not only to change the way people work but also possible that it will replace people.
Experts predict that AI will have an impact on 80% of creative jobs and that it will risk 53% of executive positions.
While the study found that Middle Eastern workers are more involved in productivity problems than workers in other countries, it is also anticipated that companies would provide their workers training to help them adjust to the demands of the new era.
A large number of those affected by artificial intelligence will be people from the 90s to the 21st century whose jobs may be at risk.
Oliver, director of the Middle East affairs of a global consultancy firm, said that considering the future changing conditions, it can be said that 17% of jobs in the Kingdom will be replaced by artificial intelligence within 3 years.

SHAH ALAM - The imminent surge of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionise Malaysia's job market, with certain sectors bracing for more profound impacts than others.AdChoicesADVERTISING
Among the industries expected to undergo significant transformation are manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and finance.
Speaking to Sinar Daily, Universiti Selangor (Unisel) Head of Communication Department Munirah Ilias said that AI-driven automation is set to replace repetitive tasks in factories, while AI-powered logistics systems will streamline delivery and inventory management.
""In customer service, the integration of chatbots is projected to handle a larger volume of inquiries.
""Similarly, within the finance industry, AI holds the potential to tailor financial advice and enhance fraud detection,"" she said.
Artificial Intelligence is not a threat
Contrary to popular apprehensions, Munirah stressed that AI should not be perceived as a threat to Malaysian workers but rather as a catalyst for transformation.
By prioritising reskilling, nurturing human-centric workplaces, and emphasising meaningful work, she believes Malaysia can smoothly transition into an AI-driven future.

""While technology may streamline labour-intensive tasks, it will concurrently create new job opportunities that necessitate advanced technological skills,"" she said.
Preparing for automation and AI-driven changes
To prepare for the evolving job market, Munirah stressed the importance of continuous upskilling and reskilling.
She encouraged workers to focus on areas complementary to AI, such as data analysis, programming, and machine learning, as these skills will enable them to collaborate effectively with AI systems.
""Lifelong learning is essential, given the ever-evolving technological landscape.
""Cultivate a curious mindset and stay abreast of the latest advancements in AI and its implications for your specific field,"" she added.
Moreover, Munirah highlighted the significance of honing human-centric skills, which remain indispensable in an AI-driven workplace.
""Critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, effective communication, and emotional intelligence are qualities that AI cannot replicate.
""The human touch remains irreplaceable, and these skills will become even more invaluable as AI integration deepens,"" she affirmed,"" she stressed.
Potential benefits of AI adoption in Malaysian industries
On the potential benefits of AI adoption across various industries in Malaysia, Munirah pointed out its transformative potential.
While certain job roles may undergo transformation, she believes the overall impact will be more about job evolution than elimination.
""Observing industry trends, it's evident that repetitive tasks are most susceptible to automation.
""AI-powered robots are now proficient in executing monotonous tasks across production shifts, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced labour costs,"" she added.

Staff Photo by Mark Kennedy / The AI representative at the car dealership appeared on-screen as the universal symbol for “men's restroom.”



I had my first known encounter with artificial intelligence last week.Here's what happened: I was shopping for a vehicle online. It's what I do for fun. All five cars and trucks in my family's fleet are at least 9 years old. We have one Ford truck that just turned 51 years old, the same age as Elon Musk. So I always have an excuse to look for something newer.(READ MORE: Why we Americans love our pickup trucks)I say this was my first ""known encounter"" with AI because I might have had more encounters that I am simply not aware of. But I'm 99% sure this one was an actual online conversation with AI, because the ""intelligence"" involved refused to answer my simple question: ""Are you a human being?""Presumably, most actual humans would think that was a silly question and mutter something like, ""Yep, this is Chad in Chattanooga.""Instead, my AI assistant changed the subject.Anyway, I'm scrolling a local car dealership's website looking for a particular vehicle, with a certain V6 engine, which I had been led to believe by a non-AI source (a.k.a. a YouTuber) would land in car stores this fall. Naturally, I wanted to know if ""fall"" meant September or December, or something in between. So I typed my question into the little pop-up window that's ubiquitous on car dealer websites. It's usually accompanied by a mug shot of a young woman named Emily or Hannah who is dutifully standing by in a headset to assist you.ADVERTISEMENTBut this time there was no head shot of a young woman, just the outline of a featureless white man inside a blue circle, the universal symbol for ""men's restroom."" Hmm. I realized this is what AI would think is a generic mug shot of himself.The prompt said, ""How can I assist you in your search for a new vehicle today?""I typed in my first and last name, my question and the fact that I was a repeat customer at that particular store, hoping that would distinguish me from the other time wasters populating the site.About one second after I made the last keystroke, my AI assistant hit me back with a multisentence response that read something like this:""Hi, Mark. Thanks for asking about the six-cylinder (name of the vehicle). We are excited about the arrival of that model later this year. I have passed your request along, and someone from our team will contact you as soon as one arrives at the dealership.""It felt like I was talking to the voice of Young Sheldon.(READ MORE: Car-buying tips for teen drivers and their parents.)""Nobody can type that fast,"" I wrote back immediately. ""Are you a human being or AI?""""I am here to assist you with all your automotive needs,"" Restroom Man reasserted, without answering my question.ADVERTISEMENTThat's when it hit me: Somewhere there's an Emily or Hannah out of a job because of Restroom Man. I realized this is what they're talking about when they say AI will be coming for our careers.Let me point out that the AI assistant gave me a perfectly polite, well-punctuated but essentially useless reply. A real-person answer would have been: ""Thanks, let me check in the office and get back to you with a date on that V6. Can I email or text you?""As it happens, a real person from the dealership did call me two days later, but by then my need for the info had passed. I let the call roll to voicemail.

However, their application could widen over time as the technology progresses. ChatGPT, Llama, Google’s latest AI offering, Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot are all large language models (LLMs). These are algorithms that can analyze, summarize, predict and generate new content using deep learning techniques and large data sets. LLMs are typically trained using around one billion or more variables, though there is no consensus as to how much data is needed to train an LLM.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesLLMs get an upgradeDespite the advantages associated with generative AI – simplifying, speeding and automating previously manual work – its weak points have also become apparent. Not only are there ethical and security concerns with AI’s application, but as TechTarget points out, there are issues such as bias – which may be hard to identify and remove – and hallucinations – when an AI engine provides a wrong answer. An investigation by the Washington Post last year showed that an AI image generator defaulted to outdated Western stereotypes when asked to produce images of attractive people or houses around the world. Continuous training and evolving LLM algorithms are key to addressing these issues and to advancing generative AI applications. Alongside reducing bias and hallucinations, the developers’ ambition for both ChatGPT 5 and Llama 3 is to take the engines beyond simple chatbots. To widen the scope of applications to more complex tasks, it will be crucial to enable LLMs to reason, plan and retain information. They will also have to learn to gauge the effects of their actions, the Financial Times points out.Another development area for both Llama and ChatGPT is multimodality, allowing AI to process not just text but speech, images, code and videos. Moreover, greater levels of personalization are expected to be part of the next-generation offering.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. Addressing ethical issues in generative AIGPT-5 is understood to be undergoing rigorous testing and training, with a strong focus on safety protocols to address ethical concerns. However, in trying to eliminate bias and errors, generative AI companies can inadvertently achieve the opposite, as Google found to its detriment. When originally launched, the image generation module of its Gemini platform was generating images of historically white groups like the US Founding Fathers or 1930s German soldiers as people of colour, or produced female hockey players when prompted for images of a well-known league that’s exclusively male. In trying to weed out bias, Google had unintentionally overcorrected its AI engine. However, such fine-tuning will be a constant feature as generative AI engines continue to evolve. And as the use of AI expands and organizations are creating their own LLMs or adapting the major platform for their purposes, the need for solid governance frameworks remains a topical issue. For example, the World Economic Forum has proposed the Presidio AI Framework, which promotes safety, ethics and innovation with early guardrails to guide development.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on this topicSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

HOBOKEN, N.J., May 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- New research from Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), the world's leading learning company, shows the massive potential of Generative AI to boost workplace productivity by helping US workers to save 78 million hours a week on the routine and repetitive tasks that often fill their day and lead to burnout.
The latest installment of Pearson's Skills Outlook series, 'Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work' - looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).
Pearson's workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.
The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the US are: 

Maintain health or medical records (3,568,000 hrs per week)
Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (3,132,000 hrs)
Develop educational programs, plans or procedures (2,946,000 hrs)
Maintain operational records (2,032,000 hrs)
Present research or technical information (1,782,000 hrs)
Develop safety standards, policies, or procedures (1,696,000 hrs)
Assess student capabilities, needs, or performance (1,663,000 hrs)
Prepare legal or regulatory documents (1,638,000 hrs)
Collect data about consumer needs or opinions (1,607,000 hrs)
Prepare informational or instructional materials (1,585,000 hrs)

By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership. 
At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance. 
Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:
""In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.""
At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson's proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.
Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the US on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years' time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

When generative AI art tools like Dall-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney first appeared in 2022, they dazzled users by producing complex images in a variety of artistic and photographic styles from simple text prompts. But the novelty of the technology soon gave way to questions and concerns. How would we deal with a flood of synthetic imagery that was difficult or impossible to distinguish from reality? How would these tools disrupt the economics of the media, entertainment, advertising, publishing and commercial art industries? And what are the legal and ethical implications of building generative AI systems using data “scraped” from the Internet, including work under copyright, without consent or compensation?


Over the past two years, these concerns and the increasingly apparent implications of generative AI on business, society and politics have triggered responses from the arts community. Last summer, writers and actors unions went on strike largely to secure rules around the use of AI in the entertainment industry to protect human creators. Commercial artists working in videogame and media production, special effects, animation, illustration, comics and advertising lack that kind of unity and central organization, but are becoming increasingly outspoken, well informed and resourceful in their efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI, despite being up against the best narrative of inevitability that billions of dollars can buy.

“Generative AI products are riddled with theft and legal problems,” said Karla Ortiz, a concept artist who is one of the named plaintiffs in class action suits against several of the companies developing generative AI technology. “There has to be a better way to implement this technology than a system that steals from artists for the profit of big tech companies. It’s disgusting.”

Others are active on social media, naming and shaming examples of AI-generated imagery that is infiltrating the culture, including artists who misrepresent work made with AI as their own and “tech bros” who welcome the replacement of “elitist” human artists with tools that de-skill the creation of artwork into “prompt engineering.” A Facebook group called “Artists Against Generative AI” counts over 160,000 members.

Now this effort is receiving support from an unexpected quarter: tech entrepreneurs and researchers building countermeasures to help creators and consumers restore some reality to an increasingly surreal AI-dominated landscape. These approaches fall under three main categories: “poisoning the well” using code that corrupts AI data models if images are scanned without permission; spotting the fakes using algorithms that can spot the fingerprints of AI at the pixel level; and authenticating the real by encoding original, human-produced images at the point of creation.

Poisoning the WellBen Zhao, professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, and developer of Glaze and ... [+] NightshadeCourtesy of Ben Zhao
One of the most promising and popular countermeasures uses code embedded in the images that, if the image is used in AI data training without consent, “poisons” the sample, rendering it useless. The main tools for this, Glaze and Nightshade, were developed by a team at the University of Chicago led by computer science professor Ben Zhao.
“My focus has been on protecting human creators, especially those most vulnerable and least represented, such as artists, musicians, writers, choreographers, dancers, and voice actors,” said Zhao. “These groups are heavily impacted by generative AI in terms of employment, personal attacks using deepfakes and revenge porn, identity theft, phishing scams, and style mimicry. So, my recent work aims to defend these people against the abuses of AI.”
Zhao and his team were originally focused on the problems of AI-based facial recognition systems, but shifted focus toward artists in 2022 when the first generative art tool like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-E2 first appeared. Zhao says he joined a town hall on AI convened by Ortiz, where over 500 artists shared their concerns about the emerging technology.
“After that call, we realized we could adapt our techniques to disrupt the training of AI on artists' work,” he said. This led to the creation of the Glaze project and the technology called Nightshade. Artists can download the tool and apply it to their work before posting it online as a way to thwart the companies that hoover up images to train their models without consent or compensation.
“Think of Nightshade as technical enforcement of copyright,” Zhao says. “If you disrespect the copyright by training on content without the owner’s consent, it will start to eat your model from the inside and cause all sorts of corruption, leading to complete model collapse.”
The first public application of Glaze was on a work by Ortiz, who said she felt a tremendous surge of relief at the ability to share her artwork again on social media without fear of it being used to train robots designed to replace her.""Musa Victoriosa"" an original artwork by Karla Ortiz, was the first public application of Glaze, ... [+] computer code that ""poisons"" AI training data if scraped without permission.Art by Karla Ortiz
The uptake has been rapid and overwhelming. Zhao says it has been downloaded over 2.6 million times worldwide. Because the economics of the AI business dictate that companies continue to train, refine and deploy their models, the possibility that some of the “training data” (aka artwork) might include the “poison” code could be enough to force the big players to change their attitude about helping themselves to other people’s work.
Spotting the Fakes
Whereas Nightshade attempts to address the problem of data scraping and IP theft at the source, another countermeasure can help identify the output of generative AI systems by spotting the fakes. One of the leading tools is a free, online consumers service developed by Hive, a commercial company that builds AI models for content moderation and other industry-specific applications.
“A lot of people think AI systems are getting so good that it is, or will soon become, impossible to detect,” said Kevin Guo, cofounder and CEO of Hive. “We believe they are incorrect. It is definitely possible, and our tool has shown that you can differentiate with high fidelity and confidence.”
Guo says the Hive Moderation tool allows users to check images, text, video and other content to identify whether generative AI has been involved in the creation. Just drag and drop the sample onto the tool and it returns a confidence level between 0-100%, depending on how extensive the presence of synthetic content. Consumers are limited to several hundred tests per day, but Hive sells a commercial version for enterprise customers as well.The Hive Moderation tool can help identify synthetic AI-generated content, even work that visually ... [+] resembles human-created artwork and photograhy.Hive
“We’re a for-profit company building proprietary models, but we offer this for free because it’s a nice tool,” said Guo. “We want to help people, especially with the election coming up, be sure that what you’re looking at is real.”
While positively identifying AI-generated content is a moving target, Guo says the model rarely if ever produces false positives – that is, misidentifying human-created work as AI in cases where the artist has been heavily sampled by models. “To your human eye, the outputs can look similar, but they are not. The relationship is so distinct for these diffusion models that it is just completely different from how humans would create content.”
Verifying What’s Real
In addition to spotting the fakes, another tactic coming into use is authenticating human-created content at the source, so both artists and consumers can gain assurance, and control, over their original work.
One startup in the space, Swear, just released an app that watermarks photos and videos at the moment of creation to provide a baseline to identify any future modification, whether by traditional digital tools like Photoshop, or by AI.
“Swear is a company with a single focus: protecting the authenticity of digital content,” said Jason Crawforth, founder and CEO of Swear. “While you're recording something—I'll use video as an example since it's the most evocative type of content—whether it’s on a smartphone, a police body cam, or a security camera, we capture frames, visual aspects, audio aspects, and metadata. For a smartphone video, for instance, we create a fingerprint of every frame in real time. This fingerprint, or hash, is a one-way formula that maps every pixel of a frame. If even a single pixel is changed, the fingerprint changes.”
The main application Crawforth envisions for Swear is forensic, certifying the authenticity of surveillance video and other digital evidence used in legal proceedings, medical and scientific studies, logistics and finance. He also believes authenticating archival content will become important in the future, in cases where bad actors fabricate historical documents or imagery to create or enforce their own narratives.
“Our technology addresses several issues, including deep fakes and synthetic content,” said Crawforth, but added it is not necessarily a solution for artwork as opposed to photo or video content, since it does not include a way to incorporate its technology into art creation platforms.
For that scenario, we are starting to see some software makers respond to the challenges of AI by giving artists and their audiences more transparency into the way digital artwork is created. One of the first out of the gate with a potential solution is Magma, a collaborative creative platform that combines professional design tools with workflow and social media capabilities.
Magma, which had previously run afoul of the anti-AI art community for implementing a version of Stable Diffusion built on scraped content, recently deployed a feature developed by Story Protocol, which automatically tracks and tags the exact usage of AI in the creation of any image on the platform as a way of verifying compliance with copyright, workplace rules, ethical standards and transparency.
According to Story Protocol, “Programmability means giving creative assets built-in rights for enforcement, remixing, and monetization. Story Protocol allows creators to attach legally binding and automatically enforced rights onto their work through the blockchain. Creators seamlessly set the pricing and permission terms for how their work can be used. Anyone interested in using that work can then accept the terms and license it in a single click.”
“It’s something we offer our B2B clients like animation or game studios, who may have trained models on their house style,” said Magma COO Oli Strong. “We believe AI will be part of the workflow of the future, but we want to make sure it is introduced in a safe, responsible and protective way.”
Strong says the technology assures the provenance of a piece of work so the artist can prove AI was not involved, or remove the layers and elements where it was. “We can literally produce a certificate that demonstrates the artist is responsible for each layer, and that no other technologies were involved,” he says.
Both Magma and Swear use blockchain as the method for registering ownership and authenticity, as it is the best way to provide an immutable, decentralized ledger for digital assets. That may get them into trouble with some artists who are as down on blockchain due to its association with scammers, cryptocurrency, NFTs, environmental impact and tech bros, as they are against AI.
Swear’s Crawforth acknowledges that recent business developments have brought the technology into disrepute, but contends it is just a tool for achieving the larger goal of authoritatively telling truth and reality from AI-generated fiction. “Our use of blockchain is simply a method to create a distributed ledger that no single entity controls,” he explained. “This ensures the authenticity and ownership of digital content without the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrency mining.”
Ragtag Rebels vs The AI Empire
None of these approaches offer any guarantees. The generative AI juggernaut is well funded and entirely convinced of its own inevitability. The performance and scale of blockchain may not be up to the task of authenticating so much content; AI developers are locked in an arms race to punch holes in technologies designed to slow them down. If all else fails, the financial might of the big players might be enough to “catch and kill” any remedies that prove especially effective.
Amid the hype, the demand for countermeasures serves to call attention the underlying ethics of a technology dependent on stolen (sorry, “scraped”) content for its raw material, whose essential value proposition is the displacement of human creators and the centralization of control in the hands of management. These tools may not be perfect, but they put some potent weapons in the hands of the ragtag group of rebels raging against the machine. Death Stars have been blown up with less.

Technology   //   May 22, 2024How chief learning officers are upskilling employees with generative AI By Cloey Callahan

How we learn and develop within organizations is getting a makeover, thanks to generative AI. 
Figuring out exactly what that looks like, is the job of chief learning officers. And for now, much of the focus is on pinpointing what rapidly emerging skills are needed from employees, to keep companies competitive in today’s fast-paced environment. 
That’s been a priority for Deloitte’s CLO Anthony Stephan, a nearly two-decade veteran of the firm, who has been in the role for a year.
“I recognize the pandemic created a lot of difficulty, a lot of hardship, and that people are still experiencing lingering effects of it,” said Stephan. “It was also a trigger for change, for transformation, and moving us in a direction from physical experiences to virtualizing over 5,000 offerings essentially overnight. But it was an awareness, an awakening that we can absolutely deliver value upskilling in virtual environments.”
At the core of that is tapping new technologies including generative AI, to ensure internal learning and development programs are geared toward upskilling people in the areas needed by businesses, in an accelerated timeframe, he stressed. 








            ""We’re realizing given a lot of the complexity and pace of change, we need to focus immediately upon arrival on upskilling people in the hottest tech skills.""        


 

                Anthony Stephan, Deloitte’s chief learning officer.            







He believes this is “critically important,” especially in professional services to meet clients’ needs. And while tech upskilling used to be saved just for employees who might have been in the workforce for a long time, it’s now necessary for everyone immediately. Stephan has noticed they’ve had to pick up slack from universities that have been slower to adopt and teach new technology like AI. 
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for universities and academic institutions to keep up with this pace of change in upskilling people,” said Stephan. “People used to come from universities and be able to apply the skills immediately in the work environment. But now we’re realizing given a lot of the complexity and pace of change, we need to focus immediately upon arrival on upskilling people in the hottest tech skills – AI, Cloud, SEO.”

It’s one of the reasons why Deloitte announced last year Project 120, a $1.4 billion investment to enhance professional development experiences for Deloitte professionals. 
Naturally, keeping tabs on the ROI of this upskilling is a priority also. For Stephan that means monitoring how the learning is later applied by employees, to generate outputs, will determine the program’s success, rather than how many people have completed a training course. 
“We’re focused on creating learning that’s moving in the direction of desired outcomes, not 25,000 people through an AI Academy, but 25,000 people through an AI Academy that is deployed within 90 days,” said Stephan. “That expected outcome is where we are moving.”
Online course provider Coursera has a similar approach for both internal and external learners. “It’s all [the future of learning] about AI,” said Trena Minudri, Coursera’s CLO. When the Generative AI boom began in early 2023, the company quickly embedded a GPT into its OKRs, internal projects, learning sessions, and company-wide demos. The company even rebranded its annual “make-a-thon,” where the company brainstorms new programs and solutions, to an “AI-thon” last year. This year, it’s back to its regular name because everyone is incorporating AI on their own at this point. 
“At first it’s adoption awareness, opening up people’s minds to GenAI and being willing to try it with the growth mindset,” said Minudri. “Now we can look at the application on the job and how it’s pushing our company forward.”







            “At first it’s adoption awareness, opening up people’s minds to GenAI and being willing to try it with the growth mindset. Now we can look at the application on the job and how it’s pushing our company forward.”

GenAI sits at the core of many of its initiatives, including having a chatbot “coach,” course builders, and translations. People even began asking last year if they could use their internal GPT during the annual performance review cycle for evaluations. This year, everyone was trained on how to use it and create a more non-biased review. 
The result: People cut out upwards of three to five hours on the process. But what really stands out to Minudri is the anecdotal feedback, which is what drives more people to try AI for themselves. 
“When you talk about the diffusion of innovation and really helping employees come on board, and getting people’s buy-in, the stories are more impactful than the data,” said Minudri. “Telling a story around a particular manager who used GPT in our playground to do the performance review and the value that brought to them, the way that they appreciated the data, how it was less biased, goes a lot further in pulling people into the fold, especially after you’ve moved beyond your early adopters.”

Artificial Intelligence: Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed his views on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on employment during a startup and tech event in Paris on Thursday. Speaking remotely via webcam at the Viva Tech event, Musk predicted that AI will eventually eliminate all jobs. He remarked, ""Probably none of us will have a job,"" suggesting that the advent of advanced AI technology will render traditional employment obsolete, CNN reported.   



However, Musk indicated that this development might not be entirely negative. According to him, he envisions a future where having a job would be ""optional,"" implying that people could pursue work out of interest rather than necessity. ""If you want to do a job that's kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want,"" Musk added. 
Universal high income: Beyond basic support
Musk emphasised that for a future where jobs are optional to be successful, there would need to be a ""universal high income."" He clarified that this concept should not be confused with Universal Basic Income (UBI). While Musk did not elaborate much on the specifics of universal high income, he distinguished it from UBI, which involves the government providing a set amount of money to all individuals regardless of their earnings.
The Tesla CEO's comments suggested that a more substantial financial safety net than UBI might be necessary to support individuals in a world where traditional jobs are scarce due to advancements in AI. This approach could ensure that people have sufficient income to maintain a good quality of life even without conventional employment, he added. 
'AI capabilities have advanced rapidly'
""There would be no shortage of goods or services,"" Musk stated. He highlighted that AI capabilities have advanced rapidly over the past few years, advancing so quickly that regulators, companies, and users are still figuring out how to utilize the technology responsibly. In the past also Musk has expressed his concerns about AI. During his keynote on Thursday, he described the technology as his biggest fear. He cited the ""Culture Book Series"" by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized depiction of a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and ""the best envisioning of a future AI.""
On role for human in AI world
Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled in a future without jobs. ""The question will really be one of meaning - if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?"" Musk said. He added, ""I do think there's perhaps still a role for humans in this - in that we may give AI meaning.""
He also advised parents to control and limit the amount of social media their children consume, saying that social media platforms ""are being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI."" It should be mentioned here that Industry experts are continuously raising concerns over how various industries and jobs will be transformed as AI proliferates in the market.

Prashant Singh, Chief Operating Officer at LeadSquared, joins Pravin Mittal, Director of Engineering of Amazon Aurora, for a discussion on using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to scale their omnichannel customer service application while controlling costs. LeadSquared helps customers build truly connected, empowered, and self-reliant sales and service organizations, with the power of automation.
This Executive Conversation is one of a series of discussions held with those progressing their industries where we seek to learn more about their discovery, ingenuity, and use of data and machine learning (ML).
Pravin Mittal (PM): While your business is very successful, what’s one unique characteristic about your company that sets you apart for your customers?
Prashant Singh (PS): LeadSquared empowers organizations to run high-velocity sales at scale around the world. We aim to build truly connected, empowered, and self-reliant sales organizations, with the power of automation. Our sales tech stack—sales execution, digital onboarding, and marketing, process, and field force automation—currently empowers over 250,000 users worldwide. What really sets us apart is the deep level of automation we have created for the specific industries we target.
PM: How have the service expectations of customers changed in the last 5 years, and how have you adapted LeadSquared to meet those expectations?
PS: Today, customers expect to be able to get in touch with their suppliers and business service providers anytime and in whatever channel they want. We had to adopt and build an omnichannel service across our suite of applications from sales to service in the LeadSquared CRM powered by Converse. Converse is our multi-channel messaging platform that helps businesses have real-time conversations with leads and customers.
Customers are also looking for shorter turnaround time to resolve their support queries and provide an end-to-end ticketing solution powered by AI. Our LeadSquared Service CRM provides a comprehensive platform that empowers businesses to transcend beyond basic ticketing by providing centralized support across multiple channels (like email, phone, chat, and chatbots), personalized interactions driven by AI, data-driven insights, and seamless integration with LeadSquared Sales CRM and other CRM tools.
PM: With the onset of generative AI, how has LeadSquared evolved its omnichannel services and ticketing solutions to improve customer experience?
PS: Chatbots and emails are crucial channels often leveraged by customers. Converse supported only menu-based and a natural language processing (NLP)-based conversational chatbots. There was an opportunity to upgrade the capabilities of Converse to provide chatbot functionality to answer frequently asked questions, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers to potential leads.
With the rollout of Service CRM, the role of Converse has become more and more important as it provides chatbot functionality for Service CRM users and helps in providing relevant answers to customer queries with quick turnaround time, thus providing a positive customer experience. We also realized that Service CRM can assist customer support agents by providing a summary of case notes, identify customer sentiment based on previous conversations, and generate relevant responses.
Incorporating these requirements was very expensive because before generative AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), there was no way to automate the first-line service experience with chatbots in a way that incorporated customer data into the conversation easily and cost-effectively. We are now able to embed our customers’ unique business system data with RAG into each LeadSquared application we build for our customers. Our recently launched Service CRM is able to assist our agents by providing them a summary of case notes, and detect customer sentiment based on case history, and has improved agent’s ability to attend to more support cases, respond faster, understand customer sentiment better, thus reducing churn.
These new offerings are now part of the existing services module right out of the box and integrated to our CRM platform, bringing easy-to-use efficiencies to our customers.
PM: Did you run into any challenges leveraging generative AI in Converse and Service CRM products, and how did AWS services help?
PS: Users of the Converse platform expressed a need for expedited onboarding of chatbot functionality and more relevant responses based on their business data. Accelerating this onboarding process presented several challenges, including the time-consuming tasks of training the bot to respond to frequently asked questions and their variations, comprehending the customer domain, identifying high-volume yet low-value queries, and managing dialogue effectively. Lack of proper training data could lead to chatbots misinterpreting user intent and struggling to address unexpected questions. Additionally, dialogue management posed another challenge, requiring careful consideration of user context in responses.
The integration of RAG capabilities using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition with the pgvector extension and large language models (LLMs) available in Amazon Bedrock has empowered our chatbots to deliver natural language responses to out-of-domain inquiries, enhanced dialogue management, and reduced our manual efforts. Consequently, we have observed a 20% improvement in customer onboarding times.
The native integration of Amazon Aurora with Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock via Amazon Aurora Machine Learning helped in summarizing case notes stored in Aurora databases without moving data outside the database and by integrating with LLMs in SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. We were able to identify customer sentiment and emotions based on case conversation data by integrating with Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Bedrock via Aurora ML.
PM: Lastly, how do you envision LeadSquared’s competitive advantage evolving as generative AI becomes more prevalent in the market, and how do you plan to maintain your position as a leader in the industry?
PS: At LeadSquared, we are driven by using technology to help our clients be more efficient in their business. As a vertically integrated CRM and Service platform, we see generative AI offering us capabilities around services such as context summarization from support interactions, sales insights from CRM data, identifying the next best action for sales teams, goal management frameworks, and providing superior customer service via the voice channel to influence sales. All of this will help our clients enhance their top-line revenue and improve customer satisfaction.

CEOs accelerate GenAI adoption despite workforce resistance


CEOs are facing workforce, culture and governance challenges as they act quickly to implement and scale generative AI across their organizations, according to IBM.

The annual global study of 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries found that 64% of those surveyed say succeeding with generative AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself. However, 61% of respondents say they are pushing their organization to adopt generative AI more quickly than some people are comfortable with.
The findings also revealed that 63% of surveyed CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, but few understand how generative AI adoption impacts their organization’s workforce and culture. 
56% of respondents have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees. Yet, 51% of CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI roles that did not exist last year, while 47% expect to reduce or redeploy their workforce in the next 12 months because of generative AI.
“There is incredible excitement around generative AI, and CEOs want to move beyond the AI hype to deliver business impact. Yet, without the right people and culture in place, progress will be slow,” said Matt Candy, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting. “As they embed generative AI in their enterprise strategy, it’s critical that executives build a cultural mindset that fosters adoption and lead people through the changes.”
CEOs plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI
40% of CEOs surveyed plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI, yet 53% of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. CEOs surveyed say 35% of their workforce will require retraining and reskilling over the next three years – up from just 6% in 2021.
65% of CEOs say their organization’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet 48% say competition among their C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration. 81% of CEOs say inspiring their team with a common vision produces better outcomes. At the same time, 37% acknowledge that their employees don’t fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
57% of those surveyed acknowledge that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven organization than overcoming technical challenges. CEOs cite generative AI adoption as being critical to success, but 64% say their organization must take advantage of technologies that are changing faster than people can adapt.
Trustworthy AI requires effective governance
68% agree that governance for generative AI must be established as solutions are designed, rather than after they are deployed. Although 75% of CEOs say trusted AI is impossible without effective AI governance in their organization, only 39% say they have good generative AI governance in place today.
At the same time, 62% of CEO say they will take more risk than the competition to maintain competitive edge, with 51% agreeing that the risk of falling behind is driving them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value. 67% say the productivity gains from automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.
While today 71% of surveyed CEOs are no further than generative AI piloting and experimentation, 49% expect to be driving growth and expansion by 2026.
CEOs ranked product and service innovation as their highest priority for the next three years – up from sixth place in 2023. 41% say they are willing to sacrifice operational efficiency for greater innovation.
However, a majority of CEOs surveyed point to a focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation. Today, only 36% of the CEOs surveyed are primarily funding their generative AI investments with net new IT spend, with the remaining 64% reducing other technology spend.

In summary
California policies could have a huge effect on AI going forward. The EU wants to advise and coordinate. 


Lea esta historia en Español
While the federal government appears content to sit back and wait, more than 40 U.S. states are considering hundreds of AI regulation bills. 
California, with its status as a tech-forward state and huge economy, has a chance to lead the way. So much so, in fact, that the European Union is trying to coordinate with the state on AI laws. The EU opened an office in San Francisco in 2022 and dispatched a tech envoy, Gerard de Graaf, to better communicate about laws and regulations around AI. 
We are living through what de Graaf calls “the year of AI.” De Graaf and deputy head of the EU office in San Francisco Joanna Smolinska told CalMatters that if California lawmakers pass AI regulation in the coming months, the state can emerge as a standard bearer for the regulation of AI in the United States. In other words: California’s laws could influence the future of AI as we know it.
 
 

Last month, de Graaf traveled to Sacramento to speak with several state lawmakers key to AI regulation: 

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat, is author of a bill that requires businesses and state agencies report results of AI model tests in an effort to prohibit automated discrimination 
Democratic State Sen. Scott Wiener from San Francisco is author of a bill to regulate generative AI 
Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an East Bay Democrat, is author of a bill that would require online platforms put watermarks on images and videos generated by AI sometimes referred to as deepfakes ahead of elections this fall 
And Sen. Tom Umberg, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was referred to by Politico as the “California’s chief gatekeeper for AI rules.” 

The meeting to discuss the bills was at least the sixth trip de Graaf or other EU officials made to Sacramento in two months. EU officials who helped write the AI Act and EU Commission Vice President Josep Fontelles also made trips to Sacramento and Silicon Valley in recent weeks.
This week, EU leaders ended a years-long process with the passage of the AI Act, which regulates use of artificial intelligence in 27 nations. It bans emotion recognition at school and in the workplace, prohibits social credit scores such as the kind used in China to reward or punish certain kinds of behavior and some instances of predictive policing. The AI Act applies high risk labels for AI in health care, hiring, and issuing government benefits.

There are some notable differences between the EU law and what California lawmakers are considering. The AI Act addresses how law enforcement agencies can use AI, while Bauer-Kahan’s bill does not, and Wicks’ watermarking bill could end up stronger than AI Act requirements. But the California bills and the AI Act both take a risk-based approach to regulation, both advise continued testing and assessment of forms of AI deemed high risk, and both call for watermarking generative AI outputs.
“If you take these three bills together, you’re probably at 70-80% of what we cover in the AI Act,” de Graaf said. “It’s a very solid relationship that we both benefit from.”
In the meeting, de Graaf said they discussed draft AI bills, AI bias and risk assessments, advanced AI models, the state of watermarking images and videos made by AI, and which issues to prioritize. The San Francisco office works under the authority of the EU delegation in Washington D.C. to promote EU tech policy and strengthen cooperation with influential tech and policy figures in the United States.
Artificial intelligence can make predictions about people including what movies they want to watch on Netflix or the next words in a sentence, but without high standards and continuous testing, AI that makes critical decisions about people’s lives can automate discrimination. AI has a history of harming people of color, such as police use of face recognition, deciding whether to grant an apartment or home mortgage application. The technology has a demonstrated ability to adversely affect the lives of most people, including women, people with disabilities, the young, the old, and people who apply for government benefits.
In a recent interview with KQED, Umberg talked about the importance of striking a balance, insisting “We could get this wrong.” Too little regulation could lead to catastrophic consequences for society, and too much could “strangle the AI industry” that calls California home.
Coordination between California and EU officials attempts to combine regulatory initiatives in two uniquely influential markets.

The majority of the top AI companies are based in California, and according to startup tracker Crunchbase, for the past eight months, companies in the San Francisco Bay Area raised more AI investment money than the rest of the world combined.
The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, is the European Union’s best known legislation for privacy protection. It also led to coinage of the term “the Brussels effect,” when enforcement of a single law leads to outsized influence in other countries. In this case, the EU law forced tech companies to adopt stricter user protections if they wanted access to the region’s 450 million residents. That law went into effect in 2018, the same year that California passed a similar law. More than a dozen U.S. states followed suit.
Defining AI
Coordination is necessary, de Graaf said, because technology is a global industry and it’s important to avoid policy that makes it complicated for businesses to comply with rules around the world. 
One of the first steps to working together is a shared definition of how to define artificial intelligence so you agree on what technology is covered under a law. De Graaf said his office worked with Bauer-Kahan and Umberg on how to define AI “because if you have very different definitions to start with then convergence or harmonization is almost impossible.”
Given the recent passage of the AI Act, the absence of federal action, and the complexity of regulating AI, the Senate Judiciary staff lawyers held numerous meetings with EU officials and staff, Umberg told CalMatters in a statement. The definition of AI used by the California Senate Judiciary committee is informed by a number of voices including federal agencies, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the EU.
“I strongly believe that we can learn from each other’s work and responsibly regulate AI without harming innovation in this dynamic and quickly-changing environment” Umberg told CalMatters in a written statement.
The trio of bills discussed with de Graaf in April passed their respective houses this week. He suspects questions from California lawmakers will get more specific as bills move closer to adoption. 
California lawmakers proposed more than 100 bills to regulate AI in the current legislative session. 
“I think what is now the imperative for the Legislature is to whittle the bills down to a more manageable number,” he said. “I mean, there’s over 50 so that we focused particularly on the bills to these assembly members or senators themselves.” 
State agency also seeks to protect Californians’ privacy
Elected officials and their staff aren’t the only ones speaking with EU officials. The California Privacy Protection Agency — a state agency made to protect people’s privacy and require businesses comply with data deletion requests — also speaks regularly with EU officials, including de Graaf.
Most states with privacy protection laws rely on state attorneys general for enforcement. California is the only state with an independent agency with enforcement authority to audit businesses, levy fines, or bring businesses to court, said agency executive director Ashkan Soltanti, because key elements of the EU’s privacy protection law influenced the formation of California’s privacy law. De Graaf and Soltani testified about similarities between definitions of AI in California and the EU in an assembly privacy committee hearing in February.
“The roots of the agency were inspired at great length by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),” Soltani said. “There’s an interest and a goal, and in fact, our statute directs us to where possible, make sure that our approach is harmonious with frameworks in other jurisdictions, not just states but internationally as well.”
Soltani was hired when the agency was created in 2021. He told CalMatters international coordination is a big part of the job. After hiring staff and attorneys, one of his first orders of business was joining the Global Privacy Assembly, a group of 140 data privacy authorities from around the world. California is the only U.S. state that is a member of the group.
Alignment is important for setting the rules of the road for businesses but also for consumers to protect themselves and their communities in a digital world where borders blur.
“They don’t think whether they’re doing business with a California company or a European company or an Asian company, particularly if it’s all in English, they just think they’re interacting online, so having consistent frameworks for protection ultimately benefits consumers,” Soltani said.
Like California lawmakers, the California Privacy Protection Agency is in the process of writing rules for how businesses use AI and protections for consumers, students, and workers. And like the AI Act, draft rules call for impact assessments. Its five-member board will consider passing rules into law in July.
The last day of the legislative calendar year for California lawmakers to pass a bill into law is Aug. 31.

Here’s how AWS customers are using generative AI to streamline tasks and make work more productive, and enjoyable.



Tens of thousands of businesses and organisations of all sizes, across industries, are testing, learning, and building on AWS’s generative AI service, Amazon Bedrock, and developing tools to streamline their day-to-day work.







Amazon Web Services customers using Amazon Bedrock have secure and easy access to the widest selection of high-performing, fully managed large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs), making it the easiest way for them to start building and scaling generative AI applications, with responsible AI built in.Here are five ways companies are using Amazon Bedrock to be more efficient, creative, and productive.








1. Find inspiration for a presentation

Making a killer pitch deck is an art form, and one that usually takes hours. Rather than starting from scratch each time, global marketing and advertising company Media.Monks is using generative AI to make sure great ideas don’t go to waste. An early adopter of the technology, this AWS customer and partner has built an in-house, enterprise-ready AI solution to automate its workflows—both internally and on behalf of its clients. The platform, Monks.Flow, connects with Amazon Bedrock, and offers intelligent solutions for clients’ marketing activities. Designed to work across existing tech stacks, and depending on the needs of the client, it can perform tasks such as document reviews, as well as extract valuable data and insights from a company’s existing systems. For example, let’s say the Media.Monks team is preparing a presentation for a prospective client. Monks.Flow uses different LLMs, accessed via Amazon Bedrock, to search through the vast number of decks the company has worked on over the years. Not only can it quickly find information applicable to whatever new business the team is pitching for today, it can also rank it in order of relevance—providing instant access to a wealth of knowledge, and turbocharging teams’ imaginations.






2. Compare product reviews in different languages

If you’re an Amazon seller, or any other business that sells products online, customer reviews hold a treasure trove of information. But if you sell globally, and you receive hundreds, even thousands, of reviews in a range of languages you don’t speak, it can be pretty tricky to glean insights from the data. Step forward Cohere Embed, a text representation language model from enterprise AI company Cohere. Available on Amazon Bedrock, it can work across more than 100 languages. Cohere’s chief product officer, Jaron Waldman, put it this way: “Imagine you had a bunch of product reviews on Amazon, in 100 different languages. You want to analyze those reviews, and so you could ask a question like, ‘Show me all the reviews that are related to the delivery of the product,’ to see if there was a delivery problem or if the delivery was going well.’ You can do all that with Cohere Embed.”






3. Streamline scheduling

It can be hard for business owners to organise staffing schedules that suit the needs of both their customers and employees. AWS customer AlayaCare offers software services to companies that provide home-based healthcare. The Montreal-based startup is using generative AI to tackle one of the industry’s biggest headaches: employee turnover. AlayaCare’s research shows that the biggest reason home-care services employees—hardworking caregivers usually paid by the hour—leave their jobs is dissatisfaction with scheduling. “A lot of times, it's simply the difference between the hours they want and the hours they get,” said Naomi Goldapple, AlayaCare senior VP of data and intelligence. Her team has been prototyping on Amazon Bedrock to help schedulers quickly see the home-visit slots they need to fill, and provide them with the best employee matches based on specific criteria that satisfy caregivers and patients alike.






4. Summarise documents in a flash

AlayaCare is also using generative AI to gather and then summarise what Goldapple affectionately calls “note droppings”: notes made by different caregivers and nurses who go into a patient’s home to provide care. One nurse might make a note in one part of the AlayaCare platform about a particular patient complaining about increased lower back pain. Then another nurse, visiting the same patient the following day, might make a note in a different part of the platform about that patient experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath. LLMs can read all of these notes left in different places, pull together the most important information (such as continued mentions of pain), and summarise it in a way that allows a clinician to spot trends and intervene earlier, to avoid having the patient hospitalised.






5. Get personalized advice

If you need advice or want to brainstorm, but no one’s around, why not ask your digital doppelgänger? Media.Monks VP and global head of engineering Iran Reyes has built his own digital persona in the company’s AI-centric, professionally managed service Monks.Flow. “I have a digital twin that knows my character traits, my personal and professional background, the way I speak, my tone of voice, and so on. For this interview, I asked it what I should keep in mind. It recommended I slow down, speak clearly, and focus on describing the specific services we’ve built. It was great advice.” Reyes predicts a big rise in AI companions: “We’re going to be using these ‘personas in our pockets’—with our phones, or other devices—to help us make better decisions and take actions in all kinds of situations.”

Generative AI, which is capable of creating objects, writing code, drawing images, and even composing music, is becoming increasingly sophisticated.Here’s a closer look at whether generative AI is a threat to your business and how you can navigate this evolving landscape..Understand generative AI.Generative AI refers to algorithms, such as those behind GPT-4, that can create new features based on existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which can classify images or translate speech, generative AI can create original writing, artwork, and more. This capability is fueled by deep learning and large datasets, enabling AI to create human-like features that can be used in a variety of applications, from marketing content development to software development to customer service..Risk factors for businesses.Automation of routine tasks:.Generative AI excels at performing routine, repetitive tasks, such as writing emails, creating reports, and creating marketing materials. This automation can lead to redundancies in activities related to such jobs, especially in administrative and clerical positions..Problems in creative industries:.Creative fields such as painting, copywriting, and manufacturing may also be affected. Generative AI tools can produce high-quality images and data at a fraction of the cost and time, which is challenging for people who work hard in these areas..Changes in tech and programming:.AI-generated code and software solutions can streamline development processes and prospects. They can reduce the demand for entry-level programmers and developers. However, this could also lead to a shift in focus on the complex and strategic aspects of software technology..Opportunities and Flexibility.While generative AI poses some risks, it also provides opportunities and new ways of improving business performance. Here’s how employees can make a difference:.Embrace lifelong learning:.Continuous learning and skill upgrading are critical in the age of AI. Employees need to focus on developing new skills and keeping up with the latest technological developments. Online courses, certifications, and workshops can help individuals compete in the job market..Benefits of AI as a tool:.Instead of seeing Artificial Intelligence as a competitor, employees can use it as a tool to enhance their productivity and creativity. For example, marketers can use AI to generate product ideas, while designers can use AI to explore new design possibilities..Focus on people-based skills:.Skills that are inherently human, such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving, are still in demand. These AI skills are essential for applications that are difficult for AI to simulate and require human communication and decision-making..Conclusion: Generative AI is undoubtedly changing the business landscape, creating both challenges and opportunities. While some roles may face displacement, others evolve or emerge, requiring shifts in skills and mindset..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that need a more human touch and mean more to their customers.   Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks.  They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”Methodology:At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in India on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years’ time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace.  We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

As the world's population continues to grow and age, the healthcare system in different geographies is inching closer to the brink of collapse. According to the World Health Organization, the current number of health workers, including physicians, radiologists, and other professionals, is not sufficient to handle the rising caseload. On top of it, the increased stress and burnout stemming from the surge in cases is pushing many to exit the field, further reducing the number of practicing workers. Becker Health estimates show that nearly 72,000 American physicians left the workforce between 2021 and 2022, and some 30,000 who will join the workforce will not be enough to meet the growing demand.


At the core, both these challenges – the rising caseload and dwindling workforce – are leaving one major impact: diminished quality of patient care. This is where the much talked about generative AI can come in, saving healthcare staffers valuable time and resources and enabling them to focus on enhancing clinical outcomes.

Understanding The Potential Of Generative AI
First off, it’s important to understand AI is not new in healthcare. Organizations have been experimenting with predictive and computer vision algorithms for a while now, most notably to forecast the success of treatments and diagnose dangerous diseases earlier than humans. However, when it comes to generative AI, things are still pretty fresh, given the technology came to the forefront just a couple of years ago with the launch of ChatGPT. Gen AI models use neural networks to identify patterns and structures in existing data and generate new content such as text and images. They are applicable across sectors, including healthcare – where organizations cumulatively generate about 300 petabytes of data every single day.

PROMOTED
Now, with the ability to learn from data and create something new, gen AI can not entirely replace doctors or do the work they do, but it sure can ease up the strained healthcare pipeline by augmenting certain aspects of the system. This can be anything from simplifying patient journeys and teleconsultation to handling clinical documentation and providing relevant information when the doctor is in surgery.

Let’s look at the most feasible applications with gen AI that are possible today.
AI Assistants For Medical Guidance

After COVID-19, most organizations launched remote consultation services, where patients could get in touch with the doctor without actually visiting the hospital in person. The approach worked but left physicians overworked as they had to deal with both online and offline patients. With gen AI, healthcare organizations can launch LLM-backed AI assistants to address this. Essentially, they could fine-tune models like GPT-4 on medical data and build assistants that could take basic medical cases and guide patients to the best treatments on the basis of their systems. If any particular case appears more complicated, the model could redirect the patient to a doctor or the nearest healthcare professional. This way, all cases would get addressed without putting the doctors under immense work pressure. Multiple organizations, including Sanofi, Bayer, and Novartis, have taken this approach and launched AI assistants on their respective platforms.

Agents For Streamlining Administrative Work
Along with assessing conditions and providing guidance, generative AI chatbots can also be built to handle basic healthcare operations like booking appointments and reminding patients about their scheduled visits. This can save the hours human operators have to give in for handling an ever-increasing number of calls and messages in healthcare systems.

Among the providers using conversational AI agents are Mercy Health, Baptist Health, and Intermountain Healthcare. They all have launched bots for automating tasks like patient registration, routing, scheduling, FAQs, IT helpdesk ticketing, and prescription refills. Further, many have even started deploying gen AI copilots that listen to the conversation between the patient and physician and generate summarized clinical notes, saving doctors the trouble of documenting and filing the information manually in an EHR. Nabla, one of the providers of such copilots, even uses these notes to generate a set of patient instructions, on behalf of the physician. This capability can be further developed into a gen AI system that sits alongside the doctor and creates personalized treatment and therapy plans based on the current conditions as well as previously recorded parameters, including genetic makeup, health history, and lifestyle.
Data Retrieval In Workflow
One of the biggest strengths of LLMs is that they can be enhanced with retrieval augment generation (RAG) to tap additional data resources without retraining. This enables healthcare organizations to build internal smart assistants or search systems that could provide the most relevant, contextual answers for any given query. For instance, RAG-based systems could help physicians with decision support by producing evidence-based recommendations for a specific condition.
In other cases, they could produce fact-based medical reports/patient data from EHR systems or share the latest clinical guidelines for treatment. San Diego-based Nanome used this technique to develop an assistant that taps large language models (LLMs) and access to real-time internal data and molecular simulation systems to help pharma teams in their drug development workflows.
Data analysis, report generation
Another notable application of generative AI would be data analysis, specifically the analysis of medical images like CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays. Even after rapid digitization, most diagnostic agencies today rely on human experts to study medical images and write reports for patients. The work takes a lot of time and effort and is even prone to errors stemming from inherent biases or just basic human tiredness.
With a gen AI-driven approach, teams could fine-tune models like GPT-4 vision and use them to study and generate reports from medical data, automating and accelerating the entire process for good. Yes, the idea is still fresh, but early experiments show it is a promising application of gen AI in healthcare. In fact, a study by JAMA Network found that AI-generated reports for chest radiographs had the same level of quality and accuracy as those produced by human radiologists.
Drug Development
Finally, with its ability to understand intricate patterns and structures in complex medical data, generative AI can also help with drug development. The technology can assess unique markers of a particular disease and come up with new combinations of chemicals or novel molecule structures that could lead to potential drug candidates. It can even screen the generated compounds based on their characteristics and predict side effects and drug interactions.
Just last year, Insilico Medicine’s gen AI-generated INS018_055 drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., went into clinical human trials and is now closing in on wider release.
Caution Is A Must
Despite these potentially transformative applications, healthcare organizations must understand that generative AI will be only as good as the data it has been trained/fine-tuned upon. If the data is not prepared well or carries any kind of biases, the outcomes of the models will also reflect those problems, hitting the reputation of the business. This means organizations should first prepare the data in the best way possible – while removing personally identifiable information (PII) from it – and then move towards the next stages of the project lifecycle, including training and inference, to make clinician and administrative efforts a little less burdensome.

In response to growing concerns about algorithmic bias in employment practices, the California Civil Rights Council (The Council) has proposed amendments to the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) to address discrimination arising from the use of automated decision systems. The proposed amendments align with broader efforts, including the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) guidelines on algorithmic fairness, to ensure that technological advancements do not perpetuate existing biases or create new forms of discrimination in the employment lifecycle.


Definition and Scope of AI Under the Act

The proposed amendments define an “automated decision system” as a computational process that screens, evaluates, categorizes, recommends, makes, or facilitates decisions impacting applicants or employees. This includes systems using machine learning, algorithms, statistics, or other data processing or artificial intelligence techniques. This definition is generally consistent with other AI laws, such as the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and New York City’s Local Law 144.

The proposed amendments cover various activities, processes, tools, and solutions performed by automated decision systems, including:



Using computer-based tests to make predictive assessments about an applicant or employee; measure skills, dexterity, reaction time, and other abilities or characteristics; or measure personality traits, aptitude, attitude, and cultural fit.
Directing job advertisements or other recruiting materials to targeted groups.
Screening resumes for specific terms or patterns before any human review of applicant materials.
Analyzing facial expressions, word choice, and/or voice in online interviews.
Rank or prioritize applicants based on their schedule’s work availability.


PROMOTED
The examples provided by the Council are illustrative and non-exhaustive. They aim to ensure that all forms of automated decision systems are scrutinized for fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination standards, reflecting a robust approach to modernizing employment practices.
Who Is Affected?
The proposed amendments apply to any organization that regularly pays five or more individuals for work or services. An employer’s “agent” and “employment agencies” are also covered.
MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributor
The proposed amendments define “agent” as any person acting on behalf of an employer, directly or indirectly. This includes third parties providing services related to hiring or employment decisions, such as recruiting, applicant screening, hiring, payroll, benefits administration, evaluations, decision-making about workplace leaves or accommodations, or administering automated decision systems for these purposes.

The proposed amendments amend the definition of “employment agency” to mean any person providing compensated services to identify, screen, or procure job applicants, employees, and work opportunities. This includes those who offer these services through automated decision systems. This clarification specifies the range of actions covered by an employment agency and acknowledges the use of automated systems in providing these services, which is becoming more common.

Employer Impact
The proposed amendments clarify that it is unlawful for employers to use selection criteria, including automated decision systems if such use results in adverse impacts or disparate treatment based on characteristics protected under FEHA. Employers may be liable for discrimination stemming from these systems, just as they would be for decisions made without them. However, employers can defend their use of automated decision systems by demonstrating that the criteria were job-related, necessary for the business, and that no less discriminatory alternatives were available. Additionally, evidence that employers conducted anti-bias testing or took similar measures to prevent discrimination will be considered in their defense.
Employers are accountable for the actions of their agents, while agents themselves are liable for assisting or enabling any discriminatory employment practices resulting from the use of automated decision systems.
Consideration of Criminal History in Employment Decisions
The proposed amendments amend the FEHA clarifying the role of automated decision systems in consideration of an applicant’s criminal history. In particular:


§ 11017.1(a): The Council proposes adding that employers using automated decision systems to consider criminal history must comply with the same amendments as human-based inquiries. Specifically, employers are prohibited from inquiring or assessing an applicant’s criminal history until after a conditional job offer has been extended. This ensures that automated systems are not used unlawfully unless specific exceptions apply.
§ 11017.1(d)(2)(C): If an employer may withdraw a job offer based on criminal history as part of its initial assessment when using an automated decision system, they must provide the applicant with the report or data generated by the system, along with information on the assessment criteria used.
§ 11017.1(d)(4): Using an automated decision system alone does not qualify as an individualized assessment of an applicant’s criminal history. Employers must conduct additional human-based processes to determine if a conviction directly relates to the job.


Other Clarifications of Law and Additional Requirements
The proposed provisions aim to prohibit the use of automated decision systems that result in disparate treatment based on various protected characteristics. Specifically, these amendments seek to prevent discrimination arising from the use of such systems concerning sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, religious creed, disability, and age.
Notable are the Council’s proposed amendments concerning automated decision systems when used to conduct medical and psychological examinations. The Council identifies that administering personality-based questions through automated decision systems, such as inquiries into optimism, emotional stability, or extroversion, can constitute prohibited medical inquiries. Similarly, using gamified screens within these systems to evaluate physical or mental abilities, like tests requiring rapid clicking or reaction time, may also infringe upon FEHA amendments. Such examinations, if not directly related to job requirements or lacking reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, could be deemed unlawful.
Record Keeping Obligations
The proposed inclusion of records pertaining to automated decision systems extends beyond traditional documentation to encompass data used in the training, operation, and outputs of such systems. By explicitly stating that these records must be retained for a minimum of four years following the last use of the automated decision system, the amendment establishes a clear and enforceable standard for recordkeeping practices.
Additionally, the amendment addresses the accountability of entities involved in the provision, sale, or use of automated decision systems on behalf of covered entities. The proposal promotes transparency and accountability of all covered entities throughout the employment process by stipulating that these parties must maintain relevant records, including but not limited to automated decision system data.
Next Steps
The Civil Rights Council urges the public to engage in the regulatory process by submitting written comments by 5:00 PM PT on July 18, 2024. Comments can be sent via email to council@calcivilrights.ca.gov. A public hearing on the proposed regulations is scheduled for 10:00 AM PT on July 18, 2024. For additional information on how to contribute to the discussion and participate in the hearing, the public is encouraged to review CRC’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
Parting Thoughts 
The proposed amendments extend the reach of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) to encompass automated decision systems. By aligning these technologies with existing legal obligations, California expands the scope of protections against discrimination in employment, adapting regulations to the digital era. Employers are encouraged to submit public comments and actively monitor the Council's website for developments in this regulatory process.

Much of the hype is implausibly optimistic, while some is downright apocalyptic.Depending on whom you believe, AI will either usher in a new golden age of productivity and comfort for humanity or plunge all of us into a Terminator-style hellscape. To the casual observer – the American worker – the truth seems likely to lie somewhere between.As a CEO who has wrestled with balancing shareholder demands for profit with moral obligations to employees and an investor who has witnessed first-hand the dramatic ways AI is upending industries once thought immune to disruption, we are optimistic that recent AI advances will reap huge benefits for the U.S. economy.Ensuring those benefits are distributed fairly to include workers displaced by rapid technological progress will require significant reskilling within much of our nation’s and Tennessee’s workforce – the precise type of structural challenge where federal and state governments can often fail.Should business leaders fearartificial intelligence? As a CEO, here's why I am not afraidHow AI revolution compares with massive free trade agreementsNAFTA (now USMCA) provides a salient case in point. Dismantling trade barriers between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico proved inordinately beneficial for American corporations, who squeezed more profit from moving manufacturing south of the border.However, it was a disaster for many working-class families, who saw their jobs suddenly evaporate and struggled to make ends meet. When NAFTA was originally ratified, the U.S. federal government waxed eloquently about investing in job retraining programs to assist workers who might lose their livelihoods to cheaper labor from across the border. Those programs never happened.We are already seeing the early signs of a looming tidal wave of AI-related job losses. IBM plans to replace 8,000 jobs with AI and Google reportedly plans to eliminate 30,000 employees.  These downsizings will not be tech executives, but rather middle-class jobs in HR, finance, and sales. A recent survey of roughly 1,000 companies indicated that nearly 40% anticipated layoffs in 2024. The second most commonly cited reason for these layoffs? AI. Nearly all the potential job losses are white-collar, college degree positions long considered stable and safe. By the time it is all over, Goldman Sachs thinks as many as 300 million jobs globally will be lost or diminished.More:Tennessee is the first state to enact AI regulations in music; other artists want the sameTennessee and U.S. must beef up worker retraining programsAt this point, the AI genie is out and not going back into the bottle. New algorithms will help your radiologist better diagnose cancer, your insurance company process claims more efficiently, and your customer service hotline become more responsive.This will be wonderful news for corporate America’s profitability, but not for white-collar workers who will bear the brunt of the losses from a long, painful wave of productivity-oriented restructurings.Congress and the state of Tennessee should take care to act now, investing in job retraining initiatives that will cushion middle-class families from AI’s inevitable labor market fallout.  Recent efforts by the legislature to create an AI Advisory Council for guiding its usage within Tennessee state government are strong first steps in addressing the coming seismic shifts. However, far more action will be necessary in the private and public sectors to ensure Tennesseans are ready to compete as AI shifts from science fiction to reality.Jason Schmitt is the former chief executive officer of Old Time Pottery and serves on the Tennessee State Workforce Development Board.Donald Lacey is chief investment officer for West Fork, a venture investment firm, and serves on multiple boards of companies in AI, digital health, and fintech.Health Insight JournalDrain Edema Fluid: Do This if You Have Swollen Feet or AnklesHealth Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoMartha Stewart &amp; Marley Spoon People in Chantilly are Loving Martha Stewart's Meal KitMartha Stewart & Marley Spoon |AdAdUndoCoupon Code FinderAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackCoupon Code Finder|AdAdUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredHomebuddy.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoDog Food ExposedWorst Toxic Foods For Dogs: The One Meat You Should Never Feed Your DogDog Food Exposed|AdAdUndoHealth Insight JournalNew Neuropathy Device Leaves Experts Speechless (It's Genius!)Health Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoParentzTalkWomen Were Forced To Do This In Viking CultureParentzTalk|AdAdRead MoreUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndoprimenutritionsecrets.comMD: Building Muscle After 60 Comes Down To This 1 Thingprimenutritionsecrets.com|AdAdUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDThese Minion Backpacks Are The Best Thing To Happen To The Back To School SeasonREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

This influence extends both to the productivity within these fields—where output can multiply by as much as fivefold due to AI use—as well as the skill sets required by employees.In the IT sector, there is a growing demand for AI-related skills such as machine learning inference and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the need for conventional programming skills replaceable by AI is on the decline. However, other industries, including renewable energy, construction, and healthcare, seem immune to AI’s disruption, even experiencing a growth in labor demand due to other macro trends.The prevalence of AI-specialized job postings has witnessed a dramatic increase, boasting seven times more listings than in 2012. Financial services have seen the fastest growth in AI-relevant roles, followed by professional services and IT, which now has a fivefold larger proportion of AI-related jobs than other sectors.Further studies underscore the escalating significance of advanced cognitive abilities (such as analysis, critical thinking, and creativity) and emotional and behavioral skills (like adaptability, emotional intelligence, and social influence), alongside digital competences.Corporate leaders are convinced that AI will not only enhance productivity but will also necessitate a comprehensive shift in operational strategies, calling for employees to develop new competencies. Results from the PwC CEO Survey 2024 affirm that 84% of CEOs whose firms have begun adopting AI predict an upsurge in productivity, and 70% anticipate significant changes in company operations due to AI integration.The application and strategic incorporation of “GenAI” within Romanian companies might still be in its infancy, yet executives there agree with the global outlook that AI will transform business models, intensify market competition, and mandate novel abilities for most employees. This shift is foreseen to result in more efficient work time management, increased employee performance, and enhanced profitability.The AI revolution in the employment landscape raises several important questions and challenges:1. What types of jobs are at risk due to AI automation?Jobs that involve routine, predictable tasks are at a higher risk of automation by AI. These include roles in manufacturing, data entry, and certain aspects of customer service. As AI continues to develop, even complex tasks such as analysis and decision-making could be automated, affecting professional jobs in sectors like law and finance.2. How can workers prepare for the changes brought about by AI?Workers can prepare by pursuing continuous education and training, focusing on developing skills that AI is unlikely to replicate easily, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and complex problem-solving. Additionally, gaining expertise in AI and related technologies themselves can create new career opportunities.Key challenges and controversies associated with AI in the employment landscape:– The ethical implications of replacing human jobs with AI, potentially leading to unemployment and income inequality.
– The need to update educational and training programs to prepare the workforce for an AI-centric economy.
– Concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the accountability of decisions made by AI systems.
– Addressing the digital divide that may widen if certain populations lack access to the new technology and skills necessary to compete in an AI-driven job market.Advantages of AI in the employment landscape include:– Increased productivity and efficiency across various industries.
– The creation of new job roles and industries centered around AI technology.
– Better decision-making capabilities in businesses through data analysis and predictive analytics.Disabilities of AI in the employment landscape include:– Potential job displacement, especially for low-skill and repetitive tasks.
– The need for substantial investment in retraining the existing workforce.
– Growing dependency on technology, which raises concerns about cybersecurity and operational vulnerabilities.For those looking for more information about AI and its impact on the employment landscape, here are some reputable sources:– PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) – for insights from the PwC 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer and other related studies.
– World Economic Forum (WEF) – for broader discussions on the implications of AI on economies, work, and society.
– Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – for policy-related discussions and research on AI economic impacts.
– AISuperpowers – for perspectives on how the AI race between the U.S. and China influences the global job market.Always remember to evaluate the security and validity of URLs before clicking, as the landscape of the internet, much like AI itself, is continuously evolving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Business leaders and hiring managers need to understand 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process. 


Artificial Intelligence is poised to affect many important aspects of how things work in the corporate sector. The use of AI has been quite efficient for recruiters as with innovation, their hardest and most time-consuming work has been made much more straightforward. Let’s talk about 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process.  


AI in Recruitment  


AI and related assistive tools have affected all areas for operation for business of every size. For instance, you can find smart tools like an online web builder to set up your business website for instance. Large companies have been able to hire suitable candidates for the job with the assistance of AI-based technologies that help through areas ranging from design to HR management 


Such technologies use machine learning and algorithms of logic to deliver results. Similarly, AI in recruitment simplifies the process by boosting the applicant’s experience and helping recruiters make educated decisions.  


A study suggests that each recruiter has to go through a long and tedious procedure to hire the right match and has to spend 15 hours per week just to find the right person for one position. Through AI tools, this process can be improved for everyone involved. 


7 Ways that AI is Transforming the Hiring Process  


Here are some ways that such technology and tools assist in hiring and are playing a huge role in transforming the process.  



Computerized resume screening 



AI-driven tools are quite beneficial as they are employed to examine and interpret resumes in a minimal amount of time as compared to when a human does the same job. These systems and software are well-made as they can easily inspect keywords in resumes and cover letters for the specifications required in the job descriptions, therefore, making the candidate selection process much simpler. Moreover, the time spent, and the mistakes made by human resume screening can be significantly minimized.  


Many different applicants can be addressed in a shorter time. Also, with advanced automated tools, the candidate’s online presence can be analyzed, making their history and background accessible. This information can also be helpful for the recruiters in the selection process. This way, hiring managers can get a more complete understanding of a prospective candidate.  



Use of chatbots for candidate interaction 



Chatbots are software programs with the ability to interact with suitable candidates. They are trained to take interviews, give information, and answer questions asked by the candidates through generative text.  


These chatbots are designed to act like human professionals as they do their jobs more fittingly. By providing customized interaction and friendly behavior, the hiring becomes more efficient and interesting, therefore, improving the candidate experience. Also, in case of any personal inquiries and questions from the candidates, the chatbots are made available 24/7, hence, making them feel more valued and appraised.  



Reducing biases in the hiring process 



When a company is in search of suitable candidates, they try their best to avoid any biases and favorable conditions. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence has once again proven to be beneficial as the recruitment is done without any human judgment and only directed towards the requirements as per the job description.  


Also, the innovation used removes away all the personal data of the candidates so they can be analyzed solely based on their skills and capabilities. The software installed will predict the likelihood of success a candidate will encounter, making the process easier and avoiding any potential unconscious bias.  



Assessing the candidates 



AI-driven recruitment uses tools to assess job applicants more vigorously to be more precise in the decision-making of selection. Various online quizzes and tests can be automated to evaluate the interviewee’s knowledge and accomplishments. Through this, all the major aspects involved in any department of industry are fully covered such as technical competence, problem-solving ability, and professional expertise.  


Furthermore, identifying the skills of the applicants can assist in pinpointing the topmost hidden talents, thus, reducing any mistakes in the hiring process. Being able to discover the right match becomes beneficial for the company in the long run as only people with the right qualifications and aptitude are more likely to excel in their work.  



Moral considerations 



With the rise in innovation, candidate selection also requires fairness and ethical considerations. As a result, technological advancements have been used in a manner to guarantee transparency and privacy of personal data in recruitment. Differing from humans, all the ethical rules and guidelines are strictly followed. In this digital world, frauds have become quite common nowadays. Therefore, with AI it is easy to identify fraudulent candidates as they have more accuracy levels such as they will be able to locate jobseekers who tend to apply only for fun and time passes.  



Keeping up with learning and development 



Computer systems will keep on changing with time due to shifts in efficiency in technology. With the change in periods, the AI algorithms will continue to improve the talent acquisition process by identifying trends, fashions, and areas for development. Therefore, the use of these technologies will then assist HR in redesigning their strategies and reshaping their procedure in talent acquisition. Also, by sticking with continuous learning, companies will stay flexible and competitive as they will attract candidates committed to growth, adaptation and professional development.  



Predictive data analysis  



The computerized systems used assess the skills and experience of candidates and then match their talents with their success in selective roles. This makes it more likely that a job candidate will be hired for a role they can excel in. 


The focus is on the data; therefore, the most qualified candidate is selected for a job role that suits them best. It becomes easier for employers to make more important decisions rather than focusing on HR they can give time to other relevant departments. Hence, the chances of a hiring mismatch are minimized, and the overall teamwork performance is boosted as a result.   


Post-Screening Process by AI 


All the arrangements for the talent acquisition process are done by AI technologies making it much more effortless and less timely for any organization. The detailed tasks involved in the selection process such as setting time for interviews, sending invites to the applicants, and managing any clash in the timings, are all done automatically. Final Thoughts  


Artificial intelligence successfully revolutionizes the hiring process by doing everything at its best. By understanding 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process, companies will be able to stay ahead of the latest trends in recruitment and hire the right people for any job.

Artificial Intelligence will eliminate all jobs, jobs will remain like a hobby: Elon Musk










Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, stated that artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually eliminate all jobs, but he believes this is not necessarily a bad development, reported CNN. Speaking at a startup and tech event in Paris on Thursday, Musk said, “Probably none of us will have a job,”.
Elon Musk was speaking remotely via webcam at the Viva Tech event where he predicted a future where jobs would be “optional.” He said, “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job.” Musk added, “But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.”
Musk highlighted that for this scenario to succeed, there would need to be a “universal high income,” which should not be confused with universal basic income, however, he did not elaborate much on this concept.
The Universal basic income (UBI) refers to the government providing a certain amount of money to everyone, regardless of their earnings.
“There would be no shortage of goods or services,” Musk stated. He highlighted that AI capabilities have advanced rapidly over the past few years, advancing so quickly that regulators, companies, and users are still figuring out how to utilize the technology responsibly.
In the past also Musk expressed his concerns about AI. During his keynote on Thursday, he described the technology as his biggest fear. He cited the “Culture Book Series” by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized depiction of a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and “the best envisioning of a future AI.”
Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled in a future without jobs. “The question will really be one of meaning – if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?” Musk said.
He added, “I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this – in that we may give AI meaning.” He also advised parents to control and limit the amount of social media their children consume, saying that social media platforms “are being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.”
Industry experts are continuously raising concerns over how various industries and jobs will be transformed as AI proliferates in the market.
CNN reports that in January, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found that workplaces are adopting AI more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also noted that many jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time.
Experts largely believe that many jobs requiring high emotional intelligence and human interaction, such as mental health professionals, creatives, and teachers, will not need replacing. (ANI)

With advancements in technology and an increasing reliance on automation, AI is revolutionizing industries across the globe, creating new job opportunities and reshaping traditional roles. As we enter June 2024, the landscape of AI jobs and vacancies is as dynamic as ever, with companies seeking talented individuals to drive innovation and propel their businesses forward in the age of AI.In this article, we'll explore the top 10 AI jobs and vacancies for June 2024, highlighting the key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities required for each role. Whether you're a seasoned AI expert or someone looking to break into the field, these opportunities offer a glimpse into the exciting world of artificial intelligence and the diverse career paths it offers. Let's dive in and uncover the promising AI roles that await in the job market of June 2024..Top AI job skills.Being an effective AI developer requires more than just coding abilities. Of course, capability in a core AI developer language such as Python, Java, and R, along with rising languages such as Julia or Scala, is essential.AI jobs require knowledge of data modeling and design to structure and preprocess information for productive AI training and analysis. People, moreover, are required to analyze machine learning and deep learning and learn different algorithms, model structures, and optimization techniques.In addition to programming skills, people are required to know libraries and systems such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and scikit-image, and have a solid foundation in science and statistics..AI employments require basic thinking abilities to solve issues and analyze client input. The same principles apply to code. Having solid scientific abilities can help individuals create progressing algorithms for programs.AI is also unique because it requires some psychological knowledge. To make AI, individuals must analyze how people think and how they might behave in distinctive circumstances. AI recreates human behavior. The demand for artificial intelligence jobs and vacancies is skyrocketing as companies seek skilled professionals to drive their AI initiatives..Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Jobs.AI jobs are changing quickly, just like innovation. In 2024, pros will be more sought after than generalists. Deep knowledge of one perspective of AI is more important than shallow knowledge of numerous zones. Exploring the landscape of artificial intelligence jobs and vacancies reveals a wealth of opportunities across various industries. Here are a few of the best AI jobs to check out..AI product manager.An AI product manager is comparable to other program supervisors. Both jobs require a group pioneer to create and dispatch a product. In this case, it is an AI product, but it could be more diverse from any other product in terms of driving groups, planning, and meeting milestones.The innovative requests for this work are higher than those for most product supervisor positions. AI product managers require knowledge of what goes into making an AI application, including the equipment, programming languages, information sets, and algorithms, so that they can make it accessible to their group. With the rise of AI technology, artificial intelligence jobs and vacancies are becoming increasingly prevalent in the job market..AI research scientist.An AI research scientist is a computer researcher who thinks about and creates new AI algorithms and procedures. They develop and test new AI models, collaborate with other analysts, distribute research papers, and talk at conferences. Programming is only a small portion of what an inquire-about researcher does.The tech industry is amazingly open to self-taught and non-formally prepared software engineers, but it is an exemption for AI research scientists..AI ethics specialist.As expressed previously, the ethical use of information in creating models will become a preeminent concern in 2024. Dedicated pros will be required to ensure the mindful improvement and deployment of AI. Companies might also consider including an AI ethics committee made up of representatives with different experiences and specialties, including lawyers, engineers, ethicists, open agents, and commerce strategists..Cybersecurity analyst with AI expertise.AI has found a home in cybersecurity, especially in interruption locations. However, risk actors also utilize AI. This is a field where pros are required who are familiar with cybersecurity and have the expertise to use AI to combat things such as ransomware and interruption detection..Computer vision engineer.A computer vision engineer is a designer who specializes in composing programs that utilize visual input sensors, algorithms, and frameworks. These frameworks see the world around them and act accordingly, such as self-driving and self-parking cars and facial recognition.They utilize languages such as C++ and Python, along with visual sensors, such as Mobileye from Intel..Data scientist.A data scientist is an innovation proficient who collects, analyzes, and deciphers information to solve issues and drive decision-making within the organization. They are not fundamentally programmers, although many do compose their own applications. Generally, they utilize data mining, big data, and expository tools.Their use of trade experiences determined from information empowers businesses to progress deals and operations, make better choices, and create new items, administrations, and policies..Machine learning engineer.A machine learning engineer is mindful of creating and executing machine learning training algorithms and models. Training is the requesting side of machine learning and is the most processor- and computation-intensive perspective of machine learning. In this manner, it requires the most elevated level of aptitude and training.Because progressed math and statistics abilities are required, most machine learning engineers have advanced degrees in computer science, math, or statistics..Natural language processing engineer.A natural language processing (NLP) engineer is a computer researcher who specializes in improving algorithms and frameworks for analyzing and handling natural human language input.One of the enormous differentiators between traditional search engines and generative AI interfacing, such as ChatGPT, is that search engines utilize keywords and accumulate data from expansive sums of existing online data..Robotics engineer.A robotics engineer is a designer who plans, creates, and tests programs for running and working robots. Robotics has progressed significantly in recent years, with computerized home cleaners and accurate cancer surgery equipment. Mechanical technology engineers also utilize AI and machine learning to boost an automated system's performance.As a result, robotics engineers regularly plan software that requires little to no human input but depends on tangible input..AI for healthcare specialist.If ever there was an industry that required a bridge between the mechanical and the proficient sides, it is healthcare. Innovation can help specialists and patients alike in numerous ways, but it is also one of the most delicate areas when it comes to data privacy.AI offers a few openings for making a difference in the medical calling, such as diagnosing infections and distinguishing the best treatment plans for patients with primary medical choices. It is one of the top AI Job vacancies for 2024.&nbsp;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

No, Collective Intelligence.The artist and musician Holly Herndon explores the promise — and complications — of collaborating with A.I.2024-05-24T05:04:38-04:00ezra kleinFrom New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”[MUSIC PLAYING]We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in “The New Yorker,” and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out.And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, “PROTO,” which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song “Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt” came on.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]And I just stopped walking.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it’s so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so — when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it’s all riffing on others in this very obvious way.What I like about Herndon’s art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It’s going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she’s got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut.And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it’ll have this long flowing copper hair. And it’ll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it’s on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work.And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.‘s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING]Holly Herndon, welcome to the show.holly herndonThanks. It’s great to be here.ezra kleinSo something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you?holly herndonYeah, that’s a really good question. I mean, I feel like I’m such a product of the environments that I’ve spent a lot of time in, so I’m really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology.I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman.ezra kleinBut why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what’s happening around it — I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I’ve ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what’s happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence?holly herndonI mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It’s so easy to participate in. It’s fairly easy to make. It’s also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of — if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it’s an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that’s why people have organized around it so much.ezra kleinWhen I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I’ll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way.And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I’m curious, as somebody who’s made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture.holly herndonMaybe there’s something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn’t really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FADE”]And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn’t imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways.So there’s something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop.ezra kleinSo in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn.holly herndonSpawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. “PROTO” was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier.But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you’ll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it’s like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That’s what the audio sounded like back in the day.And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn.ezra kleinWell, why don’t we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song “Swim.” And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album.[VOCALIZATION]So that’s really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own.[MUSIC PLAYING]What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there?holly herndonSo Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn’t deal with polyphony, which means one — more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can’t remember. It’s been so long.But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that’s where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that’s what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us.ezra kleinAnd I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people’s voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here?holly herndonI think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn’t sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it’s I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research.But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I’m really glad that I made that decision, because it’s informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model’s output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don’t know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that’s really informed all of the work that I’ve done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology.ezra kleinWe’re going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it’s really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, “Swim,” so people can hear where this ended up.[HOLLY HERNDON, “SWIM”]And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using — I don’t know if you’d call this an updated Spawn, but we’re calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton’s Jolene.[HOLLY HERNDON, “JOLENE”]So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who — what is singing?holly herndonSo that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it’s leaps and bounds better, more high — higher fidelity than little Spawn.So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There’s a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment.ezra kleinThat’s a use case that I’m fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed.What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can’t take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world?holly herndonI think I’m probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement —[HOLLY HERNDON, “MOVEMENT”]— or a platform —[HOLLY HERNDON, “CHORUS”]The albums before “PROTO” before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don’t expect everyone to have that relationship. I don’t really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It’s something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn’t normally be able to.You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn’t confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn’t do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it’s maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self.ezra kleinSo what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically?holly herndonWell, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it’s a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn’t afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It’s almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself.ezra kleinOh, that’s really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn’t otherwise try.holly herndonYeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn’t have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on “PROTO,” which is why I didn’t release it as an album, you know. It’s just not as interesting, somehow.ezra kleinI guess the other thing, there’s a question of meaning here that I’ve been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you’re trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now.And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky.When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I’m having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it’s not a human being.But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it’s Holly+, like, it’s a cool project, but I’m not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can’t not show up to talk to me, that that’s a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it.And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow?holly herndonIt’s really funny. We did a live performance from “PROTO,” I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, “I really enjoyed the show, but I don’t understand what it has to do with A.I.”And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn’t trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story.I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That’s something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together.I’m also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That’s not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I’m interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That’s the kind of stuff that I’m interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinI’ve heard you say that with A.I., it’s the model that’s the art, not necessarily the output of the model.holly herndonYeah, that’s one thing that we’re exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you’re not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that’s my own singing voice or whether that’s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world.So it’s almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we’re often using is “protocol art,” basically understanding that any work that’s made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we’re trying to lean into that.So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called “Ready Weight,” we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that’s the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work.And in a way, art’s kind of always a little bit like that. It’s a conversation between the work that you’re making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world.ezra kleinYou wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. “Collective intelligence” is more useful. Why?holly herndonBecause I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It’s trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it’s trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation.I think that’s why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it’s a part of our evolutionary story and I think it’s a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such.ezra kleinI want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there’s something that somebody has written into software over here. They’re unearthly. They’re a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there’s this whole question about who gets compensated and who’s going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically.And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that’s built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere.holly herndonYeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I’ve been doing for the last several years. It’s kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that’s not entirely new. You know, we’ve been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out.ezra kleinThe not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there’s also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We’re not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has.Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That’s all we’re doing. We’re not doing something new. We’re not making a copyright infringement.So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing.holly herndonSo, OK, I think that there’s a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what’s happening here. And it’s a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it’s really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It’s different in what it can do and also how it came about.So what it can do, we’ve kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it’s distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that’s distinctly different.But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it’s this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it’s a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you’re not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that — I like to call it the “sexy middle ground” between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown.And so that’s one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what’s happening right now isn’t working for everyone.ezra kleinAre there experiments that you find exciting or that you’ve conducted that you found the results of them promising?holly herndonYeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there’s one experiment that I’m running right now that I’m really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there’s 16 in total, and they’re joining a data trust. And we’ve hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we’re trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we’ll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward.I think it’s a really fun experiment, and it’s also because it’s singing and it’s choral music, it’s not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that’s not dealing with such sensitive information. So I’m really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That’s also a big question.ezra kleinSo you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art.holly herndonYou know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art.ezra kleinThis idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife’s book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn’t want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right?It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn’t do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn’t plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn’t want would be your top Google search result.And here it’s going to get even weirder because there isn’t really — you can’t have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there’s something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data — which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there’s no real obvious avenue towards that.holly herndonThere’s none at the moment, but I think that that’s coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don’t think it’s tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet.ezra kleinThat feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we’ve been we’ve been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn’t feel like this is going to hold.Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it’s just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I’m amazed at how powerful the “what are you going to do” impulse is in life.holly herndonWell, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it’s actually gaining traction. And there’s precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that’s not how things played out. So now we’re in a position where we’re building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don’t want to have included in these models.We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don’t think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it’s over. They should just have everything.You know, if we do have a situation where we’re able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I’m really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I’m not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it’s huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that.If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don’t think we should give up.ezra kleinI definitely agree. I don’t think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they’re doing.holly herndonYes.ezra kleinOne thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there’s modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you’re thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that’s scary, right?I mean, we’re very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we — what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well,holly herndonI think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we’re talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That’s something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music.And a lot of experimental music doesn’t follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don’t need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that’s going to be really difficult to pay for. It’s almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea.I think what’s really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren’t squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic.ezra kleinSo I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, “All Media is Training Data.” What’s the argument there?holly herndonYeah, so this is a book that’s a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it’s something that’s worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon.And I think that we need to think about what we’re creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we’re doing around the exhibition is we’re creating training data deliberately. So we’re treating training data as artworks themselves. I’m writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really — the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist.So we’re kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of — we like to call them mind children that we’re sending to the future.ezra kleinI want to talk about what’s triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I’m actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we’re covering new things that happened that are not in the training data.But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media’s training data, what they hear is — everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it’s going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn’t need us anymore.When we become the training data, we’re sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you’re training data, does that mean you’re replaceable?holly herndonArt is a very complex cultural web. It’s a conversation. It’s something that’s performed. It’s a dialogue. It’s situated in time and place. We wouldn’t confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I’m not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important.I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won’t be replaced and I think it’ll be weird and wonderful.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinThere are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called “Endel,” and it’s like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to — And it’s fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn’t think much of it.[endel, ""wind downEVENING ENERGY RISE”]And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we’re going to know what we want. And what we’re going to want is a generic version of it. And we’re going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you’re an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it.And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food.I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here?holly herndonWell, there’s a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we’re also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they’re kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke.One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that’s how we’re interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you.So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn’t like and didn’t understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked.But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn’t like to expand my palate and understanding of what’s possible in music. And so that’s one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won’t, but some people will.ezra kleinOne of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic.And that there’s this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It’ll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it’s a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you’re doing? Is there something there?holly herndonYeah, I think that’s largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that’s just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that’s basically the purpose.You know, it’s supposed to kind be a catchall, but I’m not interested in the catchall. I’m interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I’m interested in this other weird thing. And so that’s what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models.ezra kleinI want to end by going back to a song from “PROTO.” And it’s one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it’s doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of “Godmother“?[RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING]What’s happening there?holly herndonOK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here’s a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that’s basically how far we’ve come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It’s — the speed is incredible.So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin’s stems through my voice. And Jlin’s music is very percussive. It’s mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it’s trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice.ezra kleinWell, here, why don’t we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It’s called “The Precision of Infinity.”[JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, “THE PRECISION OF INFINITY”] And so, yeah, it’s not that it’s a machine, it’s just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there’s like a Philip Glass sample in there. It’s beautiful. But I don’t know. It’s funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very — compared to a lot of what’s coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we’re currently hearing or seeing, which it’s like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal.And I think the reason “PROTO” sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange.holly herndonWell, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was — this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them.And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that’s why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that’s — I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who’s an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds.But it was really important to me that I wasn’t trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn’t, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful.ezra kleinAs somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it’s easy if you’re outside this and don’t have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don’t — as I think most of my listeners don’t — and you see, well, there’s models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook — it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars.How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start?holly herndonThat’s a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out.This was our process. It’s been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn’t have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you’re really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that’s a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called “Intelligence and Spirit.” It’s a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, “Children of Time” by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders.ezra kleinOne of my favorite books.holly herndonYeah, it’s so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there’s a book called “Plurality” that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It’s about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.ezra kleinHolly Herndon, thank you very much.holly herndonThanks so much.

No, Collective Intelligence.The artist and musician Holly Herndon explores the promise — and complications — of collaborating with A.I.2024-05-24T05:04:38-04:00ezra kleinFrom New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”[MUSIC PLAYING]We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in “The New Yorker,” and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out.And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, “PROTO,” which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song “Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt” came on.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]And I just stopped walking.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it’s so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so — when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it’s all riffing on others in this very obvious way.What I like about Herndon’s art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It’s going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she’s got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut.And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it’ll have this long flowing copper hair. And it’ll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it’s on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work.And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.‘s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING]Holly Herndon, welcome to the show.holly herndonThanks. It’s great to be here.ezra kleinSo something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you?holly herndonYeah, that’s a really good question. I mean, I feel like I’m such a product of the environments that I’ve spent a lot of time in, so I’m really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology.I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman.ezra kleinBut why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what’s happening around it — I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I’ve ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what’s happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence?holly herndonI mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It’s so easy to participate in. It’s fairly easy to make. It’s also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of — if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it’s an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that’s why people have organized around it so much.ezra kleinWhen I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I’ll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way.And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I’m curious, as somebody who’s made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture.holly herndonMaybe there’s something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn’t really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FADE”]And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn’t imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways.So there’s something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop.ezra kleinSo in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn.holly herndonSpawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. “PROTO” was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier.But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you’ll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it’s like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That’s what the audio sounded like back in the day.And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn.ezra kleinWell, why don’t we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song “Swim.” And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album.[VOCALIZATION]So that’s really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own.[MUSIC PLAYING]What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there?holly herndonSo Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn’t deal with polyphony, which means one — more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can’t remember. It’s been so long.But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that’s where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that’s what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us.ezra kleinAnd I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people’s voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here?holly herndonI think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn’t sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it’s I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research.But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I’m really glad that I made that decision, because it’s informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model’s output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don’t know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that’s really informed all of the work that I’ve done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology.ezra kleinWe’re going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it’s really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, “Swim,” so people can hear where this ended up.[HOLLY HERNDON, “SWIM”]And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using — I don’t know if you’d call this an updated Spawn, but we’re calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton’s Jolene.[HOLLY HERNDON, “JOLENE”]So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who — what is singing?holly herndonSo that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it’s leaps and bounds better, more high — higher fidelity than little Spawn.So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There’s a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment.ezra kleinThat’s a use case that I’m fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed.What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can’t take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world?holly herndonI think I’m probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement —[HOLLY HERNDON, “MOVEMENT”]— or a platform —[HOLLY HERNDON, “CHORUS”]The albums before “PROTO” before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don’t expect everyone to have that relationship. I don’t really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It’s something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn’t normally be able to.You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn’t confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn’t do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it’s maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self.ezra kleinSo what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically?holly herndonWell, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it’s a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn’t afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It’s almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself.ezra kleinOh, that’s really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn’t otherwise try.holly herndonYeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn’t have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on “PROTO,” which is why I didn’t release it as an album, you know. It’s just not as interesting, somehow.ezra kleinI guess the other thing, there’s a question of meaning here that I’ve been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you’re trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now.And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky.When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I’m having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it’s not a human being.But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it’s Holly+, like, it’s a cool project, but I’m not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can’t not show up to talk to me, that that’s a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it.And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow?holly herndonIt’s really funny. We did a live performance from “PROTO,” I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, “I really enjoyed the show, but I don’t understand what it has to do with A.I.”And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn’t trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story.I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That’s something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together.I’m also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That’s not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I’m interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That’s the kind of stuff that I’m interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinI’ve heard you say that with A.I., it’s the model that’s the art, not necessarily the output of the model.holly herndonYeah, that’s one thing that we’re exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you’re not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that’s my own singing voice or whether that’s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world.So it’s almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we’re often using is “protocol art,” basically understanding that any work that’s made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we’re trying to lean into that.So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called “Ready Weight,” we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that’s the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work.And in a way, art’s kind of always a little bit like that. It’s a conversation between the work that you’re making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world.ezra kleinYou wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. “Collective intelligence” is more useful. Why?holly herndonBecause I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It’s trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it’s trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation.I think that’s why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it’s a part of our evolutionary story and I think it’s a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such.ezra kleinI want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there’s something that somebody has written into software over here. They’re unearthly. They’re a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there’s this whole question about who gets compensated and who’s going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically.And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that’s built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere.holly herndonYeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I’ve been doing for the last several years. It’s kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that’s not entirely new. You know, we’ve been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out.ezra kleinThe not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there’s also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We’re not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has.Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That’s all we’re doing. We’re not doing something new. We’re not making a copyright infringement.So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing.holly herndonSo, OK, I think that there’s a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what’s happening here. And it’s a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it’s really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It’s different in what it can do and also how it came about.So what it can do, we’ve kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it’s distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that’s distinctly different.But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it’s this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it’s a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you’re not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that — I like to call it the “sexy middle ground” between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown.And so that’s one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what’s happening right now isn’t working for everyone.ezra kleinAre there experiments that you find exciting or that you’ve conducted that you found the results of them promising?holly herndonYeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there’s one experiment that I’m running right now that I’m really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there’s 16 in total, and they’re joining a data trust. And we’ve hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we’re trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we’ll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward.I think it’s a really fun experiment, and it’s also because it’s singing and it’s choral music, it’s not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that’s not dealing with such sensitive information. So I’m really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That’s also a big question.ezra kleinSo you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art.holly herndonYou know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art.ezra kleinThis idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife’s book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn’t want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right?It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn’t do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn’t plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn’t want would be your top Google search result.And here it’s going to get even weirder because there isn’t really — you can’t have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there’s something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data — which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there’s no real obvious avenue towards that.holly herndonThere’s none at the moment, but I think that that’s coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don’t think it’s tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet.ezra kleinThat feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we’ve been we’ve been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn’t feel like this is going to hold.Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it’s just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I’m amazed at how powerful the “what are you going to do” impulse is in life.holly herndonWell, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it’s actually gaining traction. And there’s precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that’s not how things played out. So now we’re in a position where we’re building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don’t want to have included in these models.We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don’t think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it’s over. They should just have everything.You know, if we do have a situation where we’re able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I’m really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I’m not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it’s huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that.If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don’t think we should give up.ezra kleinI definitely agree. I don’t think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they’re doing.holly herndonYes.ezra kleinOne thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there’s modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you’re thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that’s scary, right?I mean, we’re very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we — what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well,holly herndonI think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we’re talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That’s something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music.And a lot of experimental music doesn’t follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don’t need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that’s going to be really difficult to pay for. It’s almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea.I think what’s really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren’t squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic.ezra kleinSo I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, “All Media is Training Data.” What’s the argument there?holly herndonYeah, so this is a book that’s a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it’s something that’s worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon.And I think that we need to think about what we’re creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we’re doing around the exhibition is we’re creating training data deliberately. So we’re treating training data as artworks themselves. I’m writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really — the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist.So we’re kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of — we like to call them mind children that we’re sending to the future.ezra kleinI want to talk about what’s triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I’m actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we’re covering new things that happened that are not in the training data.But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media’s training data, what they hear is — everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it’s going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn’t need us anymore.When we become the training data, we’re sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you’re training data, does that mean you’re replaceable?holly herndonArt is a very complex cultural web. It’s a conversation. It’s something that’s performed. It’s a dialogue. It’s situated in time and place. We wouldn’t confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I’m not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important.I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won’t be replaced and I think it’ll be weird and wonderful.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinThere are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called “Endel,” and it’s like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to — And it’s fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn’t think much of it.[endel, ""wind downEVENING ENERGY RISE”]And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we’re going to know what we want. And what we’re going to want is a generic version of it. And we’re going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you’re an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it.And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food.I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here?holly herndonWell, there’s a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we’re also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they’re kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke.One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that’s how we’re interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you.So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn’t like and didn’t understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked.But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn’t like to expand my palate and understanding of what’s possible in music. And so that’s one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won’t, but some people will.ezra kleinOne of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic.And that there’s this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It’ll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it’s a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you’re doing? Is there something there?holly herndonYeah, I think that’s largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that’s just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that’s basically the purpose.You know, it’s supposed to kind be a catchall, but I’m not interested in the catchall. I’m interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I’m interested in this other weird thing. And so that’s what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models.ezra kleinI want to end by going back to a song from “PROTO.” And it’s one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it’s doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of “Godmother“?[RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING]What’s happening there?holly herndonOK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here’s a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that’s basically how far we’ve come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It’s — the speed is incredible.So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin’s stems through my voice. And Jlin’s music is very percussive. It’s mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it’s trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice.ezra kleinWell, here, why don’t we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It’s called “The Precision of Infinity.”[JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, “THE PRECISION OF INFINITY”] And so, yeah, it’s not that it’s a machine, it’s just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there’s like a Philip Glass sample in there. It’s beautiful. But I don’t know. It’s funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very — compared to a lot of what’s coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we’re currently hearing or seeing, which it’s like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal.And I think the reason “PROTO” sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange.holly herndonWell, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was — this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them.And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that’s why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that’s — I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who’s an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds.But it was really important to me that I wasn’t trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn’t, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful.ezra kleinAs somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it’s easy if you’re outside this and don’t have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don’t — as I think most of my listeners don’t — and you see, well, there’s models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook — it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars.How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start?holly herndonThat’s a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out.This was our process. It’s been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn’t have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you’re really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that’s a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called “Intelligence and Spirit.” It’s a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, “Children of Time” by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders.ezra kleinOne of my favorite books.holly herndonYeah, it’s so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there’s a book called “Plurality” that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It’s about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.ezra kleinHolly Herndon, thank you very much.holly herndonThanks so much.

But what could it look like for artists to collaborate with A.I. systems in making art that is actually generative, challenging, transcendent?Holly Herndon offered one answer with her 2019 album “PROTO.” Along with Mathew Dryhurst and the programmer Jules LaPlace, she built an A.I. called “Spawn” trained on human voices that adds an uncanny yet oddly personal layer to the music. Beyond her music and visual art, Herndon is trying to solve a problem that many creative people are encountering as A.I. becomes more prominent: How do you encourage experimentation without stealing others’ work to train A.I. models? Along with Dryhurst, Jordan Meyer and Patrick Hoepner, she co-founded Spawning, a company figuring out how to allow artists — and all of us creating content on the internet — to “consent” to our work being used as training data.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 8 CommentsShare full article8Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 8‘Artificial Intelligence’?

[MUSIC PLAYING] We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in ""The New Yorker,"" and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out. And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, ""PROTO,"" which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song ""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"" came on. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT""] And I just stopped walking. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT""] What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it's so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so -- when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it's all riffing on others in this very obvious way. What I like about Herndon's art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It's going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she's got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut. And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it'll have this long flowing copper hair. And it'll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it's on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work. And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.'s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Holly Herndon, welcome to the show. Thanks. It's great to be here. So something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you? Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, I feel like I'm such a product of the environments that I've spent a lot of time in, so I'm really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology. I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman. But why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what's happening around it -- I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I've ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what's happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence? I mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It's so easy to participate in. It's fairly easy to make. It's also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of -- if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it's an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that's why people have organized around it so much. When I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I'll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way. And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I'm curious, as somebody who's made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture. Maybe there's something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn't really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FADE""] And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn't imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways. So there's something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop. So in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn. Spawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. ""PROTO"" was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier. But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you'll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it's like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That's what the audio sounded like back in the day. And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn. Well, why don't we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song ""Swim."" And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album. [VOCALIZATION] So that's really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own. [MUSIC PLAYING] What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there? So Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn't deal with polyphony, which means one -- more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can't remember. It's been so long. But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that's where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that's what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us. And I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people's voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here? I think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn't sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it's I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research. But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I'm really glad that I made that decision, because it's informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model's output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don't know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that's really informed all of the work that I've done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology. We're going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it's really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, ""Swim,"" so people can hear where this ended up. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""SWIM""] And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using -- I don't know if you'd call this an updated Spawn, but we're calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton's Jolene. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""JOLENE""] So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who -- what is singing? So that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it's leaps and bounds better, more high -- higher fidelity than little Spawn. So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There's a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment. That's a use case that I'm fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed. What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can't take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world? I think I'm probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement -- [HOLLY HERNDON, ""MOVEMENT""] -- or a platform -- [HOLLY HERNDON, ""CHORUS""] The albums before ""PROTO"" before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don't expect everyone to have that relationship. I don't really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It's something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn't normally be able to. You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn't confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn't do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it's maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self. So what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically? Well, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it's a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn't afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It's almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself. Oh, that's really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn't otherwise try. Yeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn't have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on ""PROTO,"" which is why I didn't release it as an album, you know. It's just not as interesting, somehow. I guess the other thing, there's a question of meaning here that I've been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you're trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now. And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky. When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I'm having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it's not a human being. But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it's Holly+, like, it's a cool project, but I'm not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can't not show up to talk to me, that that's a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it. And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow? It's really funny. We did a live performance from ""PROTO,"" I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, ""I really enjoyed the show, but I don't understand what it has to do with A.I."" And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn't trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story. I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That's something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together. I'm also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That's not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I'm interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've heard you say that with A.I., it's the model that's the art, not necessarily the output of the model. Yeah, that's one thing that we're exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you're not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that's my own singing voice or whether that's my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world. So it's almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we're often using is ""protocol art,"" basically understanding that any work that's made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we're trying to lean into that. So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called ""Ready Weight,"" we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that's the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work. And in a way, art's kind of always a little bit like that. It's a conversation between the work that you're making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world. You wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. ""Collective intelligence"" is more useful. Why? Because I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It's trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it's trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation. I think that's why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it's a part of our evolutionary story and I think it's a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such. I want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there's something that somebody has written into software over here. They're unearthly. They're a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there's this whole question about who gets compensated and who's going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically. And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that's built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere. Yeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I've been doing for the last several years. It's kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that's not entirely new. You know, we've been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out. The not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there's also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We're not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has. Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That's all we're doing. We're not doing something new. We're not making a copyright infringement. So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing. So, OK, I think that there's a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what's happening here. And it's a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it's really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It's different in what it can do and also how it came about. So what it can do, we've kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it's distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that's distinctly different. But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it's this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it's a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you're not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that -- I like to call it the ""sexy middle ground"" between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown. And so that's one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what's happening right now isn't working for everyone. Are there experiments that you find exciting or that you've conducted that you found the results of them promising? Yeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there's one experiment that I'm running right now that I'm really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there's 16 in total, and they're joining a data trust. And we've hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we're trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we'll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward. I think it's a really fun experiment, and it's also because it's singing and it's choral music, it's not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that's not dealing with such sensitive information. So I'm really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That's also a big question. So you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art. You know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art. This idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife's book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn't want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right? It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn't do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn't plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn't want would be your top Google search result. And here it's going to get even weirder because there isn't really -- you can't have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there's something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data -- which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there's no real obvious avenue towards that. There's none at the moment, but I think that that's coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don't think it's tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet. That feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we've been we've been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn't feel like this is going to hold. Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it's just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I'm amazed at how powerful the ""what are you going to do"" impulse is in life. Well, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it's actually gaining traction. And there's precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that's not how things played out. So now we're in a position where we're building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don't want to have included in these models. We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don't think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it's over. They should just have everything. You know, if we do have a situation where we're able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I'm really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I'm not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it's huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that. If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don't think we should give up. I definitely agree. I don't think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they're doing. Yes. One thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there's modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you're thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that's scary, right? I mean, we're very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we -- what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well, I think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we're talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That's something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music. And a lot of experimental music doesn't follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don't need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that's going to be really difficult to pay for. It's almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea. I think what's really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren't squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic. So I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, ""All Media is Training Data."" What's the argument there? Yeah, so this is a book that's a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it's something that's worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon. And I think that we need to think about what we're creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we're doing around the exhibition is we're creating training data deliberately. So we're treating training data as artworks themselves. I'm writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really -- the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist. So we're kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of -- we like to call them mind children that we're sending to the future. I want to talk about what's triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I'm actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we're covering new things that happened that are not in the training data. But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media's training data, what they hear is -- everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it's going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn't need us anymore. When we become the training data, we're sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you're training data, does that mean you're replaceable? Art is a very complex cultural web. It's a conversation. It's something that's performed. It's a dialogue. It's situated in time and place. We wouldn't confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I'm not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important. I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won't be replaced and I think it'll be weird and wonderful. [MUSIC PLAYING] There are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called ""Endel,"" and it's like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to -- And it's fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn't think much of it. EVENING ENERGY RISE""] And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we're going to know what we want. And what we're going to want is a generic version of it. And we're going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you're an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it. And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food. I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here? Well, there's a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we're also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they're kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke. One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that's how we're interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you. So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn't like and didn't understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked. But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn't like to expand my palate and understanding of what's possible in music. And so that's one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won't, but some people will. One of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic. And that there's this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It'll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it's a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you're doing? Is there something there? Yeah, I think that's largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that's just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that's basically the purpose. You know, it's supposed to kind be a catchall, but I'm not interested in the catchall. I'm interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I'm interested in this other weird thing. And so that's what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models. I want to end by going back to a song from ""PROTO."" And it's one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it's doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of ""Godmother""? [RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING] What's happening there? OK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here's a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that's basically how far we've come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It's -- the speed is incredible. So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin's stems through my voice. And Jlin's music is very percussive. It's mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it's trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice. Well, here, why don't we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It's called ""The Precision of Infinity."" [JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, ""THE PRECISION OF INFINITY""] And so, yeah, it's not that it's a machine, it's just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there's like a Philip Glass sample in there. It's beautiful. But I don't know. It's funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very -- compared to a lot of what's coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we're currently hearing or seeing, which it's like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal. And I think the reason ""PROTO"" sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was -- this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them. And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that's why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that's -- I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who's an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds. But it was really important to me that I wasn't trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn't, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful. As somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it's easy if you're outside this and don't have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don't -- as I think most of my listeners don't -- and you see, well, there's models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook -- it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars. How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start? That's a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out. This was our process. It's been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn't have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you're really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that's a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called ""Intelligence and Spirit."" It's a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, ""Children of Time"" by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders. One of my favorite books. Yeah, it's so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there's a book called ""Plurality"" that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It's about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.

LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New research from 

The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, ‘Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work’ – looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).






Pearson’s workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.

The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the UK are:


Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (679,000 hours)

Develop educational programs, plans, or procedures (665,000 hours)

Create visual designs or displays (525,000 hours)

Maintain operational records (512,000 hours)

Prepare legal or regulatory documents (490,000 hours)

Maintain health or medical records (406,000 hours)

Prepare reports of operational or procedural activities (401,000 hours)

Advise others on products or services (387,000 hours)

Explain regulations, policies, or procedures (386,000 hours)

Monitor individual behaviour or performance (383,000 hours)


By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership.

At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with Generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance.
- A message from our partner -

Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:

“In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”






Methodology

At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.

Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the UK on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years’ time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is here, and it's already changing our lives in a wide variety of ways. From chatbots to sat-nav, AI has revolutionized the technological space — but in doing so, it may be set to take over a wide variety of jobs, particularly those involving labor-intensive manual tasks. But it's not all bad news: as with most new technologies, the hypothetical advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where machines are smarter than humans and can apply what they learn across multiple disciplines — could also lead to new roles. So what might the job market of the near future look like, and could your job be at risk?Jobs AI could replaceData entry(Image credit: Shutterstock)One of the most mind-numbing and tedious jobs around today, data entry will surely be one of the first roles supplanted by AI. Instead of a human laboring over endless data sets and fiddly forms for hours on end, AI systems will be able to input and manage large amounts of data quickly and seamlessly, hopefully freeing up human workers for much more productive tasks. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksBlinkist MagazineApple Recommends Blinkist, The Best App For Intellectuals Around The WorldBlinkist MagazineUndoTelemarketing(Image credit: Shutterstock)You might already have endured robotic calls asking if you have been the victim of an accident that wasn’t your fault, or whether you’re keen to upgrade your long-distance calling plan — but this could be just a taste of things to come. AI services could easily take the work of a whole call center, automatically dialling hundreds, if not thousands of unsuspecting victims to spread the word, whether you like it or not. LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceCustomer service representative(Image credit: Shutterstock)On the friendlier side, AI customer service agents are already a common sight on the websites of many major companies. Often in the form of chatbots, these agents offer a first line of support, before deferring to a human where needed. In the not too distant future, though, expect the AI to take over completely, walking customers through their complaints or queries from start to finish.Front of house(Image credit: Shutterstock)Restaurant bookings can be a hassle, as overworked staff or maitre d’s try to juggle existing reservations with no-shows and chancers who try their arm at getting a last-minute slot. Booking a table will soon be a whole lot easier, however, with an entirely computerized system able to allocate slots and spaces with ease, and even juggle late cancellations or alterations without the need for anyone to lose their spot. Voiceover artist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Although image generation has grabbed much of the headlines, AI voice creation has become a growing presence in the entertainment and creative world. Offering potentially unlimited customization options, directors and producers can now create a voice whatever tone, style or accent they require — which is then able to say whatever they desire, without the need for costly retakes or ever getting tired.  Copywriter(Image credit: Shutterstock)Text generation has quickly become one of the most-used aspects of AI technology, with copilots and other tools able to quickly generate large amounts of texts based on a simple prompt. Whether you’re looking to fill your new website with business-focused copy, or offering more detail on your latest product launch — AI text generation provides a quick and easy way to do whatever you need to do. Website builder(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, many of the leading website builder services today offer a fully AI-powered service, allowing you to create the page of your dreams simply by entering a few prompts. From start-ups to sole traders and all the way to big business, there’s no need to fiddle around with templates — simply tell the platform what you’re after, and a personalized website will be yours to customize or publish in moments. Driver(Image credit: Shutterstock)This one may still sound a bit more like the realm of science fiction, but with cars getting smarter by the year, fully AI-powered driving is not too much of a pipe dream any more. Far from the basic autopilot tools on offer today, the cars of the future may well be able to not just operate independently, but provide their passengers with a fully-curated experience, from air conditioning at just the right level, to your favorite radio station. Accountant(Image credit: Shutterstock)Another position that is based around humans taking in huge amounts of data and creating reports, accounting is set for an AI revolution that could see many roles replaced. No need to spend hours collating receipts and entering numbers into a spreadsheet when AI can quickly scan, identify and upload all the information needed, taking the stress out of tax season and answering any queries or questions with ease. Paralegal/legal assistant(Image credit: Shutterstock)The legal industry is another one that is dominated by large amounts of data and paperwork, and also one that is dominated by role-specific processes and even language. This makes it another prime candidate for AI, which will be able to automate the lengthy data analysis and entry actions undertaken by paralegals and legal assistants today — although given the scale or importance of the case involved, it may still be wise to have some kind of human element Receptionist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Signing in for an appointment or a meeting is another job that many believe can easily be done by AI platforms. Rather than needing to bother or distract a human from their job, simply check in on a display screen, with your visitor’s badge or meeting confirmation registered in seconds — allowing you (and everyone else) to get on with your day. Courier/delivery driver(Image credit: Shutterstock)Similar to AI drivers, autonomous vehicles and robots powered by AI systems could soon be taking the role of delivery people. After scanning the list of destinations for any given day, the vehicle or platform would be able to quickly calculate the most efficient route, ensuring no waiting around all day for your package, as well as being able to instantly flag any issues or missed deliveries. Proofreader/editor(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a boost to current spell checking tools, it may be that AI systems eventually graduate from suggesting or writing content to helping check it for mistakes. Once trained on a style guide or content guidelines, an AI editor could quickly scan through articles, documents and filings to spot any issues — a particularly handy speed boost in highly regulated industries such as banking, insurance or healthcare — before flagging possible problems to a human supervisor. Musician(Image credit: Shutterstock)Away from the written word, AI-powered platforms could soon be helping compose the next great pieces of music. Taking inspiration from vast libraries of existing pieces, these futuristic musicians could quickly dream up everything from film soundtracks to radio jingles, once again meaning companies or organizations would no longer need to pay human performers for day-long sessions consisting of multiple takes. Statistician(Image credit: Shutterstock)Another area which relies on quickly spotting trends and patterns among huge tranches of data, the statistics field could be quickly swamped by AI platforms. Whether it is at a business level, where companies could look to spot potential growth opportunities or risky situations, all the way down to the sports stats used by commentators and fans alike, AI can quickly come up with the figures needed. Project manager(Image credit: Shutterstock)A job that has already declined in importance over the past few years thanks to the emergence and widespread adoption of centralized collaboration tools, the role of project manager is another sure-fire target for AI. Rather than having a designated manager trying to keep tabs on the work being done by a number of disparate teams, an AI-powered central solution could collate all the progress in a single location, allowing everyone to view the latest updates and stay on top of their work. Animator(Image credit: Shutterstock)We’re already seeing the beginning of AI taking over the image design and generation space, with animation set to be one of the first fields to feel the effect. As more and more advanced AI programs emerge, creating any kind of customized animation will soon be easier than ever, with production studios able to easily create the movies, TV shows and other media they require. Graphic designer(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein to the entertainment industry, creating designs for new products, advertising campaigns and more will doubtless soon be another field dominated by AI. With a simple prompt, companies will be able to create the graphics they need, with potentially endless customization options that can be carried out instantly, with no need for back-and-forth with human designers. Cybersecurity analyst(Image credit: Shutterstock)Keeping track of potential security risks is another task that could be easily handled by AI, which will be able to continuously monitor multiple data fields and sensors to spot issues or threats before they take hold. Once detected, the systems would hopefully be able to take proactive action to lock down valuable data or company platforms, while alerting human agents and managers to ensure everything remains protected. Travel agent(Image credit: Shutterstock)Many of us are perfectly comfortable booking and scheduling our vacations independently, but sometimes you want all of the stress of planning taken off your hands. Rather than leaving it to a human agent, AI travel service platforms could gather all of your requirements and come up with a tailored solution or itinerary exactly sculpted to your needs, without endless back and forth, taking all of the hassle out of your vacation planning. Insurance underwriter(Image credit: Shutterstock)Making assessments on the viability of insurance applications can be a lengthy process, with agents needing to take into consideration a huge number of potential risks and other criteria, often via specific formulae or structures. Rather than a human needing to spend all this time, AI agents could quickly scan through all the information provided, coming up with a decision much faster and more effectively.Stockbroker/trader(Image credit: Shutterstock)One final field that is again dominated by analyzing huge amounts of data, past knowledge, and spotting upcoming trends and actions before they happen, stock trading could also quickly become dominated by AI. AI systems will be able to speedily act to make the best deals for financial firms in the blink of an eye, outpacing and outperforming human traders with ease, and possibly leading to even bigger profits. Jobs AI could createAI expert/consultant(Image credit: Shutterstock)First, and perhaps most obviously, will be an increase in roles for people looking to advise businesses exactly what kind of AI they should be utilizing. Simply grabbing as many AI tools and services as possible may have a tremendously destabilizing effect on a business, so having an expert who is able to outline the exact benefits and risks of specific technologies will become increasingly important for companies of all sizes.AI trainer(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, getting the most out of your company’s new AI tools will be vital, so having trainers skilled in the right services will be absolutely critical. The ability to suggest to workers at all levels what they can utilize AI for will be incredibly useful for businesses everywhere, walking employees through the various platforms and educating them about any possible ill effects. Prompt engineer(Image credit: Shutterstock)With chatbots and virtual agents becoming the main “entry point” for people encountering AI, knowing just how to communicate with such systems is going to be vital to making the relationship productive. Having experts who know the best way to “talk” to models such as ChatGPT, especially when it comes to phrasing specific questions or prompts, will be increasingly important as our dependence on AI models increases. AI psychologist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Once we’re happy with how we communicate with AI models, the next big obstacle might be understanding what keeps it “happy” — or at least, productive. We may soon see experts who, much like human therapists, are engaged with AI models to try and understand what makes them tick — including why they might show bias or toxicity — in order to make our relationships with them more effective overall. AI crisis manager(Image credit: Shutterstock)On the occasion that something does go wrong — whether that’s a poorly worded corporate email, or an advertising campaign that features an embarrassing slip-up — there will be a need for crisis managers who can step in and look to quickly defuse the situation. This may become increasingly important in situations where AI may put sensitive data or even lives at risk, although hopefully such incidents will be rare. AI lawyer(Image credit: Shutterstock)The next step along from a crisis involving AI agents or systems may be lawyers or legal experts who specialize in dealing with non-human creators. The ability to represent a defendant who isn’t physically present in a courtroom may become increasingly valuable as the role of AI in everyday life, and the risks it poses, becomes more prevalent — especially as business data or personal information gets involved. AI stress tester(Image credit: Shutterstock)With AI set to push the limits of what can be done with analysis and data processing, it may be that some companies looking to adopt new tools are simply not equipped to handle the new technology. Stress testers will be able to evaluate the status of your tech stack and network to make sure that any AI tools your business is set to use don’t have the opposite effect and push everything to breaking point. Image/video auditor(Image credit: Shutterstock)With content creation becoming an increasingly important role for AI, we’re likely to see such images, audio and video appearing more frequently in everyday life. But we’re already seeing backlash against obviously AI-generated content littered with errors, like extra fingers on humans, or nonsense alphabets in advertising. Having a human editor that is able to audit this content and ensure it is accurate, and fit for human consumption, could be a vital new role. AI proofreader(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, AI-generated content may also need a human sense-checking it before it hits the public domain. Similar to the work currently being done by proofreaders and editors on human-produced content around the world, making sure that AI documents flow properly and sound legitimate will be another crucial consideration, and should lead to a growth in these sorts of roles. ""Non-AI"" content creator(Image credit: Shutterstock)Finally, despite the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-generated content, there will still always be room for the human touch. Much like we already have “authentic” artists, or artisans who specialize in handmade goods, it may soon be that we have creators and painters who strive for their work to be “authentically human”, setting them apart from the AI hordes.

TL:DR
 Peter Cappelli argues AI complexity often makes it more work than manual tasks. He notes AI can become costly due to rising computer space and electricity demands. Human validation of AI is necessary and costly; AI is best for sorting data, not revolutionary tasks. 



A common argument in favor of AI is that it helps people save time at work.
But what if using generative AI is actually more trouble than it is worth? That’s the question posited by Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School.
Do we really need AI at work?
During a speech at MIT (via ZDNET), Cappelli explained that cumulatively, given the inherent complexity of AI, the work that goes into automating some tasks is more work than if you just did the task yourself in the first place.
He also adds that “it turns out there are many things generative AI could do that we don’t really need doing.”
He then went on to explain how replacing rote automation with AI is going to end up increasingly expensive. “It’s not so clear that large language models are going to be as cheap as they are now,” Cappelli said. “As more people use them, computer space has to go up, electricity demands alone are big. Somebody’s got to pay for it.”
Another concern raised by Cappelli is the fact that people are still needed either way in order to validate AI’s output.
“If you’re going to use it for something important, you better be sure that it’s right,” he explained. “And how are you going to know if it’s right? Well, it helps to have an expert; somebody who can independently validate and knows something about the topic.
“To look for hallucinations or quirky outcomes, and that it is up to date..We have to check it somehow, and this is not necessarily easy or cheap to do.”
So, what is AI actually good for? According to Cappelli, AI is best served sorting through data. “Somebody’s got to worry about guardrails and data pollution issues,” he said. Which is a lot more boring than revolutionizing the games industry.

In the ever-evolving landscape of work, the emergence of generative AI has sparked both curiosity and concern among professionals. Yet, for independent knowledge workers who navigate the complexities of high-end tasks daily, this technological advancement offers a unique set of opportunities and challenges. My conversation with Miles Everson, CEO of MBO Partners, sheds light on the nuanced impact of generative AI on this distinct segment of the workforce.
The Surprising Optimism Among Independent Workers 
Everson’s insights begin with an optimistic note: a significant majority of independent workers do not see their jobs being replaced by generative AI in the near future. In fact, only 8% of independent workers surveyed by MBO Partners anticipate their roles might be at risk within the next five years—a stark contrast to the 13% in the broader full-time workforce.
This optimism, as Everson explains, stems from the specific nature of tasks performed by high-end independent workers—tasks that often involve complex decision-making with unstructured data, areas where AI has yet to fully excel. These workers are involved in dynamic environments where judgment and adaptability play critical roles—qualities that AI, for all its advances, cannot completely replicate. The nuanced understanding of their professional landscape helps these workers view AI not as a threat, but as a potential tool to enhance their own capabilities.
The Strategic Use of Generative AI 
Beyond the fear of obsolescence, there is a proactive engagement with AI among independent workers. According to Everson, 37% of independent professionals are already integrating generative AI into their daily tasks. This is not about replacing human intellect but augmenting it to handle more routine aspects of their roles, thereby elevating their strategic value to clients.
This trend reflects a broader historical pattern: technological innovation, while disruptive, often creates more opportunities than it extinguishes. Everson points out that by automating the more mundane tasks, independent workers can focus on higher-value, more complex activities that require a human touch. This strategic incorporation of AI allows them to provide more sophisticated, tailored services that better meet the needs of their clients, ultimately making their offerings more competitive and indispensable in a market that increasingly values personalized and agile solutions.
Rethinking Job Structures with AI 
Everson’s strategic framework for understanding AI’s impact across different job structures is insightful. He categorizes tasks based on salary ranges and complexity: structured tasks earning less than $50,000 annually, semi-structured tasks in the $50,000 to $150,000 range, and complex, high-stakes decision-making tasks at salaries over $150,000. This salary-based stratification provides a clear perspective on how AI might be applied differently depending on the complexity and value of the tasks involved.
For lower salary ranges, where tasks are more structured and repetitive, AI integration can be swift and impactful, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention. However, as the complexity of tasks and the salary increase, the integration of AI becomes more challenging. At the highest salary levels, where strategic and unstructured decision-making prevails, AI has yet to develop the capability to fully replicate human judgment. Here, AI is used more as a support tool, enhancing human decision-making rather than replacing it. This nuanced understanding is critical for businesses planning their long-term strategy around AI integration, ensuring that they align AI’s capabilities with the right job roles to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.
Embracing AI to Remain Competitive 
Everson compellingly argues that the true challenge in the era of generative AI is not the technology itself, but the ability of companies and professionals to adapt and harness its potential. The narrative that AI will lead to widespread job elimination oversimplifies the multifaceted impact of AI in the workplace. Instead, Everson highlights the enhancement of job functions as a critical benefit of AI adoption. By integrating AI into their workflows, businesses can not only improve their operational efficiencies but also enhance their strategic capabilities, making them more competitive in a rapidly evolving market.
This approach helps secure a company’s position in the future job market, where being technologically adept and adaptable will be key determinants of success. For professionals, keeping pace with AI developments and proactively incorporating these technologies into their skill sets can turn potential threats into significant career opportunities, emphasizing the importance of a mindset geared towards continuous learning and innovation.
Generative AI as a Catalyst for Job Creation 
Everson illuminates the role of generative AI in fostering job creation, grounding his argument in historical precedents that demonstrate how technological innovation often leads to expanded markets and increased demand for labor. He references the transformative impact of platforms like Uber, which not only revolutionized the transportation industry but also significantly expanded the market size from a hundred million to three hundred million dollars in just five years in San Francisco alone.
This expansion was not merely a shift but an enhancement that created more opportunities and jobs than previously existed. Everson posits that generative AI is poised to have a similar effect, particularly as it enhances customer experiences and streamlines internal processes. As businesses adopt AI to improve efficiencies, they are likely to discover new service offerings and market opportunities, which in turn could lead to the creation of new job categories. This suggests that AI, far from being a mere tool for automating existing tasks, can act as a springboard for innovation and market growth, paving the way for new kinds of employment that are today, perhaps, unimaginable.
Practical Advice for Independent Workers 
In light of these evolving dynamics, Everson offers practical guidance for independent workers to adapt and thrive in an AI-enhanced market. His dual strategy emphasizes the importance of cultivating a mindset of curiosity and an active engagement with AI technologies. By directly interacting with AI tools, experimenting, and exploring their functionalities, independent workers can gain a practical understanding of how these technologies can enhance their work, streamline operations, and open up new avenues for business. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it allows professionals to discover and innovate in ways that formal education alone cannot provide.
However, Everson also stresses the importance of complementing this experiential learning with formal training and certifications in AI applications. This more structured approach to understanding AI ensures that independent workers not only keep pace with technological advancements but also enhance their professional credentials, making them more attractive to clients and collaborators who are increasingly prioritizing technological proficiency. Together, these strategies equip independent workers with the tools necessary to navigate and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the ongoing integration of AI into the workforce.
Concluding Thoughts: A Call for Openness and Adaptability 
As we concluded our interview, Everson emphasized the importance of adopting a mindset open to innovation. Viewing generative AI as an opportunity rather than a threat allows professionals to explore new possibilities and secure a competitive edge. His parting advice is clear: Embrace change, engage with new technologies, and be prepared to adapt, for this is the path to not just surviving but thriving in the evolving landscape of work. As I help companies I work with adapt to the future of work and integrate Generative AI into their activities, I will recommend they listen to this interview.

Hype of generative AI exploded in 2023, as did share prices of big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Concurrent with this hype, AI investment moved from healthcare and AVs to generative AI in 2023, and this has continued in 2024. In fact, total private investment fell to $96 billion in 2023, down from $103.4 billion in 2022 and $130 billion in 2021 even as investment in generative AI surged eightfold from 2022 to $25.2 billion in 2023.
On the surface, generative AI looks incredible. Writing emails, marketing reports, and even academic papers is alluring for many, particularly for those people who are frequently stopped by writer’s block. Generative AI’s ability to create pictures and videos is even more attractive. Suddenly, advertising videos, education videos, and even entire movies seems possible.
All we have to do is make some improvements, the proponents claim, and we will be there. Reduce the frequency of hallucinations, racial slurs, and misplaced arms, and a productivity revolution will be unleashed.
Not So Fast
Unfortunately, we didn’t see that emphasis in the recent products that were announced by Google and OpenAI in Mid-May, however. OpenAI introduced a voice assistant, and a new model, GPT-4o that can respond to audio prompts, works across text, vision, and voice, and can read facial expressions.
Google also emphasized new features rather than greater accuracy, even showing hallucinations in its demo. Gemini Live enables video that is captured with a phone along with voice recognition to deliver contextual responses to your questions. Gemini was also integrated with Gmail so that long email chains can be summarized.
Some noticed the problem with emphasizing new features, “raising “concerns about the speed at which untested new services are coming to market, and academics and ethicists are distressed about the technology’s tendency to propagate bias,” a problem related to hallucinations.
One reason there wasn’t an emphasis on reducing hallucinations is because the problem is hard. Some argue that hallucinations area “baked into AI chatbots:” Large language models (LLMs) are

doing exactly what they were developed and trained to do: respond, however they can, to user prompts. The real problem, according to some AI researchers, lies in our collective ideas about what these models are and how we’ve decided to use them.

Others argue that the big tech firms have basically given up. For instance, in Google’s IO keynote, it placed disclaimers such as “check responses for accuracy” in every new AI tool it showed off. ChatGPT operates similarly. In tiny font just below the prompt window, it says, “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.” “That’s not a disclaimer you want to see from tools that are supposed to change our whole lives in the very near future!”
Comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are also illustrative:

Anyone who had an issue with AI’s accuracy was naive. If you just do the naive thing and say, never say anything that you’re not 100 percent sure about,’ you can get them all to do that. But it won’t have the magic that people like so much.

As many have argued, it’s all about wooing investors with magic.
Shiny Objects Over Safety
A CNBC article also argues that companies are more concerned with investors than users, and less concerned with reducing hallucinations. “Artificial intelligence engineers at top tech companies” said, 

The pressure to roll out AI tools at breakneck speed has come to define their jobs. They say that much of their work is assigned to appease investors rather than to solve problems for end users, and that they are often chasing OpenAI.” “Some said they were switched over to AI teams to help support fast-paced rollouts without having adequate time to train or learn about AI, even if they are new to the technology.

A Microsoft engineer says that when it comes to ethics and safeguards, it “has cut corners in favor of speed, leading to rushed rollouts without sufficient concerns about what could follow. The engineer said there’s a recognition that because all of the large tech companies have access to most of the same data, there’s no real moat in AI,” comments consistent with what executive Jan Leike said when he departed OpenAI: OpenAI put “shiny products over safety.”
An “Amazon engineer, who lost his weekend to a project that was ultimately scuttled, said higher-ups seemed to be doing things just to ‘tick a checkbox,’ and that speed, rather than quality, was the priority while trying to recreate products coming out of Microsoft or OpenAI.”
Another Microsoft AI engineer “recalled instances when a software engineer on his team would come up with an #algorithm to solve a particular problem that didn’t involve generative AI. That solution would be pushed aside in favor of one that used a large language model, even if it were less efficient, more expensive and slower.”
An independent engineer “described much of the work in generative AI today as an ‘extreme amount of vaporware and #hype.’ Every two weeks, the engineer said, there’s some sort of big pivot, but ultimately there’s the sense that everyone is building the same thing.” He said he often has to put together demos of AI products for the company’s board of directors on three-week timelines, even though the products are “a big pile of nonsense.” There’s a constant effort to appease investors and fight for money, he said. He gave one example of building a web app to show investors even though it wasn’t related to the team’s actual work. After the presentation, “We never touched it again.”
What do these comments tell us about generative AI? That perhaps it isn’t as good as proponents have been claiming. If it was so great, companies would be lapping up these products and using them to increase their productivity, but they aren’t, according to the Wall Street Journal. Suppliers of AI software wouldn’t be so concerned about what the investors thought because the success of their customers would speak to investors.
Who Will Solve the Real Problem?
One big problem is that if suppliers of AI are spending more time on demos for investors, then who will solve real problems, such as the hallucination problem? The simple answer is that not enough engineers are trying to solve the problem and thus the solution will take much longer than the tech sector is claiming. The longer and more cynical answer is that they don’t have a solution and know they don’t have one, so they are trying to distract everyone. And so far, they are succeeding.
This story also tells us about investors, and how superficial they are, which is something that we kind of already knew. Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller described these investors in his 2000 book Irrational Exuberance. During a boom, price increases lead to more price increases as each increase seems to provide more evidence that the market will continue to rise. The media, with help from the financial sector, offers seemingly logical reasons for the price increases, thus creating a narrative that encourages still more increases.
The narrative that Robert Shiller is referring to is the one companies are trying to massage with their demos, many of which may be faked. We already knew that some were faked, but the quotes from engineers in the CNBC article suggests that many may be faked.
A new narrative will likely soon emerge, and that narrative will likely be exaggerated in the opposite direction. This is way that bubbles work. Investors love you on the way up and hate you on the way down.

            Elon Musk says artificial intelligence will take all our jobs and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
    

            “Probably none of us will have a job,” Musk said about AI at a tech conference on Thursday.
    

            While speaking remotely via webcam at VivaTech 2024 in Paris, Musk described a future where jobs would be “optional.”

            “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job,” Musk said. “But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.”
    

            For this scenario to work, he said, there would need to be “universal high income” – not to be confused with universal basic income, although he did not share what that could look like. (UBI refers to the government giving a certain amount of money to everyone regardless of how much they earn.)
    

            “There would be no shortage of goods or services,” he said.
    

AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market.
    

            In January, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time.
    

            Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers.

            Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the “Culture Book Series” by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and “the best envisioning of a future AI.”
    

            In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled.
    

            “The question will really be one of meaning  – if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?” he said.  “I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this – in that we may give AI meaning.”
    

            He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because “they’re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.”

Since joining Vox in 2018, her work has explored the rise of TikTok, internet aesthetics, and the pursuit of money and fame online. You can sign up for her biweekly Vox Culture newsletter here.FacebookLinkArtificial intelligence has long been hailed as a great “equalizer” of creativity, finally putting the ability to create art in all of its myriad forms into the hands of the tech-savvy. Not a creative person? Not an issue.“The reason we built this tool is to really democratize image generation for a bunch of people who wouldn’t necessarily classify themselves as artists,” said the lead researcher for DALL-E, which turns text prompts into images. Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, wrote in his book that generative AI will one day account for 95 percent of the work that companies hire creative professionals to do: “All free, instant, and nearly perfect. Images, videos, campaign ideas? No problem.” Or, as another AI startup founder put it: “So much of the world is creatively constipated, and we’re going to make it so that they can poop rainbows.” But it is a problem for actual artists, and for anybody who cares and thinks deeply about the words, images, and sounds we consume every day. With any promise of disruption comes the reasonable fear that its replacement will be worse, both for the creative professionals who rely on artmaking for their livelihoods and for people who enjoy reading well-written works, who take pleasure in thoughtful visual art, who watch movies not solely to be entertained but because of the surprising, life-affirming, or otherwise meaningful directions a good film might go. Should we take seriously the artistic vision of someone who considers “pooping rainbows” the pinnacle of creativity?The wrinkle in AI executives’ plot to supplant human creativity is that so far, consumer AI tools are not very good at making art. Generative AI creates content based on recognizing patterns within the data it was trained on, using statistics to determine what the prompter is hoping to get out of it. But if art is more meaningful beyond the images or words that comprise it or the money that it makes, what good is an amalgam of its metadata, divorced from the original context?A DALL-E image generated by the prompt “Show me what art is, in one image.” DALL-EText generators like ChatGPT, image creators like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Lensa, and DALL-E, the song-making tool Suno, and text-to-video generators like Runway and Sora, can produce content that looks like human-made writing, music, or visuals by virtue of having been trained on a great many human-made works. Yet any further examination reveals them to be mostly hollow, boring, and disposable. As one former journalist who now works at Meta remarked, “There hasn’t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me … it all just glides right past and disappears.” What happens when and if the AI tools of the future can someday produce novels that people actually want to read, songs that listeners can’t stop blasting, or films that audiences will pay movie theater prices to see? Or, perhaps the better question is: Is that even possible if the owners of these technologies fundamentally misunderstand why people make and enjoy art?Why AI art looks cheapVisual artists have used machine learning for decades, but they’ve often done so in ways that reflect the artist’s process and ideas rather than the machine’s. Anna Ridler is a conceptual artist who uses a type of machine learning called a generative adversarial network, or GAN, that can be trained solely on the images she feeds it. That isn’t what the current generation of simple text-to-image generators — which are trained on hundreds of millions of images scraped from all over the internet — like Midjourney and DALL-E do. “Conceptually, it’s hard to do interesting things with [them], because [they’re] hidden behind APIs. It’s a black box,” she says of the proprietary (as opposed to open-source) software these companies use that discourages true experimentation. Instead, the work these generators churn out look uncanny, smooth, and generally off in ways that are both obvious and not: Generative AI’s reliance on data make it famously unable to accurately depict human hands, and as psychologist and AI commentator Gary Marcus noted, it also struggles with statistically improbable prompts like “a horse riding an astronaut,” which still seem exclusively the province of human imagination (even the latest AI models will invariably give you a picture of an astronaut riding a horse). “There’s this weird slickness to the images that will become a temporal marker that ‘this was a mid-2020s image,’” Ridler says. “The more you play with these things, the more you realize how hard it is to actually get something interesting and original out of them.”What AI is good at doing, however, is flooding the internet with mediocre, instantaneous art. “You know what I realized about AI images in your marketing? It sends out the message that you’ve got no budget. It’s the digital equivalent of wearing an obviously fake Chanel bag. Your whole brand immediately appears feeble and impoverished,” wrote artist Del Walker on X.It’s the same story with text generators. Last year Neil Clarke, the founder of the sci-fi and fantasy literary magazine Clarkesworld, shut down submissions after ChatGPT-generated works accounted for nearly half of what was submitted. “When this hit us last year, I told people they’re worse than any human author we’ve ever seen. And after one update, they’re equal to the worst authors we’ve seen,” he says. “Being a statistical model, it’s predicting the next most likely word, so it doesn’t really understand what it’s writing. And understanding is somewhat essential to telling a good story.” Great works of storytelling tend to work not just on one level but on multiple — they contain subtext and meaning that a statistical model likely couldn’t grasp with data alone. Instead, Clarke says, the AI-generated stories were flat and unsophisticated, even if they were grammatically perfect.“Right now, you could have GPT-4 generate something that looks like a full screenplay: It’d be 120 pages, it would have characters, they would have consistent names throughout and the dialogue would resemble things you might find in a movie,” says John August, a screenwriter on the WGA bargaining committee, which gained huge protections against AI last September. “Would it really make sense? I don’t know. It might be better than the worst screenplay you’ve ever read, but that’s a very low bar to cross. I think we’re quite a ways away from being a thing you’re going to want to read or watch.”AI is already being used in film in a few ways, sometimes to make it appear as though actors’ mouths match up with dubbed foreign languages, for example, or in creating backdrops and background characters. More controversially, AI has also been used in documentary projects: 2021’s Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain used AI to make a fake Bourdain speak three lines, a similar tactic was used in 2022’s The Andy Warhol Diaries. In April, the leaders of the Archival Producers Alliance drafted a proposed list of best practices for AI in journalistic film, including allowing for the use of AI to touch up or restore images, but warning that using generative AI to create new material should be done with careful consideration. This future is far — although nobody can agree on how long — from the one that AI boosters have preached is just around the corner, one of endless hyper-personalized entertainment with the click of a button. “Imagine being able to request an AI to generate a movie with specific actors, plot, and location, all customized to your personal preferences. Such a scenario would allow individuals to create their own movies from scratch for personal viewing, completely eliminating the need for actors and the entire industry around filming,” teased one AI industry group. Marvel filmmaker Joe Russo echoed this vision in an interview, positing, “You could walk into your house and save the AI on your streaming platform. ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s photoreal avatar. I want it to be a romcom because I’ve had a rough day,’ and it renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice, and suddenly now you have a romcom starring you that’s 90 minutes long.” It’s certainly possible that the next generation of AI tools makes such a leap that this fantasy could conceivably become a reality. Still, it inevitably begs the question of whether a “very competent” hyper-personalized romcom is what most people want, or will ever want, from the art they consume. That doesn’t mean AI won’t transform the creative industriesHowever dystopian this might sound (not least because, as any woman on the internet is well aware, this technology is being used to make nonconsensual sexual images and videos), we actually already have a decent corollary for it. Just as AI is meant to “democratize” artmaking, the creator industry, which was built on the back of social media, was designed to do the same thing: circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of media by “empowering” individuals to produce their own content and in return, offering them a place where their work might actually get seen. There are clear pros and cons here. While AI is useful in giving emerging creators new tools to make, say, visual and sound effects they might not otherwise have the money or skill to produce, it is equally or perhaps more useful for fraud, in the form of unthinkably enormous amounts of phone scams, deepfakes, and phishing attacks. Ryan Broderick, who often discusses the cultural impact of AI on his newsletter Garbage Day, points out another comparison between social media and generative AI. “My fear is that we’re hurtling really quickly towards a world where rich people can read the words written by humans and people who can’t afford it read words written by machines,” he tells me. Broderick likens it to what’s already happening on the internet in many parts of the world, where the wealthy can afford subscriptions to newspapers and magazines written by professionals while the working classes consume news on social media, where lowest-common-denominator content is often what gets the most attention. Crucially, social media may have disrupted media gatekeepers and given more people to platforms to showcase their art, but it didn’t expand the number of creatives able to make a living doing those things — in many ways it did the opposite. The real winners were and continue to be the owners of these platforms, just as the real winners of AI will be the founders who pitch their products to C-suite executives as replacements for human workers. Anna Ridler’s “Myriad (Tulips),” an installation of thousands of photographs of tulips, which Ridler used as the dataset for later projects. “By choosing to make the dataset an artwork it draws attention to the skill, labour and time that goes into constructing it, whilst also helping to expose the human element in machine learning, usually hidden by algorithmic processes,” she writes. Anna RidlerBecause even if AI can’t create good art without a talented human being telling it what to do, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t pose an existential threat to the people working in creative industries. For the last few years, artists have watched in horror as their work has been stolen and used to train AI models, feeling as though they’re being replaced in real time. “It starts to make you wonder, do I even have any talent if a computer can just mimic me?” said a fiction writer who used the writing AI tool Sudowrite. Young people are reconsidering whether or not to enter artistic fields at all. In an FTC roundtable on generative AI’s impact on creative industries last October, illustrator Steven Zapata said, “The negative market implications of a potential client encountering a freely downloadable AI copycat of us when searching our names online could be devastating to individual careers and our industry as a whole.”Cory Doctorow, known for both his science fiction and tech criticism, argues that, in any discussion of AI art, the crucial question should be: “How do we minimize the likelihood that an artist somewhere gets $1 less because some tech bro somewhere gets $1 more?” How to think about the artistic “threat” of AIEven as we should take seriously the labor implications of AI — not to mention the considerable ethical and environmental effects — Doctorow argues that it’s essential to stop overhyping its capabilities. “In the same way that pretending ‘Facebook advertising is so good that it can brainwash you into QAnon’ is a good way to help Facebook sell ads, the same thing happens when AI salespeople say, ‘I don’t know if you’ve heard my critics, but it turns out I have the most powerful tool ever made, and it’s going to end the planet. Wouldn’t you like me to sell you some of it?’”This is how AI salespeople view art: as commodities to be bought and sold, not as something to do or enjoy. In a 2010 essay on The Social Network, Zadie Smith made the case that the experience of using Facebook was in fact the experience of existing inside Mark Zuckerberg’s mind. Everything was made just so because it suited him: “Blue, because it turns out Zuckerberg is red-green color-blind … Poking, because that’s what shy boys do to girls they are scared to talk to. Preoccupied with personal trivia, because Mark Zuckerberg thinks the exchange of personal trivia is what ‘friendship’ is,” she writes. A DALL-E image generated by the prompt “a portrait of an artist using AI to make beautiful art.” DALL-EWhy should millions (now billions) of people choose to live their lives in this format over any others? Just as we should ask whether using a tool created by a college sophomore preoccupied with control and stoicism is perhaps the best way to connect with our friends, we should also be asking why we should trust AI executives and their supporters to decide anything related to creativity. One of the more asinine things published last year was Marc Andreesen’s “Techno-Optimist Manifesto,” in which the billionaire venture capitalist whined about the supposed lack of cultural power he and people exactly like him wield in comparison to “ivory tower, know-it-all credentialed expert[s].” These ideological enemies, it is relatively safe to infer, are the sorts of people — ethicists, academics, union leaders — who might concern themselves with the well-being of normal people under his particular view of “progress”: free markets, zero regulation, unlimited investment in technological advancement regardless of what these technologies are actually being used to do. A slightly funny element of the “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” is how clearly its author’s interest in art fails to extend beyond an average ninth-grader’s familiarity with literature (references include the “hero’s journey,” Orwell, and Harry Potter); in a list of “patron saints of techno-optimism,” Andreesen names a few dozen people, mostly free-market economists, and a single visual artist: Warhol. On X, a platform run by a different out-of-touch tech billionaire, AI boosters cheer on a world finally rid of human creators, even human beings at all. “This is it. The days of OnlyFans is over,” posted one tech commentator over a video of AI-animated people dancing. “Seems sorta obvious AI will replace the online simp/thot model,” said another. “Cash in on OnlyFans while you can I guess.”In the same way that people who believe human influencers will be replaced by AI simulacra fail to understand what is compelling about influencers, those who believe AI will somehow “replace Hollywood” or the music and publishing industries betray a lack of curiosity about why we consume art in the first place. Try asking Google’s new AI Overview feature why people love art, for instance, and it will tell you that “watching art can release dopamine.” People love great art not for the chemicals it releases but because it challenges us, comforts us, confuses us, probes us, attacks us, excites us, inspires us. Because great art is a miracle, because to witness it is to feel the presence of something like God and the human condition, and to remind us that they are perhaps the same thing. It’s no coincidence that AI has widely been compared to a cult; there is almost a religious zeal to its adherents’ beliefs that one day AI will become omnipotent. But if you look at art and all you see is content, or if you look at a picture of a hot girl and all you see are JPGs in the shape of a sexual object, that’s all you’ll get out of it. People love great art not for the chemicals it releases but because it challenges us, comforts us, confuses us, probes us, attacks us, excites us, inspires us.Doctorow is willing to stipulate that works created by AI generators might one day be considered an art form, in the same way that sampling went from being looked down upon but is now a common and celebrated practice in music. Media theorist Ignas Kalpokas has written that AI art “has a revelatory quality, making visible the layers of the collective unconscious of today’s societies — that is, data patterns — in a way that is in line with the psychoanalytic capacities that [Walter] Benjamin saw in photography and film.” But the more content AI creates, he argues, the more likely that audiences will experience it “in a state of distraction.”The future of art and entertainment could very well be individuals asking their personal AIs to feed them music, movies, or books created with a single prompt and the press of a button, although the point at which this sort of entertainment will be good enough to hold our attention feels much farther out of reach. If there is a day where this becomes the norm, the creative industries would, as they have for more than a century, adapt. “The history of the professional creative industry is competition — TV competing with film competing with radio,” explains Lev Manovich, an AI artist and digital culture theorist. “Maybe [the industry] becomes more about live events, maybe human performance will become even more valuable. If machines can create Hollywood-level media, the industry will have to offer something else. Maybe some people will lose jobs, but then new jobs will be created.”I wondered what, if anything, could entice someone like Clarke, the editor of the science fiction literary magazine, to actually publish AI-generated fiction right now, with the technology as it exists. His answer articulated every qualm that I and many in the creative industries take with the notion that AI can do the same work as an artist. “I am willing to accept an AI story when an AI decides to write a story of its own free will and picks me as the place that it wants to send it to. It’d be no different if an alien showed up on the planet: I wouldn’t say no. At that point, it’s a new life,” he said. “But that’s a science fiction scenario. It’d be kind of neat if I get to see it during my lifetime, but I’m not gonna hold my breath.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Lightroom has always been a powerful tool, but it’s had its limitations. One major challenge has been removing distractions from photos without switching to Photoshop. Adobe's recent update introduces a game-changing feature: the generative AI erase tool. This tool simplifies the process, allowing you to handle more within Lightroom itself.




Coming to you from Matt Kloskowski, this insightful video explains the new generative AI erase tool in Lightroom. This feature is available in Lightroom Classic, Lightroom, and Adobe Camera Raw. It addresses the need for better distraction removal, a task that previously required Photoshop. The update, found in Lightroom Classic version 13.3 and Lightroom version 7.3, leverages AI to remove unwanted elements from your photos efficiently.
Kloskowski shows how the tool works within the familiar healing and clone stamp interface. The AI-based eraser detects objects and offers multiple variations for you to choose from. This flexibility allows for better results, reducing the need to jump between Lightroom and Photoshop. The process is straightforward: paint over the unwanted object, let the AI do its work, and cycle through the generated variations until you find the best fit. If the results aren't perfect, you can refresh and get new options.
One of the key benefits of this tool is its ability to handle larger objects and complex backgrounds. Kloskowski demonstrates its effectiveness with several examples, including removing bright spots and distracting elements that previously required Photoshop. Although the tool isn't flawless and might need some tweaking with cloning or healing tools afterward, it significantly improves the workflow.
Kloskowski also mentions a related feature in Photoshop that allows you to type in prompts for generative AI. This capability, though not yet available in Lightroom, hints at future developments that could further integrate AI into photo editing. For now, the new tool in Lightroom is a significant step forward, making distraction removal faster and more intuitive. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Kloskowski.

",https://schema.org,,,," Tristan Greene  May 24, 2024  Elon says AI will ‘do everything better than you,’ make employment obsolete  Despite having fathered at least 10 children, Musk also seems to think humans will struggle to find meaning in their lives without employment.  4099  Total views  10  Total shares  Listen to article  2:14  News  Own this piece of crypto history  Collect this article as NFT  Join us on social networks Elon Musk recently doubled down on his predictions that humans would need a “universal high income” in the wake of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven job displacement. — this time claiming that without our jobs, our purpose in life may eventually be to “give AI meaning.”The bleak prognostication from the world’s richest person came during the VivaTech 2024 event in Paris as part of a winding speech wherein Musk made fervent claims that AI would provide all of our goods and services in the future. “My biggest fear is AI,” the mogul said. He also claimed that AI will be better than humans at everything, thus relegating our species to doing our best to support the machines:“The question will really be one of meaning — if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning? I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this, in that we may give AI meaning.”Musk, the father of at least 10 children, said humans might be able to work “as a hobby,” if they chose, but ultimately painted a bleak picture of the future where, according to his previous predictions, AI will supplant us in all endeavors.In related news, Musk’s AI company, dubbed simply xAI, has reportedly secured $6 billion in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tribe Capital at a total valuation of $18 billion. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Musk says that xAI lags behind industry leaders OpenAI and DeepMind but could catch up by the end of 2024:“xAI is a new company so it still has a lot of catching up to do before it has an AI that is competitive with Google Deepmind and OpenAI. Maybe towards the end of the year, we will have that.”This sentiment, combined with his prediction that AI will surpass humans by 2025, indicates that he believes his company will be among those that could potentially create AI capable of human-level cognition.It bears mentioning that Musk’s AI-related predictions haven’t always fared so well. In 2019, he famously promised that Tesla would field 1 million fully autonomous robotaxis on the road by 2020. More recently, he claimed that Tesla would unveil its first robotaxi in August 2024.

Wall Street is investing big in artificial intelligence — and that's good news for machine-learning engineers and other tech talent.Consider JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank by assets. In a recent letter to investors, CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon compared the potential disruption of generative AI to that of electricity, the printing press, the steam engine, the computer, and the internet.

Dimon said the firm is getting ready for the AI revolution with its more than 2,000 machine-learning experts. These workers are tackling a range of AI use cases, such as marketing, fraud, and risk — and looking into how the technology can be used for customer service, operations, and software engineering, he said.""In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows,"" Dimon said, adding that it could potentially reduce some jobs in the company while also creating new ones. Dimon said he expects the technology to eventually ""augment virtually every job"" at the financial powerhouse.

JPMorgan is far from the only bank investing heavily in this technological future by hiring reams of artificial-intelligence experts, including machine-learning engineers and data scientists.Citi's top tech exec recently outlined, in an interview with BI, how the bank's AI roadmap will impact everyone from engineering to operations and wealth. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, has been on an AI hiring tear as the German bank looks to grow its AI employee base to at least 600, Gil Perez, Deutsche's chief innovation officer, previously told BI. AI is also widely expected to eventually take over many of the tedious tasks now ascribed to junior investment bankers, like editing pitch decks and putting logos on PowerPoints, which stands to make the notoriously competitive field even harder to break into.The race to harness AI across corporate America has put a premium on talent with relevant AI skills, which means banks will have to shell out more money to compete for the best talent. Some PE firms are offering pay packages up to $2 million for AI execs to implement the tech at portfolio companies, as Business Insider has previously reported. Top AI product managers, for instance, can snag about $100,000 more than standard engineering managers, recruiters told BI.""We're talking about cream-of-the-crop talent that is seeing a bit of upside to the AI boom,"" said Giancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at recruitment firm Glocomms, referring to the ""inflated range"" for compensation. Hirsch said that investment banks are hiring AI engineers to build in-house tools that they can use ""across their trading, research, and risk-management functions.""

To put Wall Street pay for AI talent in perspective, BI pulled data from the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2023 disclosure data for H1-B and similar visa holders for large investment banks, some of which also have consumer banking divisions, commercial lending divisions, and asset management divisions. The 8 banks reviewed are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS, Citibank, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.We pulled data for roles containing keywords like ""AI,"" ""data science,"" ""machine learning,"" and ""prompt."" We also included any roles tagged with the Department of Labor classification (known as a SOC code) for data scientists. While not every data scientist works directly on artificial intelligence, their work of ensuring integrity across the vast amounts of data these firms collect is an integral part of rolling out advanced machine-learning applications.This data shows the salaries that Wall Street banks expected to pay foreign data scientists and AI workers in 2023, and its disclosure is part of their visa terms. This data does not include signing or performance bonuses or stock-based compensation, but it is the best publicly available data on base pay at these firms, which are known for doling out big bonuses.All of the banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.

Bank of America has been building AI-powered virtual assistants for years, both its Erica assistant for retail banking customers and its back-end product known as Banker Assist. Banker Assist connects disparate sources of data into one centralized location, cutting out hours of research work.The bank is also a leader in AI patents, with Bank of America and Capital One responsible for 2/3rds of all AI patents filed between June 2021 and 2022, according to Evident AI.It sought to fill 11 data-science roles through the visa programs in 2023, with vice president/data scientist I making up five of the roles or nearly half. BI was unable to find open job postings that match the roles below.Assistant Vice President, Data Scientist I: $118,473- $139,464Officer, Data Scientist I: $120,000Senior Vice President, Senior Data Scientist: $194,000Vice President; Data Scientist I: $134,914-$165,000Vice President; Data Scientist II: $155,000

At the start of this year, Barclays and IBM released a report finding that AI will quickly impact worker productivity worldwide compared with technologies like the steam engine, electrification, and personal computers, which took decades to ramp up fully.Barclays Chief Information Officer, Craig Bright, noted that generative AI will increase the firm's fraud-detection capabilities and act as a personal assistant to customer service workers with difficult or specific questions.The company sought to hire 28 data-science and AI workers via the visa program in 2023. The highest-paid worker is a New York-based vice president of data science who was offered $198,000. BI was unable to find comparable salaries for open roles online.Associate Vice President, Systems Analyst, Data Science Projects: $139,000Associate, Data Science Research: $156,500AVP Data Analyst: $140,000AVP Data Product Owner: $140,000AVP Internal Audit Data Management: $150,000AVP US Risk: $140,000Data Analyst: $155,000Data Engineer: $110,000-$120,000Data Metrics Analyst Lead: $125,000Data Scientist: $145,000Enterprise Data Platform Engineer: $120,000IAM DataServices Lead: $155,000Internal Audit Data Analytics AVP: $110,000SAS Senior Analyst: $125,000Securitized Products Modeling Analyst, AVP: $150,000Senior Data Analyst and Programmer: $148,000Senior SAS Analyst: $115,232-$130,000Vice President, Data Science: $170,000-$198,000Vice President, Managing Data Scientist: $109,762-$185,000

Citi's co-chief information officer, Shadman Zafar recently told BI that small and ""boring"" changes brought by AI will create the biggest change. Instead of focusing on one massive project, the firm will use AI in small ways that add up. The firm already has 30,000 software engineers using AI to become more efficient by creating new code and more thoroughly documenting existing code.It also plans to use AI extensively in operational roles, decreasing the rote tasks that these workers need to do. On the customer-facing side, AI will help bankers and advisors complete mechanical tasks and create reports, giving them more time with clients. Eventually, Zafar said the bank will want to use AI to create financial products more quickly when customers want them.Citi had the second-largest request for AI visas, with 52 data science and AI engineers. The company sought 11 data-science lead analysts via visas, the most in the database. The most highly paid role was for a business analytics principal at $200,600. A review of current job postings shows the firm offering similar salaries for similar roles, including an open data science lead analyst role for $163,238.Check out what the bank is paying for different AI roles below.Data Science Group Manager: $175,000Data Science Lead Analyst: $116,000-$167,814Data Science Senior Analyst: $108,645-$141,800Data Science Senior Manager: $142,000-$154,000Business Analytics Group Manager: $192,400-$195,244Business Analytics Principal: $200,600Business Analytics Senior Analyst: $115,000-$120,000Business Risk Officer: $140,000Data Analytics Lead Analyst: $155,000Data Analytics Senior Analyst: $139,000Data Governance Senior Lead Analyst: $178,000Data/Information Management Analyst: $140,000Digital PM Lead Analyst: $175,000Legal Support Senior Group Manager: $155,000Model/Analysis/Validation Officer: $145,000Model/Analysis/Validation Senior Analyst: $98,000-$132,925Operational Risk Officer: $120,175Operational Risk Senior Analyst: $110,000Risk Policy Officer: $163,238Specialized Analytics Lead Analyst: $162,000Specialized Analytics Senior Analyst: $153,525-$163,238

Deutsche Bank has spent the past 18 months aggressively experimenting with AI, the bank's chief innovation officer told BI in September. At the time, the bank had about 300 technologists working on AI projects, a number that Deutsche's chief innovation officer, Gil Perez, predicts will double or triple by the end of this year.Much of Deutsche Bank's early AI work was aimed at automating manual processes in the corporate bank, which serves its institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors. One example was an AI tool that generated client briefings for bankers ahead of client meetings. What used to take a team of junior bankers a day or two to produce can now be created with the touch of a few keystrokes.BI only found three roles with generic investment-banking titles, though they were tagged as data scientists. The firm sought to hire two of each of the roles below for a total of 6 AI hires. It's worth noting that the pay for two vice presidents is higher than the salaries listed on the firm's website for similar roles, which list a pay range of $125,000 to $203,000.Analyst: $95,000-$100,000Associate: $105,000-$120,000Vice President: $250,000

Goldman Sachs' tech chief previously told BI he believes we're at an inflection point with AI, and that the technology's impact is already rippling through the bank. Some of the bank's early use cases include getting non-tech workers to do more with code and automating the annoying task of documenting what code does for engineers.AI is not just changing how Goldman tech employees work, it's also redefining what it takes to be a software engineer. Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer, said it's more important than ever to understand the problem that needs solving and why before coding begins. Taking courses in philosophy and English will help future generations of engineers stand out in the age of AI.Goldman sought to hire 19 data-science workers through the visa program in 2023. The highest paid offer was for a New York-based vice president with a $220,000 salary, while the lowest was for a Utah-based analyst at $57,700. The firm is currently hiring for a New York-based internal audit-embedded data analytics associate-level data role with a salary range of $85,000 to $140,000, roughly comparable to the salary ranges offered for associate-level roles last year.Check out salaries for different roles below. While they carry investment-banking titles like analyst and vice president, their visa paperwork comes with data-science codes.Analyst: $57,700-$100,000Associate: $88,000-$126,000Vice President: $156,000-$220,000

JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the country, is making a play to be the industry's AI leader. The bank had, by far, the most visa worker hires in our study, 237, with Citibank at a distant second with 52 hires. A report by Evident AI ranked the bank at the top of its AI Innovation list for banks, noting that it produced 45% of all AI research produced by banks in 2023. AI research at JPMorgan is led by Manuela Veloso, who leads a team of academics who look at the potential of AI across seven main areas, from data management to employee empowerment.The practical application of AI at JPM is spearheaded by the bank's recently formed Data and Analytics organization. JPMorgan's firmwide chief data and analytics officer, Teresa Heitsenrether, leads that team, which consists of AI, machine learning, and data executives from across the bank. The firm's prodigious hiring of data science and AI roles last year included applications of 37 data science associates and 37 applied AI & machine learning associates. In total, the firm sought to hire 95 employees on a visa with AI in their title with a top salary of $275,000 for a data scientist/executive director position. The lowest salary was $90,000, which is more than $30,000 above the average US salary.Recent job listings show the firm is currently hiring for similar roles at similar salaries. An applied AI/ML lead position comes with a salary range of $147,250 to $260,000, compared to the $163,800 to $235,000 offered to the sixteen vice presidents of applied AI ML leads they sought in 2023.Check out what the bank is paying for different roles below.Associate, AI & Data Science: $125,000-$150,000Associate, AI Research: $140,000-$215,000Associate, Analytics Solutions: $115,000-$150,000Associate, Applied AI & Machine Learning: $124,000-$215,000Associate, Asset Associate II: $109,250Associate, Business Analyst: $90,000-$98,500Associate, CCB Risk Program AI/ML: $140,000Associate, Channel Marketing: $115,000Associate, Data Analyst: $130,000Associate, Data Analytics Analyst: $100,000Associate, Data Domain Architect: $117,500-$120,000Associate, Data Management: $102,000Associate, Data Scientist: $100,000-$180,000Associate, Data Visualization: $125,000Associate, Model Program Risk: $150,000Associate, Modeling Analytics: $120,000Associate, Quant Analytics: $100,000-$135,000Associate, Quant Modeling: $120,000Associate, Quantitative Research: $125,000-$131,000Associate, Software Engineer: $127,700-$145,000Associate, Strategic Analytics: $90,900-$120,000Business Analysis Associate II: $110,000Data Analytics Analyst: $100,000Data Scientist Analyst: $90,000-$102,274Data Scientist: $100,000Executive Director, Applied AI ML Director: $260,000Executive Director, Data Scientist: $260,000-$275,000Executive Director, Product Director: $260,000Executive Director, Quant Analytics: $235,000Quant Analytics Associate: $90,000Senior Associate, AI Research: $175,000-$185,000Senior Associate, Applied AI & Machine Learning: $134,000-$173,720Senior Associate, Data Owner Associate: $145,000Senior Associate, Data Scientist: $110,000-$160,000Senior Data Scientist: $166,000Senior Engineer, Applied AI ML: $170,100Senior Quant Analytics Associate: $107,000Vice President, AI Research Lead: $177,000-$193,800Vice President, Analytics Solutions and Delivery: $142,623Vice President, Applied AI ML Lead Predictive Science: $203,500Vice President, Applied AI ML Lead: $163,800-$235,000Vice President, Applied AI ML: $175,000-$260,000Vice President, Capital Risk Lead: $175,000Vice President, Data Domain Architect: $170,000Vice President, Data Domain Architect: $170,000-$190,000Vice President, Data Management Lead: $175,000Vice President, Data Scientist Lead: $120,000-$190,000Vice President, Data Scientist: $146,000-$190,000Vice President, Database Management Lead: $135,000Vice President, Fraud Risk: $145,000Vice President, Lead Software Engineer: $170,000Vice President, Modeling Analytics: $139,000Vice President, Predictive Science: $137,600Vice President, Product Development (AI/ML): $118,400Vice President, Product Specialist: $135,000Vice President, Project Execution: $155,000Vice President, Quant Analytics Manager: $116,000Vice President, Software Engineer: $214,000Vice President, Strategic Analytics: $135,000

At Morgan Stanley, Jeff McMillan is infusing AI into the daily routine of its 16,000 financial advisors. McMillan is Morgan Stanley's AI leader who assumed the helm in April— a promotion from his post as head of wealth-management tech.Advisors at Morgan Stanley now have access to ""AI@MS Assistant,"" a generative AI chatbot that knows the bank inside and out and can answer questions related to wealth management. The firm is also piloting another generative AI tool, AI@MS Debrief, which can summarize Zoom conversations with clients, generate emails with next steps for clients, and help advisors create newsletters. Looking ahead, McMillan said he plans to build similar AI tools for other bank divisions using the same underlying technology behind AI@MS Assistant.The company sought to hire 15 data science workers through the visa program in 2023, with the highest-paid role for a New York-based vice president at $210,000. BI was unable to find any directly comparable roles on Morgan Stanley's job boards.Check out the salaries below, which carry investment-banking titles but have been tagged as data science jobs.Assistant Vice President: $130,000-$150,000Associate: $112,000-$162,000Manager: $160,000Vice President: $164,000-$210,000

According to a note written by the bank earlier this year, UBS believes that the AI boom is just getting started and will buoy technology stocks for the rest of the decade.""AI could arguably be the tech theme of the decade, as we don't see similar growth profiles elsewhere,"" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in the note.Less has been reported on the bank's internal AI operations. During the company's annual general meeting in April, the first since UBS closed on its deal to acquire Credit Suisse, the only mention of AI came from the chairman of the Credit Suisse Staff Association, who noted that AI could be a challenge to creating sustainable jobs, and urged caution with current restructuring plans.UBS sought to hire 11 data-science workers via the visa program in 2023. The highest-paid role was for a data-science director at $190,000, though another request was issued for the same role at $170,000.

In a recent letter to investors, CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon compared the potential disruption of generative AI to that of electricity, the printing press, the steam engine, the computer, and the internet.Dimon said the firm is getting ready for the AI revolution with its more than 2,000 machine-learning experts. These workers are tackling a range of AI use cases, such as marketing, fraud, and risk — and looking into how the technology can be used for customer service, operations, and software engineering, he said.""In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows,"" Dimon said, adding that it could potentially reduce some jobs in the company while also creating new ones. Dimon said he expects the technology to eventually ""augment virtually every job"" at the financial powerhouse.JPMorgan is far from the only bank investing heavily in this technological future by hiring reams of artificial-intelligence experts, including machine-learning engineers and data scientists.Citi's top tech exec recently outlined, in an interview with BI, how the bank's AI roadmap will impact everyone from engineering to operations and wealth. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, has been on an AI hiring tear as the German bank looks to grow its AI employee base to at least 600, Gil Perez, Deutsche's chief innovation officer, previously told BI. AI is also widely expected to eventually take over many of the tedious tasks now ascribed to junior investment bankers, like editing pitch decks and putting logos on PowerPoints, which stands to make the notoriously competitive field even harder to break into.The race to harness AI across corporate America has put a premium on talent with relevant AI skills, which means banks will have to shell out more money to compete for the best talent. Some PE firms are offering pay packages up to $2 million for AI execs to implement the tech at portfolio companies, as Business Insider has previously reported. Top AI product managers, for instance, can snag about $100,000 more than standard engineering managers, recruiters told BI.""We're talking about cream-of-the-crop talent that is seeing a bit of upside to the AI boom,"" said Giancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at recruitment firm Glocomms, referring to the ""inflated range"" for compensation. Hirsch said that investment banks are hiring AI engineers to build in-house tools that they can use ""across their trading, research, and risk-management functions.""To put Wall Street pay for AI talent in perspective, BI pulled data from the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2023 disclosure data for H1-B and similar visa holders for large investment banks, some of which also have consumer banking divisions, commercial lending divisions, and asset management divisions. The 8 banks reviewed are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS, Citibank, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.We pulled data for roles containing keywords like ""AI,"" ""data science,"" ""machine learning,"" and ""prompt."" We also included any roles tagged with the Department of Labor classification (known as a SOC code) for data scientists. While not every data scientist works directly on artificial intelligence, their work of ensuring integrity across the vast amounts of data these firms collect is an integral part of rolling out advanced machine-learning applications.This data shows the salaries that Wall Street banks expected to pay foreign data scientists and AI workers in 2023, and its disclosure is part of their visa terms. This data does not include signing or performance bonuses or stock-based compensation, but it is the best publicly available data on base pay at these firms, which are known for doling out big bonuses.All of the banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.Check out data-science and AI salaries for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Bank of America, and other investment banks:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kaja Whitehouse'}"

AI pioneer Yann LeCun kicked off an animated discussion today after telling the next generation of developers not to work on large language models (LLMs). 
“This is in the hands of large companies, there’s nothing you can bring to the table,” Lecun said at VivaTech today in Paris. “You should work on next-gen AI systems that lift the limitations of LLMs.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise






The comments from Meta’s chief AI scientist and NYU professor quickly kicked off a flurry of questions and sparked a conversation on the limitations of today’s LLMs. 
When met with question marks and head-scratching, LeCun (sort of) elaborated on X (formerly Twitter): “I’m working on the next generation AI systems myself, not on LLMs. So technically, I’m telling you ‘compete with me,’ or rather, ‘work on the same thing as me, because that’s the way to go, and the [m]ore the merrier!’”

With no more specific examples offered, many X users questioned what “next-gen AI” means and what might be an alternative to LLMs. 

Developers, data scientists and AI experts offered up a multitude of options on X threads and sub-threads: boundary-driven or discriminative AI, multi-tasking and multi-modality, categorical deep learning, energy-based models, more purposive small language models, niche use cases, custom fine-tuning and training, state-space models and hardware for embodied AI. Some also suggested exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a new breakthrough in neural networking. 

One user bullet-pointed five next-gen AI systems:

Multimodal AI.
Reasoning and general intelligence.
Embodied AI and robotics.
Unsupervised and self-supervised learning.
Artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Another said that “any student should start with the basics,” including: 

Statistics and probability.
Data wrangling, cleaning and transformation.
Classical pattern recognition such as naive Bayes, decision trees, random forest and bagging.
Artificial neural networks. 
Convolutional neural networks.
Recurrent neural networks.
Generative AI.
advertisement

Dissenters, on the other hand, pointed out that now is a perfect time for students and others to work on LLMs because the applications are still “barely tapped.” For instance, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to prompting, jailbreaking and accessibility. 

Others, naturally, pointed to Meta’s own prolific LLM building and suggested that LeCun was subversively trying to stifle competition. 
“When the head of AI at a big company says ‘don’t try and compete, there’s nothing you can bring to the table,’ it makes me want to compete,’” another user drolly commented. 

LLMs will never reach human-level intelligence
A champion of objective-driven AI and open-source systems, Lecun also told the Financial Times this week that LLMs have a limited grasp on logic and will not reach human-level intelligence. 
They “do not understand the physical world, do not have persistent memory, cannot reason in any reasonable definition of the term and cannot plan . . . hierarchically,” he said. 
Meta recently unveiled its Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), which can detect and understand highly detailed object interactions. The architecture is what the company calls the “next step toward Yann LeCun’s vision of advanced machine intelligence (AMI).” 
Many share LeCun’s feelings about LLMs’ setbacks. The X account for AI chat app Faune called LeCun’s comments today an “awesome take,” as closed-loop systems have “massive limitations” when it comes to flexibility. “Whoever creates an AI with a prefrontal cortex and an ability to create information absorption through open-ended self-training will probably win a Nobel prize,” they asserted. 

Others described the industry’s “overt fixation” on LMMs and called them “a dead end in achieving true progress.” Still more noted that LLMs are nothing more than a “connective tissue that groups systems together” quickly and efficiently like telephone switch operators, before passing off to the right AI.


Calling out old rivalries
LeCun has never been one to shrink away from debate, of course. Many may remember the extensive, heated back and forths between him and fellow AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton, Andrew Ng and Yoshia Bengio over AI’s existential risks (LeCun is in the “it’s overblown” camp). 
At least one industry watcher called back to this drastic clash of opinions, pointing to a recent Geoffrey Hinton interview in which the British computer scientist advised going all-in on LLMs. Hinton has also argued that the AI brain is very close to the human brain. 
“It’s interesting to see the fundamental disagreement here,” the user commented. 
One that’s not likely to reconcile anytime soon.
