With the rise of artificial intelligence we ask: 'can AI be creative?' There is a new wave of artists using AI as part of their artistic process and truly opening up both debates.
In June 2018, I commissioned the fabulous Luba Elliott to curate an exhibition for CogX called 'Machine Dreams.' The show looked at the state of art in the age of AI and as Luba describes it, brought together “a range of aesthetic experiments, critical reflections and future predictions.”

The exhibition artists included Libby Heaney, Mario Klingemann, Gene Kogan, Sarah Meyohas, Sascha Pohflepp, Fabrizio Poltronieri, Anna Ridler, Mike Tyka and Pinar Yoldas. It’s clear from these artists that there are many ways AI can be incorporated into the artistic process. Luba described how AI can be used to “generate images, text and sounds based on chosen data”. It can also be used to “suggest plot lines and concepts for further development or creating interactive work that responds to an individual’s movements”. The possibilities are endless - so I asked a handful of the artists who exhibited to elaborate on their work - in the hope it will inspire you to see AI in another light.

Tabitha Goldstaub: How are you using AI to augment your art practice?
Anna Ridler (artist, researcher, DARE Art Prize winner - London): When I work with technology, I’m never interested in making work about technology for its own sake, but rather how I can use technology as a tool to talk about other things - memory, love, decay - or to augment or change the story in a way in that otherwise would not happen. 

I’m really interested in how producing an image using machine learning, as opposed to any other method, creates different experiences, expectations, histories, traces and contexts for the viewer to consider. I’m interested in the form these associations may take and how they might be registered. For me, quite a lot of this is to do with the training set, or the information that is given to the algorithm to learn.
Libby Heaney (artist, quantum physicist and lecturer at the Royal College of Art - London): My most recent work, a Sky Art Arts 50 commission called Britbot, is an online voice or text activated chatbot that asks open-ended questions about ‘Britishness’ and through its conversations develops its own ideas of what constitutes Britishness. The bot’s initial training has been based on the UK government’s citizenship test and the corresponding text-book “Life in the United Kingdom 2017” which is largely a white male privileged version of British history and culture.

I use AI to explore how chatbots can reimagine and reinterpret existing stories, like the story of British history and culture in the citizenship test, revealing new insights and knowledge about the world and our place in it. In these unsettling times, how can human interactions with chatbots create a dada-esque poetry gleaned from the rules of algorithmic systems and fragmented data?

Goldstaub: The act of training AI systems to create artwork raises fascinating questions about the nature of creativity. Can machines ever truly be creative? 
Mario Klingemann (artist, neurographer, coder, data collector - Munich): That depends on how you define creativity. If commodified creativity like applying Instagram filters, the curation of Pinterest boards or drawing in adult painting books are the bar, then machines can already accomplish that. But if you set the bar higher and define creativity as the creation of something original, that is at the same time relevant to a human audience, then we still have a long way to go. Ultimately, I believe that machines will be able to accomplish that, but just as it is with the definition what ""intelligent"" means this will remain a moving target and once machines reach a certain milestone, like generate a song, make a movie or write a book we will probably find some explanation why that act was not ""truly"" creative.
Mike Tyka (visual artist, sculptor, Google researcher - Seattle): As a computationalist, I'd say, yes, of course. But the machines that we can currently build? No, not strongly. However, eventually, I see no reason they couldn't, after all we're also just machines. But I think it all depends on your definition of what exactly you mean by creativity. The recent AlphaGo matches against Lee Sedol featured a number of moves by AlphaGo which were missed by the human players and later lead to wins by the machines. The moves were subsequently studied and described as ""beautiful"" by expert human players. That sounds like the machine had created something novel, surprising and of value; to me that’s creativity.

Goldstaub: Large tech firms remain at the forefront of AI. What part can big companies play in the world of art, as it bleeds into the world of emerging technology?
Klingemann: The beauty of AI is that the technical entry barriers to get one's hands dirty with it, learn how to use it and make something with it are very low. That is not the least thanks to the open source movement and big companies that finance the research and then make the tools and knowledge available for free to everyone who is willing to learn.
Ridler: Large tech firms are at the forefront but actually it is relatively easy to get hold of cutting edge code on places like github or arxiv. What is harder is to get hold of the data or information that they use to train their AIs. Perhaps open-sourcing this would create new opportunities for artists.  
Goldstaub: The Old Masters’ use of camera obscura has drawn both criticism and praise. What other historical parallels are there between artists’ adoption of AI?
Klingemann: New directions in art are often the consequence of a new technology that suddenly allows everyone to do something that was previously limited to an exclusive circle or required a particular talent. So, the question is of course: will AI be such a technology that forces us to reconsider what makes us unique as humans? Will it give birth - either active or passive - to new art forms?








Anna Ridler: Fall of the House of Usher (2017)
Luba Elliott





Goldstaub: Should AI be seen as an opportunity, that enhances artistic capabilities, or a threat, that could supersede human artists?
Ridler: It is most definitely an opportunity! Using AI has allowed me to create work that is looser and wilder than I ever would have been able to make myself. It is my work but also not my work - recognisably me but nothing I would have been able to do by myself. Watching it is a very odd sensation, like catching a glimpse of yourself in a mirror before you realise it is you.
Tyka: It is an opportunity, a new tool, a new way to make art. Just like other new technologies before (like photography), I think it will become a field of its own instead of displacing existing forms of art. And it will get incorporated into other art fields, just like painters use photographs to practice and study. But of course, the emergence of new technologies can change existing fields - photography for example had a tremendous (and arguably positive) impact on painting, helping to spur non-representative forms of painting around the turn of the last century.
Heaney: I believe AI can certainly enhance artistic capabilities, but I doubt it will supersede human artists as humans are required to choose the algorithm, what to train the algorithm on, the parameters of a neural net and so on.
Of course the outcomes of working with AI in art might be surprising, but this was often the case with early (digital) computer artworks by, for instance, Manfred Mohr who has stated that he never knew what a machine would output. But this is different to a machine superseding human artists. In some sense we are still asking similar questions about machines and art to those being asked by artists in the 60s and 70s. Perhaps this will always happen when there is a sudden leap with what is possible with a new technology.Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website. Tabitha GoldstaubI’m the co-founder of CognitionX, an AI Advice Platform which connects organisations with a global network of AI experts.

The news that Christie’s would sell an artwork made by artificial intelligence this October captured worldwide headlines and imaginations alike. Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), an uncanny, algorithm-created rendering of an aristocratic gentleman, will hit the auction block in New York with an estimate of $7,000 to $10,000. But the piece’s inclusion in such a high-profile sale is creating controversy far ahead of the auction itself.
While images generated using AI technology have been circulating relatively widely since Google’s pattern-finding software DeepDream roared onto the scene in 2015, the field was still young, and the artworks produced via AI were neither aesthetically nor conceptually rich enough to hold the attention of the art world for long. But after the heavyweight auction house announced it was ready to sell this latest work, the mysterious portrait—and the even more mysterious algorithm behind it—were cast by many in the media as the new standard-bearers for the genre.
There is, however, a man behind the curtain—or rather, three men. The algorithm responsible for the portrait was developed by a French art collective called Obvious, which created its AI artist using a model called a GAN, short for “generative adversarial network.”
GANs entered the AI conversation in 2014 when researcher Ian Goodfellow published an article theorizing that they represented the next step in the evolution of neural networks: the interconnected layers of processing nodes, modeled loosely on the human brain, that have driven many recent developments in artificial intelligence. The concept of GANs captured people’s attention partly because, unlike the repetitious results produced by Google DeepDream—all of which were simply pre-existing images that appeared to be run through what our critic Ben Davis described as the same “psychedelic Instagram filter”—GANs could be trained to produce completely new, and dramatically different, images.

Courtesy of Christie’s Images Ltd.In order to get their algorithm to produce a legitimately classical-looking portrait, Obvious’s members say they fed it a training data set of more than 15,000 portraits created between the 14th and 20th centuries. Using these images, the algorithm was able to “generate” new images similar to the ones it had been fed. These new portraits were then presented to another algorithm (the “adversarial” part of the GAN acronym) that was trained to distinguish between images produced by humans versus those by machines—a Turing-like test for artworks—until the generated portraits could fool this discriminator into thinking they were “real,” too.
Since the announcement, many in the traditional art world have been losing their minds over this new movement, which Obvious has christened “GAN-ism.” But other artists making work via AI think the hype about what the technology can do on its own is premature. Mario Klingemann, a pioneer of AI art who has been working with GANs since their inception, says that while this model can create images that look new and seem to define the genre of AI-made art, they are actually just one tool in the neural art toolbox.
“Because they create instant gratification even if you have no deeper knowledge of how they work and how to control them, they currently attract charlatans and attention seekers who ride on that novelty wave,” Klingemann says.

Specifically, Klingemann doesn’t think that Obvious deserves its newfound legitimacy. “Pretty much everyone who is working seriously in this field is shaking their head in disbelief about the lack of judgment when it comes to featuring Obvious, and of course Christie’s decision to auction them out of all artists who work with neural networks,” he says.
“The work isn’t interesting, or original,” agrees Robbie Barrat, a young artist who works with AI. “They try to make it sound like they ‘invented’ or ‘wrote’ the algorithm that produced the works,” but says the collective actually uses a pre-existing implementation of the model to generate low-resolution outputs, which they then run through an online enhancer to get the final image. “People have been working with low resolution GANs like this since 2015,” says Barrat, adding that last year, when he was 17 years old, he did a project using the exact same type of neural network and an identical data set. “No one in the AI and art sphere really considers them to be artists—they’re more like marketers.”
Christie’s international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, justified the choice to showcase Obvious by pointing to the limited human intervention in their creative process, evinced by the fact that the collective chose to credit the artwork to the algorithm rather than themselves. “This particular work was chosen in part because of the process,” Lloyd says. “Obvious tried to limit the human intervention as much as possible, so that the resulting work reflects the ‘purist’ form of creativity expressed by the machine.”

History Lessons
To get a better understanding of how excited (or alarmed) we should be about AI-influenced art, we have to look beyond what artists have been doing with GANs and to the history of artificial intelligence itself.
At present, much of the debate about any use of AI, including art, is colored by a grand misconception of the technology. Decades of science fiction have conditioned the general public to associate any invocation of AI with what technologists and researchers would call “artificial general intelligence,” or a machine with the abilities to think freely, learn without specific training, and perhaps even experience emotions. It’s the AI of Hollywood classics like C-3PO in Star Wars (the benevolent version) and HAL-9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey (the malevolent version).
Researchers are actively working toward artificial general intelligence, and recent breakthroughs at behemoth tech companies like Google make its eventual achievement seem plausible, though probably not imminent. But these are not the types of AI being used by Obvious, Klingemann, or any other artist making use of a neural network, for the simple reason that they do not exist yet.

A closer look at GANs reveals the long, winding road between their current capabilities and the sentient robots that the phrase “artificial intelligence” conjures for the uninitiated. Karthik Kalyanaraman, an economist and the curator of the first major gallery show devoted to art made via AI, explains that after Goodfellow’s essay about GANs was published in 2014, raw and untrained GANs were made open source by different companies, including Google (TensorFlow), Facebook (Torch), and the Dutch NPO radio broadcaster (pix2pix).
The artistic part actually comes in when these algorithms are trained to produce specific images, which is a process executed by human beings. “Artists come at these algorithms that are raw, like blank slates that are like children ready to be trained, and then train them in a particular visual style,” Kalyanaraman says. It can take up to two months to train GANs to produce images in line with the desired concept.
A lot separates GAN-ism from world-changing AI artists unassisted by humans. The issue isn’t just that GANs can only learn about the specific labeled data they’re fed (“These images are all portraits”), or that the boundaries of the tasks they can perform are very narrow (“Now that you’ve seen all those portraits, make me a portrait”). It’s also that only one of the most advanced neural networks ever developed by a tech colossus has ever learned to perform more than one cognitive task. Outside of this techno-financial edge case, educating a GAN to do something new requires a complete erasure of its progress on the original task—a process known in the AI field by the vivid phrase “catastrophic forgetting.”
In practice, catastrophic forgetting means the same GAN that Obvious used to create Portrait of Edmond de Belamy cannot also be used to create a landscape painting, let alone go rogue and liquefy life on Earth. (Oxford AI theorist Nick Bostrum famously proposed this possibility as a legitimate danger of a super-AI programmed only to manufacture paper clips.) For now, the potential of the technology vastly outpaces the reality. Artist Theo Triantafyllidis, whose work will appear in the Athens Biennial this October, grounds the discussion in relatable terms: “Even state-of-the-art AI today is somewhere between a really clumsy child and a really smart pet.”

Adversarial Approaches to GAN-ism
In that light, what Obvious has done in training the raw algorithm on a data set of existing portraits might seem less original than was previously understood, as others could replicate the training process and achieve similar results.
Unsurprisingly, then, the subjects in Obvious’s work share many similar, surreal distortions with the subjects of early work by Barrat, Klingemann, and other artists using GANs. Klingemann even came up with a name for the phenomenon: the “Francis Bacon effect.”
This repetitiveness shows that humans still have an important role to play in shaping how an AI develops creatively. Although the tech was made publicly available shortly after the Goodfellow paper was published, Kalyanaraman says it took until early 2017 for artists to really begin to recognize the potential for aesthetic diversity and conceptual richness that AI art can provide. “I think it’s just a sign of the fact that this field is in its infancy,” Kalyanaraman says, explaining that in the past year and a half there have been new developments on the technical side of things, as well as more traditional artists getting involved in the field.
“They’ve started to think about this stuff beyond the ‘selling point’ of it being art produced by AI, but have also started to think about how conceptually rich can they make it,” Kalyanaraman says. He adds that the more artists start working with AI, the more obvious it will be when the work being produced is unoriginal.
Indeed, AI has captured the attention of artists both more engaged in the conceptual depths of the technology and more deeply embedded in the structures of the traditional art market. Take Trevor Paglen and his recent series, “Adversarially Evolved Hallucinations.” Rather than train a GAN on portraits to produce an approximation of a human-rendered portrait, he trained GANs on images labeled only with symbolic or metaphorical terms, then directed them to produce images of these subjects that evade the (seemingly) simple literalism of training images labeled “portrait” or “cat.”
For instance, one work in the series arose from a GAN fed a training set (or “corpus”) labeled only with the open-ended classification “interpretations of dreams,” with specific images including Freudian classics like hypodermic needles, windows, and puffy faces. When asked to produce its own contribution from what it had reviewed, the GAN created a work that Paglen titled False Teeth (Corpus: Interpretations of Dreams) (2018), a creepy, pseudo-figurative image dominated by bloody reds, gummy pinks, and a fragmentary central form evoking dental implants.

In an interview this summer, Paglen compared working with AI to the way Sol LeWitt worked with installers for his Wall Drawings. In both cases, the job is to construct a set of rules descriptive enough to guide assistants to a general formal output that also reveals the open spaces and breakdowns within those rules.
The difference is that LeWitt’s assistants were other humans with interpretive capabilities, making judgment calls when necessary. Paglen’s are neural networks with deliberately complicated data sets, visualizing the human opinions embedded in their training. Instead of showing how independent and advanced GANs are, as Obvious’s “purist” work purports to do, Paglen’s work shows that GANs are dependent, limited, and hugely vulnerable to perpetuating the hidden biases held by the developers and researchers guiding them.
Artists’ horizons expand further in light of the fact that GANs are not even the only type of AI infrastructure available. Theo Triantafyllidis’s practice, for example, avoids neural networks in favor of the types of decision-tree-based AI that powers non-player characters in video games—technology that he has put to use in fixed-screen simulations and even virtual reality works. Other artists, such as Lynn Hershman Leeson, Martine Syms, and Martine Rothblatt, have created pieces involving chatbots, the communicative manifestations of natural language processing—the branch of AI that powers familiar digital “assistants” like Siri and Alexa.
Ultimately, the mini-controversy over Christie’s and Obvious offers a window onto an important lesson here in the early life of AI art: To identify truly path-breaking work, we would do better to stop asking where the boundary line lies between human artists’ agency and that of AI toolsets, and instead start asking whether human artists are using AI to plumb greater conceptual and aesthetic depths than researchers or coders. Anything less and we’re simply elevating a technology demo to the status of enlightened studio practice.

During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I’ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.’s center of gravity — away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country’s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of “copying.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Analysts in the West often acknowledge the areas in which China has an advantage in A.I., but they tend to misunderstand the nature of China’s strength in each one. With regard to China’s abundant data, analysts often point to the sheer size of China’s population (which owns 1.1 billion mobile internet devices) and claim that lax privacy laws allow a free-for-all with user data. But China’s core data advantage lies not just in breadth (the number of users) and access (the amount of data that users contribute) but also in the depth of data on each user — the real-world activities of Chinese people that are captured in a digital format useful to an A.I. algorithm.For instance, Chinese consumers regularly use apps like WeChat to do an astonishing range of real-world things: buy groceries, book doctor’s appointments, manage their electricity and water utilities, take out microloans. Chinese people make up 68 percent of global demand for bike-sharing and ride-hailing apps. This widespread use of apps in part reflects a “leapfrog effect”: Chinese people never truly adopted credit cards, so they jumped directly to mobile payments; Chinese hospitals never had extensive traditional systems for booking patients, so they are jumping straight to smartphone apps; and so on.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China’s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the “think different” ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don’t explore or exploit all of their technology’s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China’s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived — including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups — turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government’s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn’t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it’s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it’s technical — major improvements in core algorithms — then the advantage goes to the United States. If it’s implementation — smart infrastructure or policy adaptation — then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don’t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other’s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation’s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Kai-Fu Lee (@kaifulee), the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, is the author of the forthcoming book “A.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” from which this essay is adapted.A version of this article appears in print on Sept. 23, 2018, Section SR, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: What China Can Teach  The U.S. About A.I..

Is AI a threat to mankind? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
Answer by Falon Fatemi, CEO & Founder, Node.io, on Quora:

The rise of AI has been met with mixed reviews. The late Stephen Hawking declared that AI could be the “worst event in the history of our civilization” and Elon Musk has stated that ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""
However, AI is an integral part of our everyday lives and does not have to be so intimidating. As AI continues to integrate into our factories and offices, it will streamline and enrich processes to such an extent that companies using AI are better positioned for long-term growth than those who don’t.
PROMOTED
An important way to stay relevant in the face of AI is to double down in our efforts to develop a critical “superpower”— emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence involves the ability to recognize, understand and control our own emotions and influence others’ emotions. While AI affords companies unprecedented capabilities (such as speed-of-light calculations), it cannot exude emotional intelligence capabilities.

It’s time that we realize the pressure AI is putting on humans to be far more emotionally intelligent, as our future success in the workplace may depend on it.

Artificial intelligence to wipe out half of all jobs
Thamer Tayfour
bahrain
September 24, 2018












Environmentalists have been warning of water war, scientists of space war and the new entry to the list is ‘jobs war’. Technology experts are warning of a situation in the near future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) will wipe out nearly half of all existing jobs, leading to severe unemployment, especially among the youth.
Speaking to Tribune, technology expert and President of Bahrain Artificial Intelligence Society Dr. Jassim Haji said that policy-makers should be well aware of the situation to prevent a huge disaster from happening. “AI will take away 45 percent of all jobs occupied by humans in the region in the next few years. And it will certainly have an adverse impact on the lives of 20 million full-time employees,” he said. On the flip side, Dr. Haji said that it will contribute towards the economic growth in the region by adding around $320 billion, which is around 11pc of the region’s GDP.
“AI is capable of creating a radical change in the services provided by both the public and private sectors since AI will be able to perform more tasks currently operated by humans in the near future. “It’s expected that private commercial industries, such as the retail sector, would benefit more from AI. The public sector will also flourish with the utilization of AI in vital sectors including healthcare, education and other government services.
“In our region, there’s a remarkable interest in the development of AI and this is reflected in the future projects announced by the governments here, such as the smart cities and modern economies. Such initiatives require AI and modern operating systems, proving the growing interest in such technologies in the region.” Dr. Haji also said that AI and its role in the development of Middle Eastern societies will be highlighted during an upcoming event to be held in Bahrain. “The fourth edition of Bahrain Excellence Forum, which will be held on October 24, 25, will shed light on AI and its role in government excellence,” he said. It will be held under the patronage of Cabinet Affairs Minister Mohammed Al Mutawa.
The expert stated that the forum will include a demonstration of the different uses of AI applications in all fields and the means to benefit from modern technologies in their development. “AI has granted the ability to automate around 45pc of the existing jobs in the region. This would affect around 20 million full-time employees, but at the same time, it would save around USD366.6 billion in wages.
“This would be challenging to decision-makers in the region, but it is definitely inevitable. Raising awareness on AI and its capabilities is important and our societies should be well prepared for such a huge step towards the future.” On the other hand, experts worldwide fear that depending on AI and robotics in different industrial and service fields would have a negative impact on human resources and the opportunities of their employment. However, many other experts have an opposite and more optimistic opinion, predicting that newer work fields would be created.
On her part, the forum’s Assistant Secretary-General Noura Al Aliwi underlined the importance of AI as one of the major outputs of the industrial, informatics and technological revolutions. She said that AI is likely to open the door for unlimited innovations, pointing out its use in numerous fields. This, she added, might bring about a radical change in people’s lives due to the mammoth and fast-paced technological development and the global changes brought about by the fourth industrial revolution.

Five Questions Lawyers Should Ask About AI
By Laura van Wyngaarden, Co-Founder & COO of legal AI company, Diligen
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest emerging technologies, rapidly gaining momentum as it promises to transform the way we work. Buzz around its ability to automate work and predict outcomes is exciting, yet the chatter often clouds our perceptions and complicates the realities of introducing this powerful technology into the practice of law.
As those in the legal industry debate AI’s merits and risks, ponder their responsibilities to it, and attempt to foresee the future of the profession, we serve ourselves well by considering these five thought-provoking questions about the use of AI in the legal practice:
1 – Do lawyers have an ethical responsibility to leverage AI in the practice of law?
Lawyers are well versed in the ethical responsibilities of their profession, but what does ethical responsibility look like when it comes to new technologies, such as machine learning and AI?
Consider the tech that precedes these newcomers—email, electronic case organization and eDiscovery. At one time each of these seemed like risky new technologies, yet now they are part of the responsible practice of law. But, what about AI?
Let’s consider an example from another field. If a surgeon could adopt the latest surgical tools and improve a patient’s chances of survival – do they have an ethical obligation to do so? Would we consider them unethical if they refused to learn new techniques and thus gave their parents riskier operations than necessary?
AI-powered legal tech has the power to help lawyers do faster, more thorough and more cost effective legal work. If we can do this work better and more efficiently for our clients – do we have a responsibility to do so? While leveraging AI may not yet be considered an ethical obligation, I suspect this is a conversation we will be having many more times in the years ahead.
2 – Does entrusting technology with a greater role in the law create or mitigate risk?
Initially, the introduction of virtually any new and disruptive technology brings doubt and fear. Skeptics see embracing new tools as handing over hard-earned authority to machines, and fear that by doing so we are opening ourselves up to unnecessary risk. But is this fear warranted?
As humans, we tend to underestimate the risks in processes we are already familiar with, while overestimating the risks involved in doing things in new ways. For instance, M&A due diligence typically involves students or junior associates spending many late nights reviewing contracts to meet tight deadlines. Because lawyers are accustomed to this practice, they don’t view this as a risk, though clearly sleep-deprived associates under time pressure are prone to errors.
Contract review tools leveraging AI currently have the ability to help legal teams to thoroughly review very large sets of contracts, rapidly surfacing key issues (like a change of control provision that requires consent) buried in the documents that might have been missed if the work was being done manually. While the new tech may attract greater scrutiny than legacy processes, combining skilled lawyers with the right tools can create significant, measurable risk reduction in legal tasks.
 I suspect in years to come we will see insurance companies offering law firms lower premiums if they use AI tools for certain legal tasks, or even mandating the use of the tools as a condition of coverage.
3 – Is the role of legal counsel changing?
Numerous studies show that lawyers believe AI and machine learning technologies will threaten their roles and lead to job cuts. Consider that from the 1980s we saw a huge increase in the number of accounting jobs after spreadsheet technology became available, driving down the cost for calculations and significantly boosting demand for these services. We may well see the same in law.
AI has potential to put the lawyer back into the skilled advisory role by reducing time spent on routine, time intensive tasks that don’t require years of specialised training.

In law, one of the  fastest growing use cases for AI is leveraging machine learning to help lawyers review and summarize contracts. This technology can rapidly surface key provisions in a set of contracts and do much of the time consuming work of compiling contract summaries. This allows the lawyer to spend more time considering the implications of what AI has uncovered and advising their client.
As machine learning technologies allow us to do things we have never done before I expect that we will also see new types of legal roles emerging over the next few years – just as we saw the rapid growth of a plethora of new financial management roles in the last few decades when spreadsheets made the the ability to make rapid, sophisticated calculations standard.
4 – Do clients really care about how lawyers work?
For the most part, clients don’t really care how lawyers work. Clients want the right level of service, at the right cost, to produce the desired outcome.
Increasingly, lawyers’ spending time doing routine tasks that could be done more effectively with the assistance of the right tools will be considered a misuse of time and money.
5 – How do we begin to embrace, rather than fear AI’s role in our profession?
Like any unknown, we fear AI to the degree that we don’t understand it. Learning more about AI’s capabilities and powers – what it can and can’t do right now – goes a long way towards alleviating fears and moving past misconceptions. This prevents us getting either caught in the hype or dismissing all tools out of hand and missing out on the very real and powerful benefits machine learning technology can bring to many legal tasks, helping us to work smarter, faster and more efficiently.

Undoubtedly, AI is rapidly becoming a practical reality throughout the legal field. By better understanding its abilities and our responsibilities in leveraging it, lawyers can create more fulfilling roles for themselves and better serve their clients as AI tools become a valuable – and normal – part of the way of the way legal work is done.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to be a key element in creating the new digital labour force; what analyst firm Gartner is describing as DigitalOps.AI is integrating a long list of some of the most innovative and disruptive technologies available: machine learning; cognitive and computer vision; conversational capabilities; human-to-machine user interfaces; predictive data analytics; cybersecurity; IoT and intelligent monitoring. Prime Day deals are here - shop our expert picksIt is a huge range of applications that will take considerable skill to implement if they are to be optimised in work environments around the world. Despite all the advances in management software and techniques, the most effective path to extracting the maximum value from these technologies is through convergence with robotic process automation (RPA). Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksHealth HeadlinesTop Doctors 'Anti-Lazy' Drops Are Going Viral This JulyHealth HeadlinesBuy NowUndoWe've also highlighted the best AI platforms for businessRobotic process automationThis proven technology is already bringing together AI and cognitive tools to achieve productivity gains of several orders of magnitude whilst simultaneously slashing costs. While RPA streamlines workflows and performs routine administrative tasks at high volume in a fraction of the time it takes humans and to far higher standards of accuracy, the addition of AI and cognitive capabilities promises smarter business decisions and the potential for much more far-reaching positive change. LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

The ability to learn is the distinctive characteristic of AI and it means that computers are no longer limited to simply carrying out instructions written by humans. Instead, they can continuously learn from new data and perform better than their human programmers. It is what is described as moving from rules-based to experience-based operations.AI will take over countless tasks such as driving cars, diagnosing diseases or providing customer support. AI's superhuman performance will generate massive increases in productivity. A June 2017 study by consulting firm PwC, predicts AI will stimulate $15.7 trillion in additional wealth for the world by 2030. While AI can be considered the “thinking” component of the digital workforce, RPA embodies the component that “acts”. Computer vision and the crunching of all types of data (structured or unstructured) embodies the “sensing” component. All of this data will be then fed into the AI solution, completing the circle to provide the power to RPA software automation which can work attended under the direction of a human worker or unattended and completely autonomous.Are you a pro?

An employee can be trusted to perform as expected through training and personal performance controls. But how do humans trust a robot or any automated process, for that matter, to perform as expected?It is important to recognise the difference between an RPA robot, and a robot as an AI solution. While the RPA robot is programmed to perform certain tasks, the AI solution is trained by observation. Trusting AI machines will take time and requires transparency and analytics from the point of implementation. Finding a transparent way of helping humans see how the machines learn and use this knowledge in the correct way and take the right decisions will not be easy.Fear of change and lack of personal employee engagement can also have negative impact on the successful adoption of AI-powered automation. It is important for all organisations implementing RPA with AI capabilities to educate their workforces. Artificial Intelligence should be viewed as a technology that makes each employee more productive and opens up access to new capabilities. Training is necessary but should not take too long or become intimidatingly complex.The wider effects of automationThere are limits to the abilities of today's AI which have other ramifications for the relationship between society and automation. Repetitive tasks, such as auditing or insurance and credit administration are likely to disappear and many of the basic information-accessing and processing aspects of the professions such as medicine and the law are likely to be performed by AI and cognitive applications. Yet any role that definitely requires complex human interaction or the management of people is likely to be retained and indeed increased. These jobs are beyond AI's capabilities in terms of creativity, strategy-formulation, sociability and care. Although the technology goes way beyond human capabilities in the digital sphere it lacks social skills or empathy. The concern here is that AI will radically alter many middle-ranking jobs that involve a degree of administration and information analysis. Roles that will remain relatively insulated will be at opposite ends of the income spectrum – from CEOs to carers, podiatrists and hairstylists. As a result, there has been much discussion about providing a universal basic income to citizens who have lost their jobs to technology. This is to miss the opportunity presented by this transformative technology.Such a revolution in how we relate to work will require a rethink from all corners of society. In the private sector, instead of simply viewing AI as a means for cost-cutting through automation, businesses will create new jobs by seeking out symbiosis between AI and the human touch. This will be especially effective in areas such as healthcare and education, where AI can produce crucial insights but only humans can deliver them with care and compassion. We are already seeing that in many organisations where AI-powered ‘Smart’ RPA is implemented, there are very low levels of job losses as the humans are freed from the mundane to move up the value chain; i.e., employees have more time to devote to profitable, creative tasks which increases their engagement.A rethink may be requiredThere is no denying that some roles will disappear and that will require fresh thinking about how to use the wealth generated by AI to reorient our economies.Some of this wealth could be used to support socially useful work such as care or charity work, parenting or home schooling of young children, assisting aging parents or helping a friend with mental or physical disabilities live life to the full. By requiring some social contribution, we would foster a public ethos that focuses on our usefulness to one another and wider humanity. Many difficult questions remain to be answered, of course, before we could consider implementing such a sweeping and idealistic policy. But in the meantime, it is important that business concentrates on obtaining the huge gains in productivity and efficiency from the most effective implementation of RPA and AI. This is the one certain way of harnessing the combined potential of thinking machines and humans.Guy Kirkwood,  Chief Evangelist at UiPathThis is how AI can help you build your next website

""To AI or not to AI"", a play on Shakespeare age-old adage, is making waves into today's' teched-up world as many industries are looking into AI solutions for their businesses, especially when it comes to human resources.Due to the 'Hollywood' driven concept of AI, many organizations are scared of letting a non-human entity handle certain procedures of business, but the day when AI robots could possibly take over the world is far from today. Having an untold potential in the increase of efficiency, partnered with a cost-effective solution, does it not only make sense to adapt to the modern world, but to use the benefits of AI for your businesses recruitment needs, or your needs in general? Is it the right choice for your business? Here is what you need to know in order to answer that question.AI means reduced recruiting timelines



The time of spending hundreds of man-hours filtering through thousands of CVs and online job-board profiles for new employees is coming to an end. For example, ideally, a company, specializing in AI recruiting services, claims on their blog and estimates their AI candidate sourcing algorithm can ""reduce time to hire from 34 days to 9 days"". This is a 73.53% increase in candidate sourcing and on boarding efficiency utilizing a non-biased process that removes stereotypes from sourcing and finds candidates that are technically appropriate for the position.Candidate screening is another task that can be automated by AI technology. By using this intelligent-style method much more online data can be collected such as information from social media profiles, previous online job records, and educational qualifications that will then enhance the ranking system of candidates for recruiters to select from.


Given AI technology can efficiently source and screen multiple candidates in a short period of time the acceptance criteria set by the business and the candidate profile has to be matched to identify and match the most promising candidates for the job. Using this gathered data AI programs can then rank candidates on a scale using various pieces of information such as experience, work history, skill sets, and salary expectations to find the right person. This method of processing data is becoming highly valued in today's market because of its ability to locate passive candidates, who are generally the most desired, as they aren't actively looking for other positions and they are content with their current position meaning they are an asset to their company which in turn means there is less competition to place them.A huge part of the recruiting timeline, after you've found the 'perfect fit' for the role, is interviewing. In today's' international job market, numerous expats are actively seeking roles abroad while not always being able to go to the respective country of their desired job just for an interview. There are a few startups that are specializing in AI interviewing software such as HireVue and Mya. These companies are shifting their focus on simplifying the interviewing process by utilizing video as the medium. Programs such as HireVue use preset questionnaires that the candidate can then film themselves answering. This allows for the recruiter to generically interview a higher number of potential candidates via pre-recorded videos, which can then be sifted through to select individuals who will progress in the talent acquisition process.Using AI technology, the footwork is taken care of from sourcing to interviewing which drastically reduces the recruitment timeline. This, in turn, allows for the talent acquisition team to engage with prospective candidates and determine their ability to perform in the specific role, and inevitably, make a placement at a much faster rate.Related: How the UAE's New Minister of AI Views the Future Of Tech in His Desert NationAI in human resources is cost-effective and better for business overallAlong with numerous man-hours, countless company dollars are being spent on old-fashioned recruitment in today's' market. A 2016 Society of Human Resource Management survey found that ""the average cost-per-hire is $4,129"". That is a staggering dollar amount to place one individual. Let's put it in perspective.In 2017, CNN reported that Amazon had ""541,900 employees in the third quarter of 2017, which was up from a little more than 300,000 in the same period a year earlier."" This means that over that period 12 month period, Amazon hired an estimate of 241,900 new employees. Granted Amazon is already using AI technology in its recruitment services but for the sake of the argument let's pretend they didn't (like a lot of large companies today) and let's pretend their cost of hiring one employee was that of the average found by SHRM. The cost would look like:$4,129 (Average cost to hire) x 241,900 (New employees) = $998,805,100 in recruitment costs per 1 year.


It's estimated that in this scenario Amazon could have spent upwards of $1 Billion USD on recruitment costs alone over the period of 12 months. This is quite astounding and nearly incomprehensible, but possible. With many of the AI recruitment and Human Resources programs available offering tailor-made packages on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly subscription basis, it's not hard to see that you can save a pretty hefty penny by transitioning to AI technology solutions.AI in human resources will improve the ""employee experience"" and take ""engagement down to the individual level.""In the recent IBM Think 2018 panel, Richard Hughes, Senior Vice President at UnitedHealth Group, stated, ""The future is going to be centred on the employee experience and taking engagement down to the individual level. There is no way we can do that on any scale without applying the best that ""data science' has to offer."" AI isn't just about giving humans a hand at doing lower level tasks, it's about data. Vast amounts of data can be collected at an exponentially higher rate with AI than humans can wish to accomplish. This data is what drives businesses in general, not only in the Human Resources department.In larger corporations many employees can feel lost and unengaged by their employers and Human Resource department. Anything from vacation requests not being acknowledged to unenforced policies can be the tipping point for most employees which results in high turnover rates. A high salary does not make an employee happy. Most people feel their jobs are their lives, and who wants to live an unhappy life? No one.


Having access to a wider array of data means you have the ability to make your employees' overall experience better by applying the gathered data and making relevant adjustments to the workplace atmosphere or internal processes. A recent tweet by Hughes says, ""Having good data is like having good health. When you have it, you take it for granted. When you don't, you panic."" Simply put, increased data means increased data analytics, which means advanced insights that lead to improved working conditions for employees that keeps turnover rates low.AI In human resources and setbacks to considerAs you've gathered by now, there are multiple advantages to utilizing AI technology for your human resources and recruiting needs, but nothing is perfect in life, certainly not a budding form of technology that has yet to reach its maximum potential. Many services and programs offered could lack different aspects one might be accustomed to in manual the non AI world, such as the ability to leave feedback to a candidate after a video interview, or specific CV search criteria. One major aspect that AI technology lacks is empathy and human interaction or the opportunity to handpick a candidate and get to know them personally during the recruitment process which simply cannot be done at this time while relying on AI technology to do all the work for your company. AI sees data whereas humans sense emotion and this is something that will not be changing in the foreseeable future.Therefore it is up to you to decide if AI technology is the right solution for your businesses' needs. Are you a corporation with thousands of employees, spending big bucks on recruitment annually and desperately need a way to streamline the process and cut costs? Are you a mom-and-pop shop that has less than 15 employees and takes pride in getting to know each employee like family? Every business has different goals, budgets, and desires, but the beauty of the AI industry is that there is a solution for everyone, no matter how big or how small.


It is up to you to decide what works for your business, whether that is adapting to the constant growing AI industry or keeping things as they are or just introducing small changes over time. Either way, AI technology is only going to keep growing and at some point in the future AI will be the norm and the old-fashioned ways of recruiting and human resource processes will seem like the stone ages.Related: The Future Is Now: The UAE Is All Set To Be A Leading Destination For AI Investment

By 2012, global spend on artificial intelligence is anticipated to hit $57.6 billion, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). And one YouTube star — Taryn Southern — is already activating AI to pioneer a new methodology for producing music. Released today, Southern’s pop album “I Am AI” features eight tracks, each produced entirely with artificial intelligence. She’s also released a new music video “Welcome to the New World,” which integrated collaborators from all over the world.
 
Southern’s first single Break Free reached #48 on the Billboard Indicator Chart , #2 on the Euro Indie Chart and has more than 1.8 million views on the music video. Life Support, her second single, was nominated for a 2018 Streamy Award for Best Immersive Video.  
Her  work on “I AM AI” is unprecedented. Until now, producing an album entirely with artificial intelligence had never been done. And, it’s a process Southern said will revolutionize the open-market for aspiring artists and musicians and disrupt an age-old model for the music industry. 
“I definitely see it changing the future of the music. I imagine in 20 years, ‘coding’ songs will be commonplace,” Southern told VideoInk (a subsidiary of TheWrap) exclusively in an interview. “It’s still incredibly early for AI, but I could see artists using machine learning for all kinds of applications: to mix and master their songs, to help them identify unique chord progressions, alter instrumentation to change style, determine more interesting melody structures based on a musician’s given sound and style preferences, even gage their audience’s emotional response to a song. The sky is the limit.”

So, how does producing music with artificial intelligence work exactly? 
Southern collaborated with Amper — an artificial intelligence music composition software — to develop a process that she says involved telling the computer the sounds, notes, or instruments she wanted. Amper’s software then delivered a “stem,” or audio fragment, to match that criteria. Then with feedback and multiple tweaks, Southern is able to stitch those “stems” together to create a track.  
“This is what the future holds. For us it’s all about the collaboration between creator and the AI,” said Michael Hobe, a Hollywood film composer and co-founder of Amper. “That’s what we’re working towards — to have AI truly integrated into the workflow. And Taryn was really the first to use the tools in this way, which has been really exciting.” 
 
Taryn Southern on YouTube, circa 2013.
For Southern, taking the reins on charting a career path in unconventional ways has been her M.O. She was early to YouTube, launching a channel based on slap-stick and musical comedy in 2006. “I’m not really focused on building an audience on another platform until I have at least 250,000 subscribers on YouTube,” she told VideoInk in 2013. She now has nearly 500K subscribers on YouTube, a platform where Southern isn’t as active outside of releasing music videos for “I AM AI”. 
“When I was on YouTube, I felt owned by an algorithm,” Southern said. “It’s a really tough job to sustain, and we’ve seen a lot of creators experience burnout the past few years. I didn’t want to become a living breathing vlog machine, so I threw in the towel and started exploring other avenues of interest.”
Aside from the album, Southern is also directing a feature-length documentary on the future of man and machine. “It’s called I AM HUMAN. My album is ironically entitled I AM AI, so I’ve got both sides covered!” Southern joked.  
And so Southern has reinvented herself as a technology innovator and AI-storyteller. A musician changing the game, Southern’s work on “I AM AI” is breaking down the old-way of making music and alchemizing the future into the present.  
“I AM AI” is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Google Play and Apple Music.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise, but also potential for pitfalls. AI can change the way we live, work, and play, accelerate drug discoveries, and drive edge computing and autonomous systems. It also has the potential to transform global politics, economies, and cultures in such profound ways that the U.S. and other countries are set to enter what some speculate may be the next Space Race.  
We are just beginning to understand the implications of unchecked AI. Recent headlines have highlighted its limitations and the continued need for human control. We will not be able to ignore the range of ethical risks posed by issues of privacy, transparency, safety, control, and bias. Examples include:

""What Machine Learning Can and Cannot Do""


""AI is Hurting People of Color and the Poor. Experts Want to Fix That""


""Why Artificial Intelligence Will Have Very Human Frailties""


Considering the advances already made in AI—and those yet to be made—AI is undoubtedly on a trajectory toward integration into every aspect of our lives. As we prepare to turn an increasing share of tasks and decision-making over to AI we must think more critically about how ethics factor into AI design to minimize risk. With this in mind, policymakers must proactively consider ways to incorporate ethics into AI practices and design incentives that promote innovation while ensuring AI operates with our best interests in mind.



In an AI World, the Garbage In/Garbage Out Principle is Amplified
With so much at stake, it’s tempting to ponder whether ethical issues can be solved by simple algorithm changes. Why can’t AI technologists team up with philosophers or ethicists and immediately change the calculus to infuse morality into the very algorithms on which AI is based? It’s not that simple. The definition of exactly what is fair and equitable, and in what context, does not have a clear-cut answer. Beyond the murky definitions and lack of common consensus, the issue is not only in the algorithms themselves—it’s in the data used to train them.
Perhaps most consequential is the intentional and unintentional bias embedded in the datasets with which AI is trained. Bias in AI can take many forms: dataset bias, association bias, interaction bias, automation bias, and confirmation bias (Cou et al., 2017). It can be the result of simple mistakes or oversight in data aggregation techniques. Computers then use these potentially flawed data to make assumptions and calculations that are not truly objective. This alone may not seem overtly dangerous, but the real issue lies in the potential of these biases or discrepancies to be scaled to such a degree that they affect how computers treat larger sets of data. Biased data causes machine learning to rely on unjustified bias to discriminate against groups at scale (Crawford, 2017).  
AI technologies already in the market are displaying these intentional and unintentional biases. For example, consider talent search technology that intentionally groups candidate resumes by demographic characteristics, or insensitive autofill search algorithms (Lapowsky, 2018). Conversely, by reinforcing European notions of beauty, the Beauty.AI pageant showed unintentional automation bias in action when machines overwhelmingly chose winners with light skin rather than any of the large number of dark-skinned applicants (Levin, 2016).
As a nation, we need to understand that the implications of AI reach far beyond beauty contests or advertising targets. AI has the ability to create almost undetectable forgeries of news articles, audio recordings, and videos, making it difficult to separate truth from fiction. Organizations and governments will be held accountable for their actions, or lack thereof, in protecting citizens’ rights to privacy, equity, and justice.
Government’s Role in Safe and Responsible AI Implementation

While AI cannot be expected to solve philosophical conundrums that have existed across society for years, government leaders and policymakers are uniquely positioned to lead and fund long-term R&D on topics like ethics and bias where businesses may not be incentivized to invest. They must also introduce smart policy that balances the need for innovation with the obligation to benefit and safeguard society. Such mitigating measures should be built with inclusion and fairness in mind, and include these two fundamental steps:

Establish Standards and Guidance to Navigate Risks. The government can help confront AI risks by leading the joint development and publication of standards and guidance around safety, privacy, ethics, and control in coordination with industry, academic, and international stakeholders. Equally important is continued funding of research focused on testing and certification methods, including programs like DARPA’s Explainable AI, which aims to enable humans to understand how AI algorithms behave. The government should also focus on establishing clear plans and expectations for organizations on how to deal with failures when they do arise—because they most certainly will.  


Devote Public Resources to the Creation and Curation of Accurate and Bias-Free Data Sets. One line of defense against AI systems that inflict unfair treatment is to give more attention to how data sets are constructed before operationalizing them, which means that attention to bias cannot be an afterthought. Today, many of the most powerful data sources come from two places: (1) academic institutions, and (2) corporations. Both types of data sets have limitations. Academia’s data sets are often constrained based on the time and resources of those using the data to drive publications, while corporate data is often representative of individual customer sets rather than the public as a whole. The government should release guidance around data-sharing between public and private organizations to ensure data integrity by allowing for the curation of more diverse data sets, while still adhering to the aforementioned standards and guidance.


By leading the dialogue now and beginning to take proactive actions to address these topics, the government can ensure the development of AI with a net positive impact on society, rather than hindering potential opportunities simply because ethics wasn’t considered at the onset.

Professor Margaret Thornton says technology could bring benefits to lawyers.(Supplied: Australian National University)She believes the march of technology is making it more difficult for graduates to embark on a legal profession.""There are 42 law schools in Australia producing around 7,000 graduates a year [and] they need oversight and training,"" she said.""Traditionally they worked under supervision in established law firms but those opportunities are declining, with fewer jobs on offer and fewer experienced lawyers available to supervise newcomers.""Professor Thornton said the new developments brought about by technology could result in benefits, particularly to women, who account for about 65 per cent of Australia's law students.""With more varied models of legal practice, there's the promise of more flexible hours and that's something working parents, particularly women, need,"" she said.What a lawyer should beRecent law graduate Lachlan Robb works as a paralegal with a Brisbane law firm but wants to undertake a PhD focussing on the impact of technology on legal practice. Lachlan Robb plans to research technology's impact on law.(ABC Gold Coast: Charmaine Kane)Mr Robb said while there may be fewer jobs available in some practices, the roles that are available are becoming more meaningful.""I have noticed uncertainty in students as firms embrace technology [who are asking] 'will I still get a job?' but there are positives',"" he said.""There may be fewer jobs in some practices but the roles that are offered are becoming more meaningful.""There's an argument that firms will need graduates to be employed on more skilled-based activities which will actually use their minds instead of using pattern recognition which a machine can do.""He thinks the role and impact of lawyers will evolve and change as more technology is utilised.""It is going to revert to more of a baseline notion of what a lawyer should be,"" he said.""Not a person who does all the paperwork but an advisor, where the human element becomes more and more important.""Posted 27 Sep 201827 Sep 2018Thu 27 Sep 2018 at 6:40pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesCould a robot do your job?

Joseph Stiglitz. Photograph: Alexandre Isard/Paris Match/Contour/Getty ImagesThe technology could vastly improve lives, the economist says – but only if the tech titans that control it are properly regulated. ‘What we have now is totally inadequate’By Ian Sample Science editorSat 8 Sep 2018 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Sep 2018 05.10 EDTShare274274It must be hard for Joseph Stiglitz to remain an optimist in the face of the grim future he fears may be coming. The Nobel laureate and former chief economist at the World Bank has thought carefully about how artificial intelligence will affect our lives. On the back of the technology, we could build ourselves a richer society and perhaps enjoy a shorter working week, he says. But there are countless pitfalls to avoid on the way. The ones Stiglitz has in mind are hardly trivial. He worries about hamfisted moves that lead to routine exploitation in our daily lives, that leave society more divided than ever and threaten the fundamentals of democracy.“Artificial intelligence and robotisation have the potential to increase the productivity of the economy and, in principle, that could make everybody better off,” he says. “But only if they are well managed.”On 11 September, the Columbia University professor will be in London to deliver the latest lecture in the Royal Society’s You and AI series. Stiglitz will talk about the future of work, an area where predictions have been frequent, contradictory and unnerving. Last month, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned that “large swathes” of Britain’s workforce face unemployment as AI and other technologies automate more jobs. He had less to say about the new positions AI may create. A report from PricewaterhouseCoopers in July argued that AI may create as many jobs as it destroys – perhaps even more. As with the Industrial Revolution, the misery would come not from a lack of work, but the difficulty in switching from one job to another.A distinction Stiglitz makes is between AI that replaces workers and AI that helps people to do their jobs better. It already helps doctors to work more efficiently. At Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, for example, cancer consultants spend less time than they used to planning radiotherapy for men with prostate cancer, because an AI system called InnerEye automatically marks up the gland on the patients’ scans. The doctors process patients faster, the men start treatment sooner and the radiotherapy is delivered with more precision.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft’s InnerEye project uses AI to make treatment for prostate cancer more efficient. Photograph: Microsoft Project InnerEye StudyFor other specialists, the technology is more of a threat. Well-trained AIs are now better at spotting breast tumours and other cancers than radiologists. Does that mean widespread unemployment for radiologists? It is not so straightforward, says Stiglitz. “Reading an MRI scan is only part of the job that person performs, but you can’t easily separate that task from the others.”And yet some jobs may be fully replaced. Mostly these are low-skilled roles: truck drivers, cashiers, call centre workers and more. Again, though, Stiglitz sees reasons to be cautious about what that will mean for overall unemployment. There is a strong demand for unskilled workers in education, the health service and care for older people. “If we care about our children, if we care about our aged, if we care about the sick, we have ample room to spend more on those,” Stiglitz says. If AI takes over certain unskilled jobs, the blow could be softened by hiring more people into health, education and care work and paying them a decent wage, he says.Stiglitz won the Nobel prize for economics in 2001 for his analyses of imperfect information in markets. A year later, he published Globalisation and Its Discontents, a book that laid bare his disillusion with the International Monetary Fund – the World Bank’s sister organisation – and, by extension, the US Treasury. Trade negotiations, he argued, were driven by multinationals at the expense of workers and ordinary citizens. “What I want to emphasise is that it is time to focus on the public-policy issues surrounding AI, because the concerns are a continuation of the concerns that globalisation and innovation have brought us. We were slow to grasp what they were doing and we shouldn’t make that mistake again.”Beyond the impact of AI on work, Stiglitz sees more insidious forces at play. Armed with AI, tech firms can extract meaning from the data we hand over when we search, buy and message our friends. It is used ostensibly to deliver a more personalised service. That is one perspective. Another is that our data is used against us.“These new tech giants are raising very deep issues about privacy and the ability to exploit ordinary people that were never present in earlier eras of monopoly power,” says Stiglitz. “Beforehand, you could raise the price. Now you can target particular individuals by exploiting their information.”We’ve gone from a 60-hour working week to a 45-hour week and we could go to 30 or 25Joseph StiglitzIt is the potential for datasets to be combined that most worries Stiglitz. For example, retailers can now track customers via their smartphones as they move around stores and can gather data on what catches their eye and which displays they walk straight past.“In your interactions with Google, Facebook, Twitter and others, they gather an awful lot of data about you. If that data is combined with other data, then companies have a great deal of information about you as an individual – more information than you have on yourself,” he says.“They know, for example, that people who search this way are willing to pay more. They know every store you’ve visited. That means that life is going to be increasingly unpleasant, because your decision to shop in a certain store may result in you paying more money. To the extent that people are aware of this game, it distorts their behaviour. What is clear is that it introduces a level of anxiety in everything we do and it increases inequality even more.”Stiglitz poses a question that he suspects tech firms have faced internally. “Which is the easier way to make a buck: figuring out a better way to exploit somebody, or making a better product? With the new AI, it looks like the answer is finding a better way to exploit somebody.”Grim revelations about how Russia turned to Facebook, Twitter and Google to interfere with the 2016 US election brought home how effectively people can be targeted with bespoke messages. Stiglitz is concerned that companies are using, or will use, similar tactics to exploit their customers, in particular those who are vulnerable, such as compulsive shoppers. “As opposed to a doctor who might help us manage our frailties, their objective is to take as much advantage of you as they can,” he says. “All the worst tendencies of the private sector in taking advantage of people are heightened by these new technologies.”So far, Stiglitz argues, neither governments nor tech firms have done enough to prevent such abuses. “What we have now is totally inadequate,” he says. “There is nothing to circumscribe that kind of bad behaviour and we have enough evidence that there are people who are willing to do it, who have no moral compunction.”In the US in particular, there has been a willingness to leave tech firms to thrash out decent rules of behaviour and adhere to them, Stiglitz believes. One of the many reasons is that the complexity of the technology can make it intimidating. “It overwhelms a lot of people and their response is: ‘We can’t do it, the government can’t do it, we have to leave it to the tech giants.’”View image in fullscreen‘When you have so much wealth concentrated in the hands of relatively few, you have a more unequal society and that is bad for our democracy’ ... a warehouse operated by Amazon, which is now worth more than $1tn. Photograph: Nick Ansell/PABut Stiglitz thinks that view is changing. There is a growing awareness of how companies can use data to target customers, he believes. “Initially, a lot of young people took the view that I have nothing to hide: if you behave well, what are you afraid of? People thought: ‘What harm is there to it?’ And now they realise there can be a lot of harm. I think a large fraction of Americans no longer give the tech firms the benefit of the doubt.”So, how do we get back on track? The measures Stiglitz proposes are broad and it is hard to see how they could be brought in swiftly. The regulatory structure has to be decided publicly, he says. This would include what data the tech firms can store; what data they can use; whether they can merge different datasets; the purposes for which they can use that data; and what degree of transparency they must provide about what they do with the data. “These are all issues that have to be decided,” he says. “You can’t allow the tech giants to do it. It has to be done publicly with an awareness of the danger that the tech firms represent.”Fresh policies are needed to curb monopoly powers and redistribute the immense wealth that is concentrated in the leading AI firms, he adds. This month, Amazon became the second company, after Apple, to reach a market valuation of $1tn. The pair are now worth more than the top 10 oil companies combined. “When you have so much wealth concentrated in the hands of relatively few, you have a more unequal society and that is bad for our democracy,” says Stiglitz.Taxes are not enough. To Stiglitz, this is about labour bargaining power, intellectual property rights, redefining and enforcing competition laws, corporate governance laws and the way the financial system operates. “It’s a much broader agenda than just redistribution,” he says.He is not a fan of universal basic income, a proposal under which everyone receives a no-strings handout to cover the costs of living. Advocates argue that, as tech firms gather ever more wealth, UBI could help to redistribute the proceeds and ensure that everyone benefits. But, to Stiglitz, UBI is a cop-out. He does not believe it is what most people want.“If we don’t change our overall economic and policy framework, what we’re going towards is greater wage inequality, greater income and wealth inequality and probably more unemployment and a more divided society. But none of this is inevitable,” he says. “By changing the rules, we could wind up with a richer society, with the fruits more equally divided, and quite possibly where people have a shorter working week. We’ve gone from a 60-hour working week to a 45-hour week and we could go to 30 or 25.”None of this will happen overnight, he warns. A more robust public debate around AI and work is needed to throw up new ideas, for a start. “Silicon Valley may hire a disproportionate fraction [of people who work in AI], but it may not take that many people to figure it out, including people from Silicon Valley who have become disgruntled with what has been going on,” he says. “People will, and have already begun to, think about new ideas. There will be people with skills who try to work out solutions.”Explore more on these topicsSaturday interviewArtificial intelligence (AI)ConsciousnessComputingFacebookXGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agency sees its primary role as pushing forward new technological solutions to military problems, and the Trump administration’s technical chieftains have strongly backed injecting artificial intelligence into more of America’s weaponry as a means of competing better with Russian and Chinese military forces.The DARPA investment is small by Pentagon spending standardsThe DARPA investment is small by Pentagon spending standards, where the cost of buying and maintaining new F-35 warplanes is expected to exceed a trillion dollars. But it is larger than AI programs have historically been funded and roughly what the United States spent on the Manhattan Project that produced nuclear weapons in the 1940’s, although that figure would be worth about $28 billion today due to inflation.In July defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton received an $885 million contract to work on undescribed artificial intelligence programs over the next five years. And Project Maven, the single largest military AI project, which is meant to improve computers’ ability to pick out objects in pictures for military use, is due to get $93 million in 2019.Turning more military analytical work – and potentially some key decision-making – over to computers and algorithms installed in weapons capable of acting violently against humans is controversial.Google had been leading the Project Maven project for the department, but after an organized protest by Google employees who didn’t want to work on software that could help pick out targets for the military to kill, the company said in June it would discontinue its work after its current contract expires.While Maven and other AI initiatives have helped Pentagon weapons systems become better at recognizing targets and doing things like flying drones more effectively, fielding computer-driven systems that take lethal action on their own hasn’t been approved to date.A Pentagon strategy document released in August says advances in technology will soon make such weapons possible. “DoD does not currently have an autonomous weapon system that can search for, identify, track, select, and engage targets independent of a human operator’s input,” said the report, which was signed by top Pentagon acquisition and research officials Kevin Fahey and Mary Miller. But “technologies underpinning unmanned systems would make it possible to develop and deploy autonomous systems that could independently select and attack targets with lethal force,” the report predicted. while AI systems are technically capable of choosing targets and firing weapons, commanders have been hesitant about surrendering control The report noted that while AI systems are already technically capable of choosing targets and firing weapons, commanders have been hesitant about surrendering control to weapons platforms partly because of a lack of confidence in machine reasoning, especially on the battlefield where variables could emerge that a machine and its designers haven’t previously encountered.Right now, for example, if a soldier asks an AI system like a target identification platform to explain its selection, it can only provide the confidence estimate for its decision, DARPA’s director Steven Walker told reporters after a speech announcing the new investment – an estimate often given in percentage terms, as in the fractional likelihood that an object the system has singled out is actually what the operator was looking for.“What we’re trying to do with explainable AI is have the machine tell the human ‘here’s the answer, and here’s why I think this is the right answer’ and explain to the human being how it got to that answer,” Walker said.DARPA officials have been opaque about exactly how its newly-financed research will result in computers being able to explain key decisions to humans on the battlefield, amidst all the clamor and urgency of a conflict, but the officials said that being able to do so is critical to AI’s future in the military.Human decision-making and rationality depend on a lot more than just following rulesVaulting over that hurdle, by explaining AI reasoning to operators in real time, could be a major challenge. Human decision-making and rationality depend on a lot more than just following rules, which machines are good at. It takes years for humans to build a moral compass and commonsense thinking abilities, characteristics that technologists are still struggling to design into digital machines.“We probably need some gigantic Manhattan Project to create an AI system that has the competence of a three year old,” Ron Brachman, who spent three years managing DARPA’s AI programs ending in 2005, said earlier during the DARPA conference. “We’ve had expert systems in the past, we’ve had very robust robotic systems to a degree, we know how to recognize images in giant databases of photographs, but the aggregate, including what people have called commonsense from time to time, it’s still quite elusive in the field.”Michael Horowitz, who worked on artificial intelligence issues for Pentagon as a fellow in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 2013 and is now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, explained in an interview that “there’s a lot of concern about AI safety – [about] algorithms that are unable to adapt to complex reality and thus malfunction in unpredictable ways.

The director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced the spending spree on the final day of a conference in Washington celebrating its sixty-year history, including its storied role in birthing the internet. 

The agency sees its primary role as pushing forward new technological solutions to military problems, and the Trump administration’s technical chieftains have strongly backed injecting artificial intelligence into more of America’s weaponry as a means of competing better with Russian and Chinese military forces.

""The DARPA investment is small by Pentagon spending standards""

The DARPA investment is small by Pentagon spending standards, where the cost of buying and maintaining new F-35 warplanes is expected to exceed a trillion dollars. But it is larger than AI programs have historically been funded and roughly what the United States spent on the Manhattan Project that produced nuclear weapons in the 1940’s, although that figure would be worth about $28 billion today due to inflation.

In July defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton received an $885 million contract to work on undescribed artificial intelligence programs over the next five years. And Project Maven, the single largest military AI project, which is meant to improve computers’ ability to pick out objects in pictures for military use, is due to get $93 million in 2019.

Turning more military analytical work – and potentially some key decision-making – over to computers and algorithms installed in weapons capable of acting violently against humans is controversial.

Google had been leading the Project Maven project for the department, but after an organized protest by Google employees who didn’t want to work on software that could help pick out targets for the military to kill, the company said in June it would discontinue its work after its current contract expires.

While Maven and other AI initiatives have helped Pentagon weapons systems become better at recognizing targets and doing things like flying drones more effectively, fielding computer-driven systems that take lethal action on their own hasn’t been approved to date.

A Pentagon strategy document released in August says advances in technology will soon make such weapons possible. “DoD does not currently have an autonomous weapon system that can search for, identify, track, select, and engage targets independent of a human operator’s input,” said the report, which was signed by top Pentagon acquisition and research officials Kevin Fahey and Mary Miller. 

But “technologies underpinning unmanned systems would make it possible to develop and deploy autonomous systems that could independently select and attack targets with lethal force,” the report predicted. 

""while AI systems are technically capable of choosing targets and firing weapons, commanders have been hesitant about surrendering control ""

The report noted that while AI systems are already technically capable of choosing targets and firing weapons, commanders have been hesitant about surrendering control to weapons platforms partly because of a lack of confidence in machine reasoning, especially on the battlefield where variables could emerge that a machine and its designers haven’t previously encountered.

Right now, for example, if a soldier asks an AI system like a target identification platform to explain its selection, it can only provide the confidence estimate for its decision, DARPA’s director Steven Walker told reporters after a speech announcing the new investment – an estimate often given in percentage terms, as in the fractional likelihood that an object the system has singled out is actually what the operator was looking for.

“What we’re trying to do with explainable AI is have the machine tell the human ‘here’s the answer, and here’s why I think this is the right answer’ and explain to the human being how it got to that answer,” Walker said.

DARPA officials have been opaque about exactly how its newly-financed research will result in computers being able to explain key decisions to humans on the battlefield, amidst all the clamor and urgency of a conflict, but the officials said that being able to do so is critical to AI’s future in the military.

""Human decision-making and rationality depend on a lot more than just following rules""

Vaulting over that hurdle, by explaining AI reasoning to operators in real time, could be a major challenge. Human decision-making and rationality depend on a lot more than just following rules, which machines are good at. It takes years for humans to build a moral compass and commonsense thinking abilities, characteristics that technologists are still struggling to design into digital machines.

“We probably need some gigantic Manhattan Project to create an AI system that has the competence of a three year old,” Ron Brachman, who spent three years managing DARPA’s AI programs ending in 2005, said earlier during the DARPA conference. “We’ve had expert systems in the past, we’ve had very robust robotic systems to a degree, we know how to recognize images in giant databases of photographs, but the aggregate, including what people have called commonsense from time to time, it’s still quite elusive in the field.”

Michael Horowitz, who worked on artificial intelligence issues for Pentagon as a fellow in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 2013 and is now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, explained in an interview that “there’s a lot of concern about AI safety – [about] algorithms that are unable to adapt to complex reality and thus malfunction in unpredictable ways. It’s one thing if what you’re talking about is a Google search, but it’s another thing if what you’re talking about is a weapons system.”

Horowitz added that if AI systems could prove they were using common sense, ”it would make it more likely that senior leaders and end users would want to use them.” 

An expansion of AI’s use by the military was endorsed by the Defense Science Board in 2016, which noted that machines can act more swiftly than humans in military conflicts. But with those quick decisions, it added, come doubts from those who have to rely on the machines on the battlefield.

“While commanders understand they could benefit from better, organized, more current, and more accurate information enabled by application of autonomy to warfighting, they also voice significant concerns,” the report said.

DARPA isn’t the only Pentagon unit sponsoring AI research. The Trump administration is now in the process of creating a new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center in that building to help coordinate all the AI-related programs across the Defense Department.

But DARPA’s planned investment stands out for its scope.

""DARPA currently has about 25 programs focused on AI research""

DARPA currently has about 25 programs focused on AI research, according to the agency, but plans to funnel some of the new money through its new Artificial Intelligence Exploration Program. That program, announced in July, will give grants up to $1 million each for research into how AI systems can be taught to understand context, allowing them to more effectively operate in complex environments.

Walker said that enabling AI systems to make decisions even when distractions are all around, and to then explain those decisions to their operators will be “critically important…in a warfighting scenario.”

Information in this article may be outdated. For current information about our suicide and self-injury content detection technology, please visit our Safety Center. As described in the Safety Center, our algorithms are intended to help identify potential suicide and self-injury content and are not intended to diagnose or treat any mental health or other condition.
Originally published on September 10, 2018 at 6:00AM PT:
Around the world, a death by suicide occurs every 40 seconds and is the second-leading cause of death for 15- to 29-year-olds. In the US, nearly 45,000 people take their life every year.
When someone is expressing thoughts of suicide, it’s important to get them help as quickly as possible. Because friends and family are connected through Facebook, we can help a person in distress get in touch with people who can support them. For years, people have had the ability to report Facebook posts that they feel indicate someone is thinking about suicide. This flags the posts for review by trained members of our Community Operations team, who can connect the poster with support resources if needed.
Last year, we began to use machine learning to expand our ability to get timely help to people in need. This tool uses signals to identify posts from people who might be at risk, such as phrases in posts and concerned comments from friends and family.
Actually getting a computer to recognize suicidal expression, however, was a complex exercise in analyzing human nuance. One of the biggest challenges the team faced was that so many phrases that might indicate suicidal intent — “kill,” “die,” “goodbye” — are commonly used in other contexts. A human being might recognize that “I have so much homework I want to kill myself” is not a genuine cry of distress, but how do you teach a computer that kind of contextual understanding? Until the team managed to solve that problem, the machine learning model caught too many harmless false positives to be a useful filter for the human review team.
To train a machine learning classifier, you need to feed it tons of examples, both of what you’re trying to identify (positive examples) as well as what you’re not trying to identify (negative examples), so that the classifier learns to distinguish patterns between the two. (Check out the first video on this page for more on this concept.) Usually, you want thousands or even millions of examples in both categories. But when it comes to Facebook posts that contain suicidal expressions, the team had, thankfully, relatively few positive examples to work from. That sparse data set was dwarfed by the negative examples — that is, the entire universe of Facebook text posts that were not suicidal expressions. This imbalance only made the context challenge harder.
The team’s big breakthrough was the realization that they had a smaller and more precise set of negative examples: the set of Facebook posts that people had flagged as potentially containing thoughts of suicide, but which the trained Community Operations reviewers determined did not demonstrate a person at risk of committing self-harm. This set of negative examples contained a lot of the “I have so much homework I want to kill myself” type, which led to more precise training of the classifiers on accurate suicidal expressions.
“The smaller data set helped us develop a much more nuanced understanding of what is a suicidal pattern and what isn’t,” says Dan Muriello, an engineer on the team that produced the tools.
The text of the post is only one factor the algorithm examines to determine whether a post should be flagged for review. It also looks at comments left on the post. Here, too, there is linguistic nuance to consider — posts that reviewers determined were serious cases of people in imminent harm tended to have comments like, “Tell me where you are” or “Has anyone heard from him/her?” while potentially less-urgent posts had comments more along the lines of “Call anytime” or “I’m here for you.” Day and time of the original posting are factors, as well, as experts say the early hours of the morning and Sundays, when the workweek looms, can be common times for contemplating suicide.
Even with the introduction of these AI-fueled detection efforts, people are still core to Facebook’s success around suicide prevention. That’s why anyone who flags a potential cry for help is shown support options, including resources for help and ways to connect with loved ones.  And whether a post is reported by a concerned friend or family member or identified via machine learning, the next steps in the process remain the same. A trained member of Facebook’s Community Operations team reviews it to determine if the person is at risk — and if so, the original poster is shown support options, such as prompts to reach out to a friend and help-line phone numbers. In serious cases, when it’s determined that there may be imminent danger of self harm, Facebook may contact local authorities. Since these efforts began last year, we’ve worked with first responders on over 1,000 wellness checks based on reports we’ve received from our proactive detection efforts.
Technology can’t replace people in the process, but it can be an aid to connect more people in need with compassionate help.

(1) Various combinations of words can have positive or negative impact on the classifier’s confidence that the content includes a suicidal thought.
(2) The classifiers score the content based on how closely correlated the main text and comments are to previously confirmed cases of suicidal expression.
(3) The classifier scores, combined with other numerical details (e.g. time of day, day of week) are inputted into a “random forest learning algorithm,” a type of machine learning that specializes in numerical data.

For current information about our suicide and self-injury content detection technology, please visit our Safety Center. As described in the Safety Center, our algorithms are intended to help identify potential suicide and self-injury content and are not intended to diagnose or treat any mental health or other condition.\r\n\r\nOriginally published on September 10, 2018 at 6:00AM PT:\r\n\r\nAround the world, a death by suicide occurs every 40 seconds and is the second-leading cause of death for 15- to 29-year-olds. In the US, nearly 45,000 people take their life every year.\r\n\r\nWhen someone is expressing thoughts of suicide, it’s important to get them help as quickly as possible. Because friends and family are connected through Facebook, we can help a person in distress get in touch with people who can support them. For years, people have had the ability to report Facebook posts that they feel indicate someone is thinking about suicide. This flags the posts for review by trained members of our Community Operations team, who can connect the poster with support resources if needed.\r\n\r\nLast year, we began to use machine learning to expand our ability to get timely help to people in need. This tool uses signals to identify posts from people who might be at risk, such as phrases in posts and concerned comments from friends and family.\r\n\r\nActually getting a computer to recognize suicidal expression, however, was a complex exercise in analyzing human nuance. One of the biggest challenges the team faced was that so many phrases that might indicate suicidal intent — “kill,” “die,” “goodbye” — are commonly used in other contexts. A human being might recognize that “I have so much homework I want to kill myself” is not a genuine cry of distress, but how do you teach a computer that kind of contextual understanding? Until the team managed to solve that problem, the machine learning model caught too many harmless false positives to be a useful filter for the human review team.\r\n\r\nTo train a machine learning classifier, you need to feed it tons of examples, both of what you\'re trying to identify (positive examples) as well as what you\'re not trying to identify (negative examples), so that the classifier learns to distinguish patterns between the two. (Check out the first video on this page for more on this concept.) Usually, you want thousands or even millions of examples in both categories. But when it comes to Facebook posts that contain suicidal expressions, the team had, thankfully, relatively few positive examples to work from. That sparse data set was dwarfed by the negative examples — that is, the entire universe of Facebook text posts that were not suicidal expressions. This imbalance only made the context challenge harder.\r\n\r\nThe team\'s big breakthrough was the realization that they had a smaller and more precise set of negative examples: the set of Facebook posts that people had flagged as potentially containing thoughts of suicide, but which the trained Community Operations reviewers determined did not demonstrate a person at risk of committing self-harm. This set of negative examples contained a lot of the ""I have so much homework I want to kill myself"" type, which led to more precise training of the classifiers on accurate suicidal expressions.\r\n\r\n“The smaller data set helped us develop a much more nuanced understanding of what is a suicidal pattern and what isn’t,” says Dan Muriello, an engineer on the team that produced the tools.\r\n\r\nThe text of the post is only one factor the algorithm examines to determine whether a post should be flagged for review. It also looks at comments left on the post. Here, too, there is linguistic nuance to consider — posts that reviewers determined were serious cases of people in imminent harm tended to have comments like, “Tell me where you are” or “Has anyone heard from him/her?” while potentially less-urgent posts had comments more along the lines of “Call anytime” or “I’m here for you.” Day and time of the original posting are factors, as well, as experts say the early hours of the morning and Sundays, when the workweek looms, can be common times for contemplating suicide.\r\n\r\nEven with the introduction of these AI-fueled detection efforts, people are still core to Facebook\'s success around suicide prevention. That’s why anyone who flags a potential cry for help is shown support options, including resources for help and ways to connect with loved ones.  And whether a post is reported by a concerned friend or family member or identified via machine learning, the next steps in the process remain the same. A trained member of Facebook\'s Community Operations team reviews it to determine if the person is at risk — and if so, the original poster is shown support options, such as prompts to reach out to a friend and help-line phone numbers.

Artificial intelligence helps track down mysterious cosmic radio bursts

										 by 										 University of California - Berkeley







                Breakthrough Listen researchers used artificial intelligence to search through radio signals recorded from a fast radio burst, capturing many more than humans could. They are using a similar algorithm to search for new kinds of candidate signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. Credit: Breakthrough Listen image
             

Artificial intelligence is invading many fields, most recently astronomy and the search for intelligent life in the universe, or SETI.





Researchers at Breakthrough Listen, a SETI project led by the University of California, Berkeley, have now used machine learning to discover 72 new fast radio bursts from a mysterious source some 3 billion light years from Earth.
Fast radio bursts are bright pulses of radio emission mere milliseconds in duration, thought to originate from distant galaxies. The source of these emissions is still unclear, however. Theories range from highly magnetized neutron stars blasted by gas streams from a nearby supermassive black hole, to suggestions that the burst properties are consistent with signatures of technology developed by an advanced civilization.
""This work is exciting not just because it helps us understand the dynamic behavior of fast radio bursts in more detail, but also because of the promise it shows for using machine learning to detect signals missed by classical algorithms,"" said Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and principal investigator for Breakthrough Listen, the initiative to find signs of intelligent life in the universe.
Breakthrough Listen is also applying the successful machine-learning algorithm to find new kinds of signals that could be coming from extraterrestrial civilizations.
While most fast radio bursts are one-offs, the source here, FRB 121102, is unique in emitting repeated bursts. This behavior has drawn the attention of many astronomers hoping to pin down the cause and the extreme physics involved in fast radio bursts.






The AI algorithms dredged up the radio signals from data were recorded over a five-hour period on Aug. 26, 2017, by the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. An earlier analysis of the 400 terabytes of data employed standard computer algorithms to identify 21 bursts during that period. All were seen within one hour, suggesting that the source alternates between periods of quiescence and frenzied activity, said Berkeley SETI postdoctoral researcher Vishal Gajjar.
UC Berkeley Ph.D. student Gerry Zhang and collaborators subsequently developed a new, powerful machine-learning algorithm and reanalyzed the 2017 data, finding an additional 72 bursts not detected originally. This brings the total number of detected bursts from FRB 121102 to around 300 since it was discovered in 2012.
""This work is only the beginning of using these powerful methods to find radio transients,"" said Zhang. ""We hope our success may inspire other serious endeavors in applying machine learning to radio astronomy.""
Zhang's team used some of the same techniques that internet technology companies use to optimize search results and classify images. They trained an algorithm known as a convolutional neural network to recognize bursts found by the classical search method used by Gajjar and collaborators, and then set it loose on the dataset to find bursts that the classical approach missed.
The results have helped put new constraints on the periodicity of the pulses from FRB 121102, suggesting that the pulses are not received with a regular pattern, at least if the period of that pattern is longer than about 10 milliseconds. Just as the patterns of pulses from pulsars have helped astronomers constrain computer models of the extreme physical conditions in such objects, the new measurements of FRBs will help figure out what powers these enigmatic sources, Siemion said.
""Whether or not FRBs themselves eventually turn out to be signatures of extraterrestrial technology, Breakthrough Listen is helping to push the frontiers of a new and rapidly growing area of our understanding of the Universe around us,"" he added.
The new results are described in an article accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal and available for download from the Breakthrough Listen website.

My background is in design thinking, not data science, and these six analogies have been helpful for me when think about AI in a meaningful way. A fancy thing labeler machine The way AI is talked about today is mostly relating what is actually machine learning. Cassie Kozyrkov, Googles Chief Decision Scientist, calls machine learning a . And thats a very grounding and comforting way to think about it. We teach the machine to label things like apples and pears by showing many examples of fruit to train on. Thats very graspable.

Machine learning will replace all labeling work inte the same way. No more need to manually and repeatedly identifying, categorizing and sorting things. We can expect to uptake of this technology happen rapidly because most human don’t prefer to do repetitive work. A took 7000 pictures of cucumbers that his mother had manually sorted and built and trained a machine to sort them automatically based on this technology. Japanese farmer And Island of drunk people Because we rarely understand the underlying mechanics of how the fancy thing labeling machine works we have to be good at testing that the decided outcomes are what we expect. recently spoke about this at and had a another great analogy for how to think about this. Cassie Kozyrkov SthlmTechFest You have a friend that has and island with numerous of drunk inhabitants with connected laptops. They have all the free time in the world and are all very willing to do things but don’t respond to any detailed written instructions so you have to give them examples. This means it’s a pain to spend time teaching them if you have a one-off task, so you focus instead on the repetitive drudgery you’d like to cut out of your life. But wait! Before you offload all your work to this island, consider: How drunk are these people? Can they even do your task? Don’t just blindly trust them with important work. Force them to earn your trust by checking that they actually perform your task well enough. According to Cassie you’re not ready to dive into a serious machine learning project until you are in possession of a document that outlines: What does it mean to do your task correctly? Which mistakes are worse than which other mistakes?

Aracna A useful pet or spider web is working to bring human-centered on-device AI to Hardware and was recently talking at in Stockholm about AI as tiny minds in octopus, hawks and spiders. We are so obsessed that AI will be some sort of human form interaction like the voice in the movie , but basically we are already seeing big change because the technology is small and cheap and working in decentralized processors. So Matt sugest we think of AI as companion species with different intelligence than ours. This distributed team work suggest other sorts of relationships. Sentient AI spiders could be offloading their cognition to a web that would be intuitively graspable for us in its surrounding.

In the movie Swedish philosopher reaches out his arms as far as he can and says that we perceive the intelligence gap between the village idiot and Einstein as far apart as we can imagine. It’s the entire spectrum in which we judge intelligence. He then holds his fingers together and says, it’s really this: a very very small distance on the axel of intelligence.

The sea level represents the current level of AI capabilities, so you might want to avoid careers in the waterfront that will soon be taken over by the water elevation. How high will the water be raising? When will it cover every mountain top of human knowledge so that we have a artificial general intelligence?

AI-first companies like facebook and google is looking back at you with years of self images, questions and thousands of data points in terms of likes and other interactions. It’s a strange mirror with a kind of memory that gives you an x-ray into your self image. When the AI in this mirror is making me feel seen, it’s doing me a service in the maintenance of being human, which is to tell my story. The more limbic resonance in us, the more engagement. We really like being mirrored! There is a loopiness to this because it’s self reinforcing and therefor giving rise to phenomenons such as and saturated in our egos. filter bubbles biases In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference.Douglas Hofstadter, p.363 I Am a Strange Loop I Am a Strange Loop is a 2007 book by , examining in depth the concept of a to explain the sense of “I”. Basically stating that analogy as the core of cognition and understanding. Any sufficiently complex system of analogy such as number theory can give rise to a self mirroring/referencing “strange loop” effect. Douglas Hofstadter strange loop The key thought experiment in the mirror analogy is to think about what distorsion the AI mirror possesses so that we can understand the subsequent strange loops it will cause in our self image. In extension this is the idea that “I” is distributed over numerous system, rather than being limited to precisely one brain. If these other systems are distorted by limited data from only men in western religions we will se a great bias in the system and as a consequence in our “I”. The normative psychological effect high and low involvement mediums is well documented since stated that the medium is the message in the 1960s.

            Some of the earliest surviving cave art depicts images in the purest sense: pigment marks around the stencil of an outstretched human hand. 
    

            Examples like this have been found across the world – at sites in Indonesia, Argentina and France, among others – dating back as far as 39,000 B.C. They’re the breathtaking first examples of what we humans, even in the 21st century, still think of as art – acts of material-shaping, image-making and self-representation.

            Creativity is something we closely associate with what it means to be human. But with digital technology now enabling machines to recognize, learn from and respond to humans and the world – from digital assistants to driverless cars – an inevitable question follows: Can machines be creative? And will artificial intelligence ever be able to make art?

            Artists since the 1960s have persistently explored how computers might produce art independently of humans. Pioneers like the Hungarian Vera Molnár created the first code-based drawing programs. In the 80s and 90s, the British artist William Latham applied principles from genetics and evolution in simulators that would ‘evolve’ animated, organic sculptural forms without human direction.
    




How to put a price tag on virtual reality artworks 




            But with the accelerating pace of research into artificial cognition backed up by vast computing power, and science’s growing interest in neural networks and deep machine learning, the idea that computers might truly “create” works of art has gained currency. 
    

            After Spotify stirred controversy by promoting obscure or pseudonymous artists who create generic music for playlists such as “Peaceful Piano” or “Ambient Chill,” technology writer David Pogue asked, “Why couldn’t Spotify, or any music service, start using AI to generate free music to save itself money?” Pogue noted Spotify’s telling hire of AI researcher François Pachet, who, at Sony, had been working on AI software that writes music.
    

            Elsewhere, the art market website Artnet reported earlier in the year that a Parisian art collector had bought an image “made by artificial intelligence” – or rather, created using a computer program by Obvious, a French art collective whose strapline is “creativity is not only for humans.” The software “trained” itself using a set of historical paintings for reference, before producing an image that resembles an 18th-century portrait, though it is itself entirely new.
    



La Comtesse de Belamy






            What lies behind this – and many other – recent art experiments is the use of “generative adversarial networks” (GANs). GANs are “neural networks” that teach themselves through their own experimentation, rather than being programmed by humans. Put simply, these systems involve two programs, one of which holds a database of something real (in this instance, pictures of old paintings) while the other produces images that try to “fool” the first into thinking that they constitute an example of what it knows. Gradually, the second program develops ever-more convincing (but completely invented) images in the “style” of the database examples.
    




Google Tilt Brush: Impossible now a reality?




            In an important example of GANs’ use in art, researchers at New Jersey’s Rutgers University last year published results of a study in which their machines tried to create images that humans would think of as plausible enough to be real artworks from history. (The most convincing results were, perhaps unsurprisingly, images that looked like contemporary abstract paintings.)
    

        Defining originality


            It could be argued that the ability of machines to learn what things look like, and then make convincing new examples, marks the advent of “creative” AI. After all, if we enjoy a piece of music or artwork, why should it be disturbing to know that it was entirely machine-made? Isn’t the pleasure or the interest we derive from it proof enough?

            In George Orwell’s classic dystopian novel “1984,” the masses are entertained with songs made by a machine called a versificator that are “composed without any human intervention whatever.” Perhaps not dissimilarly, big data is today used to analyze what viewers and listeners most want to see and hear.
    

            Netflix famously commissioned “House of Cards” based on its own data, which suggested that viewers who liked the original UK series also liked films directed by David Fincher and those starring Kevin Spacey. YouTubers busily churn out videos in direct response to the search patterns of Internet users. And with companies like Microsoft developing programs that can generate realistic images based on users’ descriptions of what they want to see, the idea of virtual creators making culture that humans want to consume seems to be edging ever-closer.

            Some commentators and futurists have concluded that, eventually, we’ll no longer need human artists. But the current excitement around “creative” machines – those making artworks that could once only be made by humans – barely gets to grips with the question of how artistic originality really works.

            Machines have, it is true, been able to invent new works. Nothing exactly like them exists, so they’re “new” in some basic sense. But what machines produce is only really a sophisticated variation on an established corpus of pre-existing art. Moreover, this approach to inventiveness has been based in human-centered evaluation and judgment – it’s us who confirm whether the work is “good” or “bad.” Yes, captcha, this is an image of a bridge.
    




This new virtual reality tool could transform how we design cars 




            And yet, originality in art – real creativity – isn’t about confirming what has already been done, but about doing something differently and for a reason. What characterizes human originality is intentional difference. Human artists have always had reasons for trying to make something new – thoughts, criticisms, frustrations, passions, insights, hopes, ideals and all kinds of other motives. Newness, if not merely some random output we just happen to like, is the result of an artist intending to do something differently. And what is critical in that intention are the reasons for it.
    

        Art needs a reason


            A century ago, artist Marcel Duchamp decided it was no longer interesting to make artworks the way they had always been made. Instead he chose an ordinary object (in this case, a urinal) and presented it as “Fountain.” His reasons for doing so have vexed and inspired critics, artists and the public ever since.
    




Virtual reality just got (more) interesting 




            Duchamp’s reasons were, in part, to do with abandoning the tired, conventional wisdom that assumed art had to look like a certain kind of object. He decided to think differently about what an artwork could be, though his rationale took another 50 years to be accepted. Even today, people still profoundly disagree with his motives. Originality lies in questioning the reasons for what has become commonplace, and Duchamp was not trying to generate the most “likes” for his work. No machine has thus far chosen not to make art.

            What Duchamp’s originality outlines is the way human creativity works as part of a culture’s conversation with itself about what things are and the way we give them value. An artist presents a work and says, “What do you think of this?” The audience may like it or not like it, but more than this, humans argue over the value of what the artist has made. That’s how all art criticism starts out. Liking something isn’t enough to make it good. With the development of machine learning, it’s as if machines are getting better at asking, “Do you like this?” and yet, machines cannot yet answer why we like what they make – and have no reason to make it for themselves.
    

            The outline of a hand on a cave seems to say, “We are here.” Looking at their own hand-prints on the rock, early humans must have been aware that they had creatively changed their world, and by making a mark on it, were aware of themselves by doing so. If machines achieve the same thing, it probably won’t be through making images for humans to like. It will be the moment that an algorithm, or an artificial neural network, shows to itself that it exists.
    

            What will the digital equivalent of the hand’s outline on the rock look like? Well, like nothing we’ve ever seen.

Robots with minds of their own, bad guys manipulating data, and getting sorely outpaced by the Chinese. Those are just a few concerns shared by leaders tasked with weaving machine learning into military operations.
Exactly how artificial intelligence will play out on the battlefield remains to be seen. Defense leaders and researchers are on the hunt for ways to free up troops' time so they can address more pressing issues.Advertisement
""How can we lighten the load for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines?"" Maj. Gen. William Cooley, head of the Air Force Research Laboratory, asked during a Wednesday conference hosted by Defense News. ""How can AI make us more efficient, effective and capable?""
Think more computers sifting through complex data instead of an officer having to assess it, or technology that can recognize preventative maintenance needs on troops' equipment.
There are plenty of challenges that come along with using artificial intelligence, though. Here are just a few worries they shared about machines doing the thinking for troops.Advertisement
 
1. Killer robots.
We might be a ways off from a ""Terminator""-style nightmare in which a self-thinking computer wages war on the planet. But as the military experiments with more autonomous vehicles and robots, experts are thinking about ways to keep them in check.
Balancing the desire to make life easier for the warfighter while protecting humans from machines is an ""incredibly difficult"" topic, said Rear Adm. David Hahn, chief of naval research and director of Innovation, Technology Requirements and Test and Evaluation. What's important to remember, he added, is that accepting some risk and knowingly taking a gamble are two very different things.
 
2. More machines, fewer humans making decisions.
Warfare will always involve human beings, said Alexander Kott, chief scientist with the Army Research Laboratory. One of his lab's key efforts is thinking about how humans and artificial intelligence can best fight as a team.
Researchers first need to think about what's best done by a machine versus a human, Cooley added.
""How can we apply these tools to a more unpredictable environment to safeguard humans so they're in control, but they have help?"" he said.
 
3. Bad or tainted data.
A lot of machine-based-learning software used in the civilian world is open source, which means lots of different people can affect the artificial intelligence. In the military where national security risks are at stake, that approach isn't likely to work.
Kott called data the ""greatest challenge in terms of applying artificial intelligence in the military.""
""There's not enough of it, it's distorted, it's dynamic, it's rapidly changing,"" he said. ""Data can and will be used against you.""
That not only means they need to be clever about how they teach artificial intelligence to work using limited data, but also how to protect that data being manipulated by an adversary.
 
4. Limited platforms.
Another limitation the military faces is having to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into some of its complex existing platforms. It's not always feasible for the U.S. military to design entirely new systems built just for AI capabilities -- especially something with complicated security needs.
""The legacy systems we start with are significantly different than those our adversaries start with,"" Hahn said.
 
5. The next space race.
There's a global power competition happening in artificial intelligence. China has openly declared AI to be the next space race, Hahn said. And the country plans on winning that race.
That means the military must look to industry and academic experts who can help the services build capabilities rapidly, Cooley said. Countries like China don't deal with the rigid contract structures and other rules that can slow the developmental process significantly.
""We must be innovative and change the dynamic of how we're going to get at this or we're not going to get the capability for the U.S. military,"" he said.

In fact, Google has retained the motto, but only in one place, at the very end of its code.We can quibble about the details, but what is clear is that not being evil has become a lower level priority at the algorithmic powerhouse. Revelations that Google is lending its artificial intelligence services to enhance the targeting capabilities of the military’s flying killer robots gave support to these concerns. Even Silicon Valley elites have to admit that the phrase “flying killer robots” does have a bit of an evilish tone to it.This week, Google’s un-evil pretensions further eroded, when the tech giant’s CEO Larry Page refused to show up to answer questions from the U.S. Senate about digital industry abuses. This act of indifference to American democracy followed news that Google is arranging, through a nefarious partnership with Mastercard, to spy on users’ activities even when they’re completely offline.Google’s new unofficial motto seems to be: Who Is To Say What Is Evil, Really?In ordinary conditions, it’s not necessary for companies to openly declare that they will not be evil. We take it for granted that businesses, though they may be amoral, will at least try not to be truly wicked. The fact that Google ever even had to make it an explicit long-term goal not to be evil lets us know that moral standards in Big Tech aren’t quite as tight as they are outside of Silicon Valley.To Fear Artificial Intelligence - So Plebeian!Still, deeply invested experts continue to pooh-pooh people’s concerns about Dominant Digital’s development of increasingly powerful AI. They advise us that our fears of artificial intelligence are inconvenient irrational obstacles, getting in the way of what could be a beautiful transhumanist revolution. When J. Bradford DeLong of the National Bureau of Economic Research warns that, “It is unhelpful to stoke fears about the rise of the robots,” one wonders exactly who he thinks is being helped by uncritical acceptance of the rosy forecasts issued by algorithmic juggernauts.Perhaps critical examination and regulation of artificial intelligence would be unhelpful to the upper echelon of people who tend to rub elbows at conferences on the digital future. They come from positions of entitlement in business and society in general that bias them in favor of the grand disruptive schemes of the tech industry. What financial elites regard as unhelpful, others will consider essential.It’s easy to forget, as predictions of the glorious future of transhumanist utopias flow freely from Silicon Valley, that nobody writing about the future of artificial intelligence really knows what’s going to happen. They’re just guessing, and whenever people write about the future, their biases emerge at their strongest. This truth applies even to tech gurus. So, if we’re going to talk about the future of AI, let’s agree to put the facts aside. When people talk about the future, they’re giving voice to their emotions — and there’s nothing wrong with that.Trending AI Articles:1. From Perceptron to Deep Neural Nets2. Neural networks for solving differential equations3. Turn your Raspberry Pi into homemade Google Home4. AI & NLP WorkshopAnalysts who consider only the immediately available data about the practical impact of artificial intelligence are missing the point that AI is as much a mythological innovation as it is a technological development. Outwardly, the fears people have about artificial intelligence take on a practical tone, because we all sense that practical concerns are more likely to be taken seriously. Functional apprehensions are, however, merely a socially-acceptable mask that conceals deeper, metaphorical concerns.Whether people’s fears about artificial intelligence are justified or not, the fears exist, and will therefore significantly impact the implementation of AI technology. History makes it plain that logical arguments are ineffective at dispelling fundamental cultural concerns. So, Instead of dismissing people’s fears as uninformed, the rational thing for Silicon Valley to do is to try learning from those fears.The time has come for the tech titans to learn to face their demons.Elon Musk’s DemonsThe comparison of artificial intelligence to a demon was famously made by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. He warned, “I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and he’s like — Yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.”Elon Musk is not alone in his apprehensions of the digital. Futurist Gerd Leonhard brings up the demonic metaphor for the digital world when he talks about the “faustian bargain between us and Facebook”. Nikarika Singh asks, “Are we creating a digital satan?” while Forbes asks, “Have marketers struck a devil’s bargain with AI?”The meme of artificial-intelligence-as-diabolical-fiend is too common to be random. So, let’s play around with this idea. What if AI were to be a demon? What kind of demon might it be?Literal DemonsThere is the simple through-and-through evil demon, of course, whose job is merely to torture human beings as much as possible, without relief.Perhaps artificial intelligence is a changeling, replacing what we thought was a human with an uncanny replica.Alternatively, AI might be a succubus, seducing us and crushing us in the night, paralyzing us by placing us into an in-between state of mind in which we are somewhat aware, but not fully conscious and in control of our own bodies… and distracting us with Internet porn.AI could be a djinn, tempting us with the dangerous fulfillment of our wishes, making us wish we had never rubbed that lamp.Maybe, though, AI could become like a daemon from Philip Pullman’s fantasy series of novels, His Dark Materials, serving as a kind of outward companion, to reflect our essential character, along with the thoughts and feelings that we ordinarily hide from outselves. That’s a more hopeful vision.Metaphorical DemonsAlong the lines of Philip Pullman’s daemons, it may be more helpful to think of the demon status of artificial intelligence metaphorically. As to what might the AI demon might be a metaphorical representation for, the most obvious choice is our own dark human nature.Carol and Dinah Mack, in their Field Guide to Demons, Vampires, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits, point out that the disturbing features we confront in the form of demons are often nothing other than exaggerations of our own flaws. “Demons are personifications of our own passions, impulses and desires, lurking about in the dark, hidden terrain of our unconscious, and their habits hold profund insights into the nature of our minds,” they write.From this perspective, the demons of AI reflect our human anxieties and ambitions, as much as the technological reality of what we’re likely to face in the near future. AI is a way for us to talk about ourselves, while appearing to talk about machines. As much as it is a technology, artificial intelligence is a cultural phenomenon.As a human construction, artificial intelligence ought to subject to the regulation of human governments, but such a practical, legal approach won’t get to the heart of the matter. Rational reassurance from tech experts will also be insufficient to allay our fears. AI apologists who only speak to the literal, functional concerns people express will satisfy themselves and justify industry insiders, but will convince few others of the validity of their positions. We need tools of cultural management to deal with the more subjective forms of terror artificial intelligence presents.Culturally, demons are often demoted and frustrated gods. They were once revered in their own right, until they came along and were replaced by cultural updates. Isn’t that just the kind of frustration that many people are feeling right now, about the status they’ve lost during the upheaval of the digital revolution, and it’s threatened next step? Economically, the advent of the Internet only enriched a small elite, leaving the rest of us struggling against each other for a smaller piece of the pie than what we had before.Expressing fear of artificial intelligence could therefore be a means for expressing fear of the human beings who are developing artificial intelligence. If a demon is a powerful being who seems to delight in torturing people, is it too far of a stretch to say that many people now place tech executives like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos among the demonic hordes?AI exists in what Grant McCracken refers to as a zone of displaced meaning — a conceptual space where cultures locate the anxieties that they are incapable of dealing directly. It may be too emotionally challenging for us to grapple with the reality that we feel tortured by the very digital services we choose to interact with.The demonology of artificial intelligence is multivocal and ambiguous, which only amplifies our fear. When we speak of artificial intelligence, we aren’t typically talking about what exists right now. Rather, we refer to what we believe will soon exist. Of course, the future, even the near future, is unknowable.Anthropologist Victor Turner observed that, culturally, “The unclear is the unclean.” Artificial intelligence is not merely terrifying, but culturally contaminated when it takes place in a black box we cannot understand. If this is the case, as much as we need need regulation of artificial intelligence, we also need to develop rituals of decontamination.There are many ways to design decontamination rituals, but the one thing they all share is the creation of clear separation, of boundaries that unclean things cannot cross. Already, primitive forms of artificial intelligence such as Amazon’s Alexa are crossing boundaries in defiance of cultural norms, often without the permission of people using digital services.If the tycoons of Silicon Valley want to recast their artificial intelligence ambitious as more divine and less demonic, they’re going to need to accept the existence of AI-free zones, places where people can gain refuge from the swarm of “assistants” that are always listening, always watching, always helping themselves to whatever bits of our lives can be most profitable to their infernal masters.",,https://becominghuman.ai/a-demonology-of-artificial-intelligence-7de76284c719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Jonathan Cook'],,,2018-09-10T13:46:13.535Z,,,,,,,,,7de76284c719,,,,,

Amelia's ability to learn, interact and improve over time makes her the market's only AI that can fully understand user needs and intentions. Amelia can be trained to recognize words and phrases in more than 100 languages. She delivers real-life business benefits including lower operating costs, higher customer satisfaction and increased employee productivity. When a company hires Amelia (or several Amelias) they'll be able to design her to address a variety of company needs, roles, and verticals—all according to their specific business processes and procedures. She observes, learns, and remembers anything you ask. She can read emotions and context during conversations with colleagues and customers, on any communications channel. She can do the repetitive work of thousands while helping to improve the creativity and productivity of her human colleagues..IPsoft was the first company to launch an end-to-end digital platform, 1Desk, to deliver shared enterprise services. By connecting front-office conversations to back-end systems, IPsoft automates business processes that serve employees, customers and citizens, resulting in rapid resolutions, satisfied users and substantial organizational savings..IPsoft solutions such as Amelia Marketplace and 1Desk make it even easier for organizations to put Amelia to work. The Marketplace offers out of the box capabilities for Amelia across verticals such as banking, telecom, hospitality, insurance and healthcare, allowing Amelia to help perform tasks in a more efficient and affordable way. Marketplace provides faster and more immediate assistance to Amelia for customers, while eliminating minor, repetitive tasks from human employees, allowing them to focus on more complicated issues. Similarly, 1Desk helps companies scale their deployment of Amelia by connecting her cognitive abilities with internal systems to fully automate end to end processes in IT and HR. Both these products help integrate digital colleagues into the workforce to help employees focus on creative tasks that help accelerate innovation..The Mission to Power Industries with Intelligent Systems.IPsoft's mission is to power the world with intelligent systems, eliminate routine work and free human talent to focus on creating value through innovation..Within a few years of its founding, IPsoft established a presence in India providing remote IT infrastructure managed services and shortly thereafter opened its first European outpost in London. As growth continued to accelerate, new offices followed. First in California then Amsterdam and beyond. In 2009 alone, IPsoft opened its Frankfurt, Austin, Chicago and Stockholm offices and expanded its New York and Bangalore offices. More recently, IPsoft entered the Asia-Pacific region, opening offices in Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney..In 2014, following 15 years of development, IPsoft launched Amelia, the first cognitive agent to interact like a human. Amelia opened a new chapter in IPsoft's growth and placed IPsoft at the forefront of a technology-enabled revolution that promises to change how we live and work forever: the age of the Smart Machine..Exemplary Leadership.Chetan Dube, IPsoft's Founder and CEO, believed that the IT infrastructure and business operations of the future would be managed not by people but by expert systems. Twenty years ago, he left the world of academia, at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, to pursue a career in business. He was haunted by the question; &quot;If machines could think, what kind of world would that make possible for and what higher forms of creative expression would that allow for in humans?&quot; Out of that idea, Amelia was born..Pioneering Innovation and Disruption in Cognitive AI.IPsoft's Amelia is constantly reinventing the user experience and defining the next generation of intelligent AI – when customers or employees interact with Amelia, they don't feel they are interacting with something artificial due to her advanced empathetic abilities, capacity to switch context and channels, and intelligent response. Amelia is the only digital colleague on the market that offers all of these features with expert-level accuracy and emotional intelligence..IPsoft has an industry expertise that has allowed 6 of top 10 global banks advance in cognitive AI. IPsoft serves more than 550 of the world's leading brands directly, including more than half of the world's largest IT services providers. To name a few, these brands including Allstate, Black Rock, SEB and Credit Suisse..Delivering Intelligent Automation with Super Efficiency .&quot;Every day we apply ourselves to transforming our clients' IT and business operations for competitive advantage. Through a combination of our technology platforms and our services, IPsoft guarantees predictable business benefits through intelligent automation,&quot; said Chetan..Both Marketplace and 1Desk use automation to help reduce inefficiencies and free employees' time and resources to focus their energy on more creative tasks to accelerate innovation. By using AI to handle repetitive tasks, employees are empowered to take on more creative work that adds overall business value and supports strategic goals..&quot;According to McKinsey, the impact of AI technologies on business is projected to increase labor productivity by up to 40% and enable people to make more efficient use of their time. Executives are even more optimistic – 80% believe artificial intelligence improves worker performance and creates jobs, he mentioned&quot;..Recognitions for Driving Business Excellence.Today, Amelia is helping Credit Suisse serve 76,000 users in 40 countries, by augmenting human intelligence. Whilst at Allstate, Amelia has been trained on more than 50 unique insurance topics and regulations across 50 states in the US. Amelia is reducing the complexity for customer service representatives who handle over 250,000 monthly calls by giving them better and quicker access to information policies and procedures – blending human intelligence and problem-solving with technology, as she also constantly learns from her human co-workers..In 2017, the customer-facing IPsoft Amelia implementation at SEB, leading corporate bank in the Nordics, was awarded with the Supernova Award by Constellation Research, highlighting the bank's cutting-edge use of cognitive tech for internal and external services. In Amelia's first three weeks, over 4,000 conversations were held with 700 employees, and she solved the majority of issues without delay. Amelia has also helped SEB avoid 544 hours of escalations to customer support with an average handle time of six minutes and an 80 to 85 percent accuracy in immediate recognition of user intent..From Challenges to Value Creation.The IPsoft mission is to challenge the widespread idea that &quot;robots&quot; will take over our human jobs and make us unnecessary, but in fact, the employment of digital colleagues will actually create new jobs that involve new skill sets such as roles that focus on the creation, maintenance and performance improvement of virtual agents. For instance, top performing human agents might become escalation managers, working alongside virtual agents to ensure KPIs are aligned across the digital and human workforce and steering teams towards new goals on an ongoing basis..The Future Ahead.Chetan said tomorrow's success is not going to be dependent on &quot;hard work&quot; but rather &quot;smart work&quot;, and it will be reliant on transdisciplinary collaboration and the ability to incorporate advanced technologies in differentiated ways. This human-AI collaboration will allow humans to gain more technical skills, while simultaneously improving the sophistication and efficiency of digital agents. IPsoft enables that journey for any company of any size, across the world..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI art is on the rise – but how do we measure its success?

In the essay ‘Art in the Time of the Artificial’ (1998), Frieder Nake, a pioneer of computer-generated art, describes the bewilderment surrounding Georg Nees’s works at the first exhibition of computer art in Stuttgart in 1965. Uneasy questions confronted Nees’s drawings, created using a plotter following a programmed pattern to generate geometrical figures – was this authentic art? Who should be considered its author? We still appear to be asking the same questions today; the image itself is often outweighed by the process that constructs it.
In a moment when the information we consume and our patterns of digital behaviour are largely influenced by algorithmic processes, why does AI (artificial intelligence) art still confound us? Perhaps because the algorithmic image as aesthetic object takes us beyond the capacity of AI as a functional tool, turning it into a medium itself. The more interesting question might not be about who creates the art but why we consider it to be art in the first place. How do we surpass the obsession with whether AI art can convince us of its humanness and instead consider its larger implications on what we value as creativity? Unfortunately, the commercial positioning of AI art still emphasises spectacle and kitsch.

So, when ‘Gradient Descent’, an exhibition at Nature Morte gallery in New Delhi (until 15 September) presented itself as ‘the first ever art exhibition in India to include artwork made entirely by artificial intelligence’, I was slightly wary. The exhibition, curated by the research collective 64/1, brings together coders and artists like Mario Klingemann, Memo Akten, Tom White and Anna Ridler, for a mini-survey of the visual possibilities of neural-network AI, which seeks to recreate the mechanics of cognition in the human brain. Klingemann, probably the most recognisable of the group, has been building these kinds of programmes for years, which he ‘trains’ on massive amounts of visual data to eventually create an output that, in the work on view here, continually merges his own webcam self-portraits with those of Old Masters. The video is titled 79530 Self Portraits: each successive image mutates to integrate the previous one at a giddy pace, facial features floating in a distorted, Baconesque world.
Tom White’s Perception Engines project plays with classification systems and idioms of abstraction. His radial, blob-like prints, produced by feeding procedural algorithmic drawings through another algorithm, bring the AI into conversation with itself, a complex mimesis of dialogue that almost approaches what human creativity might look like in the mirror of artificial intelligence. London-based Jake Elwes takes this dialogue further in Closed Loop, a two-channel video from 2017 that distills the circuitry of perception. An indistinct, pastel image, created by training a generative neural network on 14.2 million photographs, appears on one screen while words, similarly drawn from a huge dataset, assemble as a descriptive response on the other. The image then slowly reconfigures to match the language in an exchange that is both intimate and enthralling – and observing it vaguely voyeuristic.

These works push the limits of vision, delineating how we tend to assign meaning to an art object, and bringing into question the possibility of a kind of creative production that can exist outside the human framework, or as an extension of it. Elsewhere, however, ‘Gradient Descent’ gets tangled in the final product and the shock of the machine, with artworks that self-consciously remind us that they were created using AI. Memo Akten’s Deep Meditations (2018) falls into this trap. Using photographs from Flickr and the Google Art Archive, the work is an interesting demonstration of style transfer – where the machine learns the template of one (or in this case, tens of thousands of) images and blends this into a new image – at work, but is a hollow display of AI’s most basic capabilities.
The gallery has valid commercial reasons for this curatorial farrago, with the rapid rise of financial interest in and visibility of AI art over the last couple of years. This autumn, Christie’s will become the first auction house to sell an algorithmic work. IBM and Google have invested millions into labs to explore the creative capabilities of neural networks. Last year, MoMA looked back to the beginnings of machine-made art with the exhibition ‘Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959–1989’, while the Grand Palais in Paris recently concluded its vast, immersive exhibition on ‘Artists & Robots’.

However, this fascination with the final image and the complex functionalities of AI can often make us forget the viewer in the process. As critic Mike Pepi put it in Frieze: ‘Art, after all, is little more than institutionalized agreement among one or more subjects to call something as such […] Its only unifying property, then, are its human subjects.’ How can AI art transcend this agreement, and bring the viewer into its fold in more meaningful ways?
At an exhibition of new media art at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, located a few kilometres from Nature Morte, I saw two such works that attempted to do exactly this. Sonia Khurana’s imposing House Anatomy (vertical spin) (2014), a stack of screens playing a loop of ant colonies moving in algorithmic patterns. The viewer’s body is brought into sharp contrast with the pictures onscreen, creating an agitated experience of scale. In Nandita Kumar’s Emotive Sounds of the Electric Writer project (2013–15), viewers were invited to write letters that were converted into inkblots, in turn fed through an algorithm that transformed them into a musical score. Kumar’s work thus considers the multisensorial implications of digital and analogue forms of correspondence, keeping the human at the centre of its technology.
AI art is at a precipice, where we are still largely uncertain about its role as tool, medium, or independent creative entity. The acceptance of AI will be contingent on our own dynamic understanding of changing aesthetics in the digital age, of which spectacle may ultimately be an indelible part.

It’s now generally accepted that as artificial intelligence (AI) advances into fields of work that were formerly considered skilled labour, a huge number of manual and white collar jobs are likely to disappear. 
These are the kinds of jobs that require learning and applying patterns, unemotional calculation and mechanistic problem solving. Think: medical diagnosis, legal contracts and engineering.

      AI doctors and engineers are coming – but they won't be stealing high-skill jobs




Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins recently suggested AI will free us up to focus on the caring work uniquely suited to humans.  
Currently much care work is low paid, unpaid or invisible – and mostly done by women. It requires creativity, empathy, relationship building, and emotional and spiritual labour. I argue the advent of AI has the potential to herald a revolution in how care work is valued in society, and ensure this kind of work is spread more evenly across genders. 
Care work underpins our economy
Market democracies may prioritise economic growth, but care is at the core of what makes us human. 
Economists might assume that we are all homo economicus (individuals who maximise rational utility), but we could also be cast as homines curans (humans who care).
Political science professor Joan Tronto describes care as:

a species activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our “world” so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, ourselves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web.

Care is the work that builds and sustains this web. It’s done within families to provide the basic needs of life. It nurtures children, supports the elderly, and supplies the “emotional labour” needed to keep households going. 
But care work also happens in professional life – and not just the care professions of nursing or childcare. 
Administrative tasks that support the collective efforts of university departments are one example. Doing the dishes in the tea room is another. More important is the daily work of building community and mutual support, fostering our being-in-common.

In the home and workplace, it’s care work that attends to the social relations underpinning institutions and organisations, farms and marketplaces, offices and factory floors. Without this largely invisible and unpaid care work, the economy would not function. 
As Yale anthropologist James Ferguson notes: 

the receipt of unconditional and unearned distribution and care must always precede any productive labour.

In other words, care comes first. Without it we wouldn’t be unable to function as organisations, manage our farms, run our factories, or participate in any kind of waged labour.
Robots can’t care
Care work is not well suited to new technologies. It requires empathy.
While AI can mimic human emotions, it’s a long way off from being able to genuinely empathise. Robot empathy is based on deceit: it can make you think it cares in order to shape your emotional responses. For ethicist Rob Sparrow, that also means it’s fundamentally unethical to rely on robots to provide care.
But if AI takes over the task-based and calculative work that people now do, could the essential, largely feminised, work of care begin to be more valued? 
There are some signs this could happen.

      Women are less likely to be replaced by robots and might even benefit from automation




The business world is paying more attention to the importance of empathy in the workplace. Research reveals the diversity of contemporary economic practices beyond capitalism, and is showing us how much of our economy is reliant upon putting care first. 
Around the world, examples of community economies – livelihood practices that actively build and sustain communities rather than seeking profit – are changing economic systems. 
In academia and the not-for-profit sector, new organisational structures are being shaped around appreciation for the whole human being, with collaboration not competition as the defining mode of interaction. 
These examples demonstrate the possibility of reconfiguring our economies towards a future where an ethics of care comes first.
Lessons from the global south
As we anticipate a new definition of the uniquely human skills people bring to the workplace, it’s worth drawing on the knowledge of societies that place more value on community networks and interpersonal relationships than western culture does.  
When asked to talk about their livelihoods, gender equity and their aspirations for the future, women and men in the Pacific focus on relationships. What concerns them most is the ability to contribute to community, to share what they have, and for the different contributions of women and men to be given equal value. 
We can learn from this.

As robots and AI “take our jobs”, the care work that underpins all workplaces – and homes, and schools, and communities – ought to come to the fore. This would offer a long overdue corrective for our love affair with the rational, utility-maximising individual – and provide opportunity and motivation for more men to shoulder a greater share of the load.
Realising we are more homines curans than homo economicus gives us a chance to properly value the care work that’s at the heart of our economies.

Proponents suggest that lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWs)  might cause less “collateral damage,” while critics warn that giving machines the power of life and death would be a terrible mistake.Last month’s UN meeting on ‘killer robots’ in Geneva ended with victory for the machines, as a small number of countries blocked progress towards an international ban. Some opponents of such a ban, like Russia and Israel, were to be expected since both nations already have advanced military AI programs. But surprisingly, the U.S. also agreed with them.Picking SidesIn July, 2,400 researchers, including Elon Musk, signed a pledge not to work on robots that can attack without human oversight. Google faced a revolt by employees over an Artificial Intelligence program to help drones spot targets for the Pentagon, and decided not to continue with the work. KAIST, one of South Korea’s top universities, suffered an international academic boycott over its work on military robots until it too stopped work on them. Groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots are becoming more visible, and Paul Scharre’s book Army of None, which details the dangers of autonomous weapons, has been hugely successful.But the government’s argument is that any regulation would be premature, hindering new developments which would protect civilians. The Pentagon’s current policy is that there should always be a ‘man in the loop’ controlling any lethal system, but the submission from Washington to the recent UN meeting argued otherwise:“Weapons that do what commanders and operators intend can effectuate their intentions to conduct operations in compliance with the law of war and to minimize harm to civilians.”  So the argument is that autonomous weapons would make more selective strikes that faulty human judgements would have botched.“Most people don’t understand that these systems offer the opportunity to decide when not to fire, even when commanded by a human if it is deemed unethical,” says Professor Ron Arkin, a roboticist at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Arkin suggests that autonomous weapons would be fitted with an “ethical governor” helping to ensure they only strike legitimate targets and avoid ambulances, hospitals, and other invalid targets.Arkin has long argued for regulation rather than prohibition of LAWs. He points out that in modern warfare, precision-guided smart weapons are now seen as essential for avoiding civilian casualties. The use of unguided weapons in populated areas, like the barrel bombs dropped by the Syrian regime, looks like deliberate brutality. Smarter is better, and an autonomous system might just be better than a human one.Robotic VisionThe greatest promise for smarter machines comes from deep learning, an AI technique that feeds massive amounts of sample data to a neural network until it learns to make necessary distinctions. In principle, deep learning might help distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, valid targets and invalid ones. Arkin warns that much more research needs to be conducted before fielding them in lethal systems, but there are already systems which can outmatch humans in recognition tasks.Australian beaches are now guarded by Little Ripper quadcopter drones equipped with an AI system known as SharkSpotter developed by the University of Technology in Sydney. This automatically scans the water for sharks and alerts the human operator when it sees something dangerous. SharkSpotter can identify humans, dolphin, boats, surfboards, rays, and objects in the water and tell them apart from sharks.“The system can detect and identify around sixteen different objects with high accuracy. These advanced machine learning techniques significantly improve aerial detection accuracy to better than 90 percent,“ says UTS researcher Nabin Sharma. This compares to about 20-30 percent for a human operator looking at aerial imagery, though the SharkSpotter’s identification is still checked by a human before raising the alarm. In combat, a drone operator squinting at a screen may struggle to tell whether people on the ground are insurgents with AK-47s or farmers with spades. Arkin says humans have a tendency toward “scenario fulfillment,” or seeing what we expect to see, and ignoring contradictory data in stressful situations. This effect contributed to the accidental shooting down of an Iranian airliner by the USS Vincennes in 1987.“Robots can be developed so that they are not vulnerable to such patterns of behavior,” says Arkin.At the very least, these AI-guided weapons would be better than current ‘smart bombs’ which lack any discrimination. On August 9th a laser-guided bomb from the Saudi coalition struck a bus full of schoolchildren in Yemen, killing forty of them.“Recognition of a school bus could be relatively straightforward to implement if the bus is appropriately marked,” says Arkin. “There is no guarantee it would work under all conditions. But sometimes is better than never.”A Flaw in the MachineNoel Sharkey is professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield and chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. As a leading voice against AI weapons, he remains unconvinced that AI would be an improvement over current weapons technology.""After all of the hype about face recognition technologies, it turns out that they work really badly for women and darker shades of skin,"" says Sharkey. ""And there are many adversarial tests showing how these technologies can be easily gamed or misled.”This was demonstrated in 2017 when some MIT students found a way of fooling an image-recognition system into thinking a plastic turtle was a rifle.Today current artificial intelligence cannot make better battlefield judgements better than humans, but AI is getting smarter, and one day they could theoretically help limit the loss of innocent lives caught in the crossfire.“We cannot simply accept the current status quo with respect to noncombatant deaths,” says Arkin. “We should aim to do better.”Sharkey disagrees that autonomous weapons are the tools that will eliminate collateral damage, referencing a principle known as Marten’s clause. This clause states that ""the human person remains under the protection of the principles of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.” This means that however well machines work, they should not be  making life-and-death decisions in warfare.“A prohibition treaty is urgently needed before massive international investment goes into LAWs,” says Sharkey. With DARPA announcing a new $2 billion investment in ""next wave"" military AI, time is running out.The  U.S. decision to back the development of ‘killer robots’ is a controversial one, and the argument is far from over. But if LAWs are fielded first, we may find out the hard way which side is right. ",,,,,,,,,1083.0,,,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a23133118/us-ai-robots-warfare/,,,,

A child is presented with a picture of various shapes and is asked to find the big red circle. To come to the answer, she goes through a few steps of reasoning: First, find all the big things; next, find the big things that are red; and finally, pick out the big red thing that’s a circle.
We learn through reason how to interpret the world. So, too, do neural networks. Now a team of researchers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group has developed a neural network that performs human-like reasoning steps to answer questions about the contents of images. Named the Transparency by Design Network (TbD-net), the model visually renders its thought process as it solves problems, allowing human analysts to interpret its decision-making process. The model performs better than today’s best visual-reasoning neural networks.  
Understanding how a neural network comes to its decisions has been a long-standing challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. As the neural part of their name suggests, neural networks are brain-inspired AI systems intended to replicate the way that humans learn. They consist of input and output layers, and layers in between that transform the input into the correct output. Some deep neural networks have grown so complex that it’s practically impossible to follow this transformation process. That's why they are referred to as ""black box” systems, with their exact goings-on inside opaque even to the engineers who build them.
With TbD-net, the developers aim to make these inner workings transparent. Transparency is important because it allows humans to interpret an AI's results.
It is important to know, for example, what exactly a neural network used in self-driving cars thinks the difference is between a pedestrian and stop sign, and at what point along its chain of reasoning does it see that difference. These insights allow researchers to teach the neural network to correct any incorrect assumptions. But the TbD-net developers say the best neural networks today lack an effective mechanism for enabling humans to understand their reasoning process.
""Progress on improving performance in visual reasoning has come at the cost of interpretability,” says Ryan Soklaski, who built TbD-net with fellow researchers Arjun Majumdar, David Mascharka, and Philip Tran.
The Lincoln Laboratory group was able to close the gap between performance and interpretability with TbD-net. One key to their system is a collection of ""modules,"" small neural networks that are specialized to perform specific subtasks. When TbD-net is asked a visual reasoning question about an image, it breaks down the question into subtasks and assigns the appropriate module to fulfill its part. Like workers down an assembly line, each module builds off what the module before it has figured out to eventually produce the final, correct answer. As a whole, TbD-net utilizes one AI technique that interprets human language questions and breaks those sentences into subtasks, followed by multiple computer vision AI techniques that interpret the imagery.
Majumdar says: ""Breaking a complex chain of reasoning into a series of smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved independently and composed, is a powerful and intuitive means for reasoning.""
Each module's output is depicted visually in what the group calls an ""attention mask."" The attention mask shows heat-map blobs over objects in the image that the module is identifying as its answer. These visualizations let the human analyst see how a module is interpreting the image.   
Take, for example, the following question posed to TbD-net: “In this image, what color is the large metal cube?"" To answer the question, the first module locates large objects only, producing an attention mask with those large objects highlighted. The next module takes this output and finds which of those objects identified as large by the previous module are also metal. That module's output is sent to the next module, which identifies which of those large, metal objects is also a cube. At last, this output is sent to a module that can determine the color of objects. TbD-net’s final output is “red,” the correct answer to the question. 
When tested, TbD-net achieved results that surpass the best-performing visual reasoning models. The researchers evaluated the model using a visual question-answering dataset consisting of 70,000 training images and 700,000 questions, along with test and validation sets of 15,000 images and 150,000 questions. The initial model achieved 98.7 percent test accuracy on the dataset, which, according to the researchers, far outperforms other neural module network–based approaches.Importantly, the researchers were able to then improve these results because of their model's key advantage — transparency. By looking at the attention masks produced by the modules, they could see where things went wrong and refine the model. The end result was a state-of-the-art performance of 99.1 percent accuracy.
""Our model provides straightforward, interpretable outputs at every stage of the visual reasoning process,” Mascharka says.
Interpretability is especially valuable if deep learning algorithms are to be deployed alongside humans to help tackle complex real-world tasks. To build trust in these systems, users will need the ability to inspect the reasoning process so that they can understand why and how a model could make wrong predictions. 
Paul Metzger, leader of the Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group, says the research “is part of Lincoln Laboratory’s work toward becoming a world leader in applied machine learning research and artificial intelligence that fosters human-machine collaboration.”
The details of this work are described in the paper, “Transparency by Design: Closing the Gap Between Performance and Interpretability in Visual Reasoning,"" which was presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) this summer.

6 min readThe most common programming languages currently used for AI and machine learning development are Python, R, Scala, Go, among others with the latest addition being Julia. Functional languages as old as Lisp and Haskell were used to implement machine learning algorithms decades ago when AI was an obscure research area of interest. There wasn’t enough hardware and software advancements back them for implementations. Some commonalities in all of the above language options are that they are simple to understand and promote clarity. They use fewer lines of code and lend themselves well to the functional programming paradigm.
What is Functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming approach that uses logical functions or procedures within its programming structure. It means that the programming is done with expressions instead of statements. In a functional programming (FP) approach, computations are treated as evaluations of mathematical functions and it mostly deals with immutable data. In other words, the state of the program does not change, the functions or procedures are fixed and the output value of a function depends solely on the arguments passed to it.
Let’s look at the characteristics of a functional programming approach before we see why they are well suited for developing artificial intelligence programs.
Functional programming features
Before we see functional programming in a machine learning context, let’s look at some of its characteristics.

Immutable: If a variable x is declared and used in the program, the value of the variable is never changed later anywhere in the program. Each time the variable x is called, it will return the same value assigned originally. This makes it pretty straightforward, eliminating the need to think of state change throughout the program.
Referential transparency: This means that an expression or computation always results in the same value in any part/context of the program. A referentially transparent programming language’s programs can be manipulated as algebraic equations.
Lazy evaluation: Being referentially transparent, the computations yield the same result irrespective of when they are performed. This enables to postpone the computation of values until they are required/called. This means one could evaluate them lazily. Lazy evaluation helps avoids unnecessary computations and saves memory.
Parallel programming: Since there is no state change due to immutable variables, the functions in a functional program can work in parallel as instructions. Parallel loops can be easily expressed with good reusability.
Higher-order functions: A higher order function can take one or more functions as arguments. They may also be able to return a function as their result. Higher-order functions are useful for refactoring code and to reduce repetition. The map function found in many programming languages is an example of a higher-order function.

What kind of programming is good for AI development?
Machine learning is a sub-domain of artificial intelligence which deals with concepts of making predictions from data, take actions without being explicitly programmed, recommendation systems and so on. Any programming approach that focuses on logic and mathematical functions is good for artificial intelligence (AI).
Once the data is collected and prepared it is time to build your machine learning model.. This typically entails choosing a model, then training and testing the model with the data. Once the desired accuracy/results are achieved, then the model is deployed. Training on the data requires data to be consistent and the code to be able to communicate directly with the data without much abstraction for least unexpected errors.

For AI programs to work well, the language needs to have a low level implementation for faster communication with the processor. This is why many machine learning libraries are created in C++ to achieve fast performance. OOP with its mutable objects and object creation is better suited for high-level production software development, not very useful in AI programs which works with algorithms and data.
As AI is heavily based on math, languages like Python and R are widely used languages in AI currently. R lies more towards statistical data analysis but does support machine learning and neural network packages. Python being faster for mathematical computations and with support for numerical packages is used more commonly in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Why is functional programming good for artificial intelligence?
There are some benefits of functional programming that make it suitable for AI. It is closely aligned to mathematical thinking, and the expressions are in a format close to mathematical definitions. There are few or no side-effects of using a functional approach to coding, one function does not influence the other unless explicitly passed. This proves to be great for concurrency, parallelization and even debugging.
Less code and more consistency
The functional approach uses fewer lines of code, without sacrificing clarity. More time is spent in thinking out the functions than actually writing the lines of code. But the end result is more productivity with the created functions and easier maintenance since there are fewer lines of code. AI programs consist of lots of matrix multiplications. Functional programming is good at this just like GPUs.
You work with datasets in AI with some algorithms to make changes in the data to get modified data. A function on a value to get a new value is similar to what functional programming does. It is important for the variables/data to remain the same when working through a program. Different algorithms may need to be run on the same data and the values need to be the same. Immutability is well-suited for that kind of job.
Simple approach, fast computations
The characteristics/features of functional programming make it a good approach to be used in artificial intelligence applications. AI can do without objects and classes of an object oriented programming (OOP) approach, it needs fast computations and expects the variables to be the same after computations so that the operations made on the data set are consistent.
Some of the popular functional programming languages are R, Lisp, and Haskell. The latter two are pretty old languages and are not used very commonly. Python can be used as both, functional and object oriented. Currently, Python is the language most commonly used for AI and machine learning because of its simplicity and available libraries. Especially the scikit-learn library provides support for a lot of AI-related projects.
FP is fault tolerant and important for AI
Functional programming features make programs fault tolerant and fast for critical computations and rapid decision making. As of now, there may not be many such applications but think of the future, systems for self-driving cars, security, and defense systems. Any fault in such systems would have serious effects. Immutability makes the system more reliable, lazy evaluation helps conserve memory, parallel programming makes the system faster. The ability to pass a function as an argument saves a lot of time and enables more functionality. These features of functional programming make it a fitting choice for artificial intelligence.
To further understand why use functional programming for machine learning, read the case made for using the functional programming language Haskell for AI in the Haskell Blog.

The intelligence community is using artificial intelligence to help manage the exponential increase of data.






                  Artificial Intelligence
                









                  Intelligence
                









                  Analytics
                









                  Location
                












































Artificial intelligence is poised to fundamentally alter the way agencies meet their missions, especially so for data-heavy departments like those in the intelligence community.To ensure continuity across the 17 disparate agencies that make up the IC, program managers looking for AI solutions are adhering to the concept of AIM, or Augmenting Intelligence using Machines.“With that, we’re auditing routine functions that analysts, curators, collectors have manually done in the past to free them up to perform more intelligence,” La’Naia Jones, IC deputy chief information officer, said at the annual Tech Trends Conference hosted by the Professional Services Council. “Common sense, right? Sounds much easier than it is.”Jones noted information gathering is part of the mission sets of each IC component, meaning lots of data.“There is no big data analytics without a large amount of data. We need the machines to help us read and understand the data and we need the humans to look at it overall,” she said. “The amount of data is just increasing exponentially.”During a roundtable with reporters, Jones explained the nature of AIM, which a way of thinking, not a technology or program office. But that thought process is essential to the success of any AI initiative, she said.“When you speak of AIM, it’s a concept, it’s a vision, it’s an idea, it’s a way of doing business,” she said. “We’re partnering within the architectural division to leverage the reference architectures so that … whatever they set up is compliant and shareable amongst the other agencies … It’s not a stovepipe solution.”Many agencies and programs are also working with academia, particularly at the local level, Jones said.“In everything we do, we’re always looking at: how can we collaborate, how can we integrate, how can we work together, how can we team?” she said. “How can we better work this problem or these issues together so that way we don’t create the same problems?”During her presentation, Jones offered three examples of how AI is being used within the AIM framework by IC agencies today.At the National Security Agency, AI is being used to augment human language processing. Jones said commercial tools have only come so far, and NSA has unique problems, including complex languages and degraded audio.“NSA has retooled the process to integrate AI across the board,” she said, changing “the way the workflow is performed and to create a continuous training set for the machines.”The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is using AI tools to sort large amounts of imagery and pull out specific targets, such as enemy safehouses and airfields—work that has been done manually by analysts in the past. The new tools enable those analysts to do more of what they’re best at: analyzing data.“We’re moving the analysts from counting things to thinking about it,” Jones said. “Of course, a computer can tell us an airfield is empty but it can’t tell us why.”Jones also offered an example from the National Reconnaissance Office, which is using AI to find the kernels of useful information in the troves of data the agency collects daily.“This is helping to detect activity and automating tasks for expansive collection systems,” she said. “We can assure that most of the data that we collect is in the best interest of our analysts, to provide the best intelligence to the decision-makers.”As with the other IC agencies, NRO’s efforts fall in line with the AIM process, Jones said.“It’s looking at what your mission goals are—what you’re trying to achieve—and then can you use automated intelligence, can you use AIM—this philosophy, this process, this way of doing business—in order to improve that? Can any efficiencies be gained? Can we use that in order to push the envelope further?” Jones said.

Consider some of the latest additions of legal technology:

 	A voice-activated personal assistant such as the RightsNOW App that handles legal research questions. While an interesting and useful tool, it needs to come with tough security.
 	Or the chatbot DoNotPay applicatio. This application was intended to help fight parking tickets, and it has contested over 160,000 tickets across London and New York, for free. DoNotPay now also helps people sue Equifax in small-claims court.
 	Contract Intelligence (COIN), that analyzes documents in seconds allowing for  significant cost savings. COIN replaced hundreds of human lawyer-hours in interpreting commercial loan agreements.

However, artificial intelligence is not new to the legal profession. Many lawyers already implement numerous technologies. For example, predictive coding is often used in e-discovery, and natural language processing is used in legal search. In fact, many legal pundits suggest that an attorney who ignores artificial intelligence (AI) does so at their own peril.

While AI is indeed not new, the latest offerings may come with a twist. New legal tech creates questions and concerns about ethics. Law and ethics rules have not yet caught up with existing technology.

Ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence

Some of the ethical issues faced by attorneys today are:

 	The duties of diligence and competence – Attorneys need to understand how the different technologies work. Lawyers need a working knowledge of what a program does to understand what outcome they can get by using it and what capabilities and limitations the AI tool may have.
 	Duties of supervision – Attorneys working with others on a case have a duty to ensure that work is done competently. This means not solely relying on AI for an accurate outcome. It also means supervising the use of AI.
 	Duties of comprehension  Not everything can or should be done by AI. It is up to the attorney to know what can and cannot be done and act accordingly.
 	Duty of knowing where to draw the line –Drawing a line between automation as a case strategy versus automation being used to augment case management.
 	Duty of knowing how far to use such technology –Utilizing technology correctly and appropriately is key. Law firms need to know when something may prove to be a risk for their firm and/or their clients.
 	Duty to ensure client privilege and confidentiality – Today, AI powered tools are used to share confidences. This needs to raise concerns about the security of hosted data, storage in the cloud and data commingling.
 	Unauthorized practice of law – Legal chatbots powered by AI are at the leading edge of controversy but are proving to be very useful in that they can fight parking tickets, draft privacy policies, advise crime victims or write up a non-disclosure agreement. The user triggers the AI powered chatbot by talking, which then simulates a conversation. This technology, if it is created or maintained by a lawyer is problematically viewed as the unauthorized practice of law.
 	The duty of inclusion and diversity – These two factors are critical for implementing justice. When programming AI may end up being biased because when AI is “trained,” it is trained using human actions and decisions, which are already biased by the person(s) who made the decision.
 	The duty of legal training and education – Attorneys must competently keep up to speed with changes in the law and legal practice matters. This means staying abreast of legal technology. An attorney needs to know what they may expect to come out, or put another way, at least see and understand the risks and benefits of such technology.

In an effort to make headway in changing ethics rules, more than 30 states have added to their Model Rules of Professional Conduct the proviso that “[t]o maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, a lawyer should keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.”

One thing is for sure. No matter what happens when introducing AI to the law, the only way it is going to work is if the human and AI gurus work together. AI is here to stay. Lawyers of the future will need to use AI.",,"Artificial intelligence (AI), a process that mimics certain operations of the human mind, is transforming legal ethics. However, using emerging and

The Future of Collaboration in the Artificial Intelligence Era
How humans collaborate with one another has been closely linked to technological progress.
Before the invention of the telephone, we had to be in the same room to communicate in real-time – and prior to the internet, we had to be in the same building to share our designs, new ideas, or other documents.
Collaboration has always been a moving target, and in modern times we shouldn’t be surprised that new technological innovations are again shifting how humans work and coordinate together.

The New Collaboration Cycle
Today’s infographic comes to us from Schneider Electric, and it shows that humans are no longer making things using a linear approach.
Instead, modern collaboration is a cyclical process with no defined start or end points – and it often involves more users and stakeholders, continuous access, and an increasingly decentralized workforce. 
The 24/7 Knowledge Factory
All around the world, the way that teams work together is changing.

Instead of always being centralized at a local level, teams are adding talent from around the world who bring diverse perspectives and new ideas to the table.
The modern organization never sleeps – it has people from different countries, time zones, and cultures all working together to create new designs or products simultaneously.
Collaboration on projects is happening in real-time, at all times of the day, and this has several benefits. It brings together a broader range of skills and perspectives, makes teams more customer-centric, reduces errors and wasted money, and enhances both decision-making and product development cycles.

Working Together is Changing
How are teams collaborating 24/7 in real-time from locations around the world?
VR/AR
Designers, engineers, and other team members can collaborate in parallel, using mixed reality as a common medium. 
Collaborative Intelligence (AI)
Multi-agent, distributed systems where each agent, human or machine, is uniquely positioned, with autonomy to contribute to a problem-solving network.

Advanced Modelling (3D and 4D printing)
Design and manufacturing can be integrated seamlessly, even to customize individual items. 4d printing (fourth dimension: movement) is a new frontier where printed objects adapt to various circumstances.
Crowd-based Collaboration
Design is no longer siloed and can be democratized between different stakeholders. Further, teams can work simultaneously from all over the world.
Computer Supported Collaborative Design (CSCD)
The synchronous sharing of information and interaction with ideas, in an AI-driven, data-intensive environment. Here, problem solving, data and service “agents” support, or replace, labor intensive work and possibly the human traits of intuition and decisi, as well.n making.  

The Next Wave
How humans work together is changing, but also shifting is how humans and AI will collaborate together.
The new technological landscape creates many questions and uncertainties for companies today:

Will new “collaborative” technologies really change how we engage, and innovate with, our colleagues?
Will a hyper-networked, always-engaged global collaborative environment create “too many cooks in the kitchen”?
With more opportunity to get involved in processes, how does the role of the end-customer change?
Will traditional design and implementation switch to being more service-based, as time goes on?

What are generative adversarial networks (GANs) and how do they work? [Video]

By Richard Gall -   September 11, 2018 - 11:51 am 0 6599 




3 min readGenerative adversarial networks, or GANs, are a powerful type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning. Made up of two competing models which run in competition with one another, GANs are able to capture and copy variations within a dataset.
They’re great for image manipulation and generation, but they can also be deployed for tasks like understanding risk and recovery in healthcare and pharmacology.
GANs are actually pretty new – they were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Goodfellow developed them to tackle some of the issues with similar neural networks, including the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders.
Both the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders use the Markov Decision Chain which has a pretty high computational cost. This efficiency gives engineers significant gains – which you need if you’re working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.
How do Generative Adversarial Networks work?
Let’s start with a simple analogy. You have a painting – say the Mona Lisa – and we have a master forger who wants to create a duplicate painting. The forger does this by learning how the original painter – Leonardo Da Vinci – produced the painting.
Meanwhile, you have an investigator trying to capture the forger and ‘second guess’ the rules the forger is learning.

To map this onto the architecture of a GAN, the forger is the generator network, which learns the distribution of classes while the investigator is the discriminator network, which learning the boundaries between those classes – the formal ‘shape’ of the dataset.
Applications of GANs
Generative adversarial networks are used for a number of different applications.
One of the best examples is a Google Brain project back in 2016 – researchers used GANs to develop a method of encryption.
This project used 3 neural networks – Alice, Bob, and Eve. Alice’s job was to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob’s job was to decode that message, while Eve’s job was to intercept it.
To begin with Alice’s messages were easily intercepted by Eve. However, thanks to Eve’s adversarial work, Alice began to develop its own encryption strategy – it took 15,000 runs for Alice to successfully encrypt a message that could be deciphered by Bob that Eve couldn’t intercept.
Elsewhere, GANs are also being used in fields such as drug research. The neural networks can be trained on the existing drugs and suggest new synthetic chemical structures that improve on drugs that already exist.
Generative adversarial networks: the cutting edge of artificial intelligence
As we’ve seen, GANs offer some really exciting opportunities in artificial intelligence. There are two key advantages you need to remember: GANs solve the problem of generating data when you don’t have enough to begin with and they require no human supervision.
This is crucial when you think about the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, both in terms of the efficiency of running the models, and the real-world data we want to use – which could be poor quality or have privacy and confidentiality issues, as much healthcare data does.

                I remember a story about Revenue Canada employees joking about ruining someone’s life. There are also a number of examples of malicious prosecution sitting out there. Maybe a computer isn’t such a bad idea. On the other hand, given the stunning disaster of the federal government payroll software, I shouldn’t be quite so sanguine. Also concerning is the Treasury Board White paper’s note about the transparency of deployment ... 9 months out there and the CBC needs a FOI request to learn about it? So much for transparency.

                @Doug Thomson Regardless, if this is designed to assess the likelihood of a successful litigation, the 1% will be safe again ... they are seldom pursued ... it will be the little fish again. The little fish can’t afford a cadre of $ thousand per hour lawyers to fight their battles, so records will ensure their cases are ready wins for RC.

By doing so, we expand our capabilities beyond our biological limits. Tools turn our hands into more versatile appendages. Cars let us travel faster, and airplanes give us wings. Computers endow us with bigger brains and memory capacity, and smartphones orchestrate daily life. Now we are creating technology that can evolve on its own by encoding into it an ability to learn through data and effort. Will it ultimately supplant us? Or will it augment our abilities, enhancing our humanness in unprecedented ways?Machine learning started in the 1950s with the work of pioneering scientists such as Frank Rosenblatt, who built an electronic neuron that learned to recognize digits, and Arthur Samuel, whose checkers program learned by playing against itself until it could beat some humans. But it is only in the past decade that the field has truly taken off, giving us self-driving cars, virtual assistants that understand our commands (up to a point) and countless other applications.Every year we invent thousands of new algorithms, which are sequences of instructions telling a computer what to do. The hallmark of learning machines, however, is that instead of programming them in detail, we give them general goals such as “learn to play checkers.” Then, like humans, they improve with experience. These learning algorithms tend to fall into five main categories, each inspired by a different scientific field. Unsurprisingly, one way that machines learn is by mimicking natural selection, through evolutionary algorithms. In the Creative Machines Lab at Columbia University, primitive robots try to crawl or fly, and the specifications of those that perform best are periodically mixed and mutated to 3-D print the next generation. Starting with randomly assembled bots that can barely move, this process eventually produces creatures such as robot spiders and dragonflies after thousands or tens of thousands of generations.But evolution is slow. Deep learning, currently the most popular machine-learning paradigm, takes inspiration from the brain. We start with a highly simplified mathematical model of how a neuron works and then build a network from thousands or millions of these units and let it learn by gradually strengthening the connections between neurons that fire together when looking at data. These neural networks can recognize faces, understand speech and translate languages with uncanny accuracy. Machine learning also draws on psychology. Like humans, these analogy-based algorithms solve new problems by finding similar ones in memory. This ability allows for the automation of customer support, as well as e-commerce sites that recommend products based on your tastes.Machines may also learn by automating the scientific method. To induce a new hypothesis, symbolic learners invert the process of deduction: If I know that Socrates is human, what else do I need to infer that he is mortal? Knowing that humans are mortal would suffice, and this hypothesis can then be tested by checking if other humans in the data are also mortal. Eve, a biologist robot at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, has used this approach to discover a potential new malaria drug. Starting with data about the disease and basic knowledge of molecular biology, Eve formulated hypotheses about what drug compounds might work, designed experiments to test them, carried out the experiments in a robotic lab, revised or discarded the hypotheses, and repeated until it was satisfied.Finally, learning can rely purely on mathematical principles, the most important of which is Bayes’s theorem. The theorem says that we should assign initial probabilities to hypotheses based on our knowledge, then let the hypotheses that are consistent with the data become more probable and those that are not become less so. It then makes predictions by letting all the hypotheses vote, with the more probable ones carrying more weight. Bayesian learning machines can do some medical diagnoses more accurately than human doctors. They are also at the heart of many spam filters and of the system that Google uses to choose which ads to show you.Recommended StoriesSuperhuman AI Bots Are Surprisingly Vulnerable to ExploitsMatthew Hutson & Nature magazineWe Cannot Cede Control of Weapons to Artificial IntelligenceKate Graham-ShawAI Chatbots Seem as Ethical as a New York Times Advice ColumnistDan FalkWhat Does Artificial General Intelligence Actually Mean?Lauren LefferEach of these five kinds of machine learning has its strengths and weaknesses. Deep learning, for example, is good for perceptual problems such as vision and speech recognition but not for cognitive ones such as acquiring commonsense knowledge and reasoning. With symbolic learning, the reverse is true. Evolutionary algorithms are capable of solving harder problems than neural networks, but it can take a very long time to solve them. Analogical methods can learn from just a small number of instances but are liable to get confused when given too much information about each. Bayesian learning is most useful for dealing with small amounts of data but can be prohibitively expensive with big data.These vexing trade-offs are why machine-learning researchers are working toward combining the best elements of all the paradigms. In the same way that a master key opens all locks, our goal is to create a so-called master algorithm—one that can learn everything that can be extracted from data, deriving all possible knowledge from it.The challenge on us now is similar to the one faced by physicists: quantum mechanics is effective at describing the universe at the smallest scales and general relativity at the largest scales, but the two are incompatible and need to be reconciled. And in the same way that James Clerk Maxwell first unified light, electricity and magnetism before the Standard Model of particle physics could be developed, different research groups, including mine at the University of Washington, have proposed ways to unify two or more of the machine-learning paradigms. Because scientific progress is not linear and instead happens in fits and starts, it is difficult to predict when the full unification of the master algorithm might be complete. Regardless, achieving this goal will not usher in a new, dominant race of machines. Rather it will accelerate human progress.Machine Takeover?Once we attain the master algorithm and feed it the vast quantities of data each of us produce, artificial-intelligence systems will potentially be able to learn very accurate and detailed models of individual people: our tastes and habits, strengths and weaknesses, memories and aspirations, beliefs and personalities, the people and things we care about, and how we will respond in any given situation. That models of us could essentially predict the choices we will make is both exciting and disquieting.Many worry that machines with these capabilities will use their newfound knowledge to take all our jobs, enslave us or even exterminate us. But that is unlikely to happen because they have no will of their own. Essentially all AI algorithms are driven by goals that we program, such as “find the shortest route from the hotel to the airport.” What distinguishes these algorithms from ordinary ones is that they have a lot of flexibility in figuring out how to reach the goals we set for them rather than needing to execute a predefined series of steps. Even as they get better at the task with experience, the goals remain unchanged. Solutions that do not make progress toward the goal are automatically discarded. Plus, humans get to check that what the machines produce does indeed satisfy our objectives. We are also able to verify that the machines do not violate any of the constraints we put on them, such as “obey the rules of the road.”When we envision an AI, though, we tend to project onto it human qualities such as volition and consciousness. Most of us are also more familiar with humanlike AIs, such as home robots, than with the myriad other types that do their work behind the scenes. Hollywood compounds this perception by depicting robots and AIs as humans in disguise—an understandable tactic that makes for a more compelling story. Artificial intelligence is just the ability to solve hard problems—a task that does not require free will. It is no more likely to turn against us than your hand is to slap you. Like any other technology, AIs will always be extensions of us. The more powerful we can make them, the better.

Intelligent machines will indeed supplant many jobs, but the effects on society will likely be similar to previous forms of automation. Two hundred years ago the majority of Americans were farmers. Yet today machines have replaced almost all of them without causing massive unemployment. Doomsayers argue that this time is different because machines are replacing our brains, not just our brawn, leaving nothing for humans to do. But the day that AIs can carry out all the tasks we can is still very distant, if it ever comes. For the foreseeable future, AIs and humans will be good at different things. Machine learning’s primary effect will be to greatly lower the cost of intelligence. This democratization will increase the variety of economically feasible uses of that intelligence, generating new jobs and transforming old ones to accomplish more with the same amount of human labor.Then there is the “singularity” scenario, popularized by futurist Ray Kurzweil. It is one of ever accelerating technological progress: machines learn to make better machines, which in turn make even better ones, and so on. But we know that this cannot continue forever because the laws of physics place strict limits on how powerful even a quantum computer can be, and in some aspects, we are not far from hitting them. The progress of AI, like the progress of everything else, will eventually plateau.Another vision popular among futurists is that computer models of us will become so good that they will be practically indistinguishable from the real thing. In this scenario, we could upload ourselves to the cloud and live on forever as pieces of software, free of the pesky constraints of the physical world. One problem with this scenario is that it may not be biologically feasible. To upload yourself, you would presumably need an accurate model of each of your neurons, complete with the memories they store. It would have to be captured so reliably that the model’s predictions would not rapidly diverge from the behavior of the real neurons—a tall order indeed.But even if this were a realistic option, would you really upload yourself if you had the chance? How could you know for sure that your model was not missing some essential part of you—or that it was conscious at all? What if a thief stole your identity in the most absolute and complete sense of the word? I believe that people will opt to hang on to their squishy, carbon-based selves—the “wetware,” as computer scientists jokingly call it—for as long as they can and then call it quits.Cherchez l’humainAI—machine learning in particular—is really just the continuation of human evolution. In The Extended Phenotype, Richard Dawkins shows how common it is for animals’ genes to control the environment beyond their bodies, from cuckoo eggs to beaver dams. Technology is the extended phenotype of humans, and what we are building today is another layer of our technological exoskeleton. I think the most likely scenario for how humans will use AI is more fascinating than the usual speculations.Within a decade or so each one of us will probably have a “digital double,” an AI companion that will be even more indispensable than our smartphones are today. Your digital double will not need to physically move around with you; most likely it will live somewhere in the cloud, just as much of your data already does. We can see its beginnings in virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. At the heart of your digital double will be a model of you, learned from all the data you have ever generated in your interactions with the digital world, from desktop computers and Web sites to wearable devices and sensors in the environment such as smart speakers, thermostats, cell-phone towers and video cameras.The better our learning algorithms become and the more personal data we feed them, the more accurate our digital doubles will get. Once we have the master algorithm and then couple it with continuous capture of your sensorimotor stream via an augmented-reality headset and other personal sensors, your double will grow to know you better than your best friend.The model and data will be maintained by a “data bank,” not unlike a traditional bank that stores and invests your money. Many existing companies would surely like to provide that service for you. Google co-founder Sergey Brin has said that Google wants to be “the third half of your brain,” but you probably would not want part of your brain to subsist by showing you ads. You might be better served by a new kind of company with fewer conflicts of interest or by a data union you form with like-minded people.After all, the central worry about AI is not that it will spontaneously turn evil but that the humans who control it will misuse it (cherchez l’humain, as the French might say—“look to the human”). So your data bank’s first duty will be to ensure that your model is never used against your interests. Both you and the data bank must be vigilant about monitoring AI crime because this technology will empower bad actors as much as anyone. We will need AI police (the Turing police, as William Gibson called it in his 1984 book Neuromancer) to catch the AI criminals.If you have the misfortune of living under an authoritarian regime, this scenario could usher in unprecedented dangers because it will allow the government to monitor and restrain you like never before. Given the speed at which machine learning is progressing and the predictive policing systems already in use, the Minority Report scenario—where people are preemptively arrested when they are about to commit a crime—no longer seems far-fetched. Then there are the implications of inequality as the world adapts to the speed of life with digital doubles before all of us are able to afford one.Our first duty, as individuals, will be not to become complacent and trust our digital doubles beyond their years. From the outside, AIs may seem objective, even perfect, but inside they are as flawed as we are or more, just in different ways. For example, AIs lack common sense and can easily make errors that a human never would, such as mistaking a person crossing the street for a windblown plastic bag. They are also liable to take our instructions too literally, giving us precisely what we asked for instead of what we actually wanted. (So think twice before telling your self-driving car to get you to the airport on time at all costs.)Practically speaking, your digital double will be similar enough to you to take your place in all kinds of virtual interactions. Its job will not be to live your life for you but rather to make all the choices you do not have the time, patience or knowledge for. It will read every book on Amazon and recommend the few that you are most likely to want to read yourself. If you need a car, it will research the options and haggle with the car dealer’s bots. If you are job hunting, it will interview itself for all the positions that fit your needs and then schedule live interviews for you for the most promising ones. If you get a cancer diagnosis, it will try all potential treatments and recommend the most effective ones. (It will be your ethical duty to use your digital double for the greater good by letting it take part in medical research, too.) And if you are seeking a romantic partner, your double will go on millions of virtual dates with all eligible doubles. The pairs that hit it off in cyberspace can then go on a date in real life.Essentially your double will live out countless probable lives in cyberspace so that the single one you live in the physical world is likely to be the best version. Whether your simulated lives are somehow “real” and your cyberselves have a kind of consciousness (as portrayed in the plots of some Black Mirror episodes, for instance) are interesting philosophical questions.Some people worry that this means that we are handing over control of our lives to computers. But it actually gives us more control, not less, because it allows us to make choices we could not before. Your model will also learn from the results of each virtual experience (Did you enjoy the date? Do you like your new job?) so that over time, it will become better at suggesting the things you would choose for yourself.In fact, we are already accustomed to most of our decision-making taking place without our conscious intervention because that is what our brains do now. Your digital double will be like a greatly expanded subconscious, with one key difference: Whereas your subconscious lives alone inside your skull, your digital double will continuously interact with those of other people and organizations. Everyone’s doubles will keep trying to learn models of one another, and they will form a society of models, living at computer speeds, branching out in all directions, figuring out what we would do if we were there.Our machines will be our scouts, blazing a trail into the future for us as individuals and as a species. Where will they lead us? And where will we choose to go?Rights & PermissionsMORE TO EXPLORE

Cloud & NetworkingDevOpsInsights 8 ways Artificial Intelligence can improve DevOps

By Prasad Ramesh -   September 1, 2018 - 10:00 am 4548 0 










6 min readDevOps combines development and operations in an agile manner. ITOps refers to network infrastructure, computer operations, and device management. AIOps is artificial intelligence applied to ITOps, a term coined by Gartner. Makes us wonder what AI applied to DevOps would look like.
Currently, there are some problem areas in DevOps that mainly revolve around data. Namely, accessing the large pool of data, taking actions on it, managing alerts etc. Moreover, there are errors caused by human intervention. AI works heavily with data and can help improve DevOps in numerous ways. Before we get into how AI can improve DevOps, let’s take a look at some of the problem areas in DevOps today.
The trouble with DevOps
Human errors: When testing or deployment is performed manually and there is an error, it is hard to repeat and fix. Many a time, the software development is outsourced in companies. In such cases, there is lack of coordination between the dev and ops teams.
Environment inconsistency: Software functionality breaks when the code moves to different environments as each environment has different configurations. Teams can run around wasting a lot of time due to bugs when the software works fine on one environment but not on the other.
Change management: Many companies have change management processes well in place, but they are outdated for DevOps. The time taken for reviews, passing a new module etc is manual and proves to be a bottleneck. Changes happen frequently in DevOps and the functioning suffers due to old processes.
Monitoring: Monitoring is key to ensure smooth functioning in Agile. Many companies do not have the expertise to monitor the pipeline and infrastructure. Moreover monitoring only the infrastructure is not enough, there also needs to be monitoring of application performance, solutions need to be logged and analytics need to be tracked.

Now let’s take a look at 8 ways AI can improve DevOps given the above context.
1. Better data access
One of the most critical issues faced by DevOps teams is the lack of unregulated access to data. There is also a large amount of data, while the teams rarely view all of the data and focus on the outliers. The outliers only work as an indicator but do not give robust information. Artificial intelligence can compile and organize data from multiple sources for repeated use. Organized data is much easier to access and understand than heaps of raw data. This will help in predictive analysis and eventually a better decision making process. This is very important and enables many other ways listed below.
2. Superior implementation efficiency
Artificially intelligent systems can work with minimal or no human intervention. Currently, a rules-based environment managed by humans is followed in DevOps teams. AI can transform this into self governed systems to greatly improve operational efficiency. There are limitations to the volume and complexity of analysis a human can perform. Given the large volumes of data to be analyzed and processed, AI systems being good at it, can set optimal rules to maximize operational efficiencies.
3. Root cause analysis
Conducting root cause analysis is very important to fix an issue permanently. Not getting to the root cause allows for the cause to persist and affect other areas further down the line. Often, engineers don’t investigate failures in depth and are more focused on getting the release out. This is not surprising given the limited amount of time they have to work with. If fixing a superficial area gets things working, the root cause is not found. AI can take all data into account and see patterns between activity and cause to find the root cause of failure.
4 Automation
Complete automation is a problem in DevOps, many tasks in DevOps are routine and need to be done by humans. An AI model can automate these repeatable tasks and speed up the process significantly. A well-trained model increases the scope of complexity of the tasks that can be automated by machines. AI can help achieve least human intervention so that developers can focus on more complex interactive problems. Complete automation also allows the errors to be reproduced and fixed promptly.
5 Reduce Operational Complexity
AI can be used to simplify operations by providing a unified view. An engineer can view all the alerts and relevant data produced by the tools in a single place. This improves the current scenario where engineers have to switch between different tools to manually analyze and correlate data. Alert prioritization, root cause analysis, evaluating unusual behavior are complex time consuming tasks that depend on data. An organized singular view can greatly benefit in looking up data when required.
“AI and machine learning makes it possible to get a high-level view of the tool-chain, but at the same time zoom in when it is required.” -SignifAI
6 Predicting failures
A critical failure in a particular tool/area in DevOps can cripple the process and delay cycles. With enough data, machine learning models can predict when an error can occur. This goes beyond simple predictions. If an occurred fault is known to produce certain readings, AI can read patterns and predict the signs failure. AI can see indicators that humans may not be able to. As such early failure prediction and notification enable the team to fix it before it can affect the software development life cycle (SDLC).
7 Optimizing a specific metric
AI can work towards solutions where the uptime is maximized. An adaptive machine learning system can learn how the system works and improve it. Improving could mean tweaking a specific metric in the workflow for optimized performance. Configurations can be changed by AI for optimal performance as required during different production phases. Real-time analysis plays a big part in this.
8 Managing Alerts
DevOps systems can be flooded with alerts which are hard for humans to read and act upon. AI can analyze these alerts in real-time and categorize them. Assigning priority to alerts helps teams towards work on fixing them rather than going through a long list of alerts. The alerts can simply be tagged by a common ID for specific areas or AI can be trained for classifying good and bad alerts. Prioritizing alerts in such a way that flaws are shown first to be fixed will help smooth functioning.
Conclusion
As we saw, most of these areas depend heavily on data. So getting the system right to enhance data accessibility is the first step to take. Predictions work better when data is organized, performing root cause analysis is also easier. Automation can repeat mundane tasks and allow engineers to focus on more interactive problems that machines cannot handle. With machine learning, the overall operation efficiency, simplicity, and speed can be improved for smooth functioning of DevOps teams.

Whether it's a navigation app such as Waze, a music recommendation service such as Pandora or a digital assistant such as Siri, odds are you've used artificial intelligence in your everyday life.""Today 85 percent of Americans use AI every day,"" says Tess Posner, CEO of AI4ALL.AI has also been touted as the new must-have for business, for everything from customer service to marketing to IT. However, for all its usefulness, AI also has a dark side. In many cases, the algorithms are biased.



Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide.Some of the examples of bias are blatant, such as Google's facial recognition tool tagging black faces as gorillas or an algorithm used by law enforcement to predict recidivism disproportionately flagging people of color. Others are more subtle. When Beauty.AI held an online contest judged by an algorithm, the vast majority of ""winners"" were light-skinned. Search Google for images of ""unprofessional hair"" and the results you see will mostly be pictures of black women (even searching for ""man"" or ""woman"" brings back images of mostly white individuals).While more light has been shined on the problem recently, some feel it's not an issue addressed enough in the broader tech community, let alone in research at universities or the government and law enforcement agencies that implement AI.""Fundamentally, bias, if not addressed, becomes the Achilles' heel that eventually kills artificial intelligence,"" says Chad Steelberg, CEO of Veritone. ""You can't have machines where their perception and recommendation of the world is skewed in a way that makes its decision process a non-sequitur from action. From just a basic economic perspective and a belief that you want AI to be a powerful component to the future, you have to solve this problem.""As artificial intelligence becomes ever more pervasive in our everyday lives, there is now a small but growing community of entrepreneurs, data scientists and researchers working to tackle the issue of bias in AI. I spoke to a few of them to learn more about the ongoing challenges and possible solutions.Cathy O'Neil, founder of O'Neil Risk Consulting & Algorithmic AuditingSolution: Algorithm auditing


Back in the early 2010s, Cathy O'Neil was working as a data scientist in advertising technology, building algorithms that determined what ads users saw as they surfed the web. The inputs for the algorithms included innocuous-seeming information like what search terms someone used or what kind of computer they owned.However, O'Neil came to realize that she was actually creating demographic profiles of users. Although gender and race were not explicit inputs, O'Neil's algorithms were discriminating against users of certain backgrounds, based on the other cues.As O'Neil began talking to colleagues in other industries, she found this to be fairly standard practice. These biased algorithms weren't just deciding what ads a user saw, but arguably more consequential decisions, such as who got hired or whether someone would be approved for a credit card. (These observations have since been studied and confirmed by O'Neil and others.)What's more, in some industries -- for example, housing -- if a human were to make decisions based on the specific set of criteria, it likely would be illegal due to anti-discrimination laws. But, because an algorithm was deciding, and gender and race were not explicitly the factors, it was assumed the decision was impartial.""I had left the finance [world] because I wanted to do better than take advantage of a system just because I could,"" O'Neil says. ""I'd entered data science thinking that it was less like that. I realized it was just taking advantage in a similar way to the way finance had been doing it. Yet, people were still thinking that everything was great back in 2012. That they were making the world a better place.""O'Neil walked away from her adtech job. She wrote a book, Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy,  about the perils of letting algorithms run the world, and started consulting.Eventually, she settled on a niche: auditing algorithms.""I have to admit that it wasn't until maybe 2014 or 2015 that I realized this is also a business opportunity,"" O'Neil says.Right before the election in 2016, that realization led her to found O'Neil Risk Consulting & Algorithmic Auditing (ORCAA).""I started it because I realized that even if people wanted to stop that unfair or discriminatory practices then they wouldn't actually know how to do it,"" O'Neil says. ""I didn't actually know. I didn't have good advice to give them."" But, she wanted to figure it out.So, what does it mean to audit an algorithm?""The most high-level answer to that is it means to broaden our definition of what it means for an algorithm to work,"" O'Neil says.Often, companies will say an algorithm is working if it's accurate, effective or increasing profits, but for O'Neil, that shouldn't be enough.""So, when I say I want to audit your algorithm, it means I want to delve into what it is doing to all the stakeholders in the system in which you work, in the context in which you work,"" O'Neil says. ""And the stakeholders aren't just the company building it, aren't just for the company deploying it. It includes the target for the algorithm, so the people that are being assessed. It might even include their children. I want to think bigger. I want to think more about externalities, unforeseen consequences. I want to think more about the future.""For example, Facebook's News Feed algorithm is very good at encouraging engagement and keeping users on its site. However, there's also evidence it reinforces users' beliefs, rather than promoting dialog, and has contributed to ethnic cleansing. While that may not be evidence of bias, it's certainly not a net positive.Right now, ORCAA's clients are companies that ask for their algorithms to be audited because they want a third party -- such as an investor, client or the general public -- to trust it. For example, O'Neil has audited an internal Siemens project and New York-based Rentlogic's landlord rating system algorithm. These types of clients are generally already on the right track and simply want a third-party stamp of approval.


However, O'Neil's dream clients would be those who don't necessarily want her there.""I'm going to be working with them because some amount of pressure, whether it's regulatory or litigation or some public relations pressure kind of forces their hand and they invite me in,"" O'Neil says.Most tech companies pursue profit above all else, O'Neil says, and won't seriously address the issue of bias unless there are consequences. She feels that existing anti-discrimination protections need to be enforced in the age of AI.""The regulators don't know how to do this stuff,"" O'Neil says. ""I would like to give them tools. But, I have to build them first. ... We basically built a bunch of algorithms assuming they work perfectly, and now it's time to start building tools to test whether they're working at all.""Related: Artificial Intelligence Is Likely to Make a Career in Finance, Medicine or Law a Lot Less LucrativeFrida Polli, co-founder and CEO of PymetricsSolution: Open source AI auditingMany thought artificial intelligence would solve the problem of bias in hiring, by making sure human evaluators weren't prejudging candidates based on the name they saw on a resume or the applicant's appearance. However, some argue hiring algorithms end up perpetuating the biases of their creators.Pymetrics is one company that develops algorithms to help clients fill job openings based on the traits of high-performing existing employees. It believes it's found a solution to the bias problem in an in-house auditing tool, and now it's sharing the tool with the world.


Co-founder and CEO Frida Polli stresses that fighting bias was actually a secondary goal for Pymetrics.""We're not a diversity-first platform,"" Polli says. ""We are a predictive analytics platform.""However, after seeing that many of her clients' employee examples used to train Pymetrics's algorithms were not diverse, combating bias became important.""Either you do that or you're actually perpetuating bias,"" Polli says. ""So, we decided we certainly were not going to perpetuate bias.""Early on, the company developed Audit AI to make sure its algorithms were as neutral as possible when it came to factors including gender and race. If a company looking to fill a sales role had a sales team that was predominantly white and male, an unaudited algorithm might pick a candidate with those same traits. Polli was quick to point out that Audit AI would also recommend adjustments if an algorithm was weighted in favor of women or people of color.Some critics say if you tweak a hiring algorithm to remove bias you're lowering the bar, but Polli disagrees.""It's the age-old criticism that's like, 'oh well, you're not getting the best candidate,'"" Polli says. ""'You're just getting the most diverse candidate, because now you've lowered how well your algorithm is working.' What's really awesome is that we don't see that. We have not seen this tradeoff at all.""In May, Pymetrics published the code for its internal Audit AI auditing tool on Github. Polli says the first goal for making Audit AI open source is to encourage others to develop auditing techniques for their algorithms.


""If they can learn something from the way that we're doing it that's great. Obviously there are many ways to do it but we're not saying ours is the only way or the best way.""Other motivations include simply starting a conversation about the issue and potentially learning from other developers who may be able to improve Audit AI.""We certainly don't believe in sort of proprietary debiasing because that would sort of defeat the purpose,"" Polli says.""The industry just needs to be more comfortable in actually realizing that if you're not checking your machine learning algorithms and you're saying, 'I don't know whether they cause bias,' I just don't think that that should be acceptable,"" she says. ""Because it's like the ostrich in the sand approach.""Related: The Scariest Thing About AI Is the Competitive Disadvantage of Being Slow to AdaptRediet Abebe, co-founder of Black in AI and Mechanism Design for Social GoodSolution: Promoting diverse AI programmers and researchers Use of facial recognition has grown dramatically in recent years -- whether it's for unlocking your phone, expediting identification at the airport or scanning faces in a crowd to find potential criminals. But, it's also prone to bias.MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gehru, who received her PhD from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, found that facial recognition tools from IBM, Microsoft and Face++ accurately identified the gender of white men almost 100 percent of the time, but failed to identify darker skinned women in 20 percent to 34 percent of cases. That could be because the training sets themselves were biased: The two also found that the images used to train one of the facial recognition tools were 77 percent male and more than 83 percent white.


One reason machine learning algorithms end up being biased is that they reflect the biases -- whether conscious or unconscious -- of the developers who built them. The tech industry as a whole is predominantly white and male, and one study by TechEmergence found women make up only 18 percent of C-level roles at AI and machine learning companies.Some in the industry are trying to change that.In March 2017, a small group of computer science researchers started a community called Black in AI because of an ""alarming absence of black researchers,"" says co-founder Rediet Abebe, a PhD candidate in computer science at Cornell University. (Gehru is also a co-founder.)""In the conferences that I normally attend there's often no black people. I'd be the only black person,"" Abebe says. ""We realized that this was potentially a problem, especially since AI technologies are impacting our day-to-day lives and they're involved in decision-making and a lot of different domains,"" including criminal justice, hiring, housing applications and even what ads you see online.""All these things are now being increasingly impacted by AI technologies, and when you have a group of people that maybe have similar backgrounds or correlated experiences, that might impact the kinds of problems that you might work on and the kind of products that you put out there,"" Abebe says. ""We felt that the lack of black people in AI was potentially detrimental to how AI technologies might impact black people's lives.""Adebe feels particularly passionate about including more African women in AI; growing up in Ethiopia, a career in the sciences didn't seem like a possibility, unless she went into medicine. Her own research focuses on how certain communities are underserved or understudied when it comes to studying societal issues -- for example, there is a lack of accurate data on HIV/AIDS deaths in developing countries -- and how AI can be used to address those discrepancies. Adebe is also the co-founder and co-organizer of Mechanism Design for Social Good, an interdisciplinary initiative that shares research on AI's use in confronting similar societal challenges through workshops and meetings.Initially, Abebe thought Black in AI would be able to rent a van to fit all the people in the group, but Black in AI's Facebook group and email list has swollen to more than 800 people, from all over the world. While the majority of members are students or researchers, the group also includes entrepreneurs and engineers.Black in AI's biggest initiative to date was a workshop at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) in December 2017 that garnered about 200 attendees. Thanks to partners such as Facebook, Google and ElementAI, the group was able to give out over $150,000 in travel grants to attendees.


Abebe says a highlight of the workshop was a keynote talk by Haben Girma, the first deaf/blind graduate from Harvard Law School, which got Abebe thinking about other types of diversity and intersectionality.Black in AI is currently planning its second NIPS workshop.As part of the more informal discussions happening in the group's forums and Facebook group, members have applied and been accepted to Cornell's graduate programs, research collaborations have started and industry allies have stepped forward to ask how they can help. Black in AI hopes to set up a mentoring program for members.Related: Why Are Some Bots Racist? Look at the Humans Who Taught Them.Tess Posner, CEO of AI4ALLSolution: Introducing AI to diverse high schoolersThe nonprofit AI4ALL is targeting the next generation of AI whiz kids. Through summer programs at prestigious universities, AI4ALL exposes girls, low-income students, racial minorities and those from diverse geographic backgrounds to the possibilities of AI.""It's becoming ubiquitous and invisible,"" says Tess Posner, who joined AI4ALL as founding CEO in 2017. ""Yet, right now it's being developed by a homogenous group of technologists mostly. This is leading to negative impacts like race and gender bias getting incorporated into AI and machine learning systems. The lack of diversity is really a root cause for this.""She adds, ""The other piece of it is we believe that this technology has such exciting potential to be addressed to solving some key issues or key problems facing the world today, for example in health care or in environmental issues, in education. And it has incredibly positive potential for good.""


Started as a pilot at Stanford University in 2015 as a summer camp for girls, AI4ALL now offers programs at six universities around the country: University of California Berkeley, Boston University, Carnegie Mellon University, Princeton University, Simon Fraser University and Stanford.Participants receive a mix of technical training, hands-on learning, demos of real-world applications (such as a self-driving car), mentorship and exposure to experts in the field. This year, guest speakers included representatives from big tech firms including Tesla, Google and Microsoft, as well as startups including H20.ai, Mobileye and Argo AI.The universities provide three to five ""AI for good"" projects for students to work on during the program. Recent examples include developing algorithms to identify fake news, predict the infection path of the flu and map poverty in Uganda.For many participants, the AI4ALL summer program is only the beginning.""We talk about wanting to create future leaders in AI, not just future creators, that can really shape what the future of this technology can bring,"" Posner says.AI4ALL recently piloted an AI fellowship program for summer program graduates to receive funding and mentorship to work on their own projects. One student's project involved tracking wildfires on the West Coast, while another looked at how to optimize ambulance dispatches based on the severity of the call after her grandmother died because an ambulance didn't reach her in time.Other graduates have gone on to create their own ventures after finishing the program, and AI4ALL provides ""seed grants"" to help them get started. Often, these ventures involve exposing other kids like themselves to AI. For example, three alumni started a workshop series called creAIte to teach middle school girls about AI and computer science using neural art, while another runs an after school workshop called Girls Explore Tech.Another graduate co-authored a paper on using AI to improve surgeons' technique that won an award at NIPS's Machine Learning for Health workshop in 2017.


""We have a lot of industry partners who have seen our students' projects and they go, 'Wow. I can't believe how amazing and rigorous and advanced this project is.' And it kind of changes people's minds about what talent looks like and who the face of AI really is,"" Posner says.Last month, AI4ALL announced it will be expanding its reach in a big way: The organization received a $1 million grant from Google to create a free digital version of its curriculum, set to launch in early 2019.Related: Artificial Intelligence May Reflect the Unfair World We Live inChad Steelberg, co-founder and CEO of VeritoneSolution: Building the next generation of AISerial entrepreneur Chad Steelberg first got involved in AI during his high school years in the 1980s, when he worked on algorithms to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins. At the time, he felt AI's capabilities had reached a plateau, and he ended up starting multiple companies in different arenas, one of which he sold to Google in 2006.A few years later, Steelberg heard from some friends at Google that AI was about to take a huge leap forward -- algorithms that could actually understand and make decisions, rather than simply compute data and spit back a result. Steelberg saw the potential, and he invested $10 million of his own money to found Veritone.Veritone's aiWARE is an operating system for AI. Instead of communicating between the software and hardware in a computer, like a traditional operating system, it takes users' queries -- such as ""transcribe this audio clip"" -- and finds the best algorithm available to process that query, whether that's Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Nuance or some other transcription engine. As of now, aiWARE can scan more than 200 models in 16 categories, from translation to facial recognition.Algorithms work best when they have a sufficiently narrow training set. For example, if you try to train one algorithm to play go, chess and checkers, it will fail at all three, Steelberg says. Veritone tells the companies it works with to create algorithms for very narrow use cases, such as images of faces in profile. AiWARE will find the right algorithm for the specific query, and can even trigger multiple algorithms for the same query. Steelberg says when an audio clip uses multiple languages, the translations aiWARE returns are 15 percent to 20 percent more accurate than the best single engine on the platform.


Algorithms designed for parsing text and speech, such as transcription and translation, are another area prone to bias. One study found algorithms categorized written African American vernacular English as ""not English"" at high rates, while a Washington Post investigation found voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa have a hard time deciphering accented English.Though it wasn't built to eliminate bias, aiWARE ends up doing exactly that, Steelberg says. Just like the human brain is capable of taking all of its learned information and picking the best response to each situation, aiWARE learns which model (or models) is most appropriate to use for each query.""We use our aiWARE to arbitrate and evaluate each of those models as to what they believe the right answer is, and then aiWARE is learning to choose which set of models to trust at every single point along the curve,"" Steelberg says.It's not an issue if an algorithm is biased. ""What's problematic is when you try to solve the problem with one big, monolithic model,"" Steelberg says. AiWARE is learning to recognize which models are biased and how, and work around those biases.Another factor that results in biased AI is that many algorithms will ignore small subsets of a training set. If in a data set of 1 million entries, there are three that are different, you can still achieve a high degree of accuracy overall while performing horribly on certain queries. This is often the reason facial recognition software fails to recognize people of color: The training set contained mostly images of white faces.Veritone tells companies to break down training sets into micro models, and then aiWARE can interpolate to create similar examples.""You're essentially inflating that population, and you can train models now on an inflated population that learn that process,"" Steelberg says.Using small training sets, aiWARE can build models for facial recognition with accuracy in the high 90th percentile for whatever particular subcategory a client is interested in (e.g., all the employees at your company), he says.


Steelberg says he believes an intelligent AI like aiWARE has a much better chance of eliminating bias than a human auditor. For one, humans will likely have a hard time identifying flawed training sets. They also might bring their own biases to the process.And for larger AI models, which might encompass ""tens of millions of petabytes of data,"" a human auditor is just impractical, Steelberg says. ""The sheer size makes it inconceivable.""

“Where Nuance Healthcare sees the next frontier is around … bringing artificial intelligence to those scenarios to solve the burden on the physicians,” Marpuri added.




The company has thus developed various products to aid clinicians in this manner. Its flagship product is the Dragon Medical suite of solutions, Marpuri noted. The products are focused on clinical documentation and translate a doctor’s speech into a narrative that goes into the EHR.

					Integrated Enrollment Platforms and Consumer Assistance Centers: The Strongest Advantage for State-Based Exchanges				


					In the ever-evolving landscape of state-based health insurance exchanges, the convergence of technology and customer service is reshaping how these exchanges operate. The increasing advent of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly dismantling the traditional business model that relies on the siloing of technology and customer service centers.

About a year ago, Nuance expanded its portfolio by launching a new solution: the Dragon Medical Virtual Assistant. The tool, which is powered by artificial intelligence, continues the clinical documentation work of Nuance’s other products. More specifically, it can understand sophisticated conversational dialogue and has capabilities that automate high-value clinical workflows.
Earlier this year, the Massachusetts company integrated its virtual assistant platform into the Epic EHR system.




Marpuri pointed out that this effort is part of Nuance’s goal of deeply integrating its technology into the physician’s workflow. In addition to Epic, the company has partnerships with IT vendors like Allscripts, Cerner and Meditech.
Diving deeper into Nuance’s work with the Wisconsin-based EHR vendor, the companies have a few joint innovations. Doctors using Epic Haiku can now ask for patient information, medication lists and lab results through Nuance’s virtual assistant technology. Staff using Epic Cadence, a scheduling tool, can converse with Nuance’s virtual assistant to set up, search for and cancel patient appointments.
Nuance also has a smart speaker in development, which is connected to the Dragon Medical cloud. It is geared toward complex medical conversations and ambient speech use cases.
Finally, the Massachusetts company is working with entities like Partners HealthCare in Boston and Nvidia, a company with roots in the gaming world. Through the collaboration, they are bringing AI to radiologists at the point of care. The aim is to have AI algorithms that scan through medical images so the radiologist can quickly see which patients need specific types of care.

How putting artificial intelligence in Google Glass-like systems could both help and harm our privacy

Posted on Sep 1, 2018 by Glyn Moody






 
Remember Google Glass? Five years ago, it was the hot new accessory for those who wanted to live at the bleeding edge of technology. But once Google Glasses started being used in public, people realized that they represented a massive intrusion into the private lives of everyone nearby. As Wikipedia puts it: “The headset received a great deal of criticism and legislative action due to privacy and safety concerns.”
In 2015, Google announced that it would stop selling the Google Glass prototype to “Glass Explorers”. Since then, the idea of a head-mounted device with built-in first-person camera has faded from public view, but the idea certainly hasn’t gone away. Many may be surprised to learn that Google quietly re-launched Google Glass back in 2017, this time in the form of the Glass Enterprise edition. At that time, The Verge reported:
The major upgrades between the original Glass and the enterprise version are a better camera (with resolution upgraded from 5 megapixels to 8), extended battery life, faster Wi-Fi and processor, and a new red light that turns on when recording video. The electronics of Glass have also been made modular in the shape of a so-called Glass Pod, which can be detached and reattached to Glass-compatible frames, which can include things like safety goggles and prescription glasses.
As its name suggests, Google Glass Enterprise edition is aimed squarely at businesses rather than end-users. That’s in part a response to the adverse reaction that people had to the devices being used in public spaces. But a 2017 article in Wired notes that even in the more controlled work environment, there are still privacy issues. One company using Google Glasses discussed the idea of installing a “bathroom bar” where people can hang their headsets to make sure that no one is snapping photos in inappropriate contexts. In offices or on the factory floor, Google Glasses might still be used to record others saying or doing things without their permission.
A recent academic research project took an interesting approach to mitigating this problem. A German team was led by Andreas Bulling, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction and Cognitive Systems at the University of Stuttgart, and head of the Perceptual User Interfaces Group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics:
we present PrivacEye, a proof-of-concept system that detects privacy sensitive everyday situations and automatically enables and disables the first-person camera using a mechanical shutter. To close the shutter, PrivacEye detects sensitive situations from first-person camera videos using an end-to-end deep-learning model. To open the shutter without visual input, PrivacEye uses a separate, smaller eye camera to detect changes in users’ eye movements to gauge changes in the “privacy level” of the current situation.
The use of a physical shutter in this way is rather clunky, and the need for a second camera is an additional inconvenience. But what makes the work of note is the way artificial intelligence techniques are applied to detect automatically whether a social context is likely to be privacy-sensitive. If it is, the first-person camera is prevented from recording. In order to establish whether that was necessary, the researchers used a neural network that monitored the eye movements of the person wearing the first-person camera. One advantage of this approach is that it is not intrusive for other people who are present, unlike alternative systems that look at the environment in order to gauge privacy-intensive situations.
Markers of eye movements included fixations, saccades (quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes between two or more points of fixation in the same direction), blinks, pupil diameter and scan paths. The basic idea is to use the neural network to detect correlations between eye movement patterns and the level of privacy sensitivity experienced by the person wearing the camera headset. Although the work by the German team is only preliminary, they believe it has potential:
We are confident that the rapidly increasing capabilities of today’s deep neural networks will soon allow to push our proof-of-concept prototype towards an effective real-world application enabling privacy-preserving day-to-day usage of “always-on” smart glasses in real-time.
Like all tools, neural networks can be used beneficially and harmfully. The same techniques deployed to analyze eye movements in order to safeguard privacy can also be applied with less benign outcomes, as another research project led by Professor Bulling indicated. The academic paper writing up the work explained:
Besides allowing us to perceive our surroundings, eye movements are also a window into our mind and a rich source of information on who we are, how we feel, and what we do. Here we show that eye movements during an everyday task predict aspects of our personality. We tracked eye movements of 42 participants while they ran an errand on a university campus and subsequently assessed their personality traits using well-established questionnaires. Using a state-of-the-art machine learning method and a rich set of features encoding different eye movement characteristics, we were able to reliably predict four of the Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness) as well as perceptual curiosity only from eye movements.
Once more, it’s important to note that this should be regarded as a preliminary investigation, albeit with a promising outcome. Much more research needs to be done before it can be stated definitively that eye movements are suitable for predicting people’s personality. Perhaps the most important result from the work carried out by Bulling and his fellow researchers is not what they found, but how they found it.
In both cases, raw observational data – things like gaze fixations, saccades and eye blinks – were fed into a neural network system. The AI software then sought hidden patterns in that data: in the first case, correlating eye movements with privacy-sensitive situations, and in the second, correlating the eye movements with personality traits. It seems that interesting patterns were found for both – although these need to be confirmed by other researchers, and with larger training sets.
The application of AI techniques like neural networks is not limited to eye movements. It could easily be applied to any rich personal data set. Obvious possibilities include things like heart beat, skin conductivity, voice pitch, hand movements, and walking patterns, not to mention non-physical ones like online posting patterns or digital writing styles. It may well be that some or all of these are susceptible to AI analysis to reveal patterns that those generating the data are not aware of. Once more, that information might be used for all kinds of appropriate purposes – public safety, enhanced efficiency, personal counselling etc. – or it might be used for new kinds of invisible surveillance.
As Google Glass-like products become more common in the enterprise, perhaps even creeping back into public space, so the research described above will become particularly pertinent. However, exactly the same kinds of AI-based analysis can – and will – be applied to other products that gather, perhaps incidentally, personal information. Increasingly sophisticated real-time automated analysis will inevitably reveal aspects of our private lives in unsuspected, and often unwanted, detail.

He voted for Hillary Clinton, and he lives and works in Silicon Valley.Yet Mr. Karp, the chief executive of Palantir, has found himself increasingly at odds with his peers in the technology industry as it publicly distances itself from the government, particularly the Department of Defense, under President Trump.Mr. Karp readily admits he would prefer that Mr. Trump didn’t occupy the Oval Office. But he believes that Silicon Valley — already facing something of a crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence — is setting itself up for a fall.“It’s going to be a very significant problem for the Valley,” Mr. Karp, who rarely speaks publicly, said in an interview in his Manhattan office.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I don’t know how you stand up and talk to a Marine or a special operator and explain to them how you have a piece of software that will allow them to come home — or more likely allow them to come home — and you’re not going to allow them to use it,” he said. “I think it’s a nearly impossible argument to make outside the Valley without people being legitimately pretty upset.”Employees at companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon don’t see it the same way. Google, under internal pressure, abandoned its contract with the Pentagon on Project Maven, which used artificial intelligence software to improve the analysis of imagery from drones. Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has faced opposition from workers who want the company to end a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And Amazon employees have objected to providing facial recognition technology to police departments and other agencies.All of this has set off a quiet — but growing — debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation’s leader?Within the technology industry, the debate has been couched as a “moral and ethical” one: “We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” employees wrote in a petition that led to the company’s withdrawal from Project Maven.In truth, the ethical arguments are a diversion. This is political.And there is a real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and Silicon Valley — Hewlett-Packard built sonar, radar and aviation equipment for the government during World War II, for example — that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School and a member of the Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory committee set up under President Barack Obama, said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation.“I worry that it will stall progress,” he said. “Innovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you’re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.”Mr. Karp, whose parents met at a civil rights demonstration, said he believed that American companies, including those in Silicon Valley, had a moral obligation to support the country and its military, no matter who was living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.“We’re proud that we’re working with the U.S. government,” he said.Of course, Mr. Karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector. Palantir, which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data, was founded with the help of $2 million from the Central Intelligence Agency’s venture capital arm, and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet.ImageGoogle abandoned a Pentagon contract in the face of internal opposition. Mr. Karp, who voted for Hillary Clinton, said that with government work, “you’re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.”Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times“I obviously am very biased,” he said. “I have a problem if I go to a cocktail party in Silicon Valley because they want to know, ‘Is it true that your product is used to target terrorists?’ Yes. And some people don’t agree with that. That’s fine, by the way. I don’t expect everyone to agree with that.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis outspokenness is even more surprising given that a co-founder of Palantir is Peter Thiel, a serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported Mr. Trump.“We didn’t vote for the same people,” Mr. Karp said without hesitation. “We’re not going to vote for the same people.”Still, even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back, the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant. Everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future. But we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized.In fairness, the fears of some technology workers that their work will be used for ill do have a historical basis — in other countries. Ferdinand Porsche designed tanks for the Nazis, and Hugo Boss made their uniforms. Was that patriotism? Would it matter?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTReid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and sold it to Microsoft, where he now sits on the board, said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence.“I think that the majority of Silicon Valley people have a strong worry/reflex against weapons,” said Mr. Hoffman, who is a member of the Defense Innovation Board with Mr. Grant. The Trump administration, he said, has “amplified” concerns over “possible bad government action.”But Mr. Karp said claims that a president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme.“America is a complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things,” Mr. Karp said. With government work, he added, “you’re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.”Lost in the conversation in Silicon Valley is its own history. The internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the Defense Department that is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. As recently as the Obama administration, Silicon Valley’s biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut there is a difference between today’s tech giants like Google and Facebook and those who turned the Santa Clara Valley into Silicon Valley. A bond with the government “was clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way,” Mr. Karp said.It is a connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed. Those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors.And given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits — or lack thereof — that the biggest tech companies truly offer society, those workers might want to rethink their position.As Mr. Karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies, “If actually the narrative was ‘We are helping also with our defense,’ then people would understand the value of these other things” they do.There could come a time when Silicon Valley wishes it was waving that flag.A version of this article appears in print on Sept. 4, 2018, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Why Tech’s Split With Trump Could Set the Country Back.

No RAM and no storage by the way.I am not biased, ENIAC was the supercomputer of the day. But what I wonder even more is, from that monster size of a computer to a recently launched Intel Movidius, a thumb size drive, with abilities to think like humans, and another, an 8.8 mm wide chip that can power unmanned air drones that can follow their master, understand depth, avoid obstacles, and orient themselves in space, all on their own, science has made mountainous progress.In the past few years, there have been a myriad technologies boasting about bringing disruption, but the one that is actually doing it in our daily lives, and remains the favourite horse of the highest bidders is Artificial Intelligence, or AI. So, all I wanted to do was write a little something on AI.What is AI?Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to see, think, learn, and act like genius humans. It isn’t debatable that the machines are faster, more efficient, and more reliable. AI today can recognise faces, converse with humans, identify objects in an image, authenticate users based on voice, predict a suspicious activity at a crowded public place, and what not. And guess what? All of it is possible at a speed and scale one can hardly fathom.Photo Credit: PexelsAs per a study, AI is expected to reach market worth $190 billion by 2025 (MarketsandMarkets), deriving business value of over $3.9 trillion by 2022 (Gartner). It is no surprise that there are countless startups and Fortune 500 companies that are determined to get the most from AI.How does AI work?In a very simple language, there’s a computer behind AI. Big or small. It first understands a situation through sensors or human input. For instance, if you want to train a computer to auto-detect a cat, you will have to show lots of cats to it. After this, the computer processes the information and tries to predict the results next time. The humans/ engineers who train this computer or the computer itself then reiterate a lot of information until desired accuracy of results is reached. Though the entire process is not as simple as it sounds, just know that more the amount of training information, better the results. Which means, you may need 100K cat images to reach 80% accuracy.Some Use Cases:AI is being continuously used around us. Few examples you may be able to relate are:Virtual Digital Assistants — Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant‘Frequently Bought Together’ suggestions on AmazonSelf-drive carsChatbotsEmotion Recognition to understand customer emotionsAutomated Customer Footfall Counting in retail storesThese are just few use cases many would hear about frequently. But AI spans beyond these, and go all over to pregnancy management, human gene analytics, smart security systems, cashier-less checkouts, predictive airplane engine maintenance, and much more.Who should pay attention?Photo Credit: PexelsEveryone. AI will have an impact on virtually every industry, when some are to be impacted immediately, and others to follow eventually. Healthcare, automotive, retail, agriculture, customer service, manufacturing, everyone. Every department — from HR, Operations, Marketing, Sales, and what not. No matter who you are, it is going to be a part of your life tomorrow, and will make today’s technologies obsolete, like mobile phones did with the landline phones in the past.What will happen?AI is said to take away a lot of jobs. In my opinion, it will not. But one thing it will certainly do in this aspect is, it will shake people, and shake them well. It will force them to go out of their comfort zones, learn new skills, and do the most difficult thing — Accept CHANGE. Just remember the days when computer entered our lives. Everyone had the same fear. But, they created more jobs. However, it took an entire generation of people to go after learning computers, as if their lives depended on it. The same holds true today.We’re living in such exciting times, a kissing distance away from a big bright future. Let’s make the best of it.",,https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/artificial-intelligence-hype-or-change-agent-to-shape-future-d543e17cdf71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Kamal Pathak'],,,2018-09-05T08:13:49.402Z,,,,,,,,,d543e17cdf71,,,,,

But it's also scary./ Artificial Intelligence/ Agi/ Ai/ Artificial IntelligenceUpdated 9.5.18, 3:43 PM EDT by Dan RobitzskiImage by Getty ImagesSophisticated AI could make the world a better place. It might let us fight cancer and improve healthcare around the world, or simply free us from the menial tasks that dominate our lives.That was the primary topic of conversation last month when engineers, investors, researchers, and policymakers got together at The Joint Multi-Conference on Human-Level Artificial Intelligence.But there was an undercurrent of fear that ran through some of the talks, too. Some people are anxious about losing their jobs to a robot or line of code; others fear a robot uprising. Where's the line between fearmongering and legitimate concern?In an effort to separate the two, Futurism asked five AI experts at the conference about what they fear most about a future with advanced artificial intelligence. Their responses, below, have been lightly edited.Hopefully, with their concerns in mind, we'll be able to steer society in a better direction — one in which we use AI for all the good stuff, like fighting global epidemics or granting more people an education, and less of the bad stuff.Image Credit: Getty ImagesQ: When you think of what we can do — and what we will be able to do — with AI, what do you find the most unsettling?Kenneth Stanley, Professor at University of Central Florida, Senior Engineering Manager and Staff Scientist at Uber AI LabsI think that the most obvious concern is when AI is used to hurt people. There are a lot of different applications where you can imagine that happening. We have to be really careful about letting that bad side get out. [Sorting out how to keep AI responsible is] a very tricky question; it has many more dimensions than just the scientific. That means all of society does need to be involved in answering it.On how to develop safe AI:All technology can be used for bad, and I think AI is just another example of that. Humans have always struggled with not letting new technologies be used for nefarious purposes. I believe we can do this: we can put the right checks and balances in place to be safer.I don’t think I know what exactly we should do about it, but I can caution us to take [our response to the impacts of AI] very carefully and gradually and to learn as we go.Irakli Beridze, Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at UNICRI, United NationsI think the most dangerous thing with AI is its pace of development. Depending how quickly it will develop and how quickly we will be able to adapt to it. And if we lose that balance, we might get in trouble.On terrorism, crime, and other sources of risk:I think the dangerous applications for AI, from my point of view, would be criminals or large terrorist organizations using it to disrupt large processes or simply do pure harm. [Terrorists could cause harm] via digital warfare, or it could be a combination of robotics, drones, with AI and other things as well that could be really dangerous.And, of course, other risks come from things like job losses. If we have massive numbers of people losing jobs and don't find a solution, it will be extremely dangerous. Things like lethal autonomous weapons systems should be properly governed — otherwise there’s massive potential of misuse.On how to move forward:But this is the duality of this technology. Certainly, my conviction is that AI is not a weapon; AI is a tool. It is a powerful tool, and this powerful tool could be used for good or bad things. Our mission is to make sure that this is used for the good things, the most benefits are extracted from it, and most risks are understood and mitigated.John Langford, Principal Researcher at MicrosoftI think we should watch out for drones. I think automated drones are potentially dangerous in a lot of ways.The computation on board unmanned weapons isn't efficient enough to do something useful right now. But in five or ten years, I can imagine that a drone could have onboard computation sufficient enough that it could actually be useful. You can see that drones are already getting used in warfare, but they’re [still human-controlled]. There’s no reason why they couldn’t be carrying some kind of learning system and be reasonably effective. So that’s something that I worry about a fair bit.Hava Siegelmann, Microsystems Technology Office Programs Manager at DARPAEvery technology can be used for bad. I think it's in the hands of the ones that use it. I don’t think there is a bad technology, but there will be bad people. It comes down to who has access to the technology and how we use it.Tomas Mikolov, Research Scientist at Facebook AIWhen there’s a lot of interest and funding around something, there are also people who are abusing it. I find it unsettling that some people are selling AI even before we make it, and are pretending to know what [problem it will solve].These strange startups are also promising things that are some great AI examples when their systems are basically over-optimizing a single path that maybe anyone didn't even care about before [such as a chatbot that's just a little better than the last version]. And maybe after spending tens of thousands of hours of work, by over-optimizing a single value, some of these startups come in with these big claims that they did achieve something that nobody could previously do.But come on, let's be honest, many of the recent breakthroughs of these groups that I don't want to name, nobody cared before, and they are not generating any money. They are more like magician tricks. Especially ones that see AI as just over-optimizing a single task that is very narrow and there's no way they can scale to pretty much anything else other than very simple problems.Someone who’s even a little bit critical of these systems would quickly encounter problems that go against the company's lofty claims.More on developing safe AI: Should Evil AI Research Be Published?

KEY TAKEAWAYS
New forms of AI will (and are already beginning to) change our lives in some very interesting ways.




We know that our world is changing quickly – but there are a lot of concrete technology advances that you might not hear a lot about in the newspaper or on TV, that are nevertheless having a dramatic impact on our lives.
Some of these big new stories are related to the artificial neural network – a relatively new phenomenon in artificial intelligence research that’s driving all sorts of progress in many fields, from entertainment to medicine.
Artificial neural networks rely on the idea that technologies can model the biological work of the human brain, using small units corresponding to individual human neurons and groups of neurons, to produce outputs based on inputs.
The idea of the artificial neural network relies on the philosophy of “connectionism” which emerged in the 1940s, and theorizes how large numbers of cooperating neurological units can impact overall behavior and cognition. Another way to say that is that as humans, we discovered that we can build better models by throwing together many of these artificial neurons and making them work together in ways that are very like our own biological thought processes.
So what are artificial networks bringing to the table? A lot, actually. Even though they're not a household name, or a familiar brand, or even a major part of elementary or high school curriculum, work on artificial neural networks is becoming common in a lot of fields. (Learn more about the milestones in computing and AI history with From Ada Lovelace to Deep Learning.)
Game Playing and Beyond
You may have heard recently that a computer was able to beat a human player in the game of “Go,” a game that's significantly more complex than chess. A lot of us intuitively understand this is yet another step forward along the path toward stronger artificial intelligence – we learned about the superiority of chess-playing computers back in the 1990s, so this seems like a logical progression.Advertisements




The emergence of artificial intelligence entities, backed by artificial neural networks, that can beat humans at Go is significant – but what you might not know is that IBM, a company that contributed to this emerging mode of game play, is also experimenting with new fundamental AI techniques that will make artificial neural networks a lot more capable and faster. News dropped last month that IBM will be dropping $240 million on a joint project with MIT, doubling down on the power of ANN and related technologies to go further than they ever have before.
More Precision in Cancer Treatment
Cancer is one of the most confounding diseases in the Western medical lexicon – but now, very new kinds of cancer research are being supported by artificial neural networks as scientists get close to breaking through to new ways of treating many different kinds of tumors.
One of the most essential ways that artificial neural networks are helping out in diagnosing and treating breast, prostate, lung and other types of cancers is with the ability to wield large sets of data and identify a path forward – whether it's the classification of cancer cases, or working with data related to gene expression, a spectrum of new cancer treatments use AI-derived insights to try to save lives.
Progress in Neuroscience
Artificial neural networks aren't just useful in cancer research – the same principles can take all sorts of clinical data and refine it into more actionable forms.
But there's a special relationship between artificial neural networks and neuroscience – because even as we’re putting together these building blocks that simulate the human brain, we’re learning more about how the human brain works – which is supporting new modern facilities to serve patients in new ways.
As scientists go in and create ANN systems, they're looking at how neurons fire impulses across synapses. They're grouping and classifying neural networks that make up parts of the human brain. In bits and pieces, they're working toward the overall goal of advanced artificial intelligence research – to more fully simulate the biological brain’s work, and turn those results into something that looks very much like human thought derived from an autonomous technology. As people use artificial neural networks, they’ll learn more about what happens in the brain, what happens when we dream, what happens when someone has a stroke – and all of this will fuel expansion in different areas of neuroscience. As we develop AI, we’re also developing our understanding of ourselves.
AI and Personalized Marketing
Another breakthrough that's supported by artificial neural networks is the uncanny ability of marketers to figure out what a given consumer wants and needs.
You may have encountered this kind of thing in a website's recommendation engine, on your Pandora feed, or elsewhere. You see ads that are so targeted they seem creepy – you get information about things that you may want or are interested in, but that you've never told anybody about. All of this is often driven by artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms that are able to make connections on their own, rather than being driven by human decision-makers. Their accuracy is uncanny, and it's only going to get better as time goes on. (Learn more in How Recommendation Systems Are the Way We Shop Online.)
Everyday Interfaces
Here's an interesting way to think about the breakthroughs that scientists are making with artificial neural networks – an article from Gizmodo talks about how we see the results of ANNs in play every day on the internet – one of the important things that this article points out is that one of the most promising frontiers of the use of artificial neural networks is image recognition.
In early use of these artificial intelligence tools, scientists have figured out how to help computers to recognize pictures of everything from cats to individual human faces. And that's already being applied in many ways – on your messaging platforms, in your Facebook profile, and even, possibly, at your local airport.
The field of biometrics has gained a lot from the idea that you can use image recognition to identify an individual. And, of course, marketing gains from image recognition as well, helping to put together those connections that are going to appeal to a human user. But on a broader level, being able to mine pictures for data has all kinds of useful applications – so that at some point, we’re not going to be feeding in words to computers anymore – we’ll be able to give them pictures to show them whatever we’re trying to convey – and as everybody knows, a picture is worth 1,000 words.
Another interesting point from the Gizmodo piece is that natural language processing is also a product of ANN work. We've been using that for a while, whether it's with Siri or dictation tools or some other form; the ways that computers break down phonetics and convert them have a lot to do with early research into artificial neural networks.
Business Intelligence
Aside from being able to pin down individual customers and dissect their personal information for marketing purposes, businesses are also using artificial neural networks and machine learning in other very important ways.
A business is an organism – and any business of significant size is going to need a lot of direction, both day to day and over the long term.
As soon as software became sufficiently advanced, advanced enough, vendors started building different enterprise software platforms to help businesses to automate everything that they used to do by hand. Salesforce automation boosts the power of sales teams through technology. Customer relationship management tools help promote better connections to a target audience. Supply chain management tools get the necessary raw materials into business locations. And general business intelligence tools take in all the raw data and make it into actionable reports that executives can use.
Rather than doing walk-throughs of facilities and trying to imagine what's going to happen in the future, today's leaders are increasingly looking at visual dashboards and seeing clearly what they need to do to make the business work better. All of that transparency, again, relies on artificial neural networks – and machine learning and deep learning tools – applied to these analytical engines are giving us the knowledge that we need in ways that are based on that very important simulation of human thought.
All of these breakthroughs are just the tip of the iceberg. A revolution is coming – a massive sea change in the way that we interact with technology. Smarter and more capable robots and computers are going to start sounding, looking and acting like us – and it's up to us to figure out how that's going to work.

With this net positive job growth, there is expected to be a major shift in quality, location and permanency for the new roles. And companies are expected to expand the use of contractors doing specialized work and utilize remote staffing.









World Economic Forum's Automation Rate Graph
World Economic Forum





In 2025, machines are expected to perform more current work tasks than humans compared to 71% being performed by humans as of now. Due to this transformation, it will have a major impact on the global workforce.
PROMOTED
This report is intended to provide guidance on how to improve the quality of the work being done by humans and how people should become prepared for emerging roles. And it is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and strategy executives from more than 300 global companies across 12 industries and 20 emerging economies.

Plus the report has determined that 54% of employees of large companies would need to up-skill in order to fully harness these growth opportunities. Over half of the companies surveyed said that they plan to train only employees in key roles and only one-third are planning to train at-risk workers.
Nearly 50% of all companies are expecting their full-time workforce to shrink by 2022 due to automation, but 40% are expecting to extend their workforce and more than 25% are expecting automation to create new roles in the enterprise.

""It is critical that business take an active role in supporting their existing workforces through reskilling and upskilling, that individuals take a proactive approach to their own lifelong learning, and that governments create an enabling environment to facilitate this workforce transformation. This is the key challenge of our time,"" said World Economic Forum founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab.
Some of the fastest growing job opportunities across all industries include data analysts, software developers and social media specialists. Plus jobs that require “human skills” like sales and marketing, innovation and customer service are also expected to increase in demand. Some of the jobs that are expected to go away include data entry, payroll and certain accounting functions. The WEF is working across multiple industries to design roadmaps to respond to these new opportunities.
The respondents provided three strategies to cope with these challenges. This includes hiring wholly new permanent staff with skills around new technologies, completely automating certain work tasks and retraining existing employees. And a smaller number of companies are expecting to allocate the work to freelancers and temporary workers.
Workforce expansion will vary across industries says the WEF report. Companies that are projecting a higher amount of job losses tend to be in the mining, consumer and IT industries than companies in professionals services. Between 2018 and 2022, the aviation and tourism industries are expected to see the highest amount of retraining. Physical tasks are also expected to be significantly replaced by mechanized labor so that humans can focus on more productive tasks.
And the report also pointed out that the demand of roles across certain regions also varies. There is expecting to be a growing demand of financial and investment advisors in East Asia and the Pacific and Western Europe, assembly and factory workers in Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and electrical engineers in North America.
This WEF report seems to reaffirm a previous study that PwC put together where it was determined that AI, robotics and smart automation technology will bring greater economic benefits. And this could contribute up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.Follow me on Twitter. Amit ChowdhryI have written over 20,000 articles about startups, gadgets and large technology companies over the last ten years.

Should social workers be among them? It might seem that the particular and personal skills of social work are of a nature that could never be replaced by a machine, but from the point of view of an economist they are part of the machinery to provide help in the most cost-effective way. This involves judgment: which families need what kind of help most urgently? And that kind of classification is one of the things that various forms of artificial intelligence promise to do better and more quickly than unaided human beings. It involves the ability to detect significance in a mass of confusing information, often in ways that are hard to explain – a faculty that in humans is called intuition. When computers do it, it is called machine learning. In neither case is it wholly reliable.The augmentation or replacement of social workers with machine learning is the possibility raised by our report that five English councils are trialling software which will help to pick out families and children in need of intervention. It is not the only danger of the projects. There are obvious problems around informed consent: as far back as 2012, Dame Louise Casey took the view that demanding informed consent for the use of the relevant data damaged society as a whole and particularly its most vulnerable members. This is not what the Guardian believes. Nor, after the GDPR, is it what the law allows.Then there is the fallibility of the algorithms themselves: the way in which putting human prejudices into software makes AI “money laundering for bias”. Beyond that is the further danger that even if this function of social workers and other professionals can be successfully augmented by machine learning, that might tend to make all the other things they do look less important when in fact they will become much more so.Yet Ms Casey’s argument has an intuitive force. We are all leaving increasingly large trails of data behind us as we move through life. At the moment it is mostly analysed in order to sell us things more efficiently. It would be absurd for society not to make use of it for more valuable purposes. If informed consent could be obtained from everyone within a council’s area, there are no doubt interesting and useful things that could be discovered. But that kind of analysis would have to involve all citizens. The more data these algorithms have, the better the results will be. Importantly, this must not just be data on “problem” families. We cannot know how they differ from the norm without a great deal of data from the families who will never trouble social work departments. This is unlikely to be politically as popular as the idea of automating hard-pressed social services departments.None of this happens in a vacuum. Technology is not bestowed on us by benevolent gods. It is deployed in response to pre-existing social and economic pressures. Why might local government want to invest in this kind of thing, and why might central government want to believe in it? To ask the question is to answer it. The technology appears to promise a magical way to slip out of the vice of rising costs, demand and expectation on the one side, and shrinking revenues on the other.But there is no magic escape here. In some cases the enthusiastic deployment of technology can make a bad situation very much worse. The good intentions of local councils will only be rewarded if they are properly funded from the centre.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSocial workLocal governmentComputingeditorialsShareReuse this contentMost viewedUnderground cave found on moon could be ideal base for explorersFormer classmate describes Trump rally gunman as ‘definitely conservative’LiveTrump picks JD Vance as his running mate – liveAOC to anonymous Democrat who said party resigned to Trump win: ‘Retire’Blue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi Hasan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence in Business Gets Real
Pioneering Companies Aim for AI at Scale








September 17, 2018


by: Sam Ransbotham, Philipp Gerbert, Martin Reeves, David Kiron, and Michael Spira


Companies are looking to artificial intelligence to create business value, and as MIT Sloan Management Review’s 2018 Global Executive Study and Research Report on AI shows, Pioneer organizations are pulling ahead of their counterparts. By deepening their commitment to AI and focusing on revenue-generating applications over cost savings, these early implementers are positioning themselves to reap the benefits of AI at scale.















Executives in companies around the world are increasingly looking to artificial intelligence to create new sources of business value. This is especially true for leading adopters of AI — those that have invested in AI initiatives and seen impressive results. This small group of companies is doubling down on AI investments, building competencies, and working to take AI to scale. The opportunities and challenges these AI Pioneers face are the focus of the 2018 MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report.
Continuing last year’s analytical approach, our latest research combines a global survey of 3,076 business executives and 36 in-depth interviews with business executives. We classified the organizations surveyed into four groups based on respondents’ responses to questions about their levels of AI adoption and AI understanding. Pioneers are enterprises that have extensive understanding of AI tools and concepts and significant levels of AI adoption; Investigators understand AI but have limited adoption; Experimenters have adopted AI but with limited understanding of it, and Passives have limited adoption and understanding of AI.

The research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an MIT Sloan Management Review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by The Boston Consulting Group and the BCG Henderson Institute.

This report highlights four major patterns in the survey and interview data:

Pioneers are deepening their commitments to AI. Is AI really taking off in business? In one respect, the percentage of Pioneers among survey respondents remained essentially the same as last year, at just under one-fifth of those polled. Yet the level of commitment to AI within the Pioneer group is striking: Fully 88% of Pioneers invested more in AI than in the previous year — in contrast to just 62% of Experimenters and Investigators. Pioneers continue to push forward.
Pioneers are eager to scale AI throughout their enterprise. Typically, an organization that gained early success with AI did so because some AI-knowledgeable managers within a business unit spotted a problem that could be solved more effectively with, for example, natural language processing. Attacking such targets in isolation, they came up with impressive solutions. However, these point solutions left enterprises with no greater systemic capabilities than they had before.

“Infrastructure capabilities needed to implement AI is coming together at a faster rate than expected. Soon, AI will be an integral part of everything that we do and eventually take over most of the activities that require human ability today. Just like every other transformative idea, AI is a double-edged sword that can be used for the good of mankind or for destructive purposes. It is very important that we aim at regulating AI and start working on new social contracts as machines will start producing everything that we need to live our day-to-day life.”

In addition to the problem of bias I discussed in a previous article, there is also the ‘black box’ problem: if people don’t know how AI comes up with its decisions, they won’t trust it.
In fact, this lack of trust was at the heart of many failures of one of the best-known AI efforts: 
IBM
 Watson – in particular, Watson for Oncology.

Experts were quick to single out the problem. “IBM’s attempt to promote its supercomputer programme to cancer doctors (Watson for Oncology) was a PR disaster,” says Vyacheslav Polonski, Ph.D., UX researcher for 
Google
 and founder of Avantgarde Analytics. “The problem with Watson for Oncology was that doctors simply didn’t trust it.”
When Watson’s results agreed with physicians, it provided confirmation, but didn’t help reach a diagnosis. When Watson didn’t agree, then physicians simply thought it was wrong.
PROMOTED
If the doctors knew how it came to its conclusions, the results might have been different. “AI’s decision-making process is usually too difficult for most people to understand,” Polonski continues. “And interacting with something we don’t understand can cause anxiety and make us feel like we’re losing control.”

The Need for Explainability
If oncologists had understood how Watson had come up with its answers – what the industry refers to as ‘explainability’ – their trust level may have been higher.

Explainability has now become a critical requirement for AI in many contexts beyond healthcare. Take 
Twitter
, for example. “We need to do a much better job at explaining how our algorithms work. Ideally opening them up so that people can actually see how they work. This is not easy for anyone to do,” says Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter. “In fact, there’s a whole field of research in AI called ‘explainability’ that is trying to understand how to make algorithms explain how they make decisions.”
In other cases, people are calling upon AI to make life-or-death decisions. In such situations, explainability is absolutely critical.
It’s no surprise, therefore, that the US Department of Defense (DoD) is investing in Explainable AI (XAI). “Explainable AI—especially explainable machine learning—will be essential if future warfighters are to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage an emerging generation of artificially intelligent machine partners,” explains David Gunning, program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the DoD. “New machine-learning systems will have the ability to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future.”
Healthcare, however, remains one of AI’s most promising areas. “Explainable AI is going to be extremely important for us in healthcare in actually bridging this gap from understanding what might be possible and what might be going on with your health, and actually giving clinicians tools so that they can really be comfortable and understand how to use,” says Sanji Fernando, vice president and head of the OptumLabs Center for Applied Data Science at 
UnitedHealth Group
. “That’s why we think there’s some amazing work happening in academia, in academic institutions, in large companies, and within the federal government, to safely approve this kind of decision making.”
The Explainability Tradeoff
While organizations like DARPA are actively investing in XAI, there is an open question as to whether such efforts detract from the central priority to make AI algorithms better.
Even more concerning: will we need to ‘dumb down’ AI algorithms to make them explainable? “The more accurate the algorithm, the harder it is to interpret, especially with deep learning,” points out Sameer Singh, assistant professor of computer science at the University of California Irvine. “Computers are increasingly a more important part of our lives, and automation is just going to improve over time, so it’s increasingly important to know why these complicated AI and ML systems are making the decisions that they are.”
Some AI research efforts may thus be at cross-purposes with others. “The more complex a system is, the less explainable it will be,” says John Zerilli, postdoctoral fellow at University of Otago and researcher into explainable AI. “If you want your system to be explainable, you’re going to have to make do with a simpler system that isn’t as powerful or accurate.”
The $2 billion that DARPA is investing in what it calls ‘third-wave AI systems,’ however, may very well be sufficient to resolve this tradeoff. “XAI is one of a handful of current DARPA programs expected to enable ‘third-wave AI systems,’ where machines understand the context and environment in which they operate, and over time build underlying explanatory models that allow them to characterize real world phenomena,” DARPA’s Gunning adds.
Skynet, Explain Thyself
Resolving today’s trust issues is important, but there are trust issues in the future as well. If we place the growing field of XAI into the dystopian future that some AI skeptics lay out, we may have a path to preventing such nightmares.
Whether it be HAL 9000, Skynet, or any other Hollywood AI villain, there is always a point in the development of the evil program where it breaks free from the control of its human creators and runs amuck.
If those creators built explainability into such systems, however, then running amuck would be much less likely – or at least, much easier to see coming.
Thanks to XAI, therefore, we can all breathe a sigh of relief.

Nearly all Fortune 500 companies now use some form of automation -- from robot avatars interviewing job candidates to computers weeding out potential employees by scanning keywords in resumes. And more and more companies are using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to assess possible employees. DeepSense, based in San Francisco and India, helps hiring managers scan people’s social media accounts to surface underlying personality traits. The company says it uses a scientifically based personality test, and it can be done with or without a potential candidate’s knowledge.The practice is part of a general trend of some hiring companies to move away from assessing candidates based on their resumes and skills, towards making hiring decisions based on people’s personalities.The Robot Revolution: An inside look at how humanoid robots are evolving.

SINGAPORE — Workers in Singapore will be hit hard by technological disruptions with the Republic’s labour market set to face the largest degree of job displacement regionally in the next decade, based on a study on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on workers in six South-east Asian economies.The new study by technology company Cisco and economic forecasting agency Oxford Economics also found that Singapore will have to confront the biggest mismatch between skills and jobs created among the countries in the region.Advertisement 











The findings were released on Wednesday (Sept 12) on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nations), a high-level gathering on innovation and entrepreneurship in Hanoi.Data showed that about one-fifth of Singapore’s full-time equivalent workforce (20.6 per cent) will have their jobs displaced by 2028. This is higher than the figures for Vietnam (13.8 per cent), Thailand (11.9 per cent), the Philippines (10.1 per cent), Indonesia (8.1 per cent) and Malaysia (7.4 per cent).In absolute numbers, however, the number of workers expected to be displaced in Singapore (500,000) trails those in Indonesia (9.5 million) and Vietnam (7.5 million), for instance.The study noted that Singapore, which is “already close to the frontier of technological progress”, has an exceptional enabling environment for innovation and digital transformation, as well as a small geographical area, and modern and upgradeable infrastructure. This means that businesses can take advantage of innovations as they become available.By contrast, the smaller job displacement in relative terms for other economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines was due to a variety of factors, including a possibly slower pace of technological change, expectations of institutional and political constraints on automation, and a challenging regulatory environment.Advertisement 











The study involved a multidisciplinary team of experts from across the region, who provided insights into the role that technology will play in various sectors and occupations. Data on 433 occupations across 21 industries was tapped to model the impact of these technological-adoption patterns on the 275 million full-time equivalent workers across the six countries by 2028.As displaced workers reskill to move into new jobs, the study suggests that Singapore faces the biggest challenge despite its highly skilled workforce.The Republic is set to confront a gap in average skill levels of 14.3 (on a scale of 100), higher than the Philippines (13.9), Vietnam (13.4), Malaysia (12.7), Thailand (8.5) and Indonesia (8.4).This, said the team behind the study, is due to Singapore’s digital transformation taking place at a faster rate than other Asean countries.The city state’s more supportive environment for investments in robotics and the Internet of Things — the global network of Internet-enabled sensors, devices and systems — will, for example, lead to a much greater displacement of production workers and labourers.Advertisement 











These low-skilled positions will be less affected in the other five countries surveyed in the next 10 years, the study said.“The majority of new job opportunities in Singapore are likely to be created in highly skilled managerial and professional roles, reflecting the growth areas of the economy. Thus, a considerable uplift is required in the overall skills composition of (the) workforce,” it added.The acute skills shortfall in the region stems largely from the areas of information technology skills including those in programming and systems evaluation (41 per cent) and operations skills such as those in installation and operations analysis (12 per cent).Asked to respond to the study’s findings on Singapore, a Manpower Ministry spokesperson said the impact of technology on jobs is often mixed: Although it may reduce the reliance on manpower in some areas, companies that are growing have to hire more workers to fill other jobs.“While keeping an eye on the impact of technology, including artificial intelligence, the Government’s priority is to help workers stay in employment by keeping their skills current or get back into employment quickly if they are displaced,” the spokesperson noted. “Where possible, it is better to intervene upstream before workers are retrenched.”Advertisement 











The ministry’s spokesperson added that statutory board Workforce Singapore and the economic agencies are engaging firms on their transformation plans and manpower needs, so as to support them in reskilling and redeploying workers in jobs at risk to new roles.Mr Naveen Menon, Cisco’s president for South-east Asia, told TODAY that the Government’s initiatives on education and training, such as the SkillsFuture movement for lifelong learning and Professional Conversion Programmes for mid-career switchers, reflect its efforts to help workers to reskill as labour requirements shift.Still, he acknowledged that more can always be done and “one of the key success factors is to focus on the long term”.Governments need to ensure that workers acquire skills that go beyond just technical knowledge, said Mr Menon. The key is to develop a flexible labour market that ensures citizens can transit from one occupation to another.“To do this effectively, citizens need skills like problem-solving, design and critical thinking, leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution, and empathy. In a digital future where everyone will have access to the same data and information, these skills will be the key differentiator between being employable or not,” he added.IN NUMBERSBy 2028, 28 million fewer workers in the region — more than 10 per cent of the present workforce across the six countries — will be needed to produce the same level of output as today.

Agriculture is the industry forecast to be worst hit in Asean, accounting for 9.9 million full-time equivalent workers displaced.

In Singapore, some 85,000 existing roles will disappear, pushing workers into other industries and vocations.

The wholesale and retail sector is set to face the highest levels of displacement in Singapore by 2028 (80,000 jobs), followed by manufacturing (55,000) and transport (50,000).

However, wholesale and retail is also poised to see the greatest job creation in Singapore in the same period (100,000 jobs). Manufacturing will come second (70,000 jobs), followed by finance and insurance (60,000 jobs).
