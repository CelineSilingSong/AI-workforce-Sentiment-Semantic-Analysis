When we talk about the jobs at risk, artificial intelligence is often seen as the main threat. However, this technology is still at its very beginning, while a lot of jobs are already transforming and even disappearing. Conversely, other jobs seem to resist, even if technologies already exist to replace them.
The extinction of some jobs
You don’t need to be an expert to observe how some jobs are already dying, and the supermarket cashier is one of the most typical examples. For some years, increasing numbers of cashiers have been replaced by self-checkout machines, several of which can be run by one employee… The same can be seen in the fast-food restaurants, at the cinema, at the airport, etc. More and more companies are implementing machines based on apps, tablets, printers, and more, replacing people formerly in charge of the ordering, registering or payment processing. The remaining employees only check the machines and assist customers if needed.
The disappearance of these jobs has nothing to do with the rise of artificial intelligence, as the technologies used have been on the market for a while. More precisely, any job based on delimited tasks, following a specific order, and making predefined choices could already be replaced by the existing technologies.
This is not a new phenomenon. Throughout the last century, a lot of jobs were replaced by machines. Who remember the ticket punchers, aircraft listeners, lamplighters or knockers up? All of these jobs disappeared decades ago, and were being replaced by machines. Actually, they were easily replaced by machines because they were designed as clear-cut, measurable and regularly scheduled tasks. Inherited mainly from the industrial and bureaucratic era, most of these jobs were designed based on the model of the machine. At the end of the day, it was not so difficult to design machine to replace them.
Resisting the rise of automation
However, some jobs resist the rise of automation, in spite of technologies already available on the market. A good example is the librarian: Even if we can consult or buy any book online, librarians have transformed public libraries to stay relevant. The same applies for booksellers, bartenders, florists and more. For instance, in spite of the implementation of numerous automatic coffee machines in most of the public places (train stations, universities, libraries, etc.), people still go and spend time in coffee shops. In a way, the success of chains such as Starbucks can seem a bit anachronistic, as it is cheaper to buy a coffee at the automatic coffee-machine.
Of course, there are many reasons to go to the coffee-shop rather than just grabbing a cup of coffee at the automatic coffee machine, and if we put the quality of the coffee aside, one of the main reasons seems to be the social experience we live. In a 2018 book, Palaces for the People, Eric Klinenberg suggests that places such as public libraries are social infrastructures that play an increasingly important role in our social lives. In a time when people can easily feel isolated, we need more and more places to connect people – and the jobs that make them possible.
Why do some jobs resist while other are dying?
This is an important lesson about the evolution of work as it means that not all the jobs will disappear, but rather those are more based on technical and routine tasks than social ones. According to a 2013 Oxford University study, if your job participates in the making of (good) social experiences for people, you might keep your job. This is an important lesson about the evolution of work and it means that not all jobs will disappear. Plus, it is not the less-qualified jobs that are likely to disappear first, but those are more technical than social. Those who worked as “knockers up” – people paid to wake up other people by knocking at the door or the window in the morning – or the subway-system ticket puncher did important jobs, but they did not participate directly in making connections between people. In a way, most of the jobs currently at risk are facing the same issue.
Conversely, the bartender and the bookseller provide a social experience that people like. It is unlikely – this is always a risky bet to predict the future – that robots will replace the bartenders as they participate in providing a good social experience when we go to the bar or the restaurant. This is even, one might guess, one of the main reason why we go to a bar. Of course, the artificial intelligence will sooner or later affect the world of work as this technology will even be able to perform some creative and cognitive tasks or to express emotions, but we do not need to wait for it to think the future of work.
If you are doing a more technical job than a social one, then your position is at risk (except maybe if you’re doing a creative one). Not in the next 5 to 10 years, but right now. It means that some people might face unemployment, whatever the evolution of technologies. However, if one considers that the social skills will be more and more important – the technical ones can already be partly or entirely automated – qualities such as the empathy, emotional intelligence, and even kindness could well be rewarded on the job market. At the end of the day, no robot or app will replace a smile, a glance or a friendly gesture. At least, not yet.

The first-ever work original work of art created using artificial intelligence to come to auction, Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), smashed expectations at Christie’s New York this morning when it was hammered down for $350,000 after a lively bidding war that lasted for more than six minutes.
The final price, with premium, was $432,500—a whopping 4,320 percent increase from the presale high estimate of $10,000. Intense competition from bidders over the phone, in the room, and online swiftly drove the work over its $7,000 to $10,000 estimate. The action only began to slow after the price exceeded $200,000. An anonymous phone bidder won the lot after a battle between two phone bidders, an online participant in France, and one man in the room.
According to Christie’s catalogue description, the painting—”if that is the right term”—is one of a group of portraits of the fictional Belamy family created by an AI trained by Obvious, a Paris-based collective. Its members—Hugo Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel, and Gauthier Vernier—explore the fields of art and artificial intelligence using a set of algorithms that goes by the acronym GAN, which stands for “generative adversarial network.”

According to Caselles-Dupré, the algorithm used to create the work is composed of two parts: “On one side is the Generator, on the other the Discriminator,” he explained in Christie’s description of the lot. “We fed the system with a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th century to the 20th. The Generator makes a new image based on the set, then the Discriminator tries to spot the difference between a human-made image and one created by the Generator. The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. Then we have a result.”
The AI-generated work was the final lot in a prints and multiples sale at Christie’s New York that included works by Jeff Koons, Banksy, and Christo. The Obvious work was the second most expensive lot in the sale; the top lot was Andy Warhol’s suite of 10 screenprints, Myths (1981), which sold for $780,500.
Perusing the sale beforehand, curious observers might have realized something was afoot. The AI lot is the only one that doesn’t have an artist listed. Instead, the medium for the Belamy portrait is listed as “generative Adversarial Network print, on canvas, 2018, signed with GAN model loss function in ink by the publisher, from a series of eleven unique images, published by Obvious Art, Paris, with original gilded wood frame.”
The head of the prints and multiples department told The Art Newspaper that he is hardly an AI expert—in fact, he only learned about Obvious after reading an article on artnet News about a collector’s purchase of one of their works for around €10,000 ($12,000). (Considering the latest price, that somehow seems like a bargain.)
But Obvious has also attracted its fair share of critics, who contend that the hype about what AI technology can do on its own is premature—and that the current interest is driven more by speculation and novelty than deep engagement.
“People have been working with low resolution GANs like this since 2015,” Robbie Barrat, a young artist who works with AI, recently told artnet News. Barrat adds that last year, when he was 17 years old, he did a project using the exact same type of neural network and an identical data set. “No one in the AI and art sphere really considers them to be artists—they’re more like marketers,” he said.

The portrait, produced by artificial intelligence, hung on the wall opposite an Andy Warhol print and just to the right of a bronze work by Roy Lichtenstein.There were some smiles and at least one frown. Two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work, which looked as though someone had taken a sponge to a 17th-century oil portrait. The arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world’s leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly, with a nod of understanding and a sip of mezcal margarita.Christie’s is hoping for a more explosive reaction on Thursday, when the gavel comes down on “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,” formally testing the art market’s interest in AI art. The work — estimated at $7,000-$10,000 — was a collaboration by the members of Obvious, a French trio composed of a student of machine learning and two business school graduates, none of whom have a background in art. There was no paint or brushes involved, just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans — in this case, thousands of portraits spanning the 14th century to the 20th.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut is it art? Frédérique Baumgartner, an art historian at Columbia University, said the AI work raised questions about “intention and authorship,” but so, too, did artists from the past, including Marcel Duchamp (who famously made art out of a urinal). She went on to compare the portrait’s contrasting tones, coupled with the subject’s sober dress, with the old master of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt van Rijn — though she quickly added, “That’s if I look half-closing my eyes.”ImagePierre Fautrel, one of the three members of the group Obvious that made the portrait using AI, in New York last week.Credit...Nathan Bajar for The New York TimesThe unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in a culture that moves at WiFi-enabled speeds. Christie’s — which shattered auction-house records in 2017 when it sold a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting — reached out directly to Obvious this year, rather than working through a seller. (It is the only AI work in Thursday’s sale of 363 lots.)Surprisingly, the loudest criticism has come not from the art establishment but from the small but passionate community of artists who work with AI, many of whom say that what Christie’s and Obvious suggested was groundbreaking was in fact effectively AI Art 101. Ahmed Elgammal, the director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University, said that the technology used to create the work, Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, had been used by artists since around 2015. “This group was totally irrelevant,” he scoffed.Mario Klingemann, a German artist known for his work with GANs, put it bluntly. “When I saw that announcement” of the auction, he said, “my reaction was ‘you can’t be serious.’” He compared the portrait by Obvious “to a connect-the-dots children’s painting.”Richard Lloyd, the International Head of the Prints & Multiples department at Christie’s, who brought the work in, acknowledged that he hadn’t made an exhaustive search of the small but very active field of AI art. “I just responded to it and thought it’d be cool,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe added of AI art, “It’s just a personal sort of interest I’ve had for quite a few years.” He said he had been inspired by a report earlier this year that Nicolas Laugero Lasserre, a French collector, had privately purchased a portrait from Obvious, for about 10,000 euros, or about $11,400.Image“5908/79530 Self Portraits,” by Mario Klingemann, an artist working with AI who criticized Christie’s for selling the creation by Obvious.Credit...Mario KlingemannWhat struck Mr. Lloyd most, he said, was the work’s resemblance to European portraiture. “It looks like something you’d expect Christie’s to sell,” he explained. “We’re the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million.”He thought that the work Obvious was doing would be a good way to ease potential buyers at Christie’s into work made with AI. “I like the fact that it didn’t at first blush look different,” he said.Many artists and researchers who specialize in artistic applications of AI technology, while generally glad of the potential exposure the sale could bring, say that the portrait chosen by Christie’s is derivative. Codes written to produce the kind of images Obvious has made are also shared freely online among enthusiasts, raising questions of originality.For its part, Obvious acknowledges that the technology it used was gleaned from others. “It’s open source,” explained Pierre Fautrel, one of the group’s members, in an interview in New York last week. “We took a lot of different parts from different people.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe biggest difference between the Obvious portrait and their predecessors’ is the fact that Obvious had theirs printed on canvas and “signed” in the bottom right corner with a mathematical function used to produce it. They also had it extravagantly framed. “We’re introducing it to people who do not necessarily know what a GAN algorithm is,” Mr. Lloyd explained, speaking to the presentation. “It has to be, all things being equal, comparatively simple.”Image“Perception Engines,” by Tom White, another AI artist, was shown at the New Delhi gallery Nature Morte in 2018.Credit...Nature Morte, New DelhiThe opportunity to capitalize on the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence fits in with Christie’s efforts to market itself in new ways.In July it held its first Art & Tech summit, focused on the theme of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (Obvious themselves have sold art on SuperRare, an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell digital artwork using cryptocurrency.)Brick-and-mortar auction houses have been slow to accept art that explores new technologies. To be sure, Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips offer plenty of digitally generated works by blue-chip artists like Andreas Gursky and Christopher Wool. But the sort of digital video and virtual reality pieces that are featured routinely at contemporary art biennials rarely, if ever, appear at auction houses.Artists in the field are hoping that works sold at auctions like Christie’s will increasingly enter private collections. That appears to be happening more often. Earlier this year the New Delhi art gallery Nature Morte hosted what was billed as India’s first exhibition of work made entirely by AI, including works by Mr. Klingemann, Tom White, Memo Akten, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler. In December, Dr. Elgammal of Rutgers will exhibit AI art for sale at SCOPE Miami Beach, a satellite fair during the time of Art Basel Miami Beach.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWho knows what art historians of the future will say about these works and the impact of AI as a tool for artists. But Dr. Baumgartner at Columbia offered a gut response to the Obvious portrait.“It’s just so strange,” she said.A correction was made on Oct. 23, 2018: An earlier version of this article misstated where AI work will be exhibited for sale in Miami.

The development and diffusion of new information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) continue apace, but how are these factors likely to change work styles and worker well-being? More than a few observers take the view that AI will deprive workers of their employment and constitutes a threat to them. However, new information technologies such as AI might affect not simply employment and wages, but also the way workers approach their work, and could influence aspects of their well-being, such as job satisfaction, stress, and health, in a variety of ways.

Relationship between technological innovation, employment, and wages

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, economists have raised the possibility of ""technological unemployment,"" in which employment is lost as a result of technological innovation. In addition, from the 1980s onward, findings of much research by labor economists have shown that the emergence of ""skill-biased technological change,"" the benefits of which accrue only to highly skilled workers causes an increase in wage disparity. In recent years, there have been forecasts that new information technologies such as AI will deprive many of their work, and concerns that this will result in even more serious wage disparities have frequently been expressed.
However, the effects of technological innovation are not limited to employment, unemployment, and wages, but a wider range of issues, for example, on the content of tasks in which workers are engaged, on the workplace environment, and on job satisfaction, stress, and health. Since the range of tasks to which new information technologies can be applied is extraordinarily broad, there should be both positive and negative effects occurring in multiple directions.

Increased job satisfaction and stress caused by the diffusion of new information technologies

In the project of the Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency, we implemented an original survey of approximately 10,000 workers, and analyzed the impact of new information technologies on approaches to work and on well-being. One interesting outcome of this analysis is that, as shown in the Figure, the more advanced the stage of adoption for new information technologies such as AI, the larger is the increase in worker job satisfaction. Conversely, there is a tendency for work-related stress to also increase.

Figure. Changes in Well-Being and Tasks as a Result of the Introduction of New Information Technologies (Subjective Impact)

Note: These are the results of collating responses to the question of how much change has occurred (or how much change is forecasted to occur) in tasks and well-being as a result of the introduction of new information technologies


Increasing task complexity

It is likely that this is related to changes in the content of tasks in which workers are engaged. Because, as shown in the Figure, the more advanced the stage of adoption for information technologies, the greater is the shift in the nature of tasks performed by the worker from highly repetitive routine tasks to non-routine tasks that require complex problems to be resolved. This suggests that when AI technologies are adopted, there is a tendency for workers to move away from tasks that can be accomplished by such technologies, and instead use the time thus freed up to concentrate on more complex tasks that can only be performed by humans.
We interpret this as meaning that many of those workers who have experienced the introduction of new information technologies feel work-related stress as a consequence of increasing task complexity. At the same time, the more complex the work, the greater is the sense of satisfaction when it is accomplished, resulting in a rising trend for job satisfaction.
As shown in the figure, the influence of AI technologies on well-being and approaches to work is complex, it is important to conduct more analyzes on the changes brought about by the emergence and subsequent diffusion of technological innovation.

Job demands-resources model

As shown in the example analysis presented above, the spread of new information technologies may have positive effects, such as an increase in job satisfaction, but it may also cause negative outcomes such as an increase in stress, and arguably it is necessary to find some way of dealing with this issue.
In such situations the ""job demands-resources model"" developed in the occupational health studies provides a useful insight. According to this model, the stress on the worker rises as the demands of the job increase, whereas stress decreases when more resources are made available.
In this context, ""job demands"" includes the number and difficulty of tasks. This corresponds to the introduction of new information technologies, as a consequence of which task difficulty increases, and new skills and knowledge must be acquired to cope. In other words, the increase in stress shown above can be interpreted as an increase in job demands caused by the introduction of new information technologies.
On the other hand, ""job resources"" incorporates a range of factors, such as the support and leadership of line managers, assistance from and trust relationships with coworkers, and efforts made by human resource management. A variety of measures and methods to reinforce those resources is theorized to exist at the firm, workplace, individual, and other levels (Shaufeli et alia (2009), Shimazu and Shaufeli (2009)).

""Job resources"" mitigate increases in stress

We have also reviewed the nature of the influence of ""job resources"" on worker stress and mental health in the course of projects at RIETI. For example, in Kuroda and Yamamoto (2018a, 2018b, 2016), and Sato (2015), the panel data used made it clear that factors such as unambiguous work goals, the amount of individual discretion allowed, a low level of unscheduled work, a workplace culture not based on the assumption of long working hours, the volume of communication between line managers and their subordinates, and the level of ability of line managers all led to improvements in the state of worker mental health, even after controlling for wages, continuous years of service, and other individual attributes. Namely, it is precisely these factors that can be interpreted as ""job resources.""
Since new information technologies such as AI generate a positive influence on work approach and individual well-being, it would seem reasonable to facilitate the maximum possible enjoyment of such benefits. However, negative side effects such as increases in work-related stress and deterioration in health may also occur. Extracting the maximum benefit from the positive aspects of new information technologies requires that ""job resources"" be strengthened, and that side effects be minimized.

IBM is betting on it.IBM has developed a scent algorithm, and it’s coming for the fragrance aisle.by  Chavie LieberOct 24, 2018, 4:30 PM EDTFacebookLinkIBM has developed an AI called Philyra, which can create perfumes for specific customer demographics. Tetra Images/Getty ImagesThe creation of a perfume is often treated as a bespoke art. The French pride themselves on centuries in the olfactory business, and professional scent masters — often referred to as “noses” — spend decades learning the craft, apprenticing under masters. Giant cosmetic companies such as Coty and Estée Lauder write huge checks to storied fragrance agencies, which will employ meticulous perfume chemists, scrupulous in the art of aromachology.A common theme here is that the skill of developing a fragrance is extremely valuable — and extremely human. Scent is, after all, the sense that science says has the strongest ability to evoke memories, or trigger emotions and moods.Now IBM is attempting to turn the traditional model on its head by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to develop scents.Symrise, a major global fragrance company based in Germany with clients including Estée Lauder, Avon, Coty, and Donna Karan, recently tapped the tech giant to study how machine learning can be applied in the world of fragrance.IBM developed an algorithm that studies existing fragrance formulas and then compares the ingredients to other data sets, like geography and customer age. This algorithm, which was created in IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center and which the company has named Philyra, can now develop new perfumes that will target very specific market segments.Achim Daub, a Symrise executive, says the company has already sold two AI-developed perfumes to O Boticário, Brazil’s second-largest beauty store. The two scents, whose names were not shared with Vox, will start selling inside O Boticário’s 4,000 locations next year.It all sounds a bit futuristic. How exactly does the process work? And how can an algorithm understand the sensual, transformative, and personal components of choosing fragrances?How does IBM’s perfume AI work?Symrise has 1.7 million fragrance formulas that it’s collected over the years. These include scents that were sold to companies like Estée Lauder and Coty, which then market and package them as fancy perfumes, as well as flavors and concoctions used for things like toothpaste, pet food, detergent, candles, snack foods, and soda.Symrise shared this list of fragrance formulas, along with information on how they performed sales-wise, with IBM. Philyra added these to a database and compared them to additional customer data provided by Symrise, like which scents were best-sellers and where, who was buying them, and which age demographic prefers which scents the most. Philyra can then use that information to create new formulas targeted to specific demographics.A Symrise perfumer plays with fragrances created by IBM AI, Philyra. SymriseRichard Goodwin, a research scientist at IBM who is part of the team that developed Philyra, describes this artificial fragrance developer as “a system whose learned to create a fragrance like a human apprentice.”“Just like an apprentice would learn from a master what combinations of ingredients would work well, like what would be a good substitute for orange oil and when, or when to add rose oil instead of lemon, machine learning will create a fragrance based off which formula worked best,” he says.In the case of the perfumes Philyra made for Boticário, the brand asked for scents that would target millennials living in Brazil. Philyra compared formulas against scents that were popular in that area and age range and came up with two. The first, according to Symrise senior perfumer David Apel, smells like “things I only can associate with exotic cuisine … fenugreek seeds, green cardamom pods, carrot seed, all wrapped with a milky, buttery, rich base note.” The other fragrance is a fruity, floral scent — seemingly aimed at girls — and has scents of Osmanthus tea with lychee and patchouli, which Apel calls “innocent, sparkling, effervescent.”Daub says both fragrances received stellar responses from focus groups, and came out on top even when tested against other perfumes popular with Brazilian millennials.Goodwin believes Philyra is an example of how “computers can be creative.” It can quickly create a new perfume by sifting through 1.7 million data sets with ease. This is similar to other AI creations, like how a data scientist created the Meow Generator by adding thousands of photos of cats into a generative adversarial network.Daub says Symrise decided to hire IBM after reading about Chef Watson, IBM’s AI cooking app. The same supercomputer that dominated Jeopardy in 2011 made headlines for its ability to concoct new recipes in a partnership with Bon Appétit.Daub felt the mixing, brewing, and smelling components of the food world was similar to the development of commercial fragrances, and thought AI could help the company innovate. Symrise also recently invested $6 million into Phlur, the fragrance startup that sells its perfumes to customers online by pairing scents with music and photography. Daub believes AI will ultimately help the fragrance market make money by targeting “missed opportunity” in fragrance sales.He’s careful to say that Philyra won’t replace humans in the fragrance development process — not yet anyway. In the case of the two perfumes that will be sold at O Boticário, a machine developed the fragrances but a master perfumer at Symrise tweaked the product “to emphasize a certain note and improve how long it lasted on the skin,” according to Goodwin.“It’s a very human reaction to be concerned about technology replacing a human, and we’re not talking about replacing perfumers tomorrow,” says Daub. “This isn’t something to necessarily market to customers, but the internal capability is that can increase efficiency and speed.”Instead, he says Philyra will function like “an apprentice that the master perfumer will be able to work with” — which sounds a whole lot like replacing apprentice perfumers to me, but details! Symrise plans to roll out the use of Philyra into its perfume school soon.IBM’s perfume AI is the latest example of the tech industry moving into beauty and fashionIt makes sense for Symrise to want to increase its speed and efficiency in developing fragrances: There’s plenty of money to be made. The global fragrance market is worth $48 billion, per Euromonitor. Perfumes are cash cows for fashion brands because they are an accessible purchase. Most can’t afford a Chanel handbag, let alone Chanel clothing, but a bottle of Chanel No. 5 is far more attainable.Britney Spears promoting her fragrance, “Curious” in 2004 at a Macy’s in New York City. Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesFragrances are also huge business opportunities for celebrities; stars like Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears have made millions by attaching their name and image to perfumes.And algorithms now drive fashion brands big and small, from Stitch Fix to Choosy. They’ve even piqued the curiosity of huge retail giants like H&M, which wants to learn how to better predict what it will sell so that it doesn’t end up sitting on $4.3 billion worth of unsold clothes again. Skin care startups are also keen on using AI to perfect and develop personalized beauty products.The idea with all these companies is that data sets can work just as well as and often even better than people, in gathering information and developing products.Applying machine learning to the fragrance industry, for instance, could help companies dupe highly coveted scents without violating trade secrets by using an algorithm to simply tweak the formula slightly. “The outcome of this is still quite open,” Goodwin says. “Will this be used to develop fragrance formulas faster? Will we understand market successes in different parts of the world, and better be able to learn about customer preferences? Will leaner formulas be designed? We’re still halfway through exploring.”The pushback, of course, is that something as personal as beauty, fragrance, and style, served as an algorithm, can feel sterile.As Chandler Burr, a former New York Times perfume critic turned scent master, said in 2014, “perfume transforms from a merely artisanal craft to a true art because it lies. The point of art is to make people feel things, to manipulate people. The stronger and deeper the emotional and intellectual reaction is, the more successful that work of art is.”Burr describes fragrance as something that gives people “an emotional and intellectual response.” A computer can generate the formula for a best-selling perfume among a certain demographic, but does it understand why those formulas are so popular — like why perfumes that are sweet and flowery are marketed to teen girls, and why some actually prefer to push against this stereotype?There are those on the small business end of the fragrance industry who see Philyra as something that could benefit big companies but probably won’t be useful to more niche perfumers.“The technology does what could be considered by some as ‘busywork’ — the building the skeleton and main body of a fragrance,” says Julia Zangrilli, the founder of the customer fragrance company Nova. “Maybe not romantic in a classic creation sense, but this is super useful technology for big companies [because it] both identifies new pathways and saves time and labor.”Symrise doesn’t yet know whether tech like Philyra will affect the cost of perfumes, and it’s too early to tell if this type of AI can be rolled out on a large scale, to the point that everyone can get their own personalized fragrance with the press of a button. So for now, AI’s effect on customers is probably small.There will no doubt be the purists who will only want to buy fragrances that are handmade and “authentic,” but Zangrilli compares IBM’s take on perfumes to buying premade pizza —except each one is unique — and adding toppings. Perhaps it’s not the same as artisanal, bougie pizza, but it can still be delicious.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

An Artwork Made by Artificial Intelligence Just Sold for $400,000. I Am Shocked, Confused, Appalled.

          New York’s senior art critic

Last night Christie’s did it again! The auction house sold an iffy object for an astronomical price.
Last year the company sold a portrait for $450 million that was said to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci — a work many now suspect might have been painted by a studio assistant or a follower, at best, or even only an adept copyist with major assists from recent over-restoration and an all-out Christie’s worldwide public-relations campaign. This time something estimated to go for $7,000 to $10,000 was hammered down at more than 40 times that already inflated price, $432,000. The work? What Christie’s claimed was the “first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.”
Before it was sold to an anonymous phone bidder in France, it was obvious that Christie’s smelled a payday in the making from the painting, called Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy. The house publicized the work as being “on canvass” and “in a gilded frame,” granted interviews, spread information, contacted press and clients, held tony private viewings and public showings — and installed the work between Warhol and Lichtenstein to pump the price and bestow cred. In this world, stagecraft really works. Within days Christie’s has been able to pass off something probably never seen by the buyer in the flesh, or researched at all and falsely touted as “the first” of its kind, on someone willing to take the bait. This opens the gates for more of the same. Mission accomplished, Christie’s.
The work was made by a French group of students of “machine learning” and “business school.” They go by the fitting name Obvious. (You can’t make this stuff up.) The picture is a typical computer-printed ink-on-canvass image. Visually, surface- and scale-wise, it is like every other image/painting/print like this that I’ve ever seen — 100 percent generic. This one depicts a blurry portrait of a man dressed in all black with a stark white collar. He has olden-style longish dark hair in a pageboy cut. All unfinished around the edges, resembles a fuzzy 17th-century Dutch portrait. In the New York Times someone already compared it to a Rembrandt. Really, it’s a poster.
The method used to make the poster has been widely used in and out of the art world for a long time. It is an open-source program called GAN. Obvious fed a computer around 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th century. The machine was then programmed to then create an optical common denominator from the data and print it out. Click print, done.
The Christie’s bigwig who brought the work to auction says he knew nothing about so-called “AI art,” quipping, “I just responded to it and thought it was cool.” He then chirped, “We’re the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million.” Indeed, Christie’s told the Times that this is “a good way to ease buyers … into works made with AI.” So much for integrity, scholarship, research, and transparency.
What makes this sale totally bogus is not only that the poster looks like a lousy 1950s Larry Rivers painting, or that as far back as the 1970s Sol LeWitt was generating written instructions that others used to make his art, or  that the process used here is a standard art student and computer-programmer exercise — it’s that these algorithmic programs and codes have been in use for a very long time to make the exact same looking things. Some of them are “on canvass” and in “gilded frames.” An expert in the field rightly scoffed that the Christie’s work is “AI Art 101.”
They’re right. I’ve seen the process done with landscapes, flowers, dogs, movie stars, clouds, buildings, and food. This poster is an individual image, but it’s not unusual to see it done in grids or series of images printed out. People have done it with Hollywood blockbusters arranged by superhero, color, setting, and even credits. It’s been done with porn films that render one Ur-orgy, superstar, or set of sexual fetishes. I’ve seen every abstract painting reduced to one meta-abstraction and seen it done with these same abstract paintings morphing endlessly one into the next like a hypnotic screensaver. Benjamin Edwards has been doing it in paintings since the late 1990s — compiling all the Starbucks in Seattle, for example, into one wild structure. Artists Jason Salavon and the late Jeremy Blake were doing this sort of thing in video and painting back then too. Julie Mehretu’s paintings are said to be handmade versions of the same visual overlay strategies. Really, this generic tic has never not been around since these sorts of digital files, compiled pictures, found footage, and captured images became a genre. World famous photographer Thomas Ruff has made, shown, and sold pictures like this for almost 20 years. In other words, it is a flat-out lie that this is the “first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.” The question is, why did so many collectors go crazy for it?

            “Edmond de Belamy” has made history as the first work of art produced by artificial intelligence to be sold at auction. 
    

            The slightly blurry canvas print, which has been likened to works by the Old Masters, sold Thursday for $432,500 – dramatically exceeding its original estimate of $7,000-$10,000 – at a Christie’s auction in New York.

            “Christie’s continually stays attuned to changes in the art market and how technology can impact the creation and consumption of art,” Richard Lloyd, international head of prints and multiples at Christie’s, said in a statement before the auction. 
    

            “AI has already been incorporated as a tool by contemporary artists and as this technology further develops, we are excited to participate in these continued conversations. To best engage in the dialogue, we are offering a public platform to exhibit an artwork that has entirely been realized by an algorithm.”

            While the print is signed “min G max D x [log (D(x))] + z [log(1 – D (G(z)))]” after a section of the algorithm’s code, it was conceived by Obvious, a Paris-based trio fascinated by the artistic potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
    

            Though none come from an art background, friends Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier first started experimenting with art and machine learning last year. 
    

            “We saw algorithms were capable of creating new images, and we were astonished by the potential they had,” Vernier said.

            To produce “Edmond de Belamy” and the 10 other portraits in the “La Famille de Belamy” series, Obvious fed a two-part algorithm 15,000 images of portraits from different time periods. After reviewing these submissions, the first part of the algorithm began generating its own portraits, trying to create original works that could pass as man-made.

            “All the data has similarities, so common features. So, first algorithm creates new examples of those images and tries to fool the second algorithm into thinking that those pictures created are, actually, real portraits, so human-made,” Vernier said.       
    

            “We’re looking at these portraits the same way a painter would do it. Like walking in a gallery, taking some inspiration. Except that we feed this inspiration to the algorithm, and the algorithm is the part that does the visual creation.” 
    






""Le Comte de Belamy"" is one of 10 portraits that comprise Obvious' ""La Famille de Belamy"" series.

            While inventive, this approach hasn’t been without critics. Many working in the field of art and artificial intelligence criticized or dismissed Obvious’ inclusion in the Christie’s sale since the type of algorithm used – generative adversarial networks, or GANs – have been used by artists for years.
    

            Speaking to The New York Times ahead of the auction, Mario Klingemann, an artist known for his work with machine learning, likened “Edmond de Belamy” to “a connect-the-dots children’s painting.”

            But in light of the auction result, it’s likely Obvious will remain undaunted by naysayers. Their work has raised interesting points around the nature of human creation – and clearly caught the attention of the world’s collectors.
    

            “I think (artificial intelligence) has its place in the art world because it tries to replicate what any artist would do, like trying to create from what he knows,” Vernier said. “It forces you to try to understand your own creativity and how you would be able to replicate it.”

The future won’t be made by either humans or machines alone – but by both, working together. Technologies modeled on how human brains work are already augmenting people’s abilities, and will only get more influential as society gets used to these increasingly capable machines.
Technology optimists have envisioned a world with rising human productivity and quality of life as artificial intelligence systems take over life’s drudgery and administrivia, benefiting everyone. Pessimists, on the other hand, have warned that these advances could come at great cost in lost jobs and disrupted lives. And fearmongers worry that AI might eventually make human beings obsolete.
However, people are not very good at imagining the future. Neither utopia nor doomsday is likely. In my new book, “The Deep Learning Revolution,” my goal was to explain the past, present and future of this rapidly growing area of science and technology. My conclusion is that AI will make you smarter, but in ways that will surprise you.
Recognizing patterns
Deep learning is the part of AI that has made the most progress in solving complex problems like identifying objects in images, recognizing speech from multiple speakers and processing text the way people speak or write it. Deep learning has also proven useful for identifying patterns in the increasingly large data sets that are being generated from sensors, medical devices and scientific instruments.
The goal of this approach is to find ways a computer can represent the complexity of the world and generalize from previous experience – even if what’s happening next isn’t exactly the same as what happened before. Just as a person can identify that a specific animal she has never seen before is in fact a cat, deep learning algorithms can identify aspects of what might be called “cat-ness” and extract those attributes from new images of cats.



Deep learning systems can tell which of these is a cat.

The methods for deep learning are based on the same principles that power the human brain. For instance, the brain handles lots of data of various kinds in many processing units at the same time. Neurons have many connections to each other, and those links strengthen or weaken depending on how much they’re used, establishing associations between sensory inputs and conceptual outputs. 
The most successful deep learning network is based on 1960s research into the architecture of the visual cortex, a part of the brain that we use to see, and learning algorithms that were invented in the 1980s. Back then, computers were not yet fast enough to solve real-world problems. Now, though, they are. 
In addition, learning networks have been layered on top of each other, creating webs of connections more closely resembling the hierarchy of layers found in visual cortex. This is part of a convergence taking place between artificial and biological intelligence.

Deep learning in real life
Deep learning is already adding to human capabilities. If you use Google services to search the web, or use its apps to translate from one language to another or turn speech into text, technology has made you smarter, or more effective. Recently on a trip to China, a friend spoke English into his Android phone, which translated it to spoken Chinese for a taxi driver – just like the universal translator on “Star Trek.”

These and many other systems are already at work, helping you in your daily life even if you’re not aware of them. For instance, deep learning is beginning to take over the reading of X-ray images and photographs of skin lesions for cancer detection. Your local doctor will soon be able to spot problems that are evident today only to the best experts. 
Even when you do know there’s a machine involved, you might not understand the complexity of what they’re actually doing: Behind Amazon’s Alexa is a bevy of deep learning networks that recognize your request, sift through data to answer your questions and take actions on your behalf. 
Advancing learning
Deep learning has been highly effective at solving pattern recognition problems, but to go beyond this requires other brain systems. When an animal is rewarded for an action, it is more likely to take similar actions in the future. Dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia of the brain report the difference between expected and received rewards, called reward prediction error, which is used to change the strengths of connections in the brain that predict future rewards. 
Coupling this approach, called reinforcement learning, with deep learning can give computers the power to identify unexpected possibilities. By recognizing a pattern and then responding to it in a way that yields rewards, machines might approach behaviors along the lines of what might be called human creativity. This coupled approach is how DeepMind developed a program called AlphaGo, which in 2016 defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol and the following year beat the world Go champion, Ke Jie. 
Games are not as messy as the real world, which is filled with shifting uncertainties. Massimo Vergassola at the University of California, San Diego, and I recently used reinforcement learning to teach a glider in the field how to soar like a bird in turbulent thermals. Sensors can be attached to actual birds to test whether they use the same cues and respond the same way. 
Despite these successes, researchers do not yet fully understand how deep learning solves these problems. Of course, we don’t know how the brain solves them either. 
While the brain’s inner workings may remain elusive, it is only a matter of time before researchers develop a theory of deep learning. The difference is that when studying computers, researchers have access to every connection and pattern of activity in the network. The pace of progress is rapid, with research papers appearing daily on arXiv. Surprising advances are eagerly anticipated this December at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Montreal, which sold out 8,000 tickets in 11 minutes, leaving 9,000 hopeful registrants on the waiting list.
There is a long way to go before computers achieve general human intelligence. The largest deep learning network today has only the power of a piece of human neural cortex the size of a rice grain. And we don’t yet know how the brain dynamically organizes interactions between larger brain areas.
Nature already has that level of integration, creating large-scale brain systems capable of operating all aspects of the human body while pondering deep questions and completing complex tasks. Ultimately, autonomous systems may become as complex, joining the myriad living creatures on our planet.

Christie’s Is First to Sell Art Made by Artificial Intelligence, But What Does That Mean?

On Thursday, the AI-generated “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” sold for $432,500—some 45 times its estimated value—in a sale trumpeted by Christie’s as the first auction to feature work created by artificial intelligence.
It’s a moment likely to be marked in the timeline of both AI and art history, but what, exactly, does the sale signify? For the AI community, the Verge’s James Vincent writes in the days preceding the bidding war, the auction provoked controversy among those who argued that the humans behind the canvas (a trio of 25-year-olds best known as the Paris-based art collective Obvious) relied heavily on 19-year-old Robbie Barrat’s algorithms yet failed to sufficiently credit him.

Then again, the entire draw of the otherwise mundane portrait is its attribution to an intimidating mathematical equation:





If the work was truly authored by this string of numbers and letters, does it matter who built and trained the AI? And, given the relatively blurred, imprecise vision the portrait—which Vulture art critic Jerry Saltz scathingly describes as “100 percent generic”—offers of its dour-looking subject, does “Edmond Belamy” even deserve a place in the art history canon?
There are no straightforward answers to these questions. The boundaries between AI, artists and AI-produced art are still amorphous, a fact readily exemplified by the current conflict between Obvious and Barrat. But before diving into the issue at hand, it’s worth revisiting the basics of the technology at the heart of this debate.
Back in August, Hugo Caselles-Dupré, one of Obvious’ three co-founders, outlined the collective’s creative process to Christie’s Jonathan Bastable. As he explained, Edmond and the sprawling network of Belamys depicted in a series of family portraits emerged thanks to a machine-learning algorithm known as the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). American AI researcher Ian Goodfellow developed GAN in 2014, and as TIME’s Ciara Nugent notes, the rough French translation of “Goodfellow”—bel ami—provided the inspiration for the fictional family’s name.
Obvious’ GAN consists of two parts: the Generator, which produces images based on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries, and the Discriminator, which attempts to differentiate between manmade and AI-generated works.
“The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits,” Caselles-Dupré said. “Then we have a result.”
The Verge’s Vincent likens the training process to tricking a bouncer at a club. At first, a drunk individual may not be able to act sober enough to gain entry, but with enough practice, an inebriated person’s performance may convince a bouncer to change their tune.
“The networks know how to copy basic visual patterns, but they don’t have a clue how they fit together,” Vincent writes. “The result is imagery in which boundaries are indistinct, figures melt into one another, and rules of anatomy go out the window.”
Barrat, a recent high school graduate now conducting research at a Stanford University AI research lab, has been at the forefront of this algorithm-powered revolution, which is tentatively termed GANism. In an interview with the Washington Post’s Meagan Flynn, Barrat explains that he started experimenting with the technology two years ago, first training GAN to produce original rap songs based on a set of 6,000 Kanye West lyrics and later expanding to surreal landscapes and nude portraits.
After fine-tuning his code, Barrat uploaded it to the sharing platform GitHub, where it was freely available to aspiring AI artists like Caselles-Dupré and the remaining members of his three-man team, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier. GitHub exchanges between Barrat and Obvious further speak to the former’s contributions, with Caselles-Dupré repeatedly asking Barrat to tweak the code.
It’s worth noting, too, that Tom White, a New Zealand-based academic and AI artist, conducted tests designed to compare Barrat’s model with those produced by Obvious. As he tells the Verge, the series of Barrat portraits produced by the analysis look “suspiciously close” to that of Edmond Belamy.
(You can judge for yourself below.)


Caselles-Dupré readily acknowledges that Obvious drew heavily on Barrat’s work, but he tells the Verge the collective tweaked the algorithm to develop a unique portrait style.
“If you’re just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified,” Caselles-Dupré says. “But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there.”
Obvious’ borrowed code isn’t the only factor contributing to AI art world ire. As the New York Times’ Gabe Cohn writes, many members of the community find the Belamy portraits wholly underwhelming. Vincent points out that critics have further identified technical shortcomings, including low resolution and smeared textures.
In an interview with Cohn, Mario Klingemann, a German artist who has worked extensively with GANs, likened “Edmond” to a “connect-the-dots children’s painting.”
Speaking separately with the Post’s Flynn, Klingemann added, “It’s horrible art from an aesthetic standpoint. You have to put some work into it to call it art. … You have to put your own handwriting on it, make your own mark with these tools. That takes some learning and work and finding something different to say.”
Still, the debate over authorship barely begins to address larger questions of AI autonomy. Christie’s has been quick to capitalize on the Belamy portrait’s singular status, defining its medium with a heady catch-all description: “generative Adversarial Network print, on canvas, 2018, signed with GAN model loss function in ink by the publisher, from a series of eleven unique images, published by Obvious Art, Paris, with original gilded wood frame.” Obvious itself initially marketed the work as “created by artificial intelligence,” but Caselles-Dupré tells the Verge he now regrets using such definitive language.
Jason Bailey, the digital art blogger behind Artnome, explains why such phrasing is misleading, arguing that “anyone who has worked with AI and art realizes” algorithms are tools, not active collaborators or autonomous agents.
Regardless of Edmond Belamy’s true nature, the Christie’s sale marks a turning point. As a specific example of AI-generated art, it isn’t the revolution of Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain”—an actual urinal turned on its side that sparked the rise of modern and conceptual art—but the kind of work the painting (if you can call it that) represents certainly points to a departure from traditional definitions of art. And, judging by the hefty price tag seen at yesterday’s auction, collectors with large pockets, at least, certainly seem ready to embrace the burgeoning field of AI-led art.

Gellerson for The New York TimesBy Jane L. LevereOct. 25, 2018This year, three Washington-based museums of the Smithsonian Institution deployed a half-dozen four-feet-tall, humanoid robots, nicknamed Pepper, to answer visitors’ questions and tell stories, using voice, gestures and an interactive touch screen. They also dance, play games and pose for selfies.Rachel Goslins, director of the Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building and overseer of the robots’ deployment, said she has been “blown away” by visitors’ reactions to them.Pepper, she added, “feels totally aligned with the museums’ mission. We are asking people to be present, engaged, to have a communal experience. We’re not making you look at your phone even more; we’re creating a playful, joyful human experience.” She said 80 more robots eventually would be rolled out, helping to guide the work of the Smithsonian’s educators and docents.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT(The museums using Pepper are the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and National Museum of African Art, as well as the Smithsonian Castle, which is using eight robots, four of which can travel elsewhere.) The robot was created by SoftBank Robotics.The Smithsonian venture into artificial intelligence to engage visitors is just one example in a rapidly moving trend mixing art and technology.The Museums Special SectionDark Awakening: Many artists are dimming the lights of their museum shows, for a mix of symbolic and spiritual reasons.A Story Told in 183 Canvases: A 122-foot-long painting by Noah Saterstrom explores mental illness.Striking a Balance: In a biennial between two museums on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, artists tell fresh stories of their homeland.Exploring History: In North Miami, the Haitian artist Manuel Mathieu weaves the personal and the political.More on Museums: Institutions are striving to offer their visitors more to see, do and feel.Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used today by museums of all sizes worldwide, which employ it to develop everything from robots, chatbots and websites, to tools that help them analyze visitor data and their collections, and determine admission policies and exhibition content.ImageThe Dot kiosk at the Akron Art Museum.Credit...via Akron Art MuseumThe Akron Art Museum is encouraging visitors to use their phones to interact with Dot, its chatbot digital tour guide, which sports dark glasses and a pink pageboy. Introduced in August, Dot is accessible by the Facebook Messenger platform; when visitors enter the museum, they are directed to a kiosk that explains how Dot works.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTShe takes visitors on a six-stop “choose your own adventure” tour of the museum’s permanent collection, discussing 60 works of art and asking visitors questions. In front of a Sol LeWitt mural in the museum’s lobby, for example, she explains that LeWitt did not personally paint the mural but that a drafter did. She calls this process delegating, and asks, “What part of your job do you wish you could assign to someone else?”Mark Masuoka, director of the museum, called Dot “a great way to connect people with art and each other. And she doesn’t require prior knowledge of the artwork.” He said the museum would analyze usage of the chatbot, which he said could help it make “more informed decisions about how we want to develop projects and exhibitions.”The Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro collaborated with IBM to develop an IRIS+ chatbot that uses IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence technology and was introduced last year.ImageThe Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro.Credit...Buda Mendes/Getty ImageOn arrival, museum visitors receive a card embedded with a chip to use IRIS+. When they finish touring the core exhibition, IRIS+ asks, via an iPad, “After everything you learned in the main exhibition, what are your concerns in today’s world?”During the conversation that follows, the app exchanges data with IBM’s cloud and suggests initiatives suited to the visitors’ concerns, basing these, in part, on personal information the visitors are invited to provide, such as their date of birth and where they live.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVisitors also are encouraged to take a selfie for a wall at the end of the core exhibition. This wall displays visitors’ photographs, along with their first names and personal interests; the wall also tracks and graphically displays all visitors’ top concerns.The Barnes Foundation used artificial intelligence when it introduced a new collection website last year, as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of its move to downtown Philadelphia.Emulating the criteria the museum’s founder, Albert C. Barnes, used to display his art collection in ensembles, the new website lets visitors search the collection by visual properties, such as light, line, color and space, filtering images according to aesthetic similarities. More than 2,000 of the roughly 3,000 works in the Barnes’s collection have been published on the site. The number of visitors going to the Barnes’s website has tripled since the new collection display was introduced, according to Shelley Bernstein, the museum’s consulting creative technologist.ImageA project, enron.email, which was developed by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain and explores the more than 100,000 emails relating to Enron’s corporate fraud, is at the New Museum in New York.Credit...Sam Lavigne and Tega BrainThe New Museum in New York, which was founded in 1977 to exhibit new works by living artists, has also worked often with artificial intelligence. Rhizome, an affiliate of the museum since 2003 that is dedicated to what it calls “born-digital art and culture,” recently commissioned a project, enron.email, which was developed by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain and explores the more than 100,000 emails relating to Enron’s corporate fraud. Working with Nokia Bell Labs through NEW INC, the museum’s incubator, is Fei Liu, an artist who is teaching robots how to play simple games as a way to better understand the human capacity for empathy. NEW INC is also working with Channel Studio, a group of artists that is mining two decades of original music to make new interactive apps to create compositions.The Museum of Modern Art is using artificial intelligence to analyze visitors’ comments, while The Broad in Los Angeles is using it to analyze visitors’ behavior, such as ticket and gift shop purchases and website visits. Diana Pan, chief technology officer of MoMA, which is now undergoing expansion, said the data produced by artificial intelligence could help it determine new signage and navigation requirements. Heather Hart, director of information technology for The Broad, said the data it collects could not only help it improve ticket distribution and exhibition planning, but also possibly what it sells in its gift shop and publishes in its newsletter.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTArtificial intelligence has allowed the Art Institute of Chicago to track how long visitors stay in its galleries, leading it to offer more small exhibitions focusing on its permanent collection.And A.I. is aiding the conservation and attribution efforts of Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. He is developing tools that allow visitors to his museum’s website — which contains over 300,000 digital photographs of objects in its collection — to use artificial intelligence when they try to make comparisons among these objects, exploring, for example, all works — beside the museum’s famous Vermeer painting of a milkmaid — of women preparing food.Another possible application of artificial intelligence, according to Elizabeth Merritt, director of the American Alliance of Museums’ Center for the Future of Museums, could be the ability of visitors to interact with historical figures at history museums, through chatbots developed using the figures’ published writings and archives, as well as oral histories.Robert Stein, executive vice president and chief program officer of the American Alliance of Museums, warned that museums must be aware of privacy issues as they use artificial intelligence, for example, protecting whatever personal information their visitors provide.“Any time you talk about an emerging technology, museums have an important role to play teaching the public about it. Artificial intelligence is going to be incredibly important in shaping the world we live in, in profound ways. We need to understand the technology and the issues it raises,” added Ms. Merritt.A correction was made on Oct. 26, 2018: Because of an editing error, a picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the name of an art museum. It is the Akron Art Museum, not the Akron Museum of Art.An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Channel Studio is working with Nokia Bell Labs through NEW INC.

On Thursday, it sold for well over double the price realized by both those pieces combined.“Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy” sold for $432,500 including fees, over 40 times Christie’s initial estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The buyer was an anonymous phone bidder.The bidding late this morning lasted just under seven minutes, during which the buyer competed against an online bidder in France, two other phone bidders and one person in the room in New York. When the hammer came down, the bids had reached $350,000, the final price before fees.The distorted portrait, by the French art collective Obvious, was marketed by Christie’s as the first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It is an exciting moment,” Obvious said in a statement. “Our hope is that the spotlight on this sale will bring forward the amazing work that our predecessors and colleagues have been producing.”The auction was inspired by a sale earlier this year, in which the French collector Nicolas Laugero Lasserre bought a portrait directly from the collective for about 10,000 euros, or about $11,400.The Andy Warhol print that hung across from the portrait last week sold for $75,000; the Roy Lichtenstein work sold for $87,500. Both prices include fees. Those two pieces were part of the same sale as “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.” (The sale included 363 lots.)Auctioning the work seemed to be a test by Christie’s of the traditional art market’s interest in AI art. But the strongest response after the announcement of the auction came from other artists who work with AI, many of whom have said that the portrait is unoriginal. Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, the technology used to create the portrait, have been used in art since around 2015, including by the artists Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler and Robbie Barrat. Obvious first started gaining attention earlier this year.Much discussion over the past few days has centered on Mr. Barrat, an artist who said that code he had written and shared online was used in the production of “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.” Obvious told the technology website The Verge on Tuesday that it did use Mr. Barrat’s code, but modified it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We would like to thank the AI community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm,” Obvious said in its statement today. “And artist Robbie Barrat, who has been a great influence for us.”A version of this article appears in print on Oct. 27, 2018, Section C, Page 3 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

DW spoke to technologists and historians to better understand some of the technological and societal upheavals humanity is facing.https://p.dw.com/p/36j4uCopy linkImage: picture-alliance/dpa/TUAdvertisementDoes technology favor tyranny? That's one of the surprising — and unsettling — questions Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari asks in his much-quoted new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.
Whereas 20th-century technology favored democracies as they were able to distribute power to make decisions among many people and institutions, according to Harari, artificial intelligence (AI) might make centralized systems that concentrate all information and power far more efficient as machine learning works better with more information to analyze.
""If you disregard all privacy concerns and concentrate all the information relating to a billion people in one database,"" Harari writes, ""you'll wind up with much better algorithms than if you respect individual privacy and have in your database only partial information on a million people.""
The rise of AI swinging the pendulum from democracies toward authoritarian regimes is just one of the feared adverse impacts of technologies: Others include job displacement, concentration of power, diminishing privacy, rising income inequality and losing our ""free will."" Yet most people have little or no knowledge about how AI, blockchain, the Internet of Things or genetic engineering could affect their lives.""The conflict between democracy and dictatorship is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems,"" not ethical ones, says Yuval Noah Harari. The historian also wrote the international bestsellers 'Sapiens' and 'Homo Deus'Image: picture alliance/dpa/NurPhoto/J. Nicholson
As there's reason to believe that these technological trends and transformations will pose existential challenges for humankind over the next decades, it makes sense to put them into a wider perspective, thereby hopefully creating some clarity.
After all, ""if the future is decided in our absence,"" as Harari puts it, ""we won't be exempt from the consequences.""
Industrial revolutions vs ""information revolutions""
At the Oslo Innovation Week in September, an annual conference in the Norwegian capital, Oxford University researcher and author Chris Kutarna offered some historical context. His key message: The prevailing ""micro view"" of history, which focuses on economic forces like capital and technology as well as industrial revolutions as the main drivers of progress, is too narrow to understand and navigate the forces currently changing our world as we know it.Big leaps forward: over the past 250 years, humanity 'progressed' thanks to inventions like the steam engine, the assembly line and the Internet. During the current fourth industrial revolution, sometimes called Industry 4.0, the speed of change is unprecedented
A ""macro view,"" in contrast, reveals four ""information revolutions"": The first one, starting some 100,000 years ago, was speech; Then came writing, then print, and now digital, which is by far the most impactful.
Each of these revolutions allowed humanity to mine more information, turn this information into knowledge and, consequently, improve overall quality of life. The corresponding dramatic increase in average life expectancy over the past half century, according to Kutarna, is a much better indicator of humanity's development than GDP growth or technological advances.Similar to the Renaissance in Western societies, sparked by the advent of the printing press in the 15th century, Kutarna today sees humanity in the middle of a similar contest for the ""values and the ideas that are going to govern the future for generations to come""Image: Oslo Business Forum/S. A. Rasmussen
""It's how technology interacts with law, ethics, politics and other important drivers of societal change that ultimately shapes the future we live in,"" Kutarna told DW in a Skype interview after the conference.
Technology, Kutarna said, ""is not the panacea;"" so-called dual-use technology like atomic power, for instance, was once deemed the secret to abundant energy. Now, countries are now phasing it out because of the ecological and military risks associated with it. In other words: New technology might solve a few problems, but it always creates new challenges, too.
Unprecedented speed of change
Since 1971, the number of transistors per square inch has doubled approximately every two years, an observation known as Moore's Law. Although computing power, which underpins most technological progress including artificial intelligence, has therefore doubled about 32 times, the speed of change is — by and large — not dramatic yet.
This moderate growth is one reason technology can probably do less right now than you think. Another, perhaps, is that science fiction movies make us believe robots are more advanced than they actually are. But as we're entering the next decade, the speed of change will accelerate so fast that technology will quickly do more than you probably think in more places.New research from McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) on five categories of AI — computer vision, natural language, virtual assistants, robotic process automation and advanced machine learning — suggests that by 2030, some 70 percent of companies will adopt at least one type of AI technology, and that AI could create a $13 trillion (€11 trillion) uptick in the world economyImage: picture-alliance/dpa/S. Shaver
And as it starts evolving at a pace humans were not evolved to move forward at, the social consequences could be far more wrenching than in past transitions like the first industrial revolution, when humans had multiple human generations to adapt.
Arguably no other technology reflects these rapid changes more than artificial intelligence. In certain areas like vision, speech, language and cognition, AI has already achieved or surpassed human abilities. Computer vision, for example, is now better than human vision at detecting differences and identifying things like different types of dogs.
Current discussions on ethical challenges raised by intelligent systems, for instance what autonomous vehicles ought to do when faced with unavoidable accidents, and the often hectic efforts to address them are also indicative of societies' and regulators' struggle to rein in ever-faster technological advancements.
""It's important to consider the impact of technology on not just the best-case outcome but the worst-case outcome of systems as we design them,"" Amber Baldet, founder of blockchain-based decentralized app store Cloyvr, told DW during Oslo Innovation Week.
Although most experts acknowledge that technology carries the philosophies of those who create it, the big companies that develop algorithms are slow to identify or correct biases, for example. Case in point: in September, German software giant SAP was only the first European technology company to introduce ""guiding principles"" and an external advisory board on AI ethics. In the US, Microsoft and Google are among the smaller number of companies building formal ethics principles and processes.""We often take for granted that much of the Internet as we know it was developed in the West and has been a democratizing force in carrying open information,"" Amber said. ""It is not necessarily true that all technology will operate thusly""Image: Oslo Innovation Week
Yet there are signs of a heightened awareness and a sense of urgency: Earlier this month, for instance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced a $1 billion (€860 million) initiative to ""address global opportunities and challenges"" presented by AI.
(When) are robots coming for our jobs?
Although artificial intelligence and automation will leave no area of life untouched, the job market will presumably be affected most profoundly. At Oslo Innovation Week, former US President Barack Obama warned that ""people fear getting left behind and seeing their economic and social status decline. This breeds fear and resentment.""""We need to compensate for some of the harshness and rapidity of change by creating stabilizers in our social and economic arrangements,"" Obama told a crowd of 3,000, citing examples like social welfare, education, eradicating poverty and the SDGs. ""Without that,"" he added, ""those imbalances over time will break the system""Image: Oslo Business Forum/A. Eriksson
Similarly, Israeli academic Yuval Noah Harari talks about the emergence of a ""useless class"" by 2050 — the consequence of a ""shortage of jobs or a lack of relevant education"" and ""insufficient mental stamina to continue learning new skills.""
While a dystopian future like a 'two-class-society' is anything but predictable, it's fairly certain that, in the near term, lines of work are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.
A decade or so out, however, we'll likely see big shifts in the job market. In a 2017 report, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that by 2030, up to a third of the American workforce will have to switch to new occupations or upgrade skills. Automation and AI will undoubtedly lift productivity and economic growth; eventually, however, it might even cause 'white-collar' jobs that demand high expertise and ingenuity to gradually disappear.AI and automation will presumably increase the demand for technological, social and emotional, and higher cognitive skills, while reducing demand for physical and manual skills and basic cognitive skills. Under most scenarios, more jobs will be gained than lost due to AI and automation. Still, millions worldwide may need to switch occupations
While almost every human job is threatened to some extent, the predictable ones, i.e. those that are manually or cognitively repetitive, are particularly vulnerable to automation. Let's take two occupations from my industry to illustrate this: Editors, on the one hand, have a low risk at losing their jobs to computers as their work is typically creative and non-repetitive; technical and financial writers, on the other hand, are already being replaced as more and more of their repetitive, data-driven stories are written by AIs.
Another set of occupations changing in value are highly paid radiologists and poorly paid nurses. As well-trained AI will presumably be much better at detecting tumors in the not-so-distant future, radiology will ultimately decline in value; in contrast, jobs like nurses will rise in value as humans will likely have an edge over machines when it comes to empathy — at least for a few more decades.
Where to go from here
In Oslo, Oxford researcher Chris Kutarna said humanity needed to adopt ""new values and behaviors"" — societal incentives for collaborative behavior, the ""courage to act now like society should 20 years from now,"" metaphorical language that's ""more precise"" than words like 'disruption' and ""redrawing old mental constructs"" similar to when humanity realized it needs a new world map after Columbus discovered the Americas during his quest for Asia.
""Above all, we need to work on being skills like compassion,"" the Oxford scholar told DW. ""Only then can we actually enact some of the big changes that are required.""
Other well-known thinkers echo Kutarna's plea. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari argues that we ought to invest at least as much time and money in ""exploring and developing human consciousness,"" particularly wisdom and compassion, as we invest in improving AI. Otherwise, AI ""might serve only to empower the natural stupidity of humans, and to nurture our worst … impulses, among them greed and hatred.""
Similarly, author and former president of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee, advocates for using AI's ""economic bounty"" to ""double down on empathy.""Are killer robots coming for us? ""There is no particular reason to believe that AI will develop consciousness as it becomes more intelligent,"" Harari writes. ""We should instead fear AI because it will probably always obey its human masters, and never rebel."" As a result, Harari says, ""it will almost certainly allow the already powerful to consolidate their power further""Image: Getty Images/AFP/C. Court
And what can we as individuals do to better cope with the challenges of the digital revolution and capitalize on its opportunities?
Education is always a good place to start. Both Kai-Fu Lee's website and brandnew findings from McKinsey Global Institute provide good overviews; if you have a little more time, consider the University of Helsinki's free online course on AI; and a reality check of the anticipated future value of occupations and skills certainly can't hurt.
It's our responsibility to know the times we're living in; and we cannot know them unless we learn at least a little bit about the technologies that shape our present. Only then can we make educated choices for the future.

The process involved feeding the algorithm a set of paintings, and having it generate an image based on the difference between its own work and the original.A section of the artwork ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy,"" created by an algorithm by French collective named OBVIOUS, at Christies in New York on Oct. 22, 2018.Timothy A.

But we found that portraits provided the best way to illustrate our point, which is that algorithms are able to emulate creativity,” said Hugo Caselles-Dupré of Obvious.The portrait has drawn a significant amount of media attention with some speculating about what artificial intelligence means for the future of art.“AI is just one of several technologies that will have an impact on the art market of the future – although it is far too early to predict what those changes might be,” said Christie’s specialist Richard Lloyd.",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/9btOAu4C/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Painting Made by Artificial Intelligence Has Been Sold at Auction for $432,500",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-10-26T14:06:16.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/9btOAu4C.m3u8,PT1M12S,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5435683/artificial-intelligence-painting-christies/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",https://time.com/5435683/artificial-intelligence-painting-christies/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christie's 1st to auction AI portrait 











Christie's first to auction portrait created by artificial intelligence
04:38

If there was ever a question of whether the art world was ready to embrace work created by artificial intelligence, there is no longer. In the first-ever auction of its kind, a painting created by AI has sold for nearly half a million dollars. Christie's sold the piece titled the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" on Thursday to an anonymous buyer for $432,500. The auction house had initially estimated it would sell between $7,000 and $10,000.The Paris-based art collective, Obvious Art, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using a computer and algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 human-made paintings from between the 14th and 20th centuries.
""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy""  

            
                CBS News

                          
After that analysis, the computer started spitting out its own versions of portraits to run through what's called a discriminator, which tries to determine whether it was created by a computer or not. The cycle finishes when the computer can no longer tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version. 






Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, brought the portrait to the ""CBS This Morning"" studio last week and addressed questions about how this might affect human artists. ""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said.

The auction house had initially estimated it would sell between $7,000 and $10,000.The Paris-based art collective, Obvious Art, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using a computer and algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 human-made paintings from between the 14th and 20th centuries.After that analysis, the computer started spitting out its own versions of portraits to run through what's called a discriminator, which tries to determine whether it was created by a computer or not.

The threat of AI to jobs — it is a debate that won’t go away.  The Bank of England and the World Bank Chief are only two voices, in a growing network, that are concerned by the rise of AI and the loss of jobs.





This continuing question is not surprising, according to John Gikopoulos, Global Head for automation and artificial intelligence AI at Infosys Consulting: fear and uncertainty make for good headlines.

“The short answer is that no-one can accurately predict what tomorrow’s job market will look like, any more than the first observers of Stephenson’s Rocket could imagine the huge numbers of people employed by the global, multi-billion dollar railway industry of today,” explains Gikopoulos.
“We prefer to take our cue from other industrial revolutions to which we’ve somehow managed to adapt. And the most likely outcome of AI will be a positive shift in the nature of the work we do.”
“We see jobs becoming less functionary and more visionary as AI takes up the burden of repetitive processes. As we’ve described, humans will always be needed to give meaning and direction to AI. That doesn’t just mean that we’ll continue to have jobs in a world of robots – it means that our work will be more interesting and rewarding,” he says.

Getting left behind
On the flip side, one could argue, that for the millions working in the transportation industry, for example – truck drivers, taxi drivers and train drivers – the rise of AI and automation spells disaster. Will they be able to go back to university, upskill into more technical fields, ahead of students who are already studying in these technology-related areas? It is unlikely.

So, while AI can provide the opportunity to free workers up from less laborious and more innovative tasks. There is a real risk that many will be left behind.
“High-skill folks do very well in these systems, and can leverage their talents and interface with machines to extend their reach, sales, products, and services,” said then-President Obama. “Low-wage, low-skill individuals become more and more redundant, and their jobs may not be replaced, but wages will be suppressed.”
Despite the promise of new, better jobs. There is a real likelihood that AI will replace most manual tasks, and that those workers will be left behind.
Culture shift needed
The next step with AI is using the technology as an opportunity for humans to move up the value chain and get rid of these mundane jobs altogether.
“This isn’t wishful thinking: it’s an essential part of successful AI,” says Gikopoulos.
“Without ambition and creative thinking, we won’t be able to apply AI effectively to the problems that we face. That in itself is a challenge that business leaders need to solve. They need to understand how to reorient their workers’ mindsets (and, indeed, their own view of employees’ roles) to support creativity and new ways of thinking. Again – and it can’t be stressed enough – AI is only as powerful as the human understanding that puts its to work.”

Investing in artificial intelligence: What businesses need to know
To make artificial intelligence work for a business, leaders need to ensure that employee skills are honed in line with technological investments. Read here
John Gikopoulos believes that AI will create many employment opportunities, as long as business leaders are up to the challenge.

For most businesses, this will require a seismic cultural shift. “We are often fixated on core technical skills; from coding to advanced topics like data science and machine learning. But have we lost sight of the softer skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and applying insight to business strategy?”
“AI can find facts and can even recommend prescriptive or proscriptive actions – but what it can’t do is formulate a watertight strategy based on the insights it discovers. We want business leaders to foster an atmosphere of experimentation and innovation, and constantly question how they can deploy smart technologies such as AI to solve today’s challenges,” says Gikopoulos.

A couple of weeks back, my colleague Caroline Alton wrote about our work on “Made by Machine: When AI Met The Archive”, our collaboration with BBC Four to produce an hour of programming, picked from the BBC’s archive entirely automatically, using machine learning techniques. Creating a TV programme with a minimum of human intervention was an ambitious project, and one without precedent at the BBC (or, to our knowledge, elsewhere), so I’m going to take some time to outline a bit more detail on the challenges we faced, and the techniques we used to bring this idea to fruition!







BBC R&D has been developing AI to help programme makers and schedulers search the BBC’s archive, which was being used to help BBC Four curate an evening of archive programming. As part of this, Cassian Harrison, controller of BBC Four, asked us to explore what would happen if artificial intelligence then tried to create a programme. This seems like a simple-enough enquiry, but we soon realised it contains interesting subtleties - beyond the practical question of whether it’s possible, there’s also the deeper question of what it might mean for an AI to ‘create’ a programme at all - what constraints would it operate under? What would inform its decisions? What would its objective in creating this programme be?
As the project took shape, some of these questions were answered as a result of the practical constraints of making the programme. We decided early on that the programme should assemble new programmes from archive footage, learning to make decisions from a corpus of the ‘best’ or most representative BBC Four programmes we’ve produced. This would require us to identify a representative set of BBC Four programmes, and to segment them into coherent ‘scenes’, for later re-assembly by the ‘AI’.
As an experiment, we tried to do this with as little human intervention as possible, in order to see what was, and wasn’t possible and let people see the results of that. Therefore, we attempted to use machine learning to derive a measure of ‘BBC Four-ness’ which we could use to select the most representative BBC Four programmes for further processing. We did this by training a linear support vector classifier to predict whether or not a given programme was broadcast on BBC Four, based on features derived from editorial metadata about that programme (genres, summaries and synopses). This performed very well, with an overall classification accuracy of 97%. We then used this model to generate a score for each programme in our archive (using the distance from the decision boundary as the score), and picked the top 150 programmes for further processing.
The candidate programmes were split into scenes using an algorithm developed by our colleague Craig Wright from BBC R&D's AI in Production project, while he was on a graduate placement with our own data team, last year. This yielded several thousand individual scenes, which could be stitched back together into new programmes by our machine learning models.
The next question, then, was how to edit these clips back together. It was apparent that there were many approaches we could have taken, based on different algorithms and feature sets, and with very different results. However, this diversity of possible approaches seemed like an interesting opportunity to us - we could use the programme to explore and compare some of these different approaches - highlighting the ways they work (and the ways they fail) in a compelling way for an audience who might not be familiar this sort of technology. In this way, we could produce a programme that wasn’t just made by machine learning, but was about machine learning too - using the task of ‘creating a programme’ to explore some of the wider questions about these technologies and how they make decisions.
Ultimately we chose to concentrate on three approaches to teaching the machine to examine and link footage from across the vast BBC archive - object detection, subtitle analysis, and ‘visual energy’ analysis, all three of which I’ll explain now.
Our first attempt at analysing the programme segments focused on the visual. We chose to apply the work of Johnson, Karpathy and Li at Stanford University in their paper DenseCap: Fully Convolutional Localization Networks for Dense Captioning to analyse the video footage of our programmes and attempt to identify the subjects depicted on screen, via automatic image captioning.

We used these captions to build sequences - starting from a random ‘seed clip’, we would then assemble a sequence by picking clips which depicted a similar scene to the previous one, as determined by our densecap model. This was the first sequence shown in the programme. This produced some interesting results - and also failed in ways which were interesting from a narrative point of view - the machine’s propensity to mis-gender short-haired women, for instance, was an obvious example of the kind of human bias which can be reproduced by machine learning systems. However, this approach really failed to capture much about the narrative subject of our scenes, and didn’t really produce a sequence with overall coherence, leading to our second approach.

The images on screen don’t tell the whole story in a TV programme - what is on the soundtrack is equally as important to the medium’s ability to tell stories. This is especially true in documentary footage (which made up a large proportion of our corpus of programmes), due to the use of voice-over to drive the overall narrative. As a result, our machine learning models really needed to be able to understand what is said as well as what is shown within our programmes, so this is where we turned our attention for the second section of the programme. Thankfully, the vast majority of our broadcast programmes have already been transcribed (in the form of subtitles), which made this part of the process significantly easier. Using the programme subtitles, we applied various natural language processing techniques including TF-IDF and Word2Vec in order to build a model of semantic similarity between scenes based on their subtitles, and used this to build the second sequence in the programme.
This produced a number of interesting sequences, which to our eyes, appeared to have more thematic coherence than the object-detection approach. The sequence which was selected for the final programme, in particular, to me at least, has rather an interesting thread about British social history running through it - ranging from the Harold Wilson government’s building of the National Theatre, to the philosophical reflections of a Routemaster bus conductor. However, while this produced a promising sequence - we felt that our approaches so far had neglected to incorporate the aesthetic craft of TV storytelling - the way in which moving images and sound are combined to give the impression of specific feelings or sensations, as well as to show images and tell stories. As a result, for our third sequence, we attempted to build a sequence with particular affective properties, rather than a particular coherent story.

In order to do this, after some discussion with Cassian and the BBC Four team, we decided to attempt to model the amount of ‘energy’ or ‘dynamism’ in a given scene - the combination of pace of editing, and movement of camera and/or subject which can make a given scene feel relaxing or tense, melancholy or uplifting. We built a model which uses the results of the MPEG-2 video encoding process to rank scenes by their perceived dynamism, then used these ‘visual energy scores’ to map scenes to a ‘narrative curve’ - starting with low energy clips, building to a ‘peak’ of more energetic scenes, before tapering off again. This did indeed produce an interesting analysis of filmic style, and the differences between the high-and-low energy clips seemed pretty apparent (with a couple of exceptions - very grainy, archive film footage, for instance, would consistently be perceived by the machine as ‘high energy’). On it’s own though, this approach doesn’t make for particularly interesting viewing, due to the total absence of any narrative structure to the programme it produces. The question then, is whether we could combine our three approaches into a fourth approach which was greater than the sum of its parts?

This is exactly what we attempted with the fourth and final sequence in the programme. Using Long short-term memory deep neural networks, and all the feature representations learned by our previous models, we attempted to learn a sequence model from our corpus of BBC Four programmes - allowing the machine to use all the features we’d derived earlier to learn a sequencing of scenes from the actions of the (human) editors of our archive programmes. At this point the workings of the machine were both un-controllable by its human operators, but also un-interpretable - in complicated neural networks, it’s very difficult to inspect or interpret why certain decisions are made - we could simply sit back and watch, and attempt to interpret the machine’s work, in the same way as the audience of the programme.
So, did this work? in terms of producing compelling television, we’ll let you be the judge of that - at the time of writing, the programme is available to watch on BBC iPlayer. More generally though, the project was a resounding success in research terms - the techniques and technologies we use have wider application in developing products, services and tools that enable easier access to archive programmes, and the reuse of our archive in new and creative ways, a direction which we are going to continue to explore in the coming months. In addition, having the opportunity to make a TV programme has taught us loads about the TV production process, and given us plenty of ideas for future projects!

Dr. Lee is the author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order
Sinovation Ventures





Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, has two daughters. One is a fashion designer. The other is a photographer. Instead of following their father into computer science, they followed their heart, passion and skills. Lee encouraged them to do what they love because his work in making a machine more like a human has given him a unique glimpse into what separates humans from machines.

In his new book, AI Superpowers, Dr. Lee examines the race between China and Silicon Valley for the lead in artificial intelligence. I’ll leave it other columnists to dig deeper into the battle of two global superpowers. I chose to spend my conversation with Lee on the other half of his book where he explains how we can all thrive in the age of artificial intelligence.
First, the bad news. Artificial intelligence will take over human jobs. A lot of them. According to Lee, in the next fifteen years, artificial intelligence will be able to “technically” replace 40 to 50% of all jobs in the United States. Lee makes an important caveat: just because AI can replace half of all jobs, doesn’t mean it will. However, “the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and coming soon,” Lee writes.
PROMOTED
Now, the good news. And there’s plenty of it. First, there will be no robot apocalypse. Lee says we should keep that notion where it belongs—in science fiction movies. Despite all the advances in machine learning, Lee says we are “nowhere near” creating machines that have any emotion—at all. And that’s why AI has its limits.

A computer isn’t proud and jubilant when it beats a human chess or Go champion. It has no capacity to feel love, excitement, compassion, or to dream of doing something other than what it was programmed to do. It has no imagination. It cannot motivate, inspire, or instill a desire to serve others. “It in in this uniquely human potential for growth, compassion, and love where I see hope,” says Lee.

The cancer scare that changed Lee's outlook. In our conversation, Lee told me about a personal health crisis that changed the way he thought about how AI and humans will co-exist. In 2013, Lee was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma. After treatment, Lee’s cancer went into remission.
As one of the top AI researchers in the world and a venture-capital investor, Lee was a workaholic, leaving little time for family or friends. He was obsessed with building more and more powerful AI algorithms. After his cancer scare, he completely reshuffled his priorities, spending less time on social media, more time with his family, and pursuing the projects he deeply cared about. He spends more time mentoring young Chinese professionals, in addition to running one of China’s most prestigious venture capital firms, Sinovation Ventures. His cancer diagnosis also gave him a fresh perspective on the technology he had pioneered.
 Dr. Lee realized that AI will not undercut our value as long as we double-down on what makes us truly human.  “AI can handle a growing number of non-personal, non-creative, routine tasks,” Lee told me. But Lee says the skills that make us uniquely human are ones that no machine can replicate. The jobs of the future, says Lee, will require creative, compassionate, and empathetic leaders who know how to create trust, build teams, inspire service, and communicate effectively.
“People don't want to interact with robots for communication-oriented jobs,” says Lee. “They don't want to listen to robots making speeches, leading the company, giving pep talks, our earning our trust. They don’t want robots to be teachers and nurses. We will end up with the inevitable outcome that, although large numbers of routine jobs will be eliminated, large numbers of empathetic jobs will be created.”
AI creates role for compassionate caregivers. It’s in the field of medicine where Lee sees a great opportunity for AI and humans to co-exist. “I have little doubt that AI algorithms will eventually far surpass human doctors in their ability to diagnose disease and recommend treatments,” Lee writes in his book. “One response to this would be to get rid of doctors entirely…but patients don’t want to be treated by a machine, a black box of medical knowledge that delivers a cold pronouncement.”
According to Lee, the medical personnel of the future will be “compassionate caregivers.” They will be trained in using the latest diagnostic tools, and also in communication, counseling, and emotional support. Instead of dryly informing patients of their chances of survival, they’ll share encouraging stories, explain, guide and comfort patients through the treatment process.
Educating students to co-exist with AI. Lee told me that the future of AI completely disrupts how the U.S. and China teaches its students. By focusing on rote memorization, students have no chance to best a machine. Instead, says Lee, education should focus on helping students discover and nurture their creative talents. “If you’re destined to be the next Einstein, we should encourage your interest in math and science. If you're destined to a poet, painter or great philosopher, it should be encouraged, too.”
Lee says communication, teamwork, empathy and creativity must be taught as early as possible. “Those are the skills that matter in the future. No leader can be a great leader without those skills.” And that’s why Lee encouraged his daughters to pursue their passions. “They both received a good basic education [including math, science and physics], but I also made it a priority for them to become eloquent, trustworthy, and decent people who love what they do and who others like to work with.”
After thirty years of pioneering work in artificial intelligence at Google China, Microsoft, Apple and other companies, Lee says he’s figured out the blueprint for humans to thrive in the coming decade of massive technological disruption: “Let us choose to let machines be machines, and let humans be humans.”Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Carmine GalloFollowingFollowMy new book, The Bezos Blueprint, reveals leadership and communication strategies that fueled Amazon's growth.

Every other day, there is an article about artificial intelligence (AI) and recruiting that’s taking the Internet by storm, but what’s the excitement about? Is bringing AI into the recruitment industry the next big thing?
 Machine learning is about predicting the future based on the past. Through years of research and data collection, AI has emerged from the ashes of big data and predictive analysis.

A recruiter serves as the middle person between the hiring manager and the candidate. AI helps to ease the hiring pipeline and allow a company to get more done, allowing you to spend time on more important activities, like building relationships with a high-profile candidate and adding value to recruiting on a strategic level.
AI is transforming hiring by assisting HR professionals in various recruitment processes, from identifying talent to mapping behavioral assessments of candidates. In a survey conducted in 2018, 36% of candidates feel the traditional interviewing methods are too time-consuming.
Hiring using AI not only saves money and time but also leverages them so you can select people who best suit your business. AI can predict the future needs of the candidates. Then, the recruiter can influence them with attractive plans and offers.
Let me start by explaining the hiring pipeline and the impact of AI in each step.
1. Job Publishing
A standard way to approach candidates is through staffing and recruiting agencies to help them reach their dream job. The quality of your applicants depends on the initial candidates you attract with your job posting. Because this is the first phase of recruiting, AI helps you to formulate clear, detailed job descriptions that explain what exactly you are looking for in candidates.
AI will analyze the data about a company, like its corporate culture, hiring trends, and current employees, in order to determine which company can best match this particular candidate and why.
The right message to the right person at the right time is what matters. So, the job should be posted in the right place for the best exposure. AI suggests the right sources for a particular job based on complex algorithms analyzing the hit ratios and market trends to get your job exactly where the right candidates are, thereby maximizing your reach.
2. Talent Acquisition
Fifty-two percent of talent acquisition leaders say the hardest part of recruitment is screening candidates from a large applicant pool. When your job description accurately represents who you’re looking to hire, AI can identify the right hire who fits your needs.
Recruiters don’t actually recruit people. Their primary job is processing applicants. Even though AI strikes fear in automating the recruiting process, its algorithms have proven beneficial for the legal and medical fields—according to 72.8% of recruiters, who say they are struggling to find relevant candidates. AI can bridge this gap between recruiters/staffing agencies and candidates.

	



3. Candidate Screening
According to a survey by CareerBuilder, in 2006, just 5% of the recruiters were using social media screening. By 2016, it was up to 60%, and in 2017, it was 70%. This reveals the impact of social media. A recruiter spends almost 3.5 hours per day on résumé reviews and candidate screening. This time can be put to better use.
AI acts as a personal assistant to recruiters by automating many of the mundane tasks that eat up the day. One of the best ways to utilize AI is through chatbots and automated message services.
By assigning rules and triggers through chatbots and automated message services, you can automate conversations related to specific hiring or job queries and receive instant answers.
AI uses machine learning, meaning that the more data it has at its disposal, the better it becomes at predicting successful outcomes. Thus, less time will be spent on sourcing and screening, and there will be more time for building candidate relationships, developing culture, and conducting other value-added HR activities.
4. Machines as Matchmakers
In order to make the right hire, every recruiter needs his or her recruitment process to function as a well-oiled machine. With greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are in a better position to match jobseekers with better job openings. AI improves the odds of creating a great match from the beginning of the recruiting process by applying predictive algorithms to make predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to jobseekers.
To get the recruitment process right, AI algorithms are incorporated in the company’s recruitment tool. Recruiting processes, like finding candidates, résumé parsing, sending follow-up e-mails, arranging interviews, evaluating assessments, and getting feedback, are all automated.
5. Hire and Keep
Keeping track of your internal employees is just as important as getting new ones in the organization. AI remains relevant even after the actual hiring process. Pay attention to details like why employees leave companies or switch departments.
The employee experience is a great factor influencing potential candidates. According to recruiters, 48% say that better company culture attracts better prospective hires. Algorithms can be the biggest help in keeping your employees happy.
In part two of this article, I’ll explain why recruiters should embrace AI.

Management consultant, educator and author Peter Drucker once declared that increasing the productivity of knowledge workers was ""the most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century.""Related: AI Is Taking the Art Out of SalesAI is changing that. More than 75 percent of companies are firing up AI to accelerate business development, automate busy work and deliver a better customer experience.



AI algorithms are powering massive amounts of calculations and decisions because they can find patterns in data, unseen to the naked eye. They're evolving technology in powerful ways that are enhancing our knowledge work:1. Automating the work humans don't want to doThe most liberating support comes from AI doing the jobs we find monotonous. AI platforms can do repetitive tasks, like learn how to automatically update contact data in your customer relationship manager (CRM) or generate weekly status reports for your leads.


In the business development world, AI and machine learning tools sort through leads and pull a wide range of data together about your prospect list. The tedious work of organizing contact information or researching prospect demographics can be handed to bots and allow your sales team to focus on selling.Related: 11 Ways to Boost Your Sales Performance2. Automating the work we can't doHow many hours per week do you need to focus on selling to meet your quotas and keep the business growing?You probably don't have hundreds of hours left over for data science. But, that's what it takes to review large data sets to find trends in your industry, uncover business opportunities and stay ahead of the competition. Whether you want to know which companies are actively searching for your solution or how qualified they are, the data is available -- but it's complex and spread out across multiple websites and databases.


AI bots and services can look at how many pieces of content are being shared around a topic, determine traffic volume, number of companies searching for your product/service and their lead score.AI can also deliver complex data sets to be reviewed on one platform, instead of having your team sort through thousands of lists or records. It can review and mark this data, then provide a report of actionable insights.3. Improving lead quality and shortening sales cyclesA full pipeline isn't useful if the leads aren't relevant or qualified. Today, many companies use a variety of people and tools to do basic data entry before these leads are delivered to a salesperson. Even then, they're only guessing which leads will be interested.Sales teams that use predictive analytics spend less time prospecting and more time selling, which motivates them and makes them more successful in their role. This reduces sales department churn.


AI is the new go-to partner for this relationship. Algorithms can now score leads based on key performance indicators (KPIs) and historical success patterns. The closer a new lead matches your existing best-value customers, the higher AI can score it.Delivering a flow of the best leads who are ready to buy can significantly reduce your sales cycle times. It gives you more revenue opportunities because your team isn't overwhelmed with prospecting or follow up -- they're focused on selling to qualified opportunities.Focusing on the people already looking for your solution provides a more enjoyable process for both you and your future customer.Related: 7 Key Selling Habits All Sales Professionals Must Develop


4. Predicting cross-sell and up-sell opportunitiesAI provides a connection that we weren't expecting initially but are pleased to see: people who want the advanced services our sales team can offer.Up-sells and cross-sells are often missed because sales teams lack a definitive process for whom to up-sell and when. It's the easiest and most neglected part of the sales process.AI makes your sales process more predictable by finding the customer personas who are most likely to say yes. That ensures sales teams are focused on customers with the largest revenue opportunity and the highest likelihood of converting.Advanced analytics can help create these personas, and the AI underneath it can continuously update those personas based on how successful its past model was. Buyers enjoy the help. Businesses enjoy the increase in revenue. And sales teams enjoy hitting those stretch goals and maximizing their bonuses.


5. Forecasting sales projections for specific customer personas and offersInternational Data Corporation (IDC) notes that real-time personalization of ads will arrive by 2020. The goal for these platforms is improving the accuracy of targeting, increasing the precision of its messaging and ensuring the context is appropriate for the customer and their pain points.Smart AI will power these platforms and we can start to see it bridging the gap between inbound marketing and outbound sales development -- aligning sales and marketing once and for all.When we look at the possibility: It's targeting your best customer personas with the best messaging to analyze buying stages, marketing channels and optimize them all. In essence, we're learning the personas that respond best to each offer and when up-sells correlate with an increase in churn.It's possible for AI to scan an entire integrated database, from CRM and customer orders to conversation intelligence and lead scoring tools. Machine learning can build out customer personas that include risk prediction and sales potentials, segmenting groups into a variety of characteristics.


It's a nuanced understanding of the customer journey that takes a few extra things into account:Customer lifetime valueRisks relative to sales thresholdsIntervention points for sales and supportProjections by category and product type within customer groups as well as individual customersThis greater understanding can be used to guide a variety of business decisions. Initially, companies can use it to manage pricing and sales strategies. Later, there's a clear understanding of messaging success rates by persona and product needs -- even the potential for a tailored customer journey with offers designed to maximize revenue, while minimizing churn.Related: 7 Tips for Getting More Sales Meetings With Prospects6. Making human work more meaningful and valuableAI in business development boils down to this: It gives us the freedom to focus on our unique abilities. We're not bogged down with repetitive busy work or boring data entry. We can focus on the meaningful work -- the elements that lead to a successful sale and customer experience.


AI runs in the background and gives us the ability to increase the productivity of knowledge work.""Every few hundred years throughout Western history, a sharp transformation has occurred,"" Drucker observed in a 1992 essay for Harvard Business Review.In a matter of decades, technology altogether has evolved at light speed -- its purpose, applications and capabilities. Years later, AI is changing our work in meaningful ways. And the people entering this brave new world can't imagine work without this valuable tool. AI is transforming technology, saving us time and uncovering new sales opportunities -- and surely exceeding the expectations of Peter Drucker.

Burger King encouraged the chicken,” says the voice. “The Whopper lives in a bun mansion, just like you,” it chirps.They’re good ads! And, of course, they’re lies.

It’s a silly, unimportant deception, but one that points to an important truth: we really don’t know what artificial intelligence is and is not capable of. Burger King’s joke lands because AI exists in the public imagination as a quantum entity — simultaneously powerful and pathetic. Artificial intelligence is about to take our jobs, we’re constantly told; it’s going to destroy the economy and humanity to boot. But we also know from our own experience that it’s incredibly dumb, incapable of understanding the simplest commands (hello, Siri), or telling the difference between a stop sign and a cyclist, or of not showing me nine toilet seats I might like to buy after I buy the one toilet seat I will need this decade. This fallibility makes AI a perfect comic foil in the age of algorithms. It can stand in for the stupidity of the machines that run our lives, and help us process this brave new world.

Artificial intelligence is dumb, anyone in the industry will tell you that. But it also creates a cloud of confusion that mainly benefits the people who control and profit from this technology. In a recent essay, filmmaker and writer Astra Taylor described the concept of “fauxtomation,” where companies oversell the technological capabilities of their products. Sometimes this is harmless, she says, like “smart” ovens that just scan barcodes to find out how long to cook your dinner. In other instances it’s more insidious and even dangerous, like when people pretend to be chatbots, or when the “AI moderators” removing gruesome and disturbing videos turn out to be human. if we don’t understand AI, we won’t know how to fix the problems it createsAs Taylor argues, automation — including automation powered by AI — isn’t neutral. It’s used to justify stagnant pay and worsening work conditions. It’s used to threaten people who might organize for better jobs (“$15 an hour? We’ll find a robot who’ll work for less”), and with fauxtomation, it often erases the lives of people at the bottom of the economic food chain. This means that having a good understanding of what technology can and cannot do is vital. It helps the public and politicians know what’s at stake, and what needs to be done to avoid the worst outcomes. Of course, Burger King’s ads are just that: ads.

Technologies in the field of data science are progressing at an exponential rate. The introduction of Machine Learning has revolutionized the world of data science by enabling computers to classify and comprehend large data sets. Another important innovation which has changed the paradigm of the world of the technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The two technological concepts, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, are often used as interchangeable terms. However, it is important to understand that these technologies supplement each other and are different in terms of their core functions.    Technology enthusiasts and social scientists often predict that human beings in the workforce will soon be replaced by self-learning robots. It is yet to be seen whether there is any truth to these predictions, but for 2017, the following trends have been prominent in the development of Machine Learning. Giant companies will develop Machine Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems In 2016, we saw many noteworthy developments in the domain of Machine Learning, and numerous artificial intelligence applications found a way to our phone screens and caught our attention. In the previous year, companies merely touched the tip of the iceberg and in 2017, big names such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and IBM are already fighting a development war. Google and Amazon launched successful apps, which include Amazon Echo and Google Home, at the beginning of the year, and we have yet to see what else these tech giants have in stores for their customers. Algorithm Economy will be on the rise  Businesses greatly value data and utilize it to take the appropriate actions, whether it’s to understand the consumer demand or comprehend a company’s financial standing. However, it is not the data alone they should value, because, without an appropriate algorithm, that data is worth nothing. Peter Sondergaard, Senior Vice President of Gartner Research, says, “Data is inherently dumb and the real value lies in the algorithms which deduce meaningful results from a cluster of meaningless data.""  The Algorithm Economy has taken center stage for the past couple of years, and the trend is expected to follow as we anticipate further developments in machine learning tools. The use of the algorithm economy will distinguish small players from the market dominators in 2017. Small businesses that have just entered the transitional phase of embedding machine learning processes into their business models will be using canned algorithms in tools such as BI, CRM, and predictive analysis. On the contrary, large enterprises will use proprietary ML algorithms. Expect more interaction between machines and humans  Google Home and Amazon Echo received an exceedingly positive response from their respective audiences, which made it evident that consumers perceive human-machine interaction positively. Innovative technologies embedded with machine learning processes prove to be helpful under various circumstances (for example, helping people with vision impairments to navigate). But will they completely replace human-human interaction? Maybe 25 years down the road, but we don’t see that happening anytime soon. Machine learning has made it increasingly possible for machines to learn new skills, such as to sort, analyze and comprehend. But nevertheless, there are certain limitations to it. Automated cars have frequently been tested, and even with modified algorithms and advanced technologies, the chance of an error is still present. Conclusion Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are promising fields with much potential for growth. We have seen some recent developments in the sector which, not long ago, people believed were not possible. Therefore, we cannot give a definite verdict regarding the industry’s potential for growth. For now, intelligent machines are only capable of handling repetitive tasks and can follow predetermined patterns. They lack the skill to figure things out which are unordinary, and we still require human intervention for keeping the chaos at bay in such situations.

 Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Annual Lecture and  The Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Annual Lecture on Science and Technology 

Kai-Fu Lee discusses the advances in artificial intelligence technology, the effects on the future of work, and the technology race between the United States and China.
PAREKH: Welcome, everybody, to today’s Council on Foreign Relations Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Lecture on Science and Technology on “The Artificial Intelligence Race and the New World Order” with Dr. Kai-Fu Lee. Dr. Kai-Fu Lee is chairman and chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures and president of Sinovation Ventures’ Artificial Intelligence Institute, and author of the new book—new bestselling book, I would add—AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.
A special thanks to Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener for making the lectureship possible, and we’re happy to have Malcolm in the audience today.
I am Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Venture Partners, and I will be presiding over today’s discussion.
Thank you, Dr. Lee, and I really enjoyed the book, as a fellow venture capitalist.
LEE: Thank you, Deven. Thanks.
PAREKH: I thought we would set the context with maybe you just starting with a little bit of your background and how you got here.
LEE: Sure. I’ve started working on artificial intelligence, or AI, thirty-eight years ago in my sophomore year in this city, at Columbia. And I’ve been an AI researcher. I’ve developed AI products at Apple, Microsoft, Google. And Sinovation Ventures makes most of our investments in AI. So I’ve seen AI from all around, and that’s pretty much my experience. We’re a venture capital firm, basically investing exclusively in China. AI is one of our—is our biggest area of investment.
PAREKH: So you were educated in the U.S., but you ended up working for, first, Microsoft in China, and then Google in China.
LEE: Right. Yes.
PAREKH: What was it like running the China sub of a U.S. company?
LEE: Well, at Microsoft Research—I started at Microsoft Research, so that was a lot of fun. Bill let us do whatever we wanted, just hired smart people and do research and ignore all the other things. So that was different.
Google China was probably both the most exhalating and also the most frustrating job that I’ve had. The exhilarating part was it was a time of ascension for Google. That brand everywhere in the world attracted the smartest people. People were saying if you don’t get—if you didn’t get invited for an interview with Google, it means your IQ is not high enough. It was so much so that in China, Silicon Valley, I got I think the smartest team I’ve ever had, and that was the great part. And we did a lot of things. We actually, despite—people seem to just remember the exit, but during my tenure we took Google’s share from nine percent to twenty-four percent, possibly as high as it’s conceivably able to go. And then—and then Google pulled out.
The frustrating part is, I think, between the values that the Chinese government wanted to ensure, and the laws and regulations, and Google’s own values, in particular the three words don’t do evil, which is a terrible—I mean, Google is a brilliant company. I love the company, but those are three terrible words to have for a corporate value because it allows everyone to interpret it however they want. And it ended up being basically a clash of values, a lot of trust lost, and Google decided to pull out. Now, I, of course, have no idea about the final incidents, but I kind of saw the downward spiral, so I left in September ’09 and Google pulled out in December ’09.
PAREKH: It was a common experience for many other companies outside of Google to not really be able to successfully penetrate China, whether it be Amazon, Yahoo, many others—Yahoo, only through their investment in Alibaba, ended up being the driver of value. Any common characteristics that you saw as to why these U.S. companies had trouble succeeding in China?
LEE: OK, so first I want to talk about the past—about, you know, ten years ago—and then I want to talk about now.
PAREKH: Right.
LEE: Back ten years ago, I think the issue is there was just too much presumption that U.S., in particular Silicon Valley, was the center of the world, and easily Silicon Valley companies took over Europe and Japan and wherever it went—South America. Basically, viewed China just another market. But China was just too different, not just in the regulations, but in the users, language, culture, patterns, expectations.
And also, the other very big issue was that multinationals generally send salespeople to run these organizations. And the salespeople have a quota. They have a KPI. They’re very smart about lowballing expectations and beating it, and then getting their promotion to be the corporate senior VP at headquarters.
PAREKH: Back in Silicon Valley. Often back in Silicon Valley, right.
LEE: Exactly. Their goal was to do the China thing for two years and then get promoted to senior VP and back to the U.S., so they would just lowball the numbers and beat it. But they were against these gladiators in China who own, you know, sixty percent of the company, who don’t want to just win, they want everyone else to lose—(laughter)—and they fight for winner take all and no holds barred. So they were just no match for the local. So that was ten years ago.
PAREKH: Yeah, and my—our experience at the time is anytime we would call into China, it would be this is the Amazon of China JD, and Alibaba, and Baidu is the Google.
LEE: Yeah.
PAREKH: And every time we thought about investment, we just said, OK, is it a U.S. version that succeeded? Then maybe we should look at it. Today, obviously, that’s changed.
LEE: Yes. Very different, yeah.
PAREKH: So talk a little bit about how that market evolved, no longer a copycat market.
LEE: Right. Yeah. So, basically, the conclusion I would reach is that today is a very different story. Now, even if American companies woke up and said, uh-oh, I’m going to find someone just as gladiatorial as my Chinese competitor, there would probably be no chance. And why is that? Because China has evolved in the last ten years from copycat to a(n) inspired by America, but build a better product—usually—to Chinese innovation.
I think Silicon Valley thinks that it’s—a company is only valid if it has an original brilliant idea and builds the product and shocks the world, and obviously we are all huge fans when that happens. But that is not the only way to build a product. China started as a copycat because China had a 0.2 percent internet penetration back in ’96. So it had nowhere to go but to learn from the U.S. But it is not true that once a copycat, always a copycat. The Chinese original copycats learned what they had to learn. And there are some who remain copycats for life and they are nowhere—they made some money, but they really got nowhere—but there are some people who learn how to build a product, who learn how to satisfy users, who learn how to beat competitors, who learn new business models that were not Silicon Valley-originated. And then they went on to become serial entrepreneurs who invented, I would say, a completely different way of entrepreneurship in China, and now they’re innovating using that model.
So today, you know, companies like Ant Financial, (Total ?), TikTok, Crysho (ph), VIPKID, Mobike, these are companies—and Pinduoduo—you probably never heard of them unless they happen to have gone public recently here, and you probably don’t understand them. The one phrase that describes them are probably not accurate. And I wouldn’t be able to explain any of them to you in less than five minutes because these are Chinese innovation powered by Chinese method of entrepreneurism, and these companies are worth anywhere between two billion and a hundred billion. So I think the wave of Chinese innovation is coming. This is with or without AI, which is another topic.
PAREKH: We’re going to come to that.
LEE: Yeah. With or without AI.
And I think it—America needs to study this method of entrepreneurism. It isn’t better or worse; it’s different. To Silicon Valley it would look ugly, but it works. It creates value. And I think Harvard Business School, you know, will use these for case studies. I think business schools are the ones who will be open-minded to studying these. I think Silicon Valley will look down upon this and frown upon them as once a copycat, always a copycat. So I’m glad to be in New York talking to people who might listen, because for America—think about this—a Chinese young entrepreneur is learning from U.S. and China simultaneously. A U.S. entrepreneur, if he or she only learns from Silicon Valley, you’re missing half the lessons. How are you going to compete in a world where you take half as many lessons?
PAREKH: Well, let’s talk about AI, which is obviously the big topic of your book. Your Ph.D. thesis, I think it was at Carnegie Mellon, was over thirty years ago. And yet, it was probably twenty or twenty-five years later before anything really happened in AI.
LEE: Yes, yes.
PAREKH: Talk about why.
LEE: Two main reasons.
One is a big breakthrough ten years ago called deep learning. Stated simply, deep learning is a way for one single domain to use a huge amount of data to train a system to do things much better than people can do. But keep in mind this is single domain, like playing Go, recognizing faces, serving ads, but not broad intelligence. One single domain with objective quantitative methods. And that breakthrough was a breakthrough that none of us AI researchers really expected. We always thought we’d find ways to understand the human brain. No progress on that, but this pattern recognition became amazingly good—so good that it can take off in many, many areas.
But it has some big constraints. One constraint is a single domain. I mentioned that. The other is huge amount of data. So it only works when you have huge amounts of data. So while some of the similar ideas had been proposed at the time when I did my Ph.D., there just wasn’t enough data to make it work. So the internet created enough data and enough object tagging. Every time you use Amazon, Google, you click, that’s teaching it something about you, and that was gathered to make internet companies the first wave of great AI companies. So deep learning and huge amounts of data.
PAREKH: You talk in your book about the four phases of AI.
LEE: Yeah.
PAREKH: If you could just walk through them at a high level, and kind of where are we on the evolution of each of them?
LEE: OK. Internet AI is pretty mature. All internet companies that have lots of users, lots of data, they use it. They use it to target ads, to get you to get better results monetize off of you.
And, by the way, the AI is also trained with an object function. Why that is is when you get all the data, you basically say, go make the default rate low for the loans, or go target ads so we get maximum ad revenue, or go show the newsfeed so that people stay the longest minutes on Facebook, OK? So the wonderful thing is you get this wonderful knob on this tool that maximizes what you want, and the more data you feed it the better it gets.
So back to the wave. Second wave is business AI, so a bank, insurance, hospital, government branches. Take a bank as an example. You can use all the transactional data of all of your customers to decide credit card fraud, loan default and approval, asset allocation, and of course target each customer with the right kind of investment products that he or she may buy. So that’s the business wave. So all the companies that have lots of data previously thought of them as just a cost center; now they can be monetized.
The third wave is when AI can see and hear. So speech and vision, cameras in airports that protect us, that do face recognition of terrorists; Amazon Echo, that we talk to; Amazon Go as the ultimate autonomous store. And extrapolate from that autonomous systems: hospitals that can watch patients so they don’t call, that can report when patients do fall or have an issue; autonomous fast food with cooks and chefs and cashiers all done automatically, but not robots that walk around. All you need are cameras and sensors, and then users—I mean, customers will go in and take this and put it in the pocket, you can directly charge them for it because that action was recognized and understood. So that’s third wave, with eyes and ears.
Fourth wave would be autonomous AI with arms and legs. Not necessarily with arms that look like this, but basically the ability to move and manipulate. So that could be autonomous factory floor assembly line, so no more humans; autonomous dishwasher; autonomous fruit picker. And I’m not making these up. We invested in companies that did each one of these. If you want that dishwasher, it’s $300,000, so—(laughter)—I’ll take a check if you want that. But for restaurants it makes sense because if you have five dishwashers, in a year and a half you’ve paid back, right? And then going on to—eventually to consumer robotics
But, of course, the big autonomous app is autonomous vehicles. That will completely disrupt our transportation and logistics, probably dramatically increasing our GDP; our savings, because we won’t have to buy cars anymore; improving our efficiency, because not much congestion; improve the pollution, because they’ll be electronic vehicles; and also displace a lot of jobs; and, oh, also increase—improve the safety because, again, AI gets better with data. So the first day that the car launches, maybe it’s one percent safer than humans. But give it five years, it’s probably eighty percent better than humans. Give it ten years, it’s probably ninety percent better than humans. And then give it fifteen years, humans probably won’t be allowed to drive because—(laughter)—we’ll be the greatest hazard to ourselves.
PAREKH: There are those who have a very dystopian view of AI as you get from phase four to phase five and phase six that we haven’t even imagined yet. I think Elon Musk even called it more dangerous than nuclear weapons.
LEE: Yes.
PAREKH: What’s your perspective on it?
LEE: Well, I think a lot of the dystopians actually are not AI experts. AI experts generally see this as a super patter recognizer.
What’s misleading is if you just read the newspaper you will see one breakthrough after another, right? First, chess and then Go; and then diagnosing lung cancer, skin cancer; and then you see these autonomous vehicles and you see AI that’s, you know, figuring out energy problems. So every day you open the paper you see more breakthroughs. So this gives certain people who write books to exaggerate the story to say that when these applications grow exponentially we’ll be facing what’s called singularity, and then suddenly one day we wake up, they control us or they’re smarter than us.
But if you really look at what’s happening, it’s one algorithm that’s being applied maybe nearly exponentially to many applications. So it’s like when you first have electricity, when you first have the internet, when you first have the operating system. These things enable many applications to be built, but it doesn’t mean there is an electricity 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, then it takes over the Earth; or operating system; or internet. So that, I think, is just being very creative/imaginative—people who want to sell books, people who want to be famous. There is no engineering evidence that that’s coming.
Now, we can’t say never because, you know, a thousand years ago, if you asked a responsible scientist and say, will people be able to fly, they will probably say, well, we see no engineering means of doing that. But ultimately, we did. So I’m not going to say never, but I promise you that when I see—the day I see robotic overlords coming—(laughter)—I’ll write—I’ll write another book, OK? (Laughter.)
PAREKH: Or they might write the book first. (Laughter.)
LEE: They—yeah. I might not have the credibility. (Laughter.)
PAREKH: So let’s go back to the U.S. versus China context for a second. You talked about this—this machine learning innovation ten or fifteen years ago. And at the time and even today, the vast majority of (super I ?) and AI algorithmic experts are in the U.S. I think it’s over sixty-five or seventy percent.
LEE: Yes. Yep.
PAREKH: But that was for the age of expertise. And what you’ve talked about, and one of the reasons why you’re not worried about singularity, is that those algorithms are not changing now as much. We’re now in the age of implementation, taking those algorithms and domain by domain trying to figure out how to apply those algorithms. And so you talk about data being the new oil and China being Saudi Arabia, which I’m not sure what it makes the U.S. Talk a little bit—talk a little bit about this.
LEE: Right. So, first, the premise is there are no, you know, deep learning 2.0 coming, and that may very well be wrong. I think, you know, projecting not reaching human intelligence, I’m pretty confident we won’t see that in twenty years. But there may very well be another disruptive technology that makes some kind of learning dramatically better. And to the extent that happens, U.S. is likely to be in a leadership position.
But those breakthroughs are hard to project. If you look at the last sixty-two years of artificial intelligence, really only one breakthrough, and that was ten years ago. Haven’t seen another one since, so to project another one in the next ten years, possible, but I don’t know how likely that is. But for now we can basically monetize and make applications and implement based on all that we already know. So while the super experts U.S. outnumbers China ten to one, if you look at the—let’s call the regular experts. (Laughs.) Super expert, maybe a thousand of them. Regular experts, maybe a hundred thousand. China and the U.S., actually China will have more of them. And then, if you look at a million of the mini-experts, China would have a lot more than the U.S. So China is fully equipped with engineers to build AI products, but not to disrupt AI.
And also, China has these gladiatorial entrepreneurs I just told you about, details in the book.
And then, of course, the most important is AI gets better with data. The best way to make your AI better is not to go hire three brilliant scientists; it’s just to get more data if you can. And China has more data because it has more users. That’s the breadth level. But also it has more depth because if you go to China—have been to China recently you’ll know that Chinese people do everything on their phone. Their rides on bicycles, their payments, their retail stores, their restaurants, ordering takeout—everything’s done through the phone. Paying taxes, everything’s on the phone.
So that record—now, that record, of course, belongs to the application in which they use. But there are many applications. Each application, similar to the U.S., has just more users and more depth. So if we think it’s three to four times more users, three to four times more depth, or there is a 10X difference in data. So a Chinese—equivalent Chinese company with equivalent skillset and funding is probably going to collect ten times more data and therefore build better AI. And, again, AI you can monetize and tweak the knob. And Chinese companies are much more willing to tweak the knob to make money. And that will result in more profitable companies.
So as a result, today’s most valuable speech recognition, machine translation, computer vision, face recognition, drone companies, are all Chinese. And there are about fifteen Chinese unicorns in the pre-IPO stage. I don’t know how many there are in the U.S., but probably not a larger number. So arguably, China’s already forged ahead monetizing and implementing—out-monetizing and out-implementing the U.S., although the technology side is still substantially behind.
PAREKH: One of my favorite stories in your book is about the two thieves who go to Hangzhou hoping to break into a couple of stores and steal some money. When they got arrested they said, where is all the cash? Because the market had gone almost all mobile. And so there’s literally—you go to the store, there is no cash. Everyone pays with Alipay. Even beggars use—
 LEE: Beggars! Beggars hold up a sign, you know: I’m hungry. Scan me. (Laughter.) I’m totally serious. If you go to China you’ll see this.
PAREKH: Do you think that there is a difference in societal norms as it relates to comfort with that collection of data between the U.S. and China?
LEE: Clearly U.S.—I mean, the United States was founded based on, you know, individual liberty, rights. And therefore the demand for privacy and the consumer advocacy is at the very forefront. China hasn’t had that development. Now, Chinese consumers are beginning to learn about privacy. They’re asking for it. There are some laws starting to govern—the sale of data is actually considered criminal. So it’s emerging. So I wouldn’t say that Chinese consumers just don’t care about privacy. But in general, I think there’s much more concern about that in the U.S.
I would just say that on the issue of privacy, we should all be very cautious that it’s not just giving me the privacy. The privacy is actually connected to convenience, to safety, and to social good. So it’s a very careful knob to tweak. You know, I think the GDPR is too simple a knob, because think about—I mean, as a—as a cancer patient—in remission, but a cancer patient nevertheless—I’d be happy to donate all of my medical records without worrying about privacy. But I don’t want, you know, photos of my family to be shared. And so I think—you know, because there’s a social good related to that. So I think privacy is a complex issue. In some countries where there are a lot of cameras and people say, wow, that’s a terrible invasion of privacy. But possibly for that country or that city, there’s a lot of crime. So that lack of—loss of privacy is compensated with greater safety. So I’m not stating what’s right or wrong. I’m just saying it’s a complex issue.
PAREKH: So before we open it up to the members for their questions, let’s talk about the implications of all this. You made some predictions about the number of jobs that could be displaced by these technologies. You talked specifically about this concept of one-to-one replacement versus disruption. Can you talk a little bit about what that means, and then what your predictions are as it relates to potential job loss?
LEE: Sure. Some economists—a lot of economists and think tanks have come out with various numbers between nine percent to about forty-six percent of jobs being displaced by AI and automation and software over the next ten or twelve years. The numbers vary greatly. I tend to go with the higher numbers. And the reason is I think a lot of the think tanks didn’t think about a couple of factors. One is that it’s U.S. and China dual engine moving this forward. Secondly, most think tanks think about one-to-one displacement—like, one robot for one cashier. One robot for one cook. But actually, there are industry-level disruptions.
You know, we funded a company that has an app. You download the app, you type in a few things, you allow it to suck up some data, at the same—similar to Facebook takes data from your phone. And it uses all that data, plus what you typed in, to give you—decide whether or not to give you a loan in basically two seconds. So that is going to disrupt. And they have a default rate much lower than banks. That’s going to disrupt the way that banks in the future do loans. And to the extent this app becomes widespread, the banking loan officer jobs will be gone, right?
We’re funding also autonomous fast food. And to the extent these take off, there will be fewer jobs in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. So I think the disruption is more complex than just job for job, country for country. It’s two engines moving forward. It’s one-to-one displacement and disruption-oriented displacement.
PAREKH: You talk about the characteristics of jobs that are least likely to be displaced by AI. Can you describe them?
LEE: Sure. Well, I described what AI can do. So it’s pretty clear what it cannot do. It cannot do multidomain, right? That’s a single domain. So strategic, you know. CFR, you think a lot about diplomacy, you know, negotiating the trade war. (Laughs.) Those things are too complex multidomain. It cannot do creativity because the humans provide the objective functions. It doesn’t create. It won’t invent a new drug. It can’t invent a new style of painting. It can only replicate, emulate. So those are kind of the cognitive advanced jobs.
But another type of job it cannot do are the human interaction jobs, the jobs that require a human connection, warmth, trust, and basically that we wouldn’t want a robot to do, nor can a robot currently do a very good job. So those are jobs like—that vary over the whole spectrum, from jobs like nanny, elderly caretaker, nurse to teachers and doctors, social worker, psychiatrists, and so on. So I think those service jobs will be large enough, potentially, to take the routine jobs that are displaced for a transition to this type of human-to-human service jobs.
PAREKH: The last question before I open it up, you mentioned your cancer diagnosis earlier. You talk a lot in the book about how that impacted your thought process on what solutions might be for the job loss that we talked about. Maybe you can touch on that.
LEE: Sure. I’ve been a workaholic my whole life. Much less so now after my cancer remission. But before then, I worked one hundred hours a week. I wake up twice in the middle of the night to answer email. And a lot of really bad habits—a lack of sleep, no exercise, basically not much time for the family. But facing death made me realize that working is just—working equals meaning of life was something that we’ve been brainwashed with in our society. Certainly in the Chinese society, and to some extent in other societies, like the U.S., as well. But once I faced death, I realized working really was not the most important thing. If I had one hundred days to live, I wanted to be with my loved ones. I wanted to do the things I love. And I regret not having done that properly prior to my cancer diagnosis.
So for myself, I’ve reformed and changed my work style, put priority on my family and friends. And that also—it was that experience that when I look at the AI job displacement issue, I think that maybe the compassionate jobs, maybe jobs that require love are the ones that will not only help transition routine workers into a new beginning, but also will inject more warmth and positive energy to the society.
PAREKH: So at this time I’d like to open it up to our members to join the conversation. Just a reminder that the meeting is on the record. Wait for the microphone to come to you. Please stand, state your name and affiliation. And please limit yourself to one concise question—and please make it a question.
Q: Hi. Danah Boyd, Microsoft Research.
One of the biggest things we saw transition early stage technologies was security because any technology that has power can be corrupted. You’re right that AI depends so heavily on different kinds of data, but we’re also watching all of these new ways in which data and models are being built are also being—facing different kinds of attacks. I’m curious, where do you see the maturation of the conversation of what security might look like in an AI world.
LEE: Thank you. That’s a great question. If I were to be given a chance to say the second biggest concern for AI, that would be it. It actually wouldn’t be privacy, even though that’s important. I think security’s a big issue. You know, we’ve seen security for PC and phone, viruses and things like that. But for AI, it’s much more dangerous because if AI controls all the autonomous vehicles, a hacker going in can turn that into autonomous weapon that kills people rather than avoids hitting people. You can also imagine hacking into AI is maybe even harder to detect, because usually when you hack into a PC or phone, you’re injecting some code. So there is a trace and evidence of a computer program that’s running on your PC or phone, so at least you can recognize it. But with deep learning, it just a giant array of numbers. If someone went in and tweaked some, I don’t know how you would detect it, other than—and also, the models are always tweaking themselves.
See, when I said AI gets better with more data, that just means you gave a million loans, you got a 3 percent default rate. Now you give three million more, every loan you give your default rate goes down a tiny little bit. So you’re—you’re modifying—your models are self-modifying all the time. So if some hacker came in and modified a model to let you give that person a bunch of loans, and they take—steal your money, or if they hack it in so that a terrorist face will not be recognized, or if they hack in the computer vision system so that their car becomes invisible, these are all forms of security that we have never seen before. So I think that’s an area that computer scientists really have to focus on because without that the dangers are substantial.
PAREKH: I think we had one more over here.
Q: Robert Klitzman from Columbia University. Thank you very much.
You suggested that you didn’t see AI going into fields like psychiatry or areas where there’s human trust. And yet, there are a lot of apps being developed now to do counseling through AI, et cetera. I’m just wondering how much of a firewall you saw there in terms of where AI may be going.
LEE: Right. I think there are always special needs. I think people who use apps for psychiatry are—probably have a special reason. Maybe they just have something they don’t want to tell a human, or maybe they are very introverted and just don’t want to face a human and talk about something that’s very private. So I can see those having uses, but I’m just saying the quality of—the process of curing someone or helping someone improve is quite unlikely with automatic methods because, first, I think the process of human interaction and the emotional EQ are not those objective things you can train—like a default rate or targeting rate or greater investment return. Those are very objective yes/no, right/wrong, large/small questions. You know, making someone who’s paranoid feel more at ease is not so objectively identifiable and trainable.
Secondly, we also see that AI and human interaction, when they fail they may fail catastrophically—such as Microsoft Tay as deployed on Twitter started to—you know, after a day started cursing at people. (Laughter.) So those catastrophic issues is another. And then finally, I think even if—even if I’m wrong and AI did an OK job of counseling, I think many people still won’t accept it. So I think at least there is a couple of decades where those human jobs are a good stop-gap solution, if not permanent solution.
PAREKH: Back there.
Q: Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, CNBC contributor.
There are reports that Google wants to go back into China. Should they?
LEE: Well, I talked about a parallel universe. So the challenges will be very big to traverse into a parallel universe because of user habits, the software stack that’s already there. I show you my list of my apps on my phone, you won’t recognize any of them. So any company that goes in will have to try to fit in. That’s difficult. I can understand why Google might feel its Android isn’t getting fully monetized. Maybe there’s some way they can find, by reentry, to monetize that. Or perhaps they can find a partner, such as Tencent, to work with. I mean, I’m purely speculating. If I actually knew anything, I couldn’t tell you. (Laughs.) So those are the possible speculation.
Q: (Off mic)—run a company today, if you were CEO of Google, do you—
LEE: I think if I got a really strong local partner, I would. And—or, if I think I can start to monetize Android, which I don’t, then I would. But currently, I don’t think either one is very easy. So most likely, I wouldn’t.
Q: (Off mic.)
LEE: Oh, but if I were already there, that’s different. See, had they not pulled out—when I was there we had 24 percent share. And if we hung in there, had 24 percent share, that’s a different story. Then we would be intertwined in that parallel universe. Right, that’s a—two different answers.
Q: (Inaudible)—from Bessemer Trust.
You mentioned deep learning as one of the two breakthroughs in your talk earlier. So I remember studying back propagation dual networks back in college, which was many years ago. So can you please elaborate as to what’s the specific transformation that you’ve seen in that? Thank you.
LEE: Sure. It’s really just a—the mathematics that it takes for thousands of layers. You know, when I studied—I studied back prop also. And it was one or two layers. You’re maybe a little younger, so maybe a few more layers. But now they do thousands of layers. And when you do thousands of layers, you no longer have to give human-extracted features. So you don’t have to go in and say, oh, I think for loans income’s really important. And I think you should, you know, not focus on the hair color or the battery level. But you can throw it all in when you have that many layers and the system will decide if a person’s hair color affects the likelihood of you paying a loan, or if a person’s battery level affects the likelihood of paying back a loan.
PAREKH: That’s an actual example from the book, the battery level.
LEE: It’s actually an example, that your battery level is slightly correlated with your likelihood of paying back the loan. (Laughter.)
PAREKH: Just to go around the room, I’ll go in the back there.
Q: Martin Indyk from the Council on Foreign Relations.
Can you talk about the application of AI and machine learning to warfare?
LEE: I can, but it would be purely speculation because we, as an investment company, stay away from anything that relates to weapons or war. I think, clearly, face recognition and targeting can be done. Clearly autonomous weapons is the worse-case of all AI, because you simultaneously launch an almost eradication of another country. And I think many countries, for those reasons, are trying to agree not to go into that area, just like the nuclear treaties. I also think AI is not just a—causes war to maybe not necessarily be fought. Well, one is you can see through Boston Dynamics that the future of soldiers might be that way. But you could also see that maybe wars don’t have to be fought in face-to-face, whether it’s human-to-human or robot-to-robot. Cyberwar appears to be another path. And AI could be plugged into that.
I think my biggest personal concern, being a novice in this space, is that even if the countries find ways to agree to keep this under control, AI is a pretty open technology. And terrorists would not be subject to the same constraints that countries agree to.
PAREKH: Here in the front.
Q: Joel Cohen, Rockefeller University. Thank you for your talk.
Would you address the future of education for the future of AI? And why is it that the United States has significant fewer mini experts? And what could we do to increase the depth of capacity in the United States? And what could China learn from the U.S. to increase their depth at the very highest levels?
LEE: Wow. Like, four really good questions. OK, I’ll try to answer them all. (Laughter.) I think—first, I think U.S. and China should learn from each other, but probably not adopt fully the other’s strengths. Because I think the U.S. strength comes from the brilliance of universities, such as yours, that have great researchers, great reputation. And they become a funnel for the world’s smartest people to come here and study, some of whom stay.
That is the American magic, I think, is that normally countries’ ability to do research is—should be roughly proportional to its population because super smart, creative people, while each—assuming every country is roughly, you know, equal—assuming their equal economically, then it’s how many people you have. That’s how many geniuses you’ll have. And that normally would put China at an advantage. But the difference here is that the whole world loves to study in the U.S. The U.S. is a melting pot. And great universities. Chinese, Indians, Iranians—everybody wants to study here. And China can’t emulate that, because—well, you know, Chinese universities generally attract Chinese students. It’s a good thing China has a large population, but it’s not yet a melting pot. So I would like to learn, but it may be very, very difficult.
Why isn’t U.S. training more mini engineers? I think U.S. education lets people do what they love. So a certain percentage will love AI, but not everybody will love AI. Chinese education tends to rank jobs based—
PAREKH: Be more prescriptive. Be a little bit more prescriptive. (Laughs.)
LEE: Rank jobs on how much they pay. AI engineers pays a lot, so everybody rushes in. And China has a large population. So that’s what the many engineers. But with respect to, you know, other types of education, I think teachers will be a very different and very special job that will not be displaced by AI. I think too much of our percentage of our—too many—too large a percentage of our teachers’ jobs are taken by routine tasks like giving exams, giving homework, homework drills, teaching—fix pronunciation, math drills. All that could be done by AI. And when AI takes away that sixty percent of a teacher’s job, the teacher has much more time to become a mentor, to help the students, to make this more humanistic. So that would be my hope.
And this Sunday, if you watch 60 Minutes, I’ll be on it to talk about this topic.
PAREKH: Kai-Fu, is it also true that those same Chinese students who were coming to study here and then staying here are increasingly coming back to China?
LEE: They are, but still a large percentage stay. I don’t have the exact number. I think it used to be eighty percent stayed. Now it’s like forty percent stay. Something in that order. So it’s still a net positive for the U.S.
PAREKH: Right here in the front.
Q: So, Esther Dyson, Wellville.
I’m just curious, as you said most of the excitement around AI is basically pattern recognition and sort of fitting things to data and statistics. But the real advances, it seems to me, are going to end up being in something that can design models, that can reason by analogy, that understands relationships. And where are we on that? Because I’m sure that more interesting people are working on that, not on better statistics.
LEE: Actually, it’s kind of going through a transition. In the academia, there were certainly people sort of tweaking deep learning and all the related technologies—you know, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and basically machine learning approaches. And tweaking and combining them to solve problems that show accuracy rates and improving them year to year. A bunch of these people were poached by Google, Microsoft, Facebook. And they’re gone. So academia shrank all of a sudden because of this poaching by quadrupling of the salaries.
What remains in academia I think is probably more than ever committed to what you described, going after the new frontiers. You know, the next deep learning, but different, you know, combined with human representation, self-replicating code, moving towards artificial general intelligence, common-sense reasoning, full natural language understanding. I think that happens for a couple of reasons. One is the near-term optimizers have been poached away, and that’s what they love to do. Secondly, companies will beat universities at those tasks anyway. So there’s not much point to keep tweaking those numbers anymore.
Face recognition, speech recognition, academia will never be—lead industry again. And people like Geoff Hinton, who invented deep learning, are coming out and saying: Don’t do deep learning anymore. We need to find the next big thing. So I do think the American advantage is to increase the funding in these more fundamental areas. And then when the next big thing comes out, can once again lead the world.
Q: Hi. I’m Joan Kaufman from the Schwartzman Scholars Program.
And my question is really about global governance mechanisms. As we sort of move forward with this brave new world and all these technologies, there are a lot of cultural differences around privacy in different, you know, comfort levels. And what are the global governance institutions that are thinking about these things right now? Are there any that are dealing with how to negotiate and regulate or set standards—ethical standards for the use of AI? Or, you know, should there be? And who—you know, who could play that role? Do you think that’s practical as we move forward over the next several decades?
LEE: Yeah, thank you. That’s a great question. I think it’s really hard, given the increasing nationalism in a lot of countries nowadays. People want to own their own destiny. And also, the diversity and difference in cultures and governments laws and regulations. On the other hand, I think we have an interesting crowdsourcing problem. We’re crowdsourcing to each government to do its own thing and then hopefully governments are watching each other, are learning from best practices. I think that sense, Europe put a foot forward and said: GDPR, that’s going to be how we give privacy back to the citizens. It’s obviously the wrong answer, what’s they’ve done.
On the other hand—(laughs)—it’s very good they’ve tried, because then their failure will cause other countries to say, OK, we can—we need to do something, but let’s not do that. So—and I think—I think that’s probably how it will come about. I wish there were global governing bodies. United Nations is unlikely to have an ability to do that. And there is—among the private—among the private organizations, similar to this one, I kind of like Partnership for AI. I think they have good people, the top AI scientists with a conscience are joining. And I think going in a good direction.
On the other hand, I’m also a little skeptical that—because it’s multinational and lots of smart people have different ideas—whether there is a true lowest-common denominator. But I think if anyone’s going to try to find one, they’ll be the ones.
PAREKH: All the way in the back.
Q: Thank you. Ariana King. I’m a reporter with the Nikkei Asian Review.
Moving down from global governance into just governments, what can you say about the government policies in the U.S. versus in China—Made in China 2025—for example, that might be giving China an edge over the U.S.?
PAREKH: Maybe you could talk also—you talk in the book about the mass innovation and entrepreneurship initiative in China, and how that really unleashed AI. Maybe add that on.
LEE: Sure. Sure. That actually is a policy I did not study or read. But I’ll give you two others. Hopefully they’re—you can draw your analogies. I think that Chinese policies, we should take them more as setting the tone, not as a huge funding source of a trillion dollars, OK? So since I don’t know the one—I mean, I know of the one you mentioned, but I’ve studied more two others because they relate to me. One is the Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation Plan. That was about four or five years ago. And then there is the AI plan from the State Council, which was last year—July last year.
So in the Mass Entrepreneurship Plan—in both plans, what happens is the central government sets a tone, and then the local governments are sort of like—it’s the crowdsourcing again. They’re each trying different things and see how it goes. And in the case of Mass Entrepreneurship plan, the local governments build up all these incubators, accelerators, angel funds, guiding funds. I think the conclusion is some of them work, some don’t. I think guiding funds were quite successful. They’re basically government acting as LPs, but with some of the profit given back to the GPs. So to accelerate that. Most of the accelerators I don’t think were all that successful.
However, it did something really amazing, which was to change the mindset of the Chinese people about risk averseness. Because, as you may recall, if you go back to anyone—anything anyone read ten years ago, oh, China, entrepreneurship? I don’t know. It’s too much risk averse. This is a thousand-year-old cultural issue. But this plan really told the people, hey, being an entrepreneur is OK. Working in the startup is OK. Failing is OK, just try again. That, I think, was a massive shift that I wouldn’t have thought would be possible.
PAREKH: And quickly. It happened so quickly.
LEE: Five years. I’ll tell you, when I started Sinovation Ventures, I had to wine and dine fiancées, fiancées’ parents—(laughter)—parents, grandparents, basically convincing them to let their children or fiancée to come work for a startup, and explained to them I will personally mentor them and help them; and if they don’t succeed, then, well, there will be another chance, et cetera. But I don’t have to do that anymore. I think the traditional risk-averseness has been un-brainwashed in five years. That’s the power of the central policy, not the dollars that went in. Each government voluntarily put its dollars forward.
In the case of the AI plan, I think, again, the government said AI is a big priority; there is no funding as far as I know affiliated—associated with it from the State Council. But each bank, once they read the plan, they became more open to buying AI software. So the companies we fund sold a lot more after the plan came out, but it wasn’t government money.
PAREKH: But talk about the autonomous city, just to give people a sense of the scope of the infrastructure.
LEE: Sure. Right. So another big thing is the infrastructure that comes about, and much of that happens also at the local level. So each city will make its own decision.
For example, Nanjing says, oh, we’ve got lots of great universities; we’re going to put—we’re going to put a lot of our next year’s budget on building these research parks to leverage our academic expertise.
And then (Shaoguan ?) became a new city the size of Chicago designed for autonomous vehicle(s). They have a two-layered road—the top layer for pedestrians and bicycles and pets, bottom layer for cars—so as to minimize the worst case, which is a car hits a pedestrian.
Suzhou created a two-level, ten-square-kilometer space. Top level is human-driven car; bottom level is autonomous car. That reduces the—again, reduces the likelihood of accidents, allows the autonomous cars to talk to each other, and also fixes the lighting problem which caused the—because you can—you can have fixed lighting in an underground. That’s what caused the Tesla accident.
And Zhejiang’s province built a new highway with sensors that tell the cars—talk to the cars to make them safer.
So I think the way to interpret these Chinese policies is setting the tone, and then letting private companies do what they do, and build what private companies can’t do, which is infrastructure—not too dissimilar from what President Eisenhower did with the interstate highways.
PAREKH: Here in the front.
Q: Ralph Buultjens, New York University.
Could you please speculate on the impact of all of this on the global political power structure of the future? Is it going to lead to a reduction in the power of the state? Is it going—those societies which have an advantage in this will rule the world? Will it lead to a new kind of AI imperialism or colonialism? How will this affect, in your view, the future power structure of the world?
LEE: I see. I’m not an expert in that. I haven’t thought deeply about that.
I will tell you what I have thought about. I think it will give more power to U.S. and China, the two countries who are co-lead, and be far ahead of the other countries. Whether the two countries collaborate or compete, they will lead. They will also form parallel universe ecosystems that don’t have a lot of mutual dependence. I know today U.S. and China have a lot of mutual dependence, but in the field of mobile, internet, and AI, the two universes are actually quite separate, which in some sense is a good thing because if a Chinese VC funds a Chinese company selling to Chinese customer, the winning of one company isn’t at a loss or the expense of the other, so that could be a good thing.
I also think, in the jobs issue that we discussed, it’s possible that stronger execution-oriented states, such as China, may have an advantage in dealing with crises that may come up, like job crisis, shifting these jobs to those jobs; suddenly increasing taxes—those would be harder to do in the political system here. I’m not advocating any form of government; I’m just saying a strong government may have an advantage if there AI-triggered crises.
Q: Increase the power of the state?
LEE: Power of the state. I don’t know. I don’t know about that. Obviously, if the state is good at using technology and is permitted to have more power—is permitted by its governance to have more power, that would be something it could do. But I can’t really see crystal ball, yeah.
PAREKH: Right here in the fourth row.
Q: Thank you so much. Liz Economy from the Council on Foreign Relations. Thanks for a really terrific set of remarks.
LEE: Thank you.
Q: And I think the picture that you paint of the future role of AI is exciting, even thrilling in terms of what it could mean transformationally for the economies of various countries. But I’m wondering, in terms of the political elements, and whether you have any concerns about the role of AI as a tool for greater government repression, for example, in China. And given your iconic status, you know, in the AI community and more broadly in the tech community in China, whether you have discussions with government officials about what may be too far when it comes to the use of AI in terms of repression.
Thank you.
LEE: I see. Actually, no government consults me on anything. (Laughter.) Not the government of Chimainland China—not the government of Taiwan, not the government of the United States, and I am happy to be left alone—(laughter)—to just do—
PAREKH: To do your thing.
LEE: —my investing and technology. And that is absolutely the truth.
PAREKH: All the way in the back, right.
Q: (Off mic)—from Paulson and Company.
There was an article in The New York Times earlier this week entitled Private Business Built Modern China; Now the Government is Pushing Back.
If you think about businesses in China like Alibaba or DiDi that are two-sided—if you have a lot of sellers then you get a lot of buyers. On Alibaba that creates a monopoly. With DiDi, which is like Uber, if you have a lot of vehicles, then you have a lot of passengers, that creates a monopoly. DiDi has about ninety percent market share.
I’d be interested to get your thoughts. It seems like AI could add another layer of monopoly because, as you pointed out, the more data you have, the better AI you can have. So I’d be interested to get your thoughts on that.
LEE: Yeah, absolutely. I think AI is the new, additional factor that’s for monopoly maintenance, and reinforcement, and growth, and that is a concern to American consumers, Chinese consumers, all the consumers.
On the other hand, AI also permeates way beyond any industry, and AI also is a force for disruption. So DiDi may not be easily disturbed by another identical competitor, but we’ve seen Mobike start to go into that area because, as you know, bicycles are connected to cars.
We’ve seen Meituan starting to move into there. So in China, actually, the dynamism of everyone wants to move into everyone else’s space is a special form of checking against monopoly. You would think Alipay had a monopoly, right? There was no other viable payment mechanism on the internet. But Wechat found a way by, you know, double subsidy to DiDi rentals, by giving red envelopes, giving away free money. And it actually forced its way into a forty percent market share.
So, you know, China antitrust laws haven’t been enforced all that much, but the incredible competitiveness in the market, and the unrelenting desire to move into somebody else’s space is kind of a very unusual way to check on monopolies.
PAREKH: So the biggest problem with today is only having an hour because there is so much to talk about, but I’d like to thank Dr. Lee for joining us today. (Applause.)
LEE: Thank you.
PAREKH: And there are books for sale on the way out, if you are interested. Thank you again.

These Are the Skills You Need to Land a Machine Learning Job

Machine learning (ML) is hot right now, and seems to be poised for a broader takeover of tech in the future. As jobs open up, we’ve identified the skills needed to land your next ML job. A recent study by Univa shows 96 percent of tech pros say the number of machine learning projects will expand over the next 24 months. Some 68 percent of respondents say their company has used machine learning increasingly in the past two years, too. Interest in a technology or skill typically aligns with job growth. We’ve seen ML jobs rise steadily over time, and there’s been a strong boost the past year or so as Google, Apple, and Microsoft have gotten serious about what machine learning is capable of. As each company rolls out their own developer tools, developer engagement and interest climbs. Tech pros can’t just apply for machine learning jobs without correlating skills, though. As we see in the chart below, the total number of ML jobs over the past two years has grown nearly 600 percent. From the beginning, one skill – ‘data science’ – has led the way. 
 There have been 50 percent more total data science jobs posted since the beginning of 2016, compared to the second-most-popular skill (artificial intelligence, or A.I.). And A.I. job postings during this time have the same lead (50 percent) over third-place Amazon Web Services (AWS). The remaining two skills on our list, TensorFlow and Apache Kafka, trail the other three significantly. We view Kafka as more a complimentary service for companies than a favored one (Kafka works very well with AWS, for instance, so it’s likely benefitting from some synergy). Tensorflow makes significant gains quarterly. It started with very few job postings, and has risen sharply – especially compared to Kafka, which has seen mostly stagnant growth after a sharp spike at the end of 2017. We’ll also note ‘data science’ and ‘artificial intelligence’ are general terms, which tells us companies hiring for machine learning jobs don’t have a preferred framework yet, and possibly don’t know exactly what they’re using ML for. Our findings with skills and machine learning jobs intersect with the cloud, as well. AWS makes a strong showing, and Univa’s survey shows 82 percent of tech pros plan to use a hybrid cloud scheme for their machine learning projects. The sky is the limit, too. Only 22 percent of Univa’s respondents say their company has machine learning projects in production; 28 percent are in the beta/pilot phase, and a full 50 percent say they’re in the research phase. This is likely because machine learning and A.I. are definitely not ready for primetime. We should remember that, while it’s 2018 and computers can do all kinds of interesting things, they must be taught, and we’re just learning how to teach them. Which is why now's a great time to get into machine learning.

The traditional narrative when it comes to discussing the impact of artificial intelligence on HR revolves around the jobs that will be lost. It’s a largely negative picture of the disruption that AI is likely to bring to work as we know it, but it need not be like this. Indeed, most of the applications of AI in HR today have been supportive of the work HR people do.

An excellent example of this comes from one of the pioneers of AI, whose AI-driven products are used by billions every day.  Search giant Google has been using AI to help power the internal talent deployment platform that sits at the heart of gTech, the company’s support and operations division, that helps users and partners get the most out of the company’s vast range of products and services.
Traditionally, the division has been structured around individual products, which forced perpetual reorganization as the company’s product strategies shifted. For many years, this approach struggled to respond with the agility and speed required to allow the right mix of technical and operational skills to be compiled into effective teams to support Google. This was frustrating both for managers and for employees themselves, who wanted greater mobility in their careers.
PROMOTED
This was certainly not a case of AI for the sake of AI, and the company tested a wide range of more low-tech approaches, but none of them really did the job they were looking for, especially in terms of the scalability of staffing model.  So instead, they tested a marketplace-based approach where employees and managers would bid for various assignments.

Building the marketplace
To ensure that there are plenty of opportunities present in the marketplace, the project team batch job vacancies three times per year.  The ultimate aim is to ensure that managers are less possessive over their teams, and indeed over their projects. The company actively wants employees to move around teams and departments to experience new environments and new challenges. It’s something the company refers to as ‘Project Chameleon.’
To aid adoption of the platform, both employees and their managers were asked to rank their personal preferences, which allowed the team to pair them using a Gale-Shapley Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, which matches employees to roles based upon these aforementioned preferences, and of course those of their manager.  It’s an approach that borrows heavily from that used for decades in American hospitals to match graduating doctors to hospitals.

It’s common for many projects to begin life as a small pilot, but that doesn’t really work when trying to build a marketplace as you need a critical mass of employees, vacancies and indeed managers using it for value to emerge.  So, instead, the team posted around 1/3 of all positions in each hiring round so that eventually all jobs would be hosted on Project Chameleon.
Building trust
The next step was to ensure that all stakeholders had trust in the system. This was hard for Google to achieve, despite their obvious expertise in building algorithms that deliver exceptional results. For instance, it was vital that when people listed their preferences, these were accurate. The whole viability of the system rested on this, and it took a while to get it right.
Indeed, in the first round, just 11% of employees moved jobs, with over 25% of this initial cohort failing to get their first choice.  By the second year, things had begun to improve, and the results reflected this. More employees switched roles in one batch than had done so in all previous rounds combined. This was driven by growing trust in the system, with 74% of users comfortable sharing their true preferences with the system.
These early successes have allowed the system to mature, and it’s now been running for a couple of years, with a number of interesting results emerging.  For instance, there is much greater transparency in the roles that are available, and the skills required to fill them. It has also increased the control employees feel over their deployment, with some 90% of Googlers now getting one of their top three choices whenever they move internally.
The project has also helped to normalize the notion of moving internally within Google, making it a much easier conversation to have, both with each other and with managers about career goals and aspirations.  It also resulted in many more employees actively networking with managers across the business as they investigated potential opportunities.
Sometimes as recruiters, we fail to spot the talent that’s sitting under our noses in-house. Platforms such as Chameleon are a nice example of how we can better uncover the talent we have within our organization.  You can read more about the project in this Harvard Business Review case study.Check out my website. Pavel KrapivinFollowingFollowI am the founder and CEO of VelvetJobs, the career matchmaking service used by millions of professionals.

Clarke and film director Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Clarke's novel Childhood's End&nbsp;and his lesser-known short story The Sentinel.&nbsp;A striking work of speculative fiction, it depicts&mdash;in terms sometimes hopeful and other times cautionary&mdash;a future of alien contact, interplanetary travel, conscious machines and even the next great evolutionary leap of humankind.The most obvious way in which 2018 has fallen short of the vision of 2001&nbsp;is in space travel. People are not yet routinely visiting space stations, making unremarkable visits to one of several moon bases, nor traveling to other planets. But Kubrick and Clarke hit the bulls-eye when imagining the possibilities, problems and challenges of the future of artificial intelligence.What can computers do?A chief drama of the movie can in many ways be viewed as a battle to the death between human and computer. The artificial intelligence of 2001&nbsp;is embodied in HAL, the omniscient computational presence, the brain of the Discovery One spaceship&mdash;and perhaps the film's most famous character. HAL marks the pinnacle of computational achievement: a self-aware, seemingly infallible device and a ubiquitous presence in the ship, always listening, always watching.HAL is not just a technological assistant to the crew, but rather&mdash;in the words of the mission commander Dave Bowman&mdash;the sixth crew member. The humans interact with HAL by speaking to him, and he replies in a measured male voice, somewhere between stern-yet-indulging parent and well-meaning nurse. HAL is Alexa and Siri&mdash;but much better. HAL has complete control of the ship and also, as it turns out, is the only crew member who knows the true goal of the mission.Ethics in the machineThe tension of the film's third act revolves around Bowman and his crewmate Frank Poole becoming increasingly aware that HAL is malfunctioning, and HAL's discovery of these suspicions. Dave and Frank want to pull the plug on a failing computer, while self-aware HAL wants to live. All want to complete the mission.The life-or-death chess match between the humans and HAL offers precursors of some of today's questions about the prevalence and deployment of artificial intelligence in people's daily lives.First and foremost is the question of how much control people should cede to artificially intelligent machines, regardless of how ""smart"" the systems might be. HAL's control of Discovery is like a deep-space version of the networked home of the future or the driverless car. Citizens, policymakers, experts and researchers are all still exploring the degree to which automation could&mdash;or should&mdash;take humans out of the loop. Some of the considerations involve relatively simple questions about the reliability of machines, but other issues are more subtle.The actions of a computational machine are dictated by decisions encoded by humans in algorithms that control the devices. Algorithms generally have some quantifiable goal, toward which each of its actions should make progress&mdash; like winning a game of checkers, chess or Go. Just as an AI system would analyze positions of game pieces on a board, it can also measure efficiency of a warehouse or energy use of a data center.But what happens when a moral or ethical dilemma arises en route to the goal? For the self-aware HAL, completing the mission&mdash;and staying alive&mdash;wins out when measured against the lives of the crew. What about a driverless car? Is the mission of a self-driving car, for instance, to get a passenger from one place to another as quickly as possible&mdash;or to avoid killing pedestrians? When someone steps in front of an autonomous vehicle, those goals conflict. That might feel like an obvious ""choice"" to program away, but what if the car needs to ""choose"" between two different scenarios, each of which would cause a human death?Under surveillanceIn one classic scene, Dave and Frank go into a part of the space station where they think HAL can't hear them to discuss their doubts about HAL's functioning and his ability to control the ship and guide the mission. They broach the idea of shutting him down. Little do they know that HAL's cameras can see them: The computer is reading their lips through the pod window and learns of their plans.In the modern world, a version of that scene happens all day every day. Most of us are effectively continuously monitored, through our almost-always-on phones or corporate and government surveillance of real-world and online activities. The boundary between private and public has become and continues to be increasingly fuzzy.The characters' relationships in the movie made me think a lot about how people and machines might coexist, or even evolve together. Through much of the movie, even the humans talk to each other blandly, without much tone or emotion&mdash;as they might talk to a machine, or as a machine might talk to them. HAL's famous death scene&mdash;in which Dave methodically disconnects its logic links&mdash;made me wonder whether intelligent machines will ever be afforded something equivalent to human rights.Clarke believed it quite possible that humans' time on Earth was but a ""brief resting place"" and that the maturation and evolution of the species would necessarily take people well beyond this planet. 2001&nbsp;ends optimistically, vaulting a human through the ""Stargate"" to mark the rebirth of the race. To do this in reality will require people to figure out how to make the best use of the machines and devices that they are building, and to make sure we don't let those machines control us.Daniel N.

Our economy is changing in the United States and across all developed nations — and a big driver of that change is technology.
The advent of robots that could mass produce goods in place of human laborers was one of the first waves of change that challenged our workforce.
Now, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence pose new and different threats. Those technologies aren’t just an existential crisis for middle class jobs, they also pose challenges for society as a whole.
But some researchers are looking at ways these technologies can be used to solve some of society’s ills.
One of those researchers is data scientist Rumman Chowdhury, the global lead for responsible AI at Accenture Applied Intelligence. She recently speaks with Detroit Today producer Jake Neher about the threats, promises, and opportunities this technology holds.
“Artificial Intelligence is something people like to think about robots and something anthropomorphized and physical, and I think what people maybe find scary is that it’s not, it’s algorithms and code that live in a cloud that invisibly shape our lives,” says Chowdhury. “That’s actually, quite frankly, much scarier than a physical robot that you might battle.”
She says, despite fears surrounding the technology, it can also be used for good.
“Really what we should be thinking about when we think about artificial intelligence is a technology that has an amazing potential to shape the world and shape our lives for good. But we need to be careful in how we build and design it so that it’s not perpetuating already-existing inequalities in our society,” says Chowdhury.

What is the AI scene like in China compared to the U.S.? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Kai-Fu Lee, CEO of 创新工场, former President of Google China and Author of AI Superpowers, on Quora:
A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.
In research, US has about 60% of the world’s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. (For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers.)
PROMOTED
Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the US, but since the deep learning breakthrough, we’ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. And that’s where China comes in.

China’s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. Nearly abandoning my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. What’s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. Most other startups in China are 997.
Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.

The Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. Total transactions in 2017 were $18.8 trillion, even larger than China’s GDP. How’s that possible? China’s mobile payments are built on the world’s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.
All of this is amplified by China’s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. China’s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. (The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year.)
All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies’ AI work better. Today, China has the world’s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.
Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. The same is true for US and China. For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).
China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags in the US, AI can make a big difference. We’ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).
So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world’s funding, while US 38%.
This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. More questions:

Artificial Intelligence: What kinds of jobs will be vulnerable to displacement due to AI, and how soon will it happen?

Artificial intelligence has become so powerful which enables it to play a key role in settling socio-economic values in India. Research says that with the right amount of investment artificial intelligence can create a flywheel effect which empowers the people to develop a long-run economic and societal value. In the healthcare industry, technology can help in providing facilities like preventive healthcare and augmented diagnosis to the needy. Then, in the agriculture sector, productivity can be increased by 20-30 percent using predictive technology..But in the current scenario areas of opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence, there is a severe lax in a country like India. This condition prevails even after the presence of tech-savvy talent pool, well-established universities and adequate level of entrepreneurs and strong corporates..Even though technical universities are pioneers in the research areas of artificial intelligence, it seems redundant to solidify the artificial intelligence ecosystem around them unlike the global counterparts like Cambridge, Oxford etc. In India, there are around 2.6 million graduates who are under stream STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects. But these graduates lag in their practical proficiency levels therefore drastically affecting their employability. This is the arena where universities have to step ahead to match international standard by investing in research and providing quality support to graduates..India ranks third in the total number of artificial intelligence startups after the US and China among the G20 countries. But the issue that is pertaining to India is that the funding received by Indian AI startups is significantly lower than in the US and China. This will adversely affect the growth and productivity of Indian startups..Multi-National Corporations along with leading Indian Banks are in the pursuit to experiment with artificial intelligence. However, according to the report by Accenture consulting, more than 80 percent of the Indian businesses believed that artificial intelligence would transform the industries. The company also made a prediction that there would be moderate to extensive investment in artificial intelligence segment in the coming three years..India being a democratic country, the policymakers play a pivotal role. The government should take initiative to create a roadmap for the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. For example, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has created a task force for artificial intelligence to work out how it can be utilized for the development in manufacturing and services..Now the big picture is vivid, if there is a large focus on artificial intelligence ranging from educational institutions to businesses to government, then the nation could reap the rewards. There are millions of people who are interested in artificial intelligence and the educational universities need to upgrade with international par and provide the students with learnings. Also business should recognize that the future lies in terms of efficiency and it is up to these large companies to make a substantial investment in their research and development wing. Lastly, there should be a government policy to bring it all together and make it happen..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The research, by the cross-party Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, found that even relatively modest gains from using robots and AI had the potential to give British workers Scandinavian levels of leisure time.The conclusions of the study will come as a boost to John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who wants to look at reducing hours in the working week. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady used her speech to the organisation’s annual gathering last month to call for a four-day working week, saying that it should be achievable by the end of the century. She also attacked the likes of Amazon chief Jeff Bezos for overseeing a trillion-dollar company while “his workers are collapsing on the job exhausted”.View image in fullscreenShadow chancellor John McDonnell wants to look at reducing hours in the working week. Photograph: Kirsty O'Connor/PAWhile Labour is prioritising policies to deal with the insecurities of the gig economy in its next manifesto, McDonnell told the Observer: “We are interested in the TUC’s proposals in how the benefits of automation, robotics and AI of the fourth industrial revolution are shared with the workers, both in rewards and potentially a shorter working week. Work-life balance is increasingly coming on to society’s agenda.”British employees currently work longer hours on average than most of their European counterparts, while at the same time the UK has seen a slump in productivity. The typical British worker spends 42 hours a week at work but produces 16% less on average than counterparts in other leading economies, according to the Office for National Statistics.The SMF analysis suggests that a 10% gain in workforce productivity could allow employers to produce the same output with a 38-hour week, assuming pay and employer profits remained the same. It would give British employees the same working week that Norwegians and Danes currently enjoy. A 30% productivity gain could allow the working week to fall to just 32 hours, or a standard four-day working week.While new technologies could bring economic rewards for employers, the SMF also warned that without the right government policies the workforce may not see any benefits.It called for big companies to be required to report their average profit per employee and to show how this is changing relative to wages. It also called on chancellor Philip Hammond to use his budget at the end of this month to give tax breaks to workers trying to improve their skills.Scott Corfe, the SMF’s chief economist who authored the report, said: “Robots, AI and big data could dramatically change society for the better, addressing the UK’s productivity crisis and creating more enjoyable work as mundane tasks are automated. If we manage this revolution properly, workers will get new choices, including whether to reduce their working week and having more leisure time.“However, it also brings challenges. Some firms are using new technologies to micromanage and monitor every movement of staff – including how long they spend in the toilet. We need to ensure that technology is rolled out in an ethical way that maintains the dignity of work, and that workers are properly consulted.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersThe ObserverRobotsWork-life balanceArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedUnderground cave found on moon could be ideal base for explorersFormer classmate describes Trump rally gunman as ‘definitely conservative’LiveTrump picks Ohio senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential pick for the 2024 US elections – liveBlue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi HasanAOC to anonymous Democrat who said party resigned to Trump win: ‘Retire’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Human Well-being
By Brent Orrell
RealClearMarkets
October 12, 2018



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn The question of how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact human well-being is something of a Rorschach test. It depends on whom you ask. For some, the advent of “smart” everything portends a future of rising living standards and unimagined opportunities for human flourishing. Others help us see the dark side. Without going “full Terminator,” some of the best informed people in the AI field see an economic transformation that threatens social cohesion as human labor — mental and physical — becomes slow, antiquated and artisanal and is ultimately consolidated and replaced by the unlimited energy, dynamism, and rocketing productivity of an algorithm-driven world.
Sophia, a robot integrating the latest technologies and artificial intelligence developed by Hanson Robotics is pictured during a presentation at the “AI for Good” Global Summit at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse.
Two recent books, Work in the Age of Robots (Encounter Books, 2018) by the Manhattan Institute’s Mark Mills, and AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) by Kai-Fu Lee, former head of Google China, embody the polarities of this debate. For Mills, the supposed threat of AI to human work is same macro-economic mistake we’ve been re-living since the Kennedy Administration: we see automation destroying jobs but can’t yet envision the economic demand and jobs automation will create. For Lee, this chapter of innovation is truly different. AI is like the introduction of electricity, a “breakthrough technology that once harnessed can be applied to revolutionizing dozens of different industries” so fast and so disruptively that it will result in massive economic dislocations, and overwhelm the ability of individuals and societies to adapt. Mills is sanguine; Lee sanguinary.
Lee’s argument is rooted in his career as an architect and builder of the modern Chinese economy, his stewardship of Google’s failed entrance into the Chinese market, and — surprisingly — his battle with lymphoma. He describes the Chinese economy as being built on what he euphemistically calls “imitation” — known as “theft” in the West — of technology chiefly from North American innovators. This technology has been assimilated and is morphing under the pressure of a gladiator entrepreneurial culture of rapid-cycle competition and development. China has taken what it needs from the West and is now leaping ahead by applying that technology to products like WeChat, a “Swiss army knife” app that combines social networking with everything from grocery shopping to booking doctor appointments and airplane tickets. Backed by oceans of data (Lee calls China the Saudi Arabia of consumer information) Lee predicts Chinese firms will garner more than half the projected $15 trillion increase in global GDP that AI will generate.
In the world Lee envisions, the money gleaned from AI innovations leads not to rising living standards but to economic and employment dystopia. Vast wealth accumulates to a small number of early AI investors and developers while the rest of humanity scrapes together a bare subsistence performing tasks requiring too much manual dexterity for robots. In Lee’s view, AI is a general purpose technology, like steam engines, that reshapes all production. Unlike the Industrial Revolution, where the introduction of industrial-scale mills provided employment to millions while wiping out the jobs of a comparative handful of small artisan weavers, AI will do the opposite. Rather than breaking work down into assembly-line processes that require more workers, AI eliminates jobs by concentrating work in the hands of a few highly skilled technology workers managing algorithm-driven systems. Eliminate hundreds of thousands of skilled tax preparers and replace them with the effectively unlimited capacity of web-based Turbo Tax. In other words, AI takes aim at the cognitive workers who do lots of repetitive “assembly-line” information tasks of the types that provide a lot of middle-skill, well-paid work. The robots are coming for the factory workers, and for the information economy professionals.
To Mills, the Lee scenario is amped up Luddism. Every human being, he says, is allotted about one million hours in a normal life-span. The story of human advancement has been one of figuring out how to substitute machine for human labor thereby reducing the number of hours devoted to backbreaking drudgery. AI is merely the next step in that journey of reducing labor inputs and increasing productivity, wealth, and well-being. In this view, economic growth is centered in manufacturing but surrounded, as it has been since the dawn of the modern era, by a much larger service economy. Demand for new and existing products is nowhere near its limit. In the developed world, there are 700 cars for every 1,000 people; in the developing world there are several hundred people for every car. If AI boosts productivity and reduces the price of finished products, demand will rise and with it the total employment required to supply materials, fabricate products, and distribute, sell, and service the gadgets.
And here’s where the Lee and Mills perspectives partially converge. Whatever else AI is, it cannot replace the human beings at the center of economic life. Lee learned this during his bout with cancer. Machines diagnosed his illness and he benefited from the best drugs and medical protocols. But it was his family, whom he says he neglected during his career, who really got him through treatment. They paid exquisitely focused attention to his needs — down to observing his reactions to the food they prepared and adjusting the spices to reduce nausea — something a machine could never do. Lee’s conclusion is that we can employ those who might have worked in factories and offices in jobs that provide education and care. State subsidies, paid for by taxes on the tidal wave of AI generated wealth, would raise compensation for those jobs to a respectable level. Similarly, Mills notes that it is absurd to assume that machines, however sophisticated, could ever replace people. An internal Google study listed eight hiring qualifications required by managers. At the top were communication, cooperation, and critical thinking — distinctively human characteristics. At the bottom were degrees in hard sciences.
The human element both Lee and Mills emphasize is the bedrock on which the economic future is built, regardless of which perspective ultimately turns out to be more accurate. The sci-fi nightmare of a general artificial intelligence capable of replicating or imitating human behavior is a mirage. Algorithms operate in narrow, well-defined tasks. The human mind is like an infinite number of highly complex and perfectly synchronized and integrated algorithms that are built, first and foremost, to respond to other human minds. This inherent human sociability, which Adam Smith identified as the source and purpose of economic life, is what will shape our future not the silica pathways of our magnificent computing machines.

Artificial Intelligence in Norway 
April 13, 2021October 16, 2018 by David Nikel 

Home » Science » Artificial Intelligence in Norway








Some of Norway's biggest companies and research institutes are getting together to build competence in artificial intelligence.
Big names in Norwegian business like Telenor, DNB and Kongsberg are joining forces with Trondheim-based research powerhouses NTNU and SINTEF to seek out opportunities in AI and reduce the reliance on oil revenues.
The group of investors also includes energy giant Equinor (formerly Statoil) and the global classification agency DNV GL.
The first step in a collaborative approach was to establish the joint venture enterprise Norwegian Open AI Lab (NOAIL), which will develop expertise and technologies for use in Norway and for export potential.







Making a global impact
That latter point is crucial, as Norway wants to develop and deliver AI solutions that have big potential for global sales. The country has long been criticised by some for its inward focus when it comes to innovation and entrepreneurship, outside of oil and gas and the shipping industry, that is.
It's part of the reason the country has always played catch-up in the world of innovation. Norway's Nordic neighbours Sweden, Denmark and Finland are all better established in the world of technology entrepreneurship.
SINTEF CEO Alexandra Bech Gjørv told Computer Weekly that the background for the collaboration is that we are living in a highly competitive world that is fast-moving and increasingly challenging.
“It’s critical that we start to build Norway's competence within the AI domain now. Industry in Norway faces challenges and requirements that can't be solved by using off-the-shelf solutions. We must work to develop technology that can strengthen Norwegian industry’s competitive advantage.”






One of the reasons NTNU and SINTEF are so involved is that NOAIL aims to build a bridge between industry and academia. NOAIL will serve as a centre of excellence to strengthen the quality and capacity for research, education and innovation in the AI-domain.
The basis for this cooperation is the shared understanding that industry and academia will need to form a deeper bond in the AI-area for Norway to gain its much sought-after strong and sustainable international position in the global marketplace.
Where are we with AI?
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have moved from the realm of sci-fi novels into realism. But how far down the road are we? Possibly farther than you think…
IBM interviewed 30 AI experts to uncover the key elements to sparking the next AI innovation wave. All agreed that the technology has entered a period of rapid R&D.
“Faced with a constant onslaught of data, we needed a new type of system that learns and adapts, and we now have that with AI,” says Arvind Krishna, Senior Vice President of Hybrid Cloud and Director of IBM Research.






“What was deemed impossible a few years ago is not only becoming possible, it’s very quickly becoming necessary and expected.”
Experts express little doubt that deep learning will serve as a vital variable in the new AI growth equation, much as it did in the current one. However, deep learning has yet to demonstrate a strong ability to help machines with reasoning, a skill they must master to enhance many AI applications.
“The next big opportunity is to do for reasoning what deep learning did for perception and classification. Reasoning is required for a range of cognitive tasks including using basic common sense, dealing with changing situations, simple planning and making complex decisions in a profession”, states the report.
“Real machine learning is changing the world”
The South China Morning Post reported from this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that much of what was promoted as AI was actually natural language processing rather than machine learning, but the stories were there.
“Despite not being obvious at the CES, machine learning is having a lot of success in the background”, said the report.






“Google’s latest AI tool, called DeepVariant, was recently used to sequence human genomes in significantly more detail than humans could manage by presenting the data as an image. It initiated discoveries of mutations that would otherwise have remained hidden.”
“Similarly at the University of Texas, researchers worked with Google’s AI tools to trawl through data from the Kepler Space Telescope after astronomers had found all they could using their existing methods. They found “extra” planets around distant solar systems that would have otherwise remained undiscovered.”
Presumably it's these type of breakthroughs that NOAIL will be aiming to make within its new lab.
Building on existing competence
Hopes are high that the new Norway lab will make get off to a flyer because the team is not actually starting from scratch.
NOAIL is an expansion of the existing Telenor-NTNU AI-Lab located in Trondheim. It builds further on the work already carried out there in the areas of innovation within artificial intelligence/machine learning and big data.






“NTNU is proud to host the Norwegian Open AI Lab. With this powerhouse, we ensure the recruitment of talented professionals and students to the field. This lab will develop tomorrow's technology and methods as well as help solve today's challenges across fields and usage areas,” says the Rector of NTNU, Gunnar Bovim.

Although schools across the country are adding classes, increasing enrollment and developing new programs to accommodate student demand, there are too few potential employees with training or experience in AI. That has big consequences. Too few AI-trained job-seekers has slowed hiring and impeded growth at some companies, recruiters and would-be employers told Reuters. It may also be delaying broader adoption of a technology that some economists say could spur U.S. economic growth by boosting productivity, currently growing at only about half its pre-crisis pace. Andrew Shinn, a chip design manager at Marvell Technology Group who was recruiting interns and new grads at UC Berkeley's career fair, said his company has had trouble hiring for AI jobs. ""We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years,"" he said. ""It does slow things down."" ""COMING OF AGE""Many economists believe AI has the potential to change the economy's basic trajectory in the same way that, say, electricity or the steam engine did. ""I do think artificial intelligence is ... coming of age,"" said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview. ""This will diffuse through the whole economy and will change all of our lives."" But the speed of the transformation will depend in part on the availability of technical talent. A shortage of trained workers ""will definitely slow the rate of diffusion of the new technology and any productivity gains that accompany it,"" said Chad Syverson, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. U.S. government data does not track job openings or hires in artificial intelligence specifically, but online job postings tracked by jobsites including Indeed, Ziprecruiter and Glassdoor show job openings for AI-related positions are surging. AI job postings as a percentage of overall job postings at Indeed nearly doubled in the past two years, according to data provided by the company. Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see https://tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eG Universities are trying to keep up. Applicants to UC Berkeley's doctoral program in electrical engineering and computer science numbered 300 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, with more than half of applicants interested in AI, according to professor Pieter Abbeel. In response, the school tripled its entering class to 30 in the fall of 2017. At the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said. Carnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. ""We feel strongly that the demand is there,"" said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new program. ""And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand."" Still, a fix for the supply-demand mismatch is probably five years out, says Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. The company has algorithms that trawl job postings on company websites, and their data show AI-related job postings having doubled in the last 11 months. ""The supply of people moving into this field is way below demand,"" he said. A JOB-SEEKER'S MARKETThe demand has driven up wages. Glassdoor estimates that average salaries for AI-related jobs advertised on company career sites rose 11 percent between October 2017 and September 2018 to $123,069 annually. Michael Solomon, whose New York-based 10X Management rents out technologists to companies for specific projects, says his top AI engineers now command as much as $1000 an hour, more than triple the pay just five years ago, making them one of the company's two highest paid categories, along with blockchain experts. Liz Holm, a materials science and engineering professor at Carnegie Melon, saw the increased demand first-hand in May, when one of her graduating PhD students, who used machine learning methods for her research, was overwhelmed with job offers, none of which were in materials science and all of them AI-related. Eventually the student took a job with Proctor & Gamble, where she uses AI to figure out where to put items on store shelves around the globe. ""Companies are really hungry for these folks right now,"" Holm said. Mark Maybury, an artificial intelligence expert who was hired last year as Stanley Black and Decker's first chief technology officer, agreed. The firm is embedding AI into the design and production of tools, he said, though he said details are not yet public. ""Have we been able to find the talent we need? Yes,"" he said. ""Is it expensive? Yes."" The crunch is great news for job-seeking students with AI skills. In addition to bumping their pay and giving them more choice, they often get job offers well before they graduate. Derek Brown, who studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, got a full-time post-graduation job offer from Salesforce at the start of his senior year last fall. He turned it down in favor of Facebook, where he started this past July.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHorror Stories Of Entitled PeopleA family of 5 gets on my flight.

Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see https://tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eG Universities are trying to keep up. Applicants to UC Berkeley's doctoral program in electrical engineering and computer science numbered 300 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, with more than half of applicants interested in AI, according to professor Pieter Abbeel. In response, the school tripled its entering class to 30 in the fall of 2017. At the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said. Carnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence.  We feel strongly that the demand is there,  said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new program.  And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand.  Still, a fix for the supply-demand mismatch is probably five years out, says Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. The company has algorithms that trawl job postings on company websites, and their data show AI-related job postings having doubled in the last 11 months.  The supply of people moving into this field is way below demand,  he said. A JOB-SEEKER'S MARKETThe demand has driven up wages. Glassdoor estimates that average salaries for AI-related jobs advertised on company career sites rose 11 percent between October 2017 and September 2018 to $123,069 annually. Michael Solomon, whose New York-based 10X Management rents out technologists to companies for specific projects, says his top AI engineers now command as much as $1000 an hour, more than triple the pay just five years ago, making them one of the company's two highest paid categories, along with blockchain experts. Liz Holm, a materials science and engineering professor at Carnegie Melon, saw the increased demand first-hand in May, when one of her graduating PhD students, who used machine learning methods for her research, was overwhelmed with job offers, none of which were in materials science and all of them AI-related. Eventually the student took a job with Proctor & Gamble, where she uses AI to figure out where to put items on store shelves around the globe.  Companies are really hungry for these folks right now,  Holm said. Mark Maybury, an artificial intelligence expert who was hired last year as Stanley Black and Decker's first chief technology officer, agreed. The firm is embedding AI into the design and production of tools, he said, though he said details are not yet public.  Have we been able to find the talent we need? Yes,  he said.  Is it expensive? Yes.  The crunch is great news for job-seeking students with AI skills. In addition to bumping their pay and giving them more choice, they often get job offers well before they graduate. Derek Brown, who studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, got a full-time post-graduation job offer from Salesforce at the start of his senior year last fall. He turned it down in favor of Facebook, where he started this past July.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBM’s Watson supercomputer has beat Jeopardy champions, reconstituted recipes, and even helped create highlight reels for the World Cup. Now it’s taking on a new tech challenge; changing how the construction industry operates. 
A new partnership between IBM and Fluor, a global engineering and construction company, will put the supercomputer’s computational skills to work on making building more efficient. 
The new Watson-based system, in development since 2015 and now in use on select projects, will be able to analyze a job site “like a doctor diagnoses a patient,” according to Leslie Lindgren, Fluor’s vice president of Information Management. That degree of risk analysis, predictive logistics, and comprehension is no small challenge given the complexity of today’s construction megaprojects. 
“These are multibillion dollar project sites, that are like walking into a city,” says Lindgren. “The sheer volume of data is tremendous.” 
On especially complicated projects, Fluor will begin using two new tools, the EPC Project Health Diagnostics and the Market Dynamics/Spend Analytics, to make sense of the thousands of data points found on a crowded construction site. Constant analysis will help forecast issues before they show up, and automate how materials and workers are distributed. Eventually, the system will develop natural language functionality.
“Think of it as a living and breathing system,” says Sai Yadati, a partner for IBM Global Business Services. “This is truly one-of-a-kind for the marketplace.”  
It’s a bold bet that reflects the ways in which the $10 trillion global construction industry continues to play catch-up with technology. That gap has created an opportunity for startups and technology firms to make a huge difference in an industry beset by increasing costs and labor shortages. 
Applying artificial intelligence to the field won’t bring robots in hard hats, at least not anytime soon. But it can help with cost, scheduling, and quality for an industry in need of cost cutting. According to a McKinsey & Co. analysis, construction projects routinely lose up to a third of their value to waste. 
“Construction is one of the least digitized industries, so many startups are seizing the opportunity to build technology that would increase efficiency within this market,” Michael Wholey, an intelligence analyst for CB Insights, told Curbed.
Startups sees opportunity in construction  
The sharp rise in startup funding in the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) space makes it an ideal time to sell the promise of AI for the building trades. According to data from CB Insights, the industry saw $882.3 million in venture capital investment last year across 103 deals, and has already bested that in 2018, racking up $1.38 billion across 61 deals. KcKinsey found the construction tech industry has benefited from $18 billion in investment since 2013.
While AI’s more fervent converts predict massive leaps forward with adoption of the evolving technology, analysts predict construction will see more moderate gains. 
Turns out the technology gap can’t be leapfrogged immediately; that same McKinsey analysis found that while AI could offer extensive benefits, “few E&C firms or owners currently have the capabilities—including the personnel, processes, and tools—to implement them.”

The report goes on to say that construction, in the short-term, will benefit from second-order improvements, especially as other industries in the supply chain continue to adapt the technology. Construction AI investment will still lag for the foreseeable future. Of the 12 industries McKinsey analyzed, 10 will increase AI spending at a faster pace than construction. 
Carlos Serra, a managing director at JLL, a global real estate management firm, believes the impact of AI is, at best, five to 10 years off, due to the industry’s lack of standardization. JLL has made extensive bets in property technology, and recently built a new proprietary project management system that can work with AI applications. But he feels the fragmented nature of the industry makes it unlikely a technology will be introduced that works for everyone involved, from architects and owners to labor. 
“We get compared to the auto industry, and people ask why we can’t be standardized like them, but it’s really not comparable,” Serra says. “For that to be fair, you’d have to have an individual design for each and every car. For us to get there, we’d need to make architecture redundant.” 
Serra says that JLL is even using a basic AI system for a project in Los Angeles (he can’t name the client due to confidentiality issues). A system of small robots at the job site check and crosscheck real-word construction with a digital model of the project. While the technology can be helpful, it also added millions to the project, a premium Serra says won’t work for most job sites. 
Betting on a more automated future
But that doesn’t mean there won’t be substantial investment. Fortune found many tech firms investing billions in construction tech firms, including Oracle, which purchased Aconex for $1.2 billion in February, and Trimble, which bought Viewpoint for $1.2 billion in April. 
In addition, other ACE firms are creating their own systems. AECOM, the LA-based multinational engineering firm, introduced Capture, a new web and mobile platform that continuously analyzes construction sites and can build an accurate 3D model at any point in a project’s lifecycle. 
Startup indus.ai, a construction intelligence-as-a-service solution which uses neural nets, computer vision, and analysis of millions of construction site photos to train AI to identify problems on existing job sites, just raised $3.7 million in seed funding. 
With such a relatively small technology spend by the industry—McKinsey found engineering and construction only invested 1 percent overall into technology, significantly smaller than other industries—the opportunity for new technologies to change construction sites is vast.

Artificial intelligence research has a lot to learn from nature. My work links biology with computation every day, but recently the rest of the world was reminded of the connection: The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Frances Arnold together with George Smith and Gregory Winter for developing major breakthroughs that are collectively called “directed evolution.” One of its uses is to improve protein functions, making them better catalysts in biofuel production. Another use is entirely outside chemistry – outside even the traditional life sciences.
That might sound surprising, but many research findings have very broad implications. It’s part of why just about every scientist wonders and hopes not only that maybe they would be selected for a Nobel Prize, but, far more likely, that the winner might be someone they know or have worked with. In the collaborative academic world, this isn’t terribly uncommon: In 2002, I was studying under a scholar who had studied under one of the three co-winners of that year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. This year, it happened again – one of the winners has written a couple of papers with a scholar I have collaborated with.
Beyond satisfying my own vanity, the award reminds me how useful biological concepts are for engineering problems. The best-known example is probably the invention of Velcro hook-and-loop fasteners, inspired by burrs that stuck to a man’s pants while he was walking outdoors. In the Nobel laureates’ work, the natural principle at work is evolution – which is also the approach I use to develop artificial intelligence. My research is based on the idea that evolution led to general intelligence in biological life forms, so that same process could also be used to develop computerized intelligent systems. 
When designing AI systems that control virtual cars, for example, you might want safer cars that know how to avoid a wide range of obstacles – other cars, trees, cyclists and guardrails. My approach would be to evaluate the safety performance of several AI systems. The ones that drive most safely are allowed to reproduce – by being copied into a new generation. 
Yet just as nature does not make identical copies of parents, genetic algorithms in computational evolution let mutations and recombinations create variations in the offspring. Selecting and reproducing the safest drivers in each new generation finds and propagates mutations that improve performance. Over many generations, AI systems get better through the same method nature improves upon itself – and the same way the Nobel laureates made better proteins.
In the effort to understand human intelligence, many researchers are working to reverse-engineer the brain, figuring out how it works at all levels. Complex gene networks control the neurons that form the layers of the neocortex that are sitting on top of a highway of connections. These interconnections support communications between the different cortical regions that make up most of our cognitive functions. All of this is integrated into the phenomenon of consciousness.

Deep learning and neural networks are computer-based approaches that attempt to recreate how the brain works – but even they can only achieve the equivalent activity of a clump of brain cells smaller than a sugar cube. There remains an enormous amount to learn about the brain – and that’s before trying to write the intensely complicated software that can emulate all those biological interactions.
Capitalizing on evolution can make systems that seem lifelike and are inherently as open-ended and innovative as natural evolution is. It is also the key methodology used in genetic algorithms and genetic programming. The Nobel Prize committee’s recognition highlights a technology that has evolution at its core. That indirectly justifies my own research approach and the idea that evolution in action is a critical research topic with vast potential.

The robots are taking over, and some of the tech billionaires who drove their rise are stepping up to give big to programs focused on artificial intelligence.Since 2015, nine wealthy donors have given a total of about $583.5 million to nonprofit institutions that are developing new artificial-intelligence tools and studying the effects of A.I. on human life, according to a Chronicle tally of publicly announced gifts.Of those nine, five are technology moguls. Among them is the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday. He gave $125 million in February to his Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle nonprofit he launched in 2013. His last gift during his lifetime went to a new research program that is studying ways to instill common sense in artificial-intelligence programs to improve problem-solving without human input.

The robots are taking over, and some of the tech billionaires who drove their rise are stepping up to give big to programs focused on artificial intelligence. Since 2015, nine wealthy donors have given a total of about $583.5 million to nonprofit institutions that are developing new artificial-intelligence tools and studying the effects of A.I. on human life, according to a Chronicle tally of publicly announced gifts. Of those nine, five are technology moguls. Among them is the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday. He gave $125 million in February to his Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle nonprofit he launched in 2013. His last gift during his lifetime went to a new research program that is studying ways to instill common sense in artificial-intelligence programs to improve problem-solving without human input. Allen’s institute operates several programs that center on creating new A.I. systems and tools, and his gift reflects the majority of those donating large sums to A.I.: philanthropists who want to back the creation of new ways of applying artificial intelligence by supporting new research, academic courses, and professorships. Allen was joined in that effort by others, including Dwight Diercks, an executive at Nvidia, a tech company specializing in A.I. and supercomputing, who gave the Milwaukee School of Engineering $34 million last year for a center for courses on A.I., robotics, and related technologies; and Austin McChord, a cybersecurity entrepreneur who dedicated $20 million of a $50 million donation he gave to his alma mater, Rochester Institute of Technology, to hire more A.I. and cybersecurity faculty.

 Growing Unease But there is another group of rich donors who are using their big gifts to address and explore ethical and other implications of artificial intelligence on our lives. Of the nine philanthropists in the Chronicle’s tally, four directed millions to these concerns in the past 20 months, suggesting a growing unease among even masters-of-the-universe types about the potential down sides of artificial intelligence. Top among this crowd is LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who gave $10 million last year to jump-start the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, a collaboration between MIT Media Lab and Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. The fund is working on developing artificial intelligence that puts ethics first and will serve the public good. Hoffman also recently gave nearly $2.5 million to the University of Toronto to create a professorship to study how future artificial intelligence will affect people’s lives. Elon Musk, who co-founded PayPal and Tesla Motors, gave $10 million in 2015 to the Future of Life Institute, a research organization that studies the risks from advanced technologies and seeks to harness them in ways that will help people flourish rather than self-destruct. Multimillion-dollar gifts exploring the implications of A.I. are starting to come at a more rapid pace. On Monday the New York financier Stephen Schwarzman gave $350 million to MIT for a new College of Computing, which will focus on developing new breakthroughs and the ethical application of artificial intelligence. Late last month, he gave $5 million to Harvard Business School to develop case studies and other programs to analyze how A.I. is affecting different industries, individual companies, and financial markets.

 The significance of increasing concerns about A.I. is not lost on the companies that have spawned the rise of technology in our everyday lives. Microsoft, which Allen and Bill Gates co-founded, announced late last month a $40 million grant for the third phase of its A.I. for Good program. The grant will go to A.I. for Humanitarian Action, a five-year program aimed at using artificial intelligence to address global problems like disaster response and the refugee crisis.

Therefore, in this article I would like to discuss the most common of these arguments.Argument # 1: Artificial intelligence is still in its infancyThe claim that the AI ​​is still in its infancy is a lullaby for critics. A similar reasoning is used by climate skeptics. Part of the climate researchers, for example, argue that individual weather phenomena can not be traced back to climate change. What from skeptics to conclusions in the direction of “Well, you all, panic!” Is reinterpreted.Here, a differentiated statement is instrumentalized to consolidate one’s own reasoning. It would be just as tricky to claim that the present state of artificial intelligence is a useful indicator for the next 10, 20 or 100 years. What is actually said?

Almost two-thirds of the school's student population are considered to be among the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of learners in the country, according to the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority.""There are some select schools across the state that have been tinkering with these things for a few years, but it's only in the last two years that it's cheap enough and accessible enough that we can be working with this type of equipment,"" Mr McPherson said.""You have to be able to allow for the cost of the robot, and a bit extra for breakages."" Charlotte Hazeldine and her friends, Makayla Stork and Georgie Milburn, have been working on putting together a robot they call 'Fred'.(ABC Central Victoria: Mark Kearney)Open-source solutionThe school has recently used a Victorian Government grant to purchase several do-it-yourself robotics kits, made entirely from components that can be bought on the open market — not from a robot manufacturer.Step-by-step assembly instructions can be downloaded online for free.All together, the parts for one robot cost about $100. The price is less again if the body of the robot is constructed from cardboard or another commonly found material.

It was an experience students wouldn't have if the school bought pre-built robots to program.""They've got to work out after they've made it, why did it or didn't it work, and then go back and make it again, in the same way an engineer would keep refining and reiterating a design until they've made, say, the perfect bridge,"" he said.Friend or foe?

MIT To Build New College With USD 1 Billion Dedicated For Artificial Intelligence

Published by Amer Ahmed
, in News
— October 16, 2018
















In a recent announcement, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that it wants to create a new college specially dedicated for the science of artificial intelligence. The University committed a total of USD 1 billion for the program with the main focus on “responsible and ethical” uses of the technology.













Along with that, the university also said that it would add a total of 50 new faculty members and create a hub of inter-disciplines for dedicated work in the fields of computer science, Artificial Intelligence and other related fields.





A big amount of the new funds is slated to come from a gift from Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and co-founder of the financial giant Blackstone. The college will also be named after him.


“As computing reshapes our world, MIT intends to help make sure it does so for the good of all,” said MIT President Rafael Reif.


A statement by MIT said that the crucial initiative represents the single largest investment being done in computing and AI by an American academic institution.
The grand initiative news comes at a time when there are growing concerns over the impacts of artificial intelligence on global institutions, and fears that China is going ahead that extra mile compared to United States in this field.


“There is no more important opportunity or challenge facing our nation than to responsibly harness the power of artificial intelligence so that we remain competitive globally and achieve breakthroughs that will improve our entire society,” Schwarzman said.
“We face fundamental questions about how to ensure that technological advancements benefit all — especially those most vulnerable to the radical changes AI will inevitably bring to the nature of the workforce.”

The new college is expected to open in the month of September of the year 2019. The college will have a new and dedicated building and that will be completed in the year 2022.
There have been speculations over the use of Artificial Intelligence with many experts saying that the technology may overcome human power of intelligence finally to overtake us. This may even result in the extinction of human race. Amid these concerns, many scientists are advising to take all precautions beforehand to face the risk in case we come across such a situation. Artificial Intelligence tries to mimic human intelligence in various forms. But that does not mean that it can be limited to a form. It can be coded for any kind of software.

What effect will job displacement due to AI have on the worldwide economy? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Kai-Fu Lee, CEO of 创新工场, former President of Google China and Author of AI Superpowers, on Quora:
As outlined in my new book AI Superpowers, 40-50% of our jobs will be technically and economically doable by AI and automation over the next 15 years. AI can optimize within a single domain by “watching and learning” from many actual examples. So AI certainly cannot do most things that we humans can do.
PROMOTED
Disruption will hit the industry in areas with the largest number of routine jobs – manufacturing, call centers, banks, retail, etc. It will also cause existing players to compete on their speed of automation. Those who automate faster will be economically advantaged and may win over outsized profits. There will also be disruptions in certain markets (such as loans by apps rather than banks, news edited by personalized AI rather than editors, robot fast food restaurants rather than human-serviced ones).

The net impact will be that there will be a few winners and many losers. A small number of companies (AI companies, Internet+AI companies, AI SaaS companies, etc.) will make outsized profits, while others will struggle to survive. People in routine jobs will lose their jobs, and I believe only human-to-human service jobs are a sector large enough to accommodate them with some retraining.
The GDP will go up substantially (PWC estimates AI will add $16 trillion in WW GDP by 2030), but the wealth gap will widen, between countries (as US and China dominate), companies (AI companies vs. routine job companies), and individuals (AI tycoons vs. displaced workers). This will present a lot of economic challenges to even the winning countries (like US and China): how to redistribute income (tax for the ultra-rich and universal basic income are both difficult and fraught with problems).

Richard Waters in San Francisco October 9 2018124Print this pageStay informed with free updatesSimply sign up to the US & Canadian companies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.The human race is not on the scrapheap after all. Or at least not yet. There has been no shortage of predictions in recent years about how advances in artificial intelligence and robotics will see humans replaced in all kinds of jobs.
But most AI experts see a less drastic outcome. In this version of the future, people will still have a role working alongside smart systems: either the technology will not be good enough to take over completely, or the decisions will have human consequences that are too important to hand over completely to a machine.
This hybrid decision-making
 should produce better results than either working alone, according to David Mindell, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of Our Robots, Ourselves. There’s just one problem: when humans and semi-intelligent systems try to 
work together, things do not always turn out well.
A catastrophic demonstration took place on the streets of Tempe, Arizona, this year. An Uber test car equipped with the company’s latest self-driving technology struck and killed a person crossing the road. Like almost all of today’s autonomous cars, a back-up driver was there to step in if the software failed. But an analysis by local police concluded that the driver was distracted at the time — and may have been watching a TV show on a smartphone.
The Uber vehicle was relying on a degree of autonomy which is due to be launched more widely next year. The so-called Level 3 system is designed to drive itself in most situations but hand control back to a human when confronted by situations it cannot handle.

A system that is meant to be fully autonomous but suddenly deviates puts unrealistic demands on humans, say critics. “If you’re only needed for a minute a day, it won’t work,” says Stefan Heck, chief executive of Nauto, a US start-up whose technology is used to prevent professional drivers from becoming distracted. “It’s neither fish nor fowl.”
The failure points to a predicament with the adoption of AI that reaches well beyond driverless cars. Without careful design, the intelligent systems making their way into the world could provoke a backlash against the technology.
Once people come to understand how limited today’s machine learning systems are, the exaggerated hopes they have aroused will evaporate quickly, warns Roger Schank, an AI expert who specialises in the psychology of learning. The result, he predicts, will be a new “AI winter” — a reference to the period in the late 1980s when disappointment over the progress of the technology led to a retreat from the field. 
Preventing that will require more realistic expectations of the new autonomous systems, as well as careful design to make sure they mesh with the human world. But the technology itself presents a serious barrier.
“The way AI works, and the way it fails, are foreign to us,” says Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. “Does the AI make us feel more involved — or is it like dealing with an alien species?”

The semi-driverless car is a particularly stark example of a near-autonomous system that relies on close co-operation with people. But as AI advances, hybrid systems such as these are creeping into many different situations.
Machine learning — the type of AI that is behind the most dramatic recent progress in the field — is an advanced form of pattern recognition. It has already proved itself superior to people in tasks such as identifying the images in photographs or recognising speech.
But it is less effective when it has to make judgments based on the specific data on which it has been trained. In the real world, people often make decisions about situations they have not previously faced.
RecommendedArtificial intelligence in real workplacesCan a robot do your job?
The problem lies in systems that can match data but not understand its significance. “They are powerful things, but they don’t have a sense of the world,” says Vishal Sikka, a former top SAP and Infosys executive who specialises in AI. 

The new forms of human/machine co-operation are taking root in three main ways. First, there are scenarios where humans act as a back-up for the robots, taking over when the machines reach the limits of their abilities. Many work processes are being redesigned in this way — such as automated call centres, where language-understanding systems try to handle callers’ queries, only defaulting to a human operator when the technology is confused.
The Uber crash was an extreme example of what can go wrong. Research from Stanford University has shown that it takes at least six seconds for a human driver to recover their awareness and take back control, says Mr Heck. But even when there is enough time for human attention to be restored, the person stepping into a situation may see things differently from the machine, making the handover far from seamless.
PodcastThe Big ReadArtificial intelligence: can humans and robots work together?
“We need to work on a shared meaning between software systems and people — this is a very difficult problem,” says Mr Sikka. The use of language highlights the difficulty. Humans can convey meaning by using few words: the shared understanding of context between speaker and listener invests those words with meaning, adds Mr Sikka. Computer scientists have not yet worked out how to create that shared understanding in machines, he adds.
A second type of human/machine co-operation is designed to make sure that a sensitive task always depends on a person — even in situations where an automated system has done all the preparatory work and would be quite capable of completing the task itself.
Military drones, where human “pilots”, often based thousands of miles away, are called on to make the decision to fire at a target, are one example. 
Facial recognition systems — used to help immigration officers identify suspect travellers — are another. Both show how AI can make humans far more effective without robbing them of control, says Mr Heck.
One criticism of semi-autonomous weapons such as drones, however, is that there are no technical barriers to turning them into fully autonomous systems. Current procedures and safeguards can quickly be changed.

According to Stuart Russell, an AI professor at the University of California, Berkeley, it would be a short and easy step in a national emergency to remove the human drone operator from the loop, precipitating an era of robot weapons that make their own decisions about when to kill people. “You can’t say the technology itself can only be used in a defensive way and under human control. It’s not true,” he says.
A final type of “human in the loop” system involves the use of AI that is not capable of handling a task entirely on its own but is used as an aid to human decision-making. Algorithms that crunch data and make recommendations, or direct people in which step to take next, are creeping into everyday life. 


The algorithms, though, are only as good as the data they are trained on — and they are not good at dealing with new situations. People required to trust these systems are often also required to take them on faith.
Mr Schank points to the role of algorithms in baseball. Analysing the strengths and weaknesses of each batter has led to new ways of setting the field that baseball traditionalists would balk at. The outcome of these computer-aided decisions may well end up being worse than those based on purely human analysis, he says.
A bug in the app used by Uber drivers in San Francisco sent them to an airport cargo site rather than the passenger terminal. “Sometimes people will blindly follow the machine, other times people will say: ‘Hang on, that doesn't look right.’ It’s like a lot of other technologies, people will adapt,” says Tim O’Reilly, a technology author.

These may be relatively harmless cases where little damage is done from being led astray by the machine. But what happens when the stakes are higher?
IBM made medical diagnostics one of the main goals for Watson, the system first created to win a TV game show and then repurposed to become what it calls a more general “cognitive” system.
Such systems are designed to leave the ultimate decision with an expert. IBM maintains that humans will always have the final say. But how easy would it be for a doctor to override a recommendation being offered by a computer that, by definition, has analysed more comparable situations and crunched more data than they have? 
Rejecting the technology might be even harder if it has insurance or other financial consequences. “Doctors are put in a position where they feel subservient to the system,” says Mr Nourbakhsh. “Simply saying they’ll still make the decisions doesn’t make it so.”
Similar worries surfaced in the 1980s, when the field of AI was dominated by “expert systems” designed to guide their human users through a “decision tree” to reach the correct answer in any situation. It turned out to be too hard to anticipate all the unforeseen factors that complicate real-world decisions.
Artificial intelligence may be able to clean up scans and spot anomalies faster than the human eye, but algorithms can be fallible 
But the latest AI, based on machine learning, looks set to become far more widely adopted, and it may be harder to second-guess. Thanks to their success in narrow fields such as image recognition, expectations for these systems have been soaring. Their creators have been more than happy to feed the hype.
“We’re getting out-of-control marketing departments,” says Mr Schank. He singles out IBM in particular, arguing that the company heavily over-promised when it came to Watson — a criticism frequently heard in AI circles.
The long road to a driverless future

 Dario Gil, chief operating officer of IBM’s research effort, defends the decision to launch a big initiative around Watson nearly eight years ago, arguing that no other tech companies were according such a central role to AI at the time. But, he adds: “We were not clear enough about the difference between general . . . and specific [AI].”
Assessing the quality of an AI system’s recommendations raises other challenges. Non-experts may feel reluctant to second-guess a machine whose workings they do not understand.
It is not a new dilemma. More than 30 years ago, a software glitch in a radiation therapy machine called Therac-25 led to some patients being given massive overdoses. Technicians had no way of identifying the flaw and the machine stayed in use much longer as a result, says Mr Nourbakhsh.
That’s the odd irony of artificial intelligence — the best systems happen to be the ones that are least explainable today
The technology used in the most advanced machine learning systems, known as neural networks, present additional challenges. They are modelled on a theory about how the human brain operates, passing data through layers of artificial neurons until an identifiable pattern emerges. Unlike the logic circuits employed in a traditional software program, there is no way of tracking this process to identify exactly why a computer comes up with a particular answer. This is a big hindrance in the adoption of neural networks. 
“That’s the odd irony of AI — the best systems happen to be the ones that are least explainable today,” says Mr Nourbakhsh.
Some experts, however, say headway is being made and that it will not be long before machine learning systems are able to point to the factors that led them to a particular decision. “It’s not impossible — you can look inside and see what signals it’s picking up,” says Mr Heck.
Like many working in the field, he expresses optimism that humans and machines, working together, will achieve far more than either could have done alone. But there are some serious design challenges to solve before that rosy future arrives.
AI still has ‘a long way to go’ in dealing with people
There has long been a sure-fire way to get people and machines to work more effectively together: make the humans themselves act more like the machines.
Since the earliest days of mass manufacturing, it has been easier to fit people into the carefully structured world of automated processes than it has been to unleash the systems to work in the messy human world.
Some computer science experts say a more creative relationship between man and machine will take new forms of AI 
What applied to early motor vehicle assembly lines is equally relevant in the age of artificial intelligence. But it comes with limitations. People often accept — and act on — the output of such systems without questioning them, says Roger Schank, an expert in the psychology of learning.
Pointing to the risk that doctors will blindly follow the recommendations of intelligent diagnostics systems, even when they are wrong, he adds: “There are always going to be doctors who are robotic. This problem has existed forever.”
Breaking this cycle and replacing it with a more creative relationship between man and machine will take new forms of AI, some computer science experts say. The systems need a wider understanding of the world in order to fit their recommendations into a more human context, says Vishal Sikka, the former chief executive of Infosys.
Mr Schank says that computer scientists should stop studying machine intelligence and turn their attention instead on the human variety. He points out that some of the founders of the field of AI were also psychologists. Only a better understanding of how humans learn from their experiences and apply their knowledge to new situations will bring the necessary breakthrough, he says.
David Mindell, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has written about the challenges of getting humans and robots to interact effectively, puts it most succinctly: “The computer science world still has a long way to go before it has a clue about how to deal with people.”

The company’s experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars – much as shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said.“Everyone wanted this holy grail,” one of the people said. “They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 résumés, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.”But by 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.Automation could destroy millions of jobs. We have to deal with it nowYvette CooperRead moreThat is because Amazon’s computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in résumés submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized résumés that included the word “women’s”, as in “women’s chess club captain”. And it downgraded graduates of two all-women’s colleges, according to people familiar with the matter.Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon’s recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.Amazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges, but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equality.The company’s experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Goldman Sachs that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.Franken-algorithms: the deadly consequences of unpredictable codeRead moreSome 55% of US human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.Masculine languageAmazon’s experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world’s largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon’s Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree; since June 2015, the company’s global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.So it set up a team in Amazon’s Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize some 50,000 terms that were found on past candidates’ résumés. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.Instead, the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ resumes, such as “executed” and “captured”, one person said.Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.The problem or the cure?Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping companies look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyzes candidates’ speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on résumés.“You weren’t going back to the same old places; you weren’t going back to just Ivy League schools,” Parker said. His company’s customers include Unilever PLC and Hilton.Goldman Sachs has created its own résumé analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the “best fit”, the company said.LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network, has gone further. It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its site.Joseph Stiglitz on artificial intelligence: 'We’re going towards a more divided society'Read moreStill, John Jersin, vice-president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruiters.“I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,” he said. “The technology is just not ready yet.”Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites’ algorithms for discrimination.“We are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue,” said Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU. Still, Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring; job candidates might never know it was being used.As for Amazon, the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment. It now uses a “much watered-down version” of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores, including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases, one of the people familiar with the project said.Another said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try, this time with a focus on diversity.Explore more on these topicsAmazonArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedUnderground cave found on moon could be ideal base for explorersFormer classmate describes Trump rally gunman as ‘definitely conservative’LiveTrump picks Ohio senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential pick for the 2024 US elections – liveBlue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi HasanAOC to anonymous Democrat who said party resigned to Trump win: ‘Retire’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They told Reuters that the system was intended to review job applications and give candidates a score ranging from one to five stars.""They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those,"" said one of the engineers who spoke to Reuters.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENT'Women' penalisedBy 2015, it was clear that the system was not rating candidates in a gender-neutral way because it was built on data accumulated from CVs submitted to the firm mostly from males, Reuters claimed.The system started to penalise CVs which included the word ""women"". The program was edited to make it neutral to the term but it became clear that the system could not be relied upon, Reuters was told.The project was abandoned, although Reuters said that it was used for a period by recruiters who looked at the recommendations generated by the tool but never relied solely on it.According to Amazon, its current global workforce is split 60:40 in favour of males.About 55% of US human resources managers said that AI would play a role in recruitment within the next five years, according to a survey by software firm CareerBuilder.It is not the first time doubts have been raised about how reliable algorithms trained on potentially biased data will be.MITAn MIT AI system, dubbed Norman, had a dark view of the world as a result of the data it was trained onAn experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which trained an AI on images and videos of murder and death, found it interpreted neutral inkblots in a negative way.And in May last year, a report claimed that an AI-generated computer program used by a US court was biased against black people, flagging them as twice as likely to reoffend as white people.Predictive policing algorithms were spotted to be similarly biased, because the crime data they were trained on showed more arrests or police stops for black people.

Artificial intelligence helps reveal how people process abstract thought

As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, much of the public attention has focused on how successfully these technologies can compete against humans at chess and other strategy games. A philosopher from the University of Houston has taken a different approach, deconstructing the complex neural networks used in machine learning to shed light on how humans process abstract learning.





""As we rely more and more on these systems, it is important to know how they work and why,"" said Cameron Buckner, assistant professor of philosophy and author of a paper exploring the topic published in the journal Synthese. Better understanding how the systems work, in turn, led him to insights into the nature of human learning.
Philosophers have debated the origins of human knowledge since the days of Plato—is it innate, based on logic, or does knowledge come from sensory experience in the world?
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, or DCNNs, suggest human knowledge stems from experience, a school of thought known as empiricism, Buckner concluded. These neural networks—multi-layered artificial neural networks, with nodes replicating how neurons process and pass along information in the brain—demonstrate how abstract knowledge is acquired, he said, making the networks a useful tool for fields including neuroscience and psychology.
In the paper, Buckner notes that the success of these networks at complex tasks involving perception and discrimination has at times outpaced the ability of scientists to understand how they work.
While some scientists who build neural network systems have referenced the thinking of British philosopher John Locke and other influential theorists, their focus has been on results rather than understanding how the networks intersect with traditional philosophical accounts of human cognition. Buckner set out to fill that void, considering the use of AI for abstract reasoning, ranging from strategy games to visual recognition of chairs, artwork and animals, tasks that are surprisingly complex considering the many potential variations in vantage point, color, style and other detail.






""Computer vision and machine learning researchers have recently noted that triangle, chair, cat, and other everyday categories are so dif?cult to recognize because they can be encountered in a variety of different poses or orientations that are not mutually similar in terms of their low-level perceptual properties,"" Buckner wrote. ""... a chair seen from the front does not look much like the same chair seen from behind or above; we must somehow unify all these diverse perspectives to build a reliable chair-detector.""
To overcome the challenges, the systems have to control for so-called nuisance variation, or the range of differences that commonly affect a system's ability to identify objects, sounds and other tasks—size and position, for example, or pitch and tone. The ability to account for and digest that diversity of possibilities is a hallmark of abstract reasoning.
The DCNNs have also answered another lingering question about abstract reasoning, Buckner said. Empiricists from Aristotle to Locke have appealed to a faculty of abstraction to complete their explanations of how the mind works, but until now, there hasn't been a good explanation for how that works. ""For the first time, DCNNs help us to understand how this faculty actually works,"" Buckner said.
He began his academic career in computer science, studying logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence. The stark differences between early AI and the ways in which animals and humans actually solve problems prompted his shift to philosophy.
Less than a decade ago, he said, scientists believed advances in machine learning would stop short of the ability to produce abstract knowledge. Now that machines are beating humans at strategic games, driverless cars are being tested around the world and facial recognition systems are deployed everywhere from cell phones to airports, finding answers has become more urgent.
""These systems succeed where others failed,"" he said, ""because they can acquire the kind of subtle, abstract, intuitive knowledge of the world that comes automatically to humans but has until now proven impossible to program into computers.""

Thanks to Amazon, the world has a nifty new cautionary tale about the perils of teaching computers to make human decisions.
According to a Reuters report published Wednesday, the tech giant decided last year to abandon an “experimental hiring tool” that used artificial intelligence to rate job candidates, in part because it discriminated against women. Recruiters reportedly looked at the recommendations the program spat out while searching for talent, “but never relied solely on those rankings.”
The misadventure began in 2014, when a group of Amazon engineers in Scotland set out to mechanize the company’s head-hunting process, by creating a program that would scour the Internet for worthwhile job candidates (and presumably save Amazon’s HR staff some soul crushing hours clicking around LinkedIn). “Everyone wanted this holy grail,” a source told Reuters. “They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.”

It didn’t pan out that way. In 2015, the team realized that its creation was biased in favor of men when it came to hiring technical talent, like software developers. The problem was that they trained their machine learning algorithms to look for prospects by recognizing terms that had popped up on the resumes of past job applicants—and because of the tech world’s well-known gender imbalance, those past hopefuls tended to be men.
“In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word ‘women’s,’ as in ‘women’s chess club captain.’ And it downgraded graduates of two all-women’s colleges,” Reuters reported. The program also decided that basic tech skills, like the ability to write code, which popped up on all sorts of resumes, weren’t all that important, but grew to like candidates who littered their resumes with macho verbs such as “executed” and “captured.”

After years of trying to fix the project, Amazon brass reportedly “lost hope“ and shuttered the effort in 2017.
All of this is a remarkably clear-cut illustration of why many tech experts are worried that, rather than remove human biases from important decisions, artificial intelligence will simply automate them. An investigation by ProPublica, for instance, found that algorithms judges use in criminal sentencing may dole out harsher penalties to black defendants than white ones. Google Translate famously introduced gender biases into its translations. The issue is that these programs learn to spot patterns and make decisions by analyzing massive data sets, which themselves are often a reflection of social discrimination. Programmers can try to tweak the A.I. to avoid those undesirable results, but they may not think to, or be successful even if they try.
Amazon deserves some credit for realizing its tool had a problem, trying to fix it, and eventually moving on (assuming it didn’t have a serious impact on the company’s recruiting over the last few years). But, at a time when lots of companies are embracing artificial intelligence for things like hiring, what happened at Amazon really highlights that using such technology without unintended consequences is hard. And if a company like Amazon can’t pull it off without problems, it’s difficult to imagine that less sophisticated companies can.

Artificial intelligence run amok has the potential for lurking biases. Reuters reports Amazon’s machine-learning specialists made a troubling discovery that their new recruiting engine had a bias against women.
Automation factors into processes across Amazon’s business from operations to pricing. The team also uses artificial intelligence to tackle hiring and had been building tools for this aim since 2014. This experimental hiring AI tool rated job candidates on a 5-star scale similar to the product ratings Amazon shoppers give.
“Everyone wanted this holy grail,” said one of the specialists. “They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.”

AI learned a preference for male candidates; subsequently, resumes with the word “women’s” were discounted so where those of graduates of two, unspecified all-women’s colleges.

Evidence of gender bias for software developer and other technical job candidates emerged as early as 2015 and was the result of the computer models relying on an inadvertently male-heavy resume pool drawn from a decade-long period. AI learned a preference for male candidates; subsequently, resumes with the word “women’s” were discounted so where those of graduates of two, unspecified all-women’s colleges.
While Amazon made updates to prevent bias for these particular terms, no safeguards were made against other forms of discrimination, according to the team. Amazon eventually scrapped the project in 2017, disappointed with the results. Anonymous sources also revealed Amazon recruiters took ratings into consideration as only one part of their hiring process.
In response, Amazon had no comment on the tool’s issues of bias, but told Reuters the tool “was never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates” with no further comment. The company did not dispute that recruiters saw these generated recommendations.
This saga illustrates the challenges of machine learning in automating the hiring process. A 2017 survey by CareerBuilder found that some 55 percent of U.S. human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years. Machine learning has a ways to go for this application, experts note. “How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that’s still quite far off,” explained Nihar Shah, assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon.
Amazon’s experiment coincided with a hiring spree and inexpensive computing power that made machine learning appealing. The company had formed an engineering team in Edinburgh to create an AI sourcing tool. Unfortunately, among other issues, this tool learned to favor masculine language (words such as “executed” and “captured”).
While Amazon’s foray with AI in hiring went south, other companies are undeterred and believe automation can even force employers to look beyond elite credentials. Companies such as Goldman Sachs and Microsoft have used AI in their recruiting processes.
AI is no substitute for humans when it comes to recruiters, cautions John Jersin, vice president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions.
“I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,” Jersin said. “The technology is just not ready yet.”
The opacity surrounding the technology has also drawn the ire of organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union who are pushing for algorithmic fairness. Critics argue that even being aware of discrimination due to automated hiring would be a challenge given the nature of the technology.
Amazon has not cut AI entirely from its recruiting. Its AI now takes the form of a “much-watered down version” of the recruiting engine that handles basic tasks such as de-duplication, according to an anonymous source. The next AI recruiting experiment rolling out from the Edinburgh team is taking on a new challenge: diversity.

While some fear that improvements in machine learning and cognitive intelligence will present a threat to jobs—which is certainly an important concern—others see AI as a helpful tool for real estate professionals.

When hearing the term ""AI,"" people often think of chatbots and Siri or Alexa; however, experts see AI as having greater potential as a common helper in the real estate industry—being able to communicate with buyers in an intelligent manner and identify important signals for property regulations, such as RegTech.

Technology can assist the industry in property management, application processing and data synthesizing so that agents and brokers can focus on connecting with clients and helping them with the emotional process of buying or selling a home.

Here are some ways real estate professionals can utilize AI to improve their operations and increase their business growth:
<ul>
	<li>For property management, advanced machine learning can streamline everyday processes for tenants, property managers and landlords by helping find suitable tenants, locate vendors and provide alerts for routine maintenance and management tasks.</li>
	<li>Increase the number of recommendations your clients can choose from through AI. Agents can convert their knowledge of a client's wants into data an algorithm can use to find a higher number of matches at a faster rate.</li>
	<li>AI can provide virtual tours for interested homebuyers and answer simple technical questions about the property on behalf of the agent, such as square footage, questions about the lease and more, through 24/7 chat boxes. More nuanced questions can be transferred to the agent.</li>
	<li>Agents can maintain long-term relationships with their clients for when they need help moving, selling or even buying multiple properties in the future through AI-based customer relationship management (CRM) systems.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of the ways AI is being developed into the way real estate professionals conduct their business. AI can be a helpful tool that can make everyday tasks more efficient and provide assistance to clients at a moment's notice, rather than a replacement for the agent themselves. It's important to remember that AI is not without flaws. Some worry that AI creators and users will include their own biases within new technology, causing more roadblocks and harm to minorities.

Innovators are working to make AI great at problem solving, automatic processing, data collecting and so on, but being an agent or broker requires skills that AI doesn't have: the expert advice of a professional who has worked in the field for over 20 years; the ethics to make sure AI is used responsibly; the ability to listen and understand the needs of a client; the intuition to know when a property is a good fit or deal; and the empathy to sympathize and provide moral support when homebuyers get cold feet or things don't go according to plan.<strong>

Watching a 50th anniversary screening of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” I found myself, a mathematician and computer scientist whose research includes work related to artificial intelligence, comparing the story’s vision of the future with the world today.
close dialog     Play/Pause Video              Mute/Unmute Video             Advertisementclose dialogThe movie was made through a collaboration with science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and film director Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Clarke’s novel “Childhood’s End” and his lesser-known short story “The Sentinel.” A striking work of speculative fiction, it depicts – in terms sometimes hopeful and other times cautionary – a future of alien contact, interplanetary travel, conscious machines and even the next great evolutionary leap of humankind.
The most obvious way in which 2018 has fallen short of the vision of “2001” is in space travel. People are not yet routinely visiting space stations, making unremarkable visits to one of several moon bases, nor traveling to other planets. But Kubrick and Clarke hit the bull’s-eye when imagining the possibilities, problems and challenges of the future of artificial intelligence.Advertisement:
What can computers do?
A chief drama of the movie can in many ways be viewed as a battle to the death between human and computer. The artificial intelligence of “2001” is embodied in HAL, the omniscient computational presence, the brain of the Discovery One spaceship — and perhaps the film’s most famous character. HAL marks the pinnacle of computational achievement: a self-aware, seemingly infallible device and a ubiquitous presence in the ship, always listening, always watching.
HAL is not just a technological assistant to the crew, but rather — in the words of the mission commander Dave Bowman — the sixth crew member. The humans interact with HAL by speaking to him, and he replies in a measured male voice, somewhere between stern-yet-indulging parent and well-meaning nurse. HAL is Alexa and Siri — but much better. HAL has complete control of the ship and also, as it turns out, is the only crew member who knows the true goal of the mission.Advertisement:
Ethics in the machine
The tension of the film’s third act revolves around Bowman and his crewmate Frank Poole becoming increasingly aware that HAL is malfunctioning, and HAL’s discovery of these suspicions. Dave and Frank want to pull the plug on a failing computer, while self-aware HAL wants to live. All want to complete the mission.
The life-or-death chess match between the humans and HAL offers precursors of some of today’s questions about the prevalence and deployment of artificial intelligence in people’s daily lives.
First and foremost is the question of how much control people should cede to artificially intelligent machines, regardless of how “smart” the systems might be. HAL’s control of Discovery is like a deep-space version of the networked home of the future or the driverless car. Citizens, policymakers, experts and researchers are all still exploring the degree to which automation could — or should — take humans out of the loop. Some of the considerations involve relatively simple questions about the reliability of machines, but other issues are more subtle.Advertisement:
The actions of a computational machine are dictated by decisions encoded by humans in algorithms that control the devices. Algorithms generally have some quantifiable goal, toward which each of its actions should make progress – like winning a game of checkers, chess or Go. Just as an AI system would analyze positions of game pieces on a board, it can also measure efficiency of a warehouse or energy use of a data center.
But what happens when a moral or ethical dilemma arises en route to the goal? For the self-aware HAL, completing the mission — and staying alive — wins out when measured against the lives of the crew. What about a driverless car? Is the mission of a self-driving car, for instance, to get a passenger from one place to another as quickly as possible – or to avoid killing pedestrians? When someone steps in front of an autonomous vehicle, those goals conflict. That might feel like an obvious “choice” to program away, but what if the car needs to “choose” between two different scenarios, each of which would cause a human death?Advertisement:
Under surveillance
In one classic scene, Dave and Frank go into a part of the space station where they think HAL can’t hear them to discuss their doubts about HAL’s functioning and his ability to control the ship and guide the mission. They broach the idea of shutting him down. Little do they know that HAL’s cameras can see them: The computer is reading their lips through the pod window and learns of their plans.
In the modern world, a version of that scene happens all day every day. Most of us are effectively continuously monitored, through our almost-always-on phones or corporate and government surveillance of real-world and online activities. The boundary between private and public has become and continues to be increasingly fuzzy.
The characters’ relationships in the movie made me think a lot about how people and machines might coexist, or even evolve together. Through much of the movie, even the humans talk to each other blandly, without much tone or emotion — as they might talk to a machine, or as a machine might talk to them. HAL’s famous death scene — in which Dave methodically disconnects its logic links – made me wonder whether intelligent machines will ever be afforded something equivalent to human rights.Advertisement:
Clarke believed it quite possible that humans’ time on Earth was but a “brief resting place” and that the maturation and evolution of the species would necessarily take people well beyond this planet. “2001” ends optimistically, vaulting a human through the “Stargate” to mark the rebirth of the race. To do this in reality will require people to figure out how to make the best use of the machines and devices that they are building, and to make sure we don’t let those machines control us.

Amazon Scraps Secret AI Recruiting Engine that Showed Biases Against Women
AI Research scientists at Amazon uncovered biases against women on their recruiting machine learning engine

By Roberto Iriondo Email

The AI research team had been building a recruiting machine-learning based engine since 2014, it took care of reviewing applicant’s resumes with the aim of intelligently automatizing the search for top talent.
Quoting an AI research scientist on the team: “Everyone wanted this Holy Grail,” one of the people said. “They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.” However, by 2015, Amazon realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.
Amazon’s recruiting machine learning model was trained to vet applicants by analyzing certain parameters in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Due to the biases that the machine learning model had, most ideal candidates were generated as men, which is a reflection of the male dominance across the tech industry — therefore the data fed to the model was not unbiased towards gender equality but au contraire.
Amazon’s research team states that they modified the central algorithms and made the machine learning model neutral to these gender biases, however that was not a guarantee that the engine would not device other ways of sorting candidates (i.e. male dominant keywords in applicant’s resumes) that could prove discriminatory.
Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. Nevertheless, ML research scientists such as Assistant Professor, Nihar Shah, whose research is in the areas of statistical learning theory and game theory, with a focus on learning from people at the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, says there is still much work to do.
“How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable — that’s still quite far off,” Professor Shah mentioned.

Masculine dominant keywords on resumes were pivotal after the modification of the algorithms on the machine learning models from Amazon’s recruiting engine. The research group created 500 models that focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize over 50,000 parameters that showed up on applicants’ resumes. The algorithms ultimately learned to assign a low percentage of significance towards skills that were common across all applicants, i.e. programming languages, platforms used, etc.
It is important for our society to continue with the focus towards machine learning, but with special attention to biases — which, sometimes are unconsciously added to these programs. Thankfully Amazon’s AI research team was able to recognize such biases and act upon it.

LeaderEQ uses artificial intelligence-based technology to match coaches with executives and host virtual sessions on desktop or mobile.
""We brought on two neuroscientists to help build technology that would make matching coaches with executives faster,"" says Chessa Eskandanian-Yee, who started the company with her mother Katherine Eskandanian-Yee. On Oct. 8, 2018, they launched LeaderEQ, which they say matches executives and coaches in five to ten minutes based on their past experience, work habits, personality, culture and values. I spoke to the cofounders in advance of LeaderEQ's launch.

Elana Lyn Gross: How did you decide to go into business together, and what inspired you to start LeaderEQ?
Katherine Eskandanian-Yee: I’ve never treated [Chessa Eskandanian-Yee] like a child, I’ve always trusted her immensely, and that trust we have with each other, you cannot find with a stranger. It is unconditional trust. We’ve always had synergy, but we’re not the same people, and we have different ideas.
PROMOTED
When [Chessa Eskandanian-Yee] was growing up, she watched me coach and guide my clients and candidates through different challenges and learned so much from observation. When she graduated from college, we knew we wanted to work together, and we wanted to create a high-touch coaching service that reached a lot of people, without losing that personal and high-quality aspect. This was really [Chessa Eskandanian-Yee's] brainchild.
Chessa Eskandanian-Yee: Like my mom said, we’re not the same people, but we do often joke that we share a brain. My mom has always been my best friend. We love each other and, from that, we realized we work really well together. We understand each other’s work habits. It also helps that since I am her daughter, she can’t stay mad at me.
Gross: What is LeaderEQ’s mission? How is it different than other executive coaching companies or platforms?
Chessa Eskandanian-Yee: The real goal behind LeaderEQ is to help executives not feel lonely at the top. Every executive we’ve met says that at some point, they have felt that way. We want to make today’s leaders feel secure in who they are and match them with coaches that they can create a trusted relationship with so we can help them put their best foot forward. It’s almost like a dating service, we want to be a matchmaker for them. Coaching is an extremely personal experience, and it’s really important that we treat it that way.

Katherine Eskandanian-Yee: With my recruitment company Agency360, we are recruiters and advisors to businesses. We were shaping the culture of a company through the people we brought on. The part we saw was missing from this was that we were not able to stay a permanent guide with those individuals or companies through transitions. For example, one of our recruitment clients went through an acquisition. Through that, we saw a lot of mistakes that the leadership team made around communication with employees, which caused a mass exodus. We realized that if we would have been able to make this a more involved relationship, we would have been there to guide them through it and teach them how to deliver the messages in a way that employees understood. They are actually now a LeaderEQ client. That’s why we started LeaderEQ. We wanted to create relationships that last so that coaches could help executives through every stage of their career.
Gross: Does being mother-daughter business owners give you any sort of advantage? Does the dynamic present any challenges?
Katherine Eskandanian-Yee: I think our goals and visions are aligned. When I started my last company, I had two other partners and our visions were not aligned. And that’s why we went our separate ways. You cannot always find that alignment with people. I think our customers also get an advantage from us being related because they know we’re coming from the same place and we're always talking to one another.
Chessa Eskandanian-Yee: It’s a lot of just understanding each other. We can bounce ideas off each other freely without fear of judgment or too much conflict. It’s not weird to call your mom at midnight in a panic about something, but it might be to call your business partner. It’s just this basic level of trust and understanding that would take two strangers much longer to build. We had a leg up from the get-go.
It’s not always sunny, and we don’t always agree. But we always work through it.
Gross: What is the best advice you've ever received?
Chessa Eskandanian-Yee: Make sure you invest in relationships with people that light a fire in you. In high school, I had a teacher that was always pushing me beyond my limits and encouraging me to reach my top potential. She empowered me to keep stepping outside of my comfort zone and to face anything that I was afraid of doing.
Katherine Eskandanian-Yee: No mountain is too high. I have a yoga teacher that is much younger than me, and she had me do a move that I just did not think I could even try. She said, “Your body is a Mercedes Benz, and you just need to learn how to drive it.” Don’t undermine yourself. The power of the mind is something to be aware of.  What you think you cannot do is exactly what you can do – face your fears. And that’s the purpose of a coach, to push you to that limit. Just like you need a trainer at the gym to force you to do that extra set, coaches help you reach your full potential.
Gross: What is your business advice for other young professional women?
Chessa Eskandanian-Yee: Don’t let limitations of the mind scare you. If someone thinks you cannot do something, show them you can. There really should be nothing in your life that limits you.  Embrace your weird, that is what makes you, you.
Katherine Eskandanian-Yee: Speak up. It’s our time as women. It’s time for women to shine. It’s time for female founders. It’s time for us to question limitations society has put upon us for many years. We have to stand up, and we have to have our voices heard. This is the time for the female voice to be heard on every platform – our time is now.
Responsibility also lies with parents to raise young women who understand that they can do anything. We need to take away that traditional box we have for boys and girls. Stop automatically giving girls dolls, give them something to build. We don’t have enough female engineers in this world. We have to stop putting limitations on each other. Gender should not be the reason to hold someone back from reaching their full potential. For this business specifically, it’s about turning your weakness into your strength and defying stereotypes.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out some of my other work here. Elana Lyn GrossI'm a journalist and the author of What Next?: Your Five-Year Plan for Life After College published by Simon & Schuster.

But a year into the project, the programers realized that the algorithmic system wasn’t good at identifying people’s job potential: It was just good at identifying men.

Artificial intelligence systems like the one Amazon tried to build typically require lots of data to learn. Gigabytes of image data are needed to train an algorithm to distinguish between a picture of a cat and a horse, and similarly Amazon’s algorithm would have needed historical data to tell what was desirable in a job candidate.

“Everyone wanted this holy grail,” one of the Amazon employees Reuters interviewed said. “They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.”

That’s where the bias crept in, according to Reuters. The team decided to train the system on the previous 10 years of resumes sent to Amazon, which were mostly men. When the algorithm reached its conclusions for what would be good and what would be bad in an applicant, it mirrored the hiring biases towards men that Amazon had shown in the past. In 2014, Amazon released diversity numbers that revealed 63% of Amazon employees were male, and that number grew to 75% when only looking at managers.

The algorithmic system went so far as to penalize the word “women” on a resume, as in a women’s club or sport, and downgraded all-women’s colleges as less preferable. Amazon reportedly tried to make the algorithm more neutral, but there was no guarantee that it actually was less biased.

The algorithm was also just not very good: It would recommend jobs for applicants where they had no expertise or applicable skills. Amazon reportedly shut down the project after coming to this conclusion.

“This was never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates,” an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz.

This is far from the first example of an artificial intelligence system that only mirrors the biases found in its training data. The idea has been brought up in testimony to the US Congress, and has been acknowledged by tech companies like Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Bias along gender, ethnicity, and geographic lines have even been seen in healthcare applications of the technology.

Yet for all the discussion, there are no best practices or industry guidelines for developing AI technology without biases. That could change in the near future, though, as details about algorithms like Amazon’s are revealed amid growing congressional scrutiny into whether facial recognition and forms of AI making governmental decisions could break civil rights laws.

Update (Oct. 11): This story has been updated to include a comment from an Amazon spokesperson.

Doosan Bobcat North America is exploring the notion of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its Bobcat equipment.
In order to study incorporating advanced AI, Doosan Bobcat North America has partnered with SafeAI – a startup company located in Silicon Valley.
Through the pilot program, SafeAI plans to demonstrate how the latest AI technologies, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be used to perceive complex dynamic environments around equipment and provide automated control.
“At SafeAI we are building a safe, AI-enabled autonomous platform for the equipment industry,” said Dr. Bibhrajit Halder, CEO and co-founder of SafeAI. “We look forward to beginning our partnership with the global market leader in compact equipment.”





The partnership is part of Doosan Bobcat North America’s initiative to identify forward-looking solutions to help equipment owners and operators improve productivity.
“We live in an on-demand, highly connected world,” said Joel Honeyman, vice president of global innovation at Doosan Bobcat North America.
“The customers who purchase our machines expect to have the latest and greatest technology at their fingertips. Through our partnership with SafeAI, we hope to work toward our ultimate goal of enabling our customers to work more efficiently on the job site.”

To reach A.I.’s potential, we need to think beyond what it does for search, social media, security, and shopping – and beyond making things merely “smarter”.Instead, we should imagine how A.I. can be both smart and compassionate, a combination that can solve the most important human problems. Good design can lead the way by infusing an approach centered around the user and the real needs that A.I. can address.We should be thinking about A.I. in new contexts – the newborn of the overworked parent, the cancer patient who needs round-the-clock attention, and the child with learning and behavioral difficulties. A.I. holds great promise for them in combination with design that is empathic and follows a few principles.First, good design should help without intruding. A.I. must free our attention rather than take it away, and it must enhance human connection and abilities rather than replace humans. Great design can create A.I. interfaces that fit discreetly and seamlessly into users’ lives, solving problems without creating distraction.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, good design can bring A.I.’s benefits to those who otherwise might be left out. That so much of A.I. is currently directed at the affluent contradicts the notion that good design can serve everyone, regardless of age, condition or economic background. We should take the “A.I. for all” approach, and it should follow a human need. Designers and researchers should work together in the early stages of design to identify those needs, develop A.I. that responds compassionately to human demands, and use design to ensure cost-effective, accessible A.I.-enabled products and services.Third, A.I. should never create emotional dependence. We see this danger in social media, where A.I. traps users in echo chambers and emotional deserts. Thoughtful design can create A.I. experiences that evolve with the user to continuously serve their needs. The combination of good A.I. and good design can ultimately create products that help people live healthier, longer and happier lives.This is not a purely utopian vision. It is achievable. Developers must recognize that while they can do important, valuable work for a range of commercial products and consumers, the most meaningful A.I. will touch those with greater needs and lack of access. The result will mean well-designed products and experiences that tackle real needs, with the power to improve, not complicate, human lives.ImageCredit...Ike EdeaniLILA IBRAHIMChief operating officer, DeepMindArtificial intelligence offers new hope for addressing challenges that seem intractable today, from poverty to climate change to disease. As a tool, A.I. could help us build a future characterized by better health, limitless scientific discovery, shared prosperity and the fulfillment of human potential. At the same time there’s a growing awareness that innovation can have unintended consequences and valid concern that not enough is being done to anticipate and address them.Yet for A.I. optimists, this increasing attention to risks shouldn’t be cause for discouragement or exasperation. Rather, it’s an important catalyst for thinking about the kind of world we want to live in — a question technologists and broader society must answer together.Throughout history few, if any, societal transformations have been preceded by so much scrutiny and speculation about all the ways they could go wrong. A sense of urgency about the risks of A.I., from unintended outcomes to unintentional bias, is appropriate. It’s also helpful. Despite impressive breakthroughs, A.I. systems are still relatively nascent. Our ambition should be not only to realize their potential, but to do so safely.Alongside vital public and political conversations, there’s plenty of technical work to be done too. Already, some of the world’s brightest technological minds are channeling their talent into developing A.I. in line with society’s highest ethical values.For example, as more people and institutions use A.I. systems in everyday life, interpretability — whether an A.I. system can explain how it reaches a decision — is critical. It’s one of the major open challenges for the field, and one that’s energizing researchers across the world.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA recent research collaboration between DeepMind and London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital demonstrated a system that not only recommended the correct referral decision for over 50 eye diseases with 94 percent accuracy but also, crucially, presented a visual map that showed doctors how its conclusions were reached.Meanwhile, researchers at Berkeley have been studying how humans can make sense of robot behavior, and in turn, develop ways for robots to signal their intentions. A team at OpenAI has developed approaches for interpretable communication among humans and computers. Others at DeepMind have been working on A.I. “theory of mind” — the ability to model what drives other systems’ actions and behaviors, including beliefs and intentions.These are just early examples of progress. Much more must be done, including deeper collaborations between scientists, ethicists, sociologists and others. Optimism should never give way to complacency. But the fact that more energy and funding is being invested into this kind of fundamental research is a positive sign. After all, these challenges are as complex, as important, and should be as prestigious as the many other impressive achievements in the A.I. field to date.Awareness of risks can also be a call to action. It’s precisely because A.I. technology has been the subject of so many hopes and fears, that we have an unprecedented chance to shape it for the common good.ImageCredit...Spencer LowellNILS GILMANVice president for programs at the Berggruen InstituteWe stand on the cusp of a revolution, the engineers tell us. New gene-editing techniques, especially in combination with artificial intelligence technologies, promise unprecedented new capacities to manipulate biological nature — including human nature itself. The potential could hardly be greater: whole categories of disease conquered, radically personalized medicine, and drastically extended mental and physical prowess.However, at the Berggruen Institute we believe that strictly engineering conceptions of these new technologies are not enough to grasp the significance of these potential changes.So profound is the potential impact of these technologies that they challenge the very definition of what it is to be human. Seen in this light, the development and deployment of these technologies represent a practical experiment in the philosophical, today conducted primarily by engineers and scientists. But we need a broader conversation.For millenniums Western philosophy took for granted the absolute distinction between the living and the nonliving, between nature and artifice, between non-sentient and sentient beings. We presumed that we — we humans — were the only thinking things in a world of mere things, subjects in a world of objects. We believed that human nature, whatever it may be, was fundamentally stable.But now the A.I. engineers are designing machines they say will think, sense, feel, cogitate, and reflect, and even have a sense of self. Bioengineers are contending that bacteria, plants, animals, and even humans can be radically remade and modified. This means that the traditional distinctions between man and machine, as between humans and nature — distinctions that have underpinned Western philosophy, religion, and even political institutions — no longer hold. In sum, A.I. and gene editing promise (or is it threaten?) to redefine what counts as human and what it means to be human, philosophically as well as poetically and politically.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe questions posed by these experiments are the most profound possible. Will we use these technologies to better ourselves or to divide or even destroy humanity? These technologies should allow us to live longer and healthier lives, but will we deploy them in ways that also allow us to live more harmoniously with each other? Will these technologies encourage the play of our better angels or exacerbate our all-too-human tendencies toward greed, jealousy, and social hierarchy? Who should be included in conversations about how these technologies will be developed? Who will have decision rights over how these technologies are distributed and deployed? Just a few people? Just a few countries?To address these questions, the Berggruen Institute is building transnational networks of philosophers + technologists + policy-makers + artists who are thinking about how A.I. and gene-editing are transfiguring what it means to be human. We seek to develop tools for navigating the most fundamental questions: not just about what sort of world we can build, but what sort of world we should build —— and also avoid building. If A.I. and biotechnology deliver even half of what the visionaries believe is in store, then we can no longer defer the question of what sort of human beings we want to be, both as individuals, and as a collective.ImageCredit...L. Kasimu Harris/Open Society FoundationsSTEPHANIE DINKINSArtist & associate professor of art, Stony Brook University; fellow, Data & Society Research Institute; Soros Equality Fellow; 2018 Resident Artist, EyebeamMy journey into the world of artificial intelligence began when I befriended Bina48 — an advanced social robot that is black and female, like me. The videotaped results of our meetings form an ongoing project called “Conversations with Bina48.” Our interactions raised many questions about the algorithmically negotiated world now being constructed. They also pushed my art practice into focused thought and advocacy around A.I. as it relates to black people — and other non-dominant cultures — in a world already governed by systems that often offer us both too little and overly focused attention.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBecause A.I. is no single thing, it’s difficult to speak to its overarching promise; but questions abound. What happens when an insular subset of society encodes governing systems intended for use by the majority of the planet? What happens when those writing the rules — in this case, we will call it code — might not know, care about, or deliberately consider the needs, desires, or traditions of people their work impacts? What happens if the codemaking decisions are disproportionately informed by biased data, systemic injustice, and misdeeds committed to preserving wealth “for the good of the people?”I am reminded that the authors of the Declaration of Independence, a small group of white men said to be acting on behalf of the nation, did not extend rights and privileges to folks like me — mainly black people and women. Laws and code operate similarly to protect the rights of those who write them. I worry that A.I. development — which is reliant on the privileges of whiteness, men and money — cannot produce an A.I.-mediated world of trust and compassion that serves the global majority in an equitable, inclusive, and accountable manner. People of color, in particular, can’t afford to consume A.I. as mere algorithmic systems. Those creating A.I. must realize that systems that work for the betterment of people who are not at the table are good. And systems that collaborate with and hire those missing from the table — are even better.A.I. is already quietly reshaping systems of trust, industry, government, justice, medicine and, indeed, personhood. Ultimately, we must consider whether A.I. will magnify and perpetuate existing injustice, or will we enter a new era of computationally augmented humans working amicably beside self-driven A.I. partners? The answer, of course, depends on our willingness to dislodge the stubborn civil rights transgressions and prejudices that divide us. After all, A.I. — and its related technologies — carry the foibles of their makers.A.I. presents the challenge of reckoning with our skewed histories, while working to counterbalance our biases, and genuinely recognizing ourselves in each other. This is an opportunity to expand — rather than further homogenize — what it means to be human through and alongside A.I. technologies. This implies changes in many systems: education, government, labor, and protest, to name a few. All are opportunities if we, the people, demand them and our leaders are brave enough to take them on.ImageCredit...Mauro Bottaro/European UnionANDRUS ANSIPEuropean Commission vice president for the digital single marketIn health care today, algorithms can beat almost all but the most qualified dermatologists in recognizing skin cancer. A recent study found that dermatologists could identify 86.6 percent of skin cancers, while a machine using artificial intelligence (A.I.) detected 95 percent.In Denmark, when people call 112 — Europe’s emergency number — an A.I.-driven computer analyzes the voice and background noise to check whether the caller has had a heart attack.A.I. is one of the most promising technologies of our times.It is an area where several European Union countries have decided to invest and research, to formulate a national strategy or include A.I. in a wider digital agenda. We encourage all our countries to do this, urgently, so that the E.U. develops and promotes A.I. in a coordinated way.This should be a Pan-European project, not a series of national initiatives that may or may not overlap. It is the best way for Europe to avoid a splintered A.I. environment that hinders our collective progress, and to capitalize on our strong scientific and commercial position in this fast-evolving sector.That can only happen if all E.U. countries work and pull together.Today, many breakthroughs in A.I. come from European labs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWe have a good talent and industrial base — as a world region, Europe is home to the highest number of service robot manufacturers. We have world-class expertise in techniques requiring less data — ‘small data’ — to train algorithms.The European Commission has long recognized the importance and potential of A.I. and robotics, along with the need for much higher investment and an appropriate environment that adequately addresses the many ethical, legal and social issues involved.This can only be achieved by starting from common European values — such as diversity, nondiscrimination and the right to privacy — to develop A.I. in a responsible way. After all, people will not use a technology that they do not trust. We set out Europe’s way forward on A.I. in a dedicated strategy earlier this year.Our aim is to be ahead of technological development, to maximize the impact of investment in supercomputers and research and to encourage more A.I. use by the private and public sectors. We are consulting widely — also with non-E.U. countries — to design ethical guidelines for A.I. technologies.The project to build a Digital Single Market based on common Pan-European rules creates the right environment and conditions for the development and takeup of A.I.in Europe — particularly concerning data, the lifeblood of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt frees up data flows, improves overall access to data and encourages more use of open data.It aims to improve connectivity, protect privacy and strengthen cybersecurity.A.I. has the potential to benefit society as a whole: for people going about their everyday lives, for business.Europe is stepping up efforts to be at the forefront of the exciting possibilities that A.I. technologies offer.A correction was made on Oct. 19, 2018: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of Yves Béhar’s company.

Is it possible to build an AI that won't reflect the bone-deep distorted justice of our social systems?,,Amazon just scrapped a sexist recruiting engine. Is it possible to build an AI that won't reflect the bone-deep distorted justice of our social systems?,,,,"        Amazon’s AI gurus scrapped a new machine-learning recruiting engine earlier this month. Why? It transpired that the AI behind it was sexist. What does this mean as we race to produce ever-better artificial intelligence, and how can we understand the risks of machines learning the worst of our own traits?Trained on the past decade’s worth of data about job applicants, the Amazon model began to penalize CVs that included the word “women.” The incident calls to mind another experiment in AI bias, Microsoft’s “Tay” project, which the company pulled from the web after the bot learned racism from users it was chatting with on GroupMe and Kik. In Amazon’s case, however, rogue users weren’t to blame. The AI was learning from the historical data of tech’s largest global company.An artificial intelligence that dislikes women or people of color sounds like a concept straight out of a Twilight Zone episode. But sadly, it’s reality.How did we get to this situation? And is it possible to build an AI that won’t reflect the bone-deep prejudices that are – knowingly or unknowingly – built into our social systems? To answer that second question, it’s crucial to address the first one.How a Sexist AI HappensOkay, the first point to make is that sexist or racist AI doesn’t emerge from nowhere. Instead, it reflects the prejudices already deeply held within both society at large, and the tech industry specifically.Don’t believe us about sexism in tech? One study from earlier this year found that 57 out of 58 major U.S. cites paid women in tech less than men. Last year, two female tech cofounders demonstrated tech sexism at work by proving they could make better connections once they invented a fictional male cofounder.And as long as tech companies continue overlooking sexism, they’ll keep perpetuating a system that prioritizes male applicants and promotes male staff.Sexist AIs Start With a Blinkered Industry…The tech world loves rapid growth above all else. But this year, it’s finally begun to come to terms with the impact that its culture can make, and a sense of responsibility is finally taking root.Few sum it up better than former Reddit product head Dan McComas, whose recent New York Magazine interview (titled ‘I Fundamentally Believe That My Time at Reddit Made the World a Worse Place’) includes this insight:“The incentive structure is simply growth at all costs. There was never, in any board meeting that I have ever attended, a conversation about the users, about things that were going on that were bad, about potential dangers, about decisions that might affect potential dangers. There was never a conversation about that stuff.”…And Machine Learning Perpetuates ThemIt’s this attitude that’s at the core of prejudiced AI, which perpetuates the system just as clearly, if a little more mechanically. As Lin Classon, director of public cloud strategy at Ensono, puts it, the process of machine learning is the issue.“Currently, the most common application of AI is based on feeding the machine lots of data and teaching it to recognize a pattern. Because of this, the results are as good as the data used to train the algorithms,” she tells me.Ben Dolmar, director of software development at the Nerdery, backs her up.“Almost all of the significant commercial activity in Artificial Intelligence is happening in the field of Machine Learning,” explains Ben. “It was machine learning that drove Alpha Go and it’s machine learning that is driving the leaps that we’re making in natural language processing, computer vision and a lot of recommendations engines.”Machine learning begins by providing a model with a core data set. The model trains on this before producing its own outputs. Any historical issues in the core data are then reproduced. Translation? Sexist data turns into sexist outputs.“It’s not unlike painting with watercolors, where the brush has to be clean or it taints the colors,” says Classon. And, in modern society, sexism turns up everywhere, Classon says, whether it’s in “recruiting, loan applications or stock photos.” Or even in the emptiness of women’s restrooms at major tech conferences, as Classon has pointed out to Tech.Co before.How to Combat AI PrejudiceHow do we solve a problem like AI prejudice? Classon boils it down to a key guiding principle: conscientious and collective vigilance. And that begins with ensuring the community behind the AI developments is equipped to spot the issues. Which takes us right back to the core problem of ensuring that a diverse developer community is in place, to find issues faster and address them more quickly.Practically speaking, Classon has further suggestions:Increased TransparencyRight now, machine learning algorithms function like black boxes: Data goes in, trained models come out.“DARPA has recognized [that this leaves users unaware of how the system came to any decision] and is working on Explainable Artificial Intelligence so future AI will be able to explain the rationale behind each decision,” says Classon.In other words, the AI itself should need to explain its decision, opening up a conversation about how it got there.Routine Audits “An auditing approach can help mitigate the effect of inherent and unconscious biases. The machine learning and AI communities have an obligation to contribute to the larger data science,” Classon says, pointing me to one open source tool for bias testing that already exists.It’s not just a tech problem: Innovative AI companies are responsible for auditing their work and developing standards that can improve the entire industry. One example is Microsoft’s multidisciplinary FATE group. The accronym stands for “fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics,” and it’s examining how an ethical AI could work.A Feedback LoopInstituting audits and transparency is a step, but we’ll need to keep taking more and more steps to reduce a problem that will likely never be fully solved.“The biggest way to ensure a fair model would be to require a large number of users providing feedback from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” Pamela Wickersham, senior global partner solutions manager at Docusign + SpringCM, tells me. “It’s unfortunately never going to be perfect, since user input and decision making will always be required. All models need a constant feedback loop, so that if sexism or prejudiced data is found to be prevalent, the model can be re-trained.”Track Down the SubtletiesSo, find the issues and you’ll solve the problem, right? Not so fast.Let’s go back to our most recent example of AI bias. Amazon was likely aware of the potential sexism problem and still couldn’t correct it.“It appears like Amazon actively tried to address the bias in the dataset by removing features that would identify women. So, in theory, the output would be gender-neutral and select the best candidates,” Ben says. “However, machine learning models can key in on subtle differences, and what ended up happening is that the model basically found other, subtler ways to identify women and the bias returned in the output.”Even “highly reliable algorithms,” Ben notes, can turn up the wrong answer. Picture a model that’s 99 percent accurate reviewing one million records. It’ll get 10,000 incorrect results, and it won’t be clear which ones those are.One method to address bias is to adjust a model’s goals rather than the data. Data scientists and platform vendors, Ben says, are actively working to fight fire with fire. One demo from a major machine learning vendor at the Gartner ITXPO earlier this month debuted a model designed to monitor other machine-learning models, identifying their biases. “In a bit of irony,” Ben says, “the platform uses its own machine learning to generate the changes for the biased machine-learning models. Tools like this platform are what will ultimately help us address the bias that shows up in data when we accurately represent our current society and history. The problems here are hard, but they are tractable.” Where Next For AI?The bottom line? AI’s reflection of our biases can be addressed, but only through a slow process that emphasises feedback, audits, fact-checks, and transparency.It’s not unlike how prejudices must be addressed across the rest of society, too.

Is the art world ready for AI-generated work? Christie's is about to find out

Christie's 1st to auction AI portrait 











Christie's first to auction portrait created by artificial intelligence
04:38

Next week, Christie's will be the first auction house to offer artwork created by artificial intelligence. The Paris-based art collective, Obvious, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using an algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 portraits and from that created a unique image. The piece goes up for auction on October 25 and is estimated to fetch between $7,000 and $10,000, according to Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd. ""We put a lot of thought into the estimate because if we put a huge amount on it people would say 'Well what are you basing that valuation on because this is the first,"" Lloyd told ""CBS This Morning.""  






Lloyd also offered a deeper explanation of how the piece was generated using something called the GAN algorithm. The process starts with uploading thousands of portraits to a computer. One half of that computer is called the generator, which analyzes those images and learns what a portrait is. Then, it starts spitting out versions of its own.

""The second half of the computer, the discriminator, tries to spot that. And every time the cycle is run if the discriminator is able to say, wait a minute, that's created by computer, the generator runs it again and the cycle finishes when the discriminator says, 'I give up, I can't tell. I can't tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version,'"" Lloyd explained. 


With this new category of art comes questions about how we define the artist. Is it the AI software? The people who wrote the original algorithm? Or even a combination of the artwork that was used as a basis for the portrait? ""I think this is why this is so inspiring and interesting, because we've never really had to ask those questions before,"" Lloyd said. As for how human artists might react to AI art, Lloyd sees their future alongside one another, progressing on ""parallel tracks.""""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said.

The Paris-based art collective, Obvious, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using an algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 portraits and from that created a unique image. The piece goes up for auction on October 25 and is estimated to fetch between $7,000 and $10,000, according to Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd. ""We put a lot of thought into the estimate because if we put a huge amount on it people would say 'Well what are you basing that valuation on because this is the first,"" Lloyd told ""CBS This Morning."" Lloyd also offered a deeper explanation of how the piece was generated using something called the GAN algorithm. The process starts with uploading thousands of portraits to a computer. One half of that computer is called the generator, which analyzes those images and learns what a portrait is. Then, it starts spitting out versions of its own.  ""The second half of the computer, the discriminator, tries to spot that. And every time the cycle is run if the discriminator is able to say, wait a minute, that's created by computer, the generator runs it again and the cycle finishes when the discriminator says, 'I give up, I can't tell. I can't tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version,'"" Lloyd explained. With this new category of art comes questions about how we define the artist. Is it the AI software? The people who wrote the original algorithm? Or even a combination of the artwork that was used as a basis for the portrait? ""I think this is why this is so inspiring and interesting, because we've never really had to ask those questions before,"" Lloyd said. As for how human artists might react to AI art, Lloyd sees their future alongside one another, progressing on ""parallel tracks.""""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said. ",,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/19/0fddbbca-76bb-4175-b94c-39ab94a22c32/thumbnail/1200x630/3243c599b13e82ecf9644df0b1609306/1019-ctm-aiartworkqa-lloyd-portrait-1689297-640x360.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Live00:0000:0000:00 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Dozens of employers looking to hire the next generation of tech employees descended on the University of California, Berkeley in September to meet students at an electrical engineering and computer sciences career fair.Boris Yue, 20, was one of thousands of student attendees, threading his way among fellow job-seekers to meet recruiters.But Yue wasn’t worried about so much potential competition.  While the job outlook for those with computer skills is generally good, Yue is in an even more rarified category: he is studying artificial intelligence, working on technology that teaches machines to learn and think in ways that mimic human cognition. Advertisement · Scroll to continueHis choice of specialty makes it unlikely he will have difficulty finding work. ""There is no shortage of machine learning opportunities,"" he said.He's right.Artificial intelligence is now being used in an ever-expanding array of products: cars that drive themselves; robots that identify and eradicate weeds; computers able to distinguish dangerous skin cancers from benign moles; and smart locks, thermostats, speakers and digital assistants that are bringing the technology into homes. At Georgia Tech, students interact with digital teaching assistants made possible by AI for an online course in machine learning.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe expanding applications for AI have also created a shortage of qualified workers in the field. Although schools across the country are adding classes, increasing enrollment and developing new programs to accommodate student demand,  there are too few potential employees with training or experience in AI.That has big consequences.Too few AI-trained job-seekers has slowed hiring and impeded growth at some companies, recruiters and would-be employers told Reuters. It may also be delaying broader adoption of a technology that some economists say could spur U.S. economic growth by boosting productivity, currently growing at only about half its pre-crisis pace.Andrew Shinn, a chip design manager at Marvell Technology Group  who was recruiting interns and new grads at UC Berkeley's career fair, said his company has had trouble hiring for AI jobs. ""We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years,"" he said. ""It does slow things down.""“COMING OF AGE”Many economists believe AI has the potential to change the economy’s basic trajectory in the same way that, say, electricity or the steam engine did. ""I do think artificial intelligence is … coming of age,"" said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview. ""This will diffuse through the whole economy and will change all of our lives.”MaximizeItem 1 of 3 Students attend the University of California, Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer sciences career fair in Berkeley, California, U.S., September 5, 2018.

AI job postings as a percentage of overall job postings at Indeed nearly doubled in the past two years, according to data provided by the company. Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eGUniversities are trying to keep up. Applicants to study artificial intelligence in UC Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer sciences doctoral programme numbered 341 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, according to the department. The entering class of AI students was 38 in the fall of 2017, up from 10 in the fall of 2008.At the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said.Carnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. ""We feel strongly that the demand is there,"" said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new programme. ""And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand.""Still, a fix for the supply-demand mismatch is probably five years out, says Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. The company has algorithms that trawl job postings on company websites, and their data show AI-related job postings having doubled in the last 11 months. ""The supply of people moving into this field is way below demand,"" he said. A JOB-SEEKER’S MARKETThe demand has driven up wages. Glassdoor estimates that average salaries for AI-related jobs advertised on company career sites rose 11 percent between October 2017 and September 2018 to $123,069 annually.Michael Solomon, whose New York-based 10X Management rents out technologists to companies for specific projects, says his top AI engineers now command as much as $1000 an hour, more than triple the pay just five years ago, making them one of the company's two highest paid categories, along with blockchain experts.Liz Holm, a materials science and engineering professor at Carnegie Melon, saw the increased demand first-hand in May, when one of her graduating PhD students, who used machine learning methods for her research, was overwhelmed with job offers, none of which were in materials science and all of them AI-related. Eventually the student took a job with Proctor & Gamble, where she uses AI to figure out where to put items on store shelves around the globe. ""Companies are really hungry for these folks right now,"" Holm said.Mark Maybury, an artificial intelligence expert who was hired last year as Stanley Black and Decker's first chief technology officer, agreed. The firm is embedding AI into the design and production of tools, he said, though he said details are not yet public.""Have we been able to find the talent we need? Yes,"" he said. ""Is it expensive? Yes.""The crunch is great news for job-seeking students with AI skills. In addition to bumping their pay and giving them more choice, they often get job offers well before they graduate.Derek Brown, who studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, got a full-time post-graduation job offer from Salesforce at the start of his senior year last fall. He turned it down in favour of Facebook, where he started this past July.Additional reporting by Jane Lee; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Sue HortonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.New Tab, opens new tabShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsRead NextChevronChevronTechnologycategoryMusk signals delays to robotaxi unveiling for key design changeArtificial IntelligencecategoryApple at all-time high after Morgan Stanley calls stock 'top pick' for AI effortsCybersecuritycategoryExclusive: North Korean hackers sent stolen crypto to wallet used by Asian payment firmKKR-backed OneStream seeks $4.38 bln valuation in US IPOANALYSISNvidia investor dilemma: how much is too much in a stock portfolio?Regulatory OversightcategoryBritish regulators to examine Big Tech's digital wallets",https://schema.org,NewsMediaOrganization,https://www.reuters.com,"As companies embrace AI, it's a job-seeker's market","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/as-companies-embrace-ai-its-a-job-seekers-market-idUSKCN1MP0LU/'}",https://www.reuters.com,,,2018-10-18T01:05:31.000Z,2018-10-18T01:07:38.000Z,2018-10-15T10:15:53.000Z,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ann Saphir', 'sameAs': 'https://www.reuters.com/authors/ann-saphir/', 'image': ['https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=628&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1920&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1200&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=2400&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1500&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true']}]",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}",,,,,False,,Reuters,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/logo-vertical-default-512x512.png?d=203', 'width': '512', 'height': '512'}",https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/social-impact/social-impact-and-esg-report-2022.html#c7_Diversity%20%20inclusion,https://ir.thomsonreuters.com/static-files/f4169de5-ee8c-4c28-9971-75b0baf97365,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/Reuters/', 'https://twitter.com/reuters', 'https://www.instagram.com/reuters/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/reuters2/', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@reuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo']",,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'addressLocality': 'London, United Kingdom', 'postalCode': 'E14 5AQ', 'streetAddress': '5 Canada Square, Canary Wharf'}",,"{'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'A.I. talent shortage hampers some tech firms', 'description': 'As artificial intelligence takes center stage in the tech world, companies struggle to find talent to fill A.I. related jobs, even as students flock to learn the ropes.', 'datePublished': '2018-10-15T10:19:38Z', 'dateModified': '2023-11-30T07:59:32Z', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/api/v2/img/5bae5b64e4b05ce65e868229-1538153316469', 'duration': 'PNaNMNaNS', 'uploadDate': '2023-11-30T07:59:32Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/265121/master.m3u8'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html,,https://www.reutersagency.com/en/about/standards-values/,,,,,https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/about

What is ZipRecruiter?How Does ZipRecruiter Use AI?How Does ZipRecruiter Measure Up?Conclusion 









Last year we told you about an emerging trend in perhaps one of the dirtiest industries on the planet. No, we’re not talking about charcoal maker, animal bone charrer or even space miner. We’re talking about the use of artificial intelligence in HR recruiting. At first, we thought it was too good to be true that a machine would replace a human recruiter, which we put on par with used car salesmen and realtors, as professions that add little value to the advancement of the human race. Then it seemed as if the field exploded overnight, with countless startups emerging that promised to disrupt the hiring industry through AI. We even profiled one such company, PredictiveHire out of Australia. Now ZipRecruiter, a startup that runs an online job marketplace using artificial intelligence, is one of the newest members of the Unicorn Club, startups valued at $1 billion or more.
What is ZipRecruiter?
Founded in 2010, ZipRecruiter is based in sunny Santa Monica, outside of Los Angeles. The company took in a massive $156 million Series B earlier this month, more than four years after a pretty impressive $63 million Series A. That brings total disclosed funding to $219 million, earning it a valuation of about $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg. The company started as a tool to help small businesses distribute job postings affordably, and today has grown to serve more than one million employers and 120 million job seekers. ZipRecruiter has nearly 1,000 employees in the U.S., U.K. and Israel.

The startup offers a couple of core services – posting jobs and searching for jobs – which are heavily tied to its mobile app. There’s the basic job posting service on its own platform, as well as across another 100-plus job boards, including companies from LinkedIn and Salary.com to Google and Facebook. However, it’s the company’s algorithms that potentially set it apart from other job search platforms like Monster.com and LinkedIn.
How Does ZipRecruiter Use AI?
ZipRecruiter’s AI-powered algorithm learns what each employer is looking for and provides a “personalized, curated set of highly relevant candidates” based on more than 60 factors. On the flip side of the equation, the company’s technology matches job seekers with jobs based on factors beyond job titles, potentially introducing them to jobs they may never even have considered before, like professional gamer or quant. The company claims that its algorithms are so good that 80 percent of employers who post a job online get a qualified candidate within the first 24 hours.

ZipRecruiter recently launched a new feature for employers called Candidate Calibration, which apparently is not a thinly veiled dystopian term meaning to wipe applicants’ brains clean in order to enslave them at low wages, as we first assumed. Rather, the tool lets employers give feedback about what types of candidates they like – before candidates apply – so they get better matches for their job posts. It works by showing employers potential applicants who might be a good match. The employer rates them Tinder-like (though using a simple thumbs up or thumbs down rather than a swipe left or swipe right). Based on the feedback, ZipRecruiter makes recommendations using parameters such as the applicant’s skills, job titles, years of experience, location, resume length and application rate. It’s a bit like how Netflix or Amazon might make movie or product recommendations.
How Does ZipRecruiter Measure Up?
At the moment, ZipRecruiter appears to be the hottest thing on the recruitment scene. ZipRecruiter CEO and co-founder Ian Siegel told TechCrunch his company accounts for about 10 percent of activity in the U.S. recruitment market, with over 5.6 million jobs listed on its app as of early October. The company’s recent $1.5 billion valuation is more than triple of what Randstad, an international recruitment firm, paid ($429 million in cash) for Monster.com back in 2016. That was the same year that Microsoft coughed up $26.2 billion for LinkedIn, which as far as we know is where recruiters troll for candidates, calling it “headhunting” so that they can charge big bucks for little effort. 
On the other hand, Microsoft did report that LinkedIn’s revenue rose 37 percent annually for the second quarter in a row and totaled $1.46 billion, so maybe that’s why all those headhunters are charging such a premium. More recently, another competitor, Glassdoor, was gobbled up for $1.2 billion after raising a similar amount of VC dollars as ZipRecruiter by a Tokyo-based HR and recruitment services company called, imaginatively enough, Recruit Inc.
Conclusion
ZipRecruiter is obviously producing results for somebody or they wouldn’t be attracting these big investment rounds and garnering a $1.5 billion valuation along the way, though no word on the company’s actual profitability. It’s been around for more than eight years now, so that’s encouraging. Still, it’s a very competitive market, with a pretty interesting history of acquisitions of major players in the last couple of years. We wouldn’t be surprised if a company like Google, which launched its own jobs search platform recently using its own AI technology, might be interested in removing acquiring a rival. Or Amazon might just swoop in and buy them because, well, it’s Amazon.

MIT Opening New College for Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is hot—and if you don’t believe that, look at the six-figure salaries paid out to the experts in the field. Now comes the next big step: creating as many A.I. experts as possible. In order to expand the pipeline of A.I.-knowledgeable graduates, many schools across the country have added A.I. and machine-learning courses to their curriculums. Now the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plans to take things another step further, with the launch of a $1 billion college dedicated to A.I. When the college opens in the fall of 2019, it will focus on helping students enhance their studies in another discipline with the latest A.I. techniques and tools. For example, if you’re studying biology, MIT wants you to use A.I. to radically upgrade your work in that arena. There’s also an emphasis on “responsible” use of A.I. tools. “Computing is no longer the domain of the experts alone. It’s everywhere, and it needs to be understood and mastered by almost everyone,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. “In that context, for a host of reasons, society is uneasy about technology—and at MIT, that’s a signal we must take very seriously.” The college will also create 50 new faculty positions, and provide a shared structure for A.I. research with the rest of MIT. A new building for the school is scheduled to open sometime in 2022. If this initiative succeeds, it will deeply bake A.I. into a host of disciplines, potentially equipping students for a future in which automation, machine learning, and other A.I. disciplines dominate various industries. For those who want to learn A.I. now, there are lots of options. For example, Bloomberg offers a (free) online course in machine learning, aimed at pros who already have some background in machine learning (and a lot of aptitude for mathematics). Google also has a (likewise free) course with 25 lessons and more than 40 exercises, which you can finish in 15 hours or so; it features lots of video of Google engineers describing the nuances of A.I. and machine learning. Online learning schools such as Udacity also have programs in machine learning, some of which are meant for beginners. And Microsoft is offering a Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence, with 10 online courses that teach 10 skills. If attending MIT isn’t an option, fortunately, the resources are there already for boosting your A.I. knowledge.

Mr. Sloan is writing his book with the help of home-brewed software that finishes his sentences with the push of a tab key.It’s probably too early to add “novelist” to the long list of jobs that artificial intelligence will eliminate. But if you watch Mr. Sloan at work, it is quickly clear that programming is on the verge of redefining creativity.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @davidstreitfeldA version of this article appears in print on Oct. 19, 2018, Section F, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

Ministers of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have rolled out and tested AI to automate claims processing and fight fraud within their department. Over the last year, the department unleashed artificial intelligence algorithms to track down large-scale corruption of the benefit and welfare program to stop criminal gangs who are responsible for extremely large losses. Ultimately, this effort protects taxpayers’ money and gets the benefits to those who they are intended for.

AI Identifies Large-Scale Abuse of the Benefits System
Benefit fraud at the hands of criminal gangs cost the Department of Work and Pensions nearly £2.1 billion in 2016, a rise of £200 million in just one year. The losses to fraud equate to the entire budget of the Foreign Office, which is £1.1 billion annually. To combat this crime, ministers have launched Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect fraudulent claims. The algorithms look for patterns in claims such as the same phone number or applications written in the same style. Once a claim is flagged as suspicious, a human investigator takes over to determine if the claim is in fact fraudulent.
AI identifies possible issues faster than human investigators who in the past would have to assess every claim. Therefore, until recently, the department was focused on stopping individual benefit fraud and investigated people who were flagged as being suspicious at job centers. However, it’s the large-scale efforts by criminal gangs that contributes the bulk of the issue. By deploying AI, billions of items of data can be quickly reviewed, fake identity cloning techniques commonly used by fraudsters are detected and the claim payments can be stopped.
PROMOTED
Artificial intelligence algorithms are also used to scour social media accounts to uncover inconsistencies in the stories people tell on social media and the claims they are making for benefits. Lavish holiday parties are a red flag if you’re claiming unemployment benefits. Going on a cross-country race is not congruent with someone who receives disability benefits. If you claim single status and you post pictures of your wedding or spouse, it’s suspicious to the AI algorithms.
The DWP tested the algorithms extensively and the algorithms can even scan across the benefit system including Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Personal Independent Systems making it even more robust.
The UK’s Commitment to Artificial Intelligence and Data Technologies
It’s clear from the Industrial Strategy the UK government, that it’s not just one department that is committed to expanding its technology prowess, it’s a priority for the UK government in its entirety. The strategy said the UK government is committed to investments in innovation to make “the country the world’s most innovative nation by 2030.” Prime Minister Theresa May said the strategy will help businesses seize the big opportunities of our day, “such as artificial intelligence and big data.” Artificial Intelligence is one of the four grand challenges outlined in the strategy to “put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution.”

AI Can Bring Major Social and Economic Impacts to UK
In a report about the artificial intelligence industry in the UK, the government sees a bright future ahead and possibilities for major social and economic benefits from the technology. By 2035, it’s estimated that AI could add an additional £630 billion to the UK economy.
This future will be realized, according to the report, only if AI continues to be developed and applied. This review recommends increased access to data in a wider range of sectors, to develop a larger workforce with deep AI expertise as well as continued UK commitment to AI research. In addition, the growth of AI directly relates to an increased understanding of what AI can do and where it could be applied.
While the prevention and recovery of unlawful benefits payouts is showing promise in the Department of Work and Pensions, there are many other AI applications in the works including the automatic processing of 42% of documentation submitted with benefits claims. As other departments and businesses integrate AI into existing processes and begin to realize the massive efficiencies, boost to performance and better decision-making due to more accurate information, AI adoption will continue to increase.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",http://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,,How The UK Government Uses Artificial Intelligence To Identify Welfare And State Benefits Fraud,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/10/29/how-the-uk-government-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-identify-welfare-and-state-benefits-fraud/,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2018/10/AdobeStock_218306830-1200x534.png?format=png&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}",,2018-10-29T01:17:00-04:00,2018-11-01T20:16:21-04:00,Enterprise & Cloud,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bernard Marr', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/', 'description': 'Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Job seekers question businesses' use of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate resumes and cover letters, according to a new survey from Clutch, a B2B ratings and reviews firm.The survey found that 32% of job seekers doubt companies used AI to review their resumes or cover letters during their most recent job search, compared to 32% who believe companies used AI but remain unsure.

More than 60% of job seekers are unsure whether AI helps the recruitment process, new Clutch data reveals.








Job seekers are most likely to communicate with companies via phone, email, or text message, new survey from Clutch finds.








This uncertainty translates to job seekers' mixed feelings about AI, the survey finds. More than half of recent job seekers (51%) believe AI currently isn't advanced enough to assist with recruitment – including nearly 20% who doubt AI will ever be useful. 
Does AI Improve Recruitment? AI's level of usefulness depends on how companies choose to apply it.Only 11% of job seekers believe AI improves recruitment. Experts warn that AI can reinforce existing biases when it's used to evaluate resumes and cover letters. For example, AI can replicate a company's tendency to hire candidates of a certain gender or educational background. Experts, however, believe AI can be beneficial if companies use AI for skill-based testing instead of screening candidates' race, gender, or backgrounds.""As long as your test isn't easier for someone who went to MIT than it is for someone who went to community college, AI can be tremendously helpful,"" said Harj Haggar, CEO and co-founder of Triplebyte, a company that uses background-blind testing to match candidates with tech companies. AI can also supplement communication between companies and candidates. Currently, only 3% of applicants communicate with companies via AI-supported chatbots, but experts see potential for growth.Nearly One-Quarter of Job Seekers Text Companies During RecruitmentNearly 25% of job seekers have texted a company representative during the interview process. Courteney Kovacs, a senior professional in HR at Hudson Insurance Group, views texting as a valuable tool for communicating with potential employees, especially in a competitive hiring landscape. ""Everybody is texting,"" Kovacs said. ""If you can find a way to incorporate it into recruitment, why not?"" Candidates who text potential employers should use the same etiquette as writing a professional email, experts advise.Nearly 20% of Job Seekers Use Social Media to Contact CompaniesNearly 1 in 5 job seekers (16%) connect with companies on social media. Emily Rowe is the owner and CEO of Social Sensei, a Florida-based creative agency. She initially connected with three members of her core staff on Instagram before hiring them.""If a business is on social media, they should expect to use it as a mode of communication,"" Rowe said.Traditional Communication Methods Remain PopularPhone calls and email still remain essential to hiring.Nearly three-quarters of recent hires connected with companies via phone calls (74%) and email (73%) during recruitment.Clutch's 2018 Recruiting Survey included 507 full-time employees who were hired in the past 6 months.Read the full report here: https://clutch.co/hr/recruiting/resources/how-companies-use-technology-communicate-recruitmentFor questions or comments about the survey, or an introduction to the experts included in the report, contact Michelle Delgado at 204145@email4pr.com.About ClutchA B2B research, ratings, and reviews firm in the heart of Washington, DC, Clutch connects small and medium businesses with the best-fit agencies, software, or consultants they need to tackle business challenges together and with confidence.

Their model contains thousands of agents representing different ethnicities, races and religions.Norway and Slovakia are trialling the tech to tackle tensions that can arise when Muslim immigrants settle in historically Christian countries.  The Oxford University researchers hope their system can be used to help governments respond to incidents, such as the recent London terror attacks. However, one independent expert said that the tool needed more work before it could be used in real-life situations.""This could be an extremely useful research project when it reaches maturity as a thought tool for analysing factors involved in religious conflict,"" said Prof Noel Sharkey.Core beliefsThe research, published in the Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Stimulation, indicates people are a peaceful species by nature.Even in times of crisis, such as natural disasters, the simulated humans came together peacefully. But in some situations the program indicated people were willing to endorse violence. Examples included occasions when other groups of people challenged the core beliefs that defined their identity.AFP/GETTYResearchers studied the Troubles in Northern Ireland before creating their modelThe research team drew on the Northern Ireland Troubles to programme conditions that saw what the researchers call ""xenophobic social anxiety"" escalate into extreme physical violence.  The conflict - which involved political and cultural factors in addition to religion - spanned three decades and claimed the lives of approximately 3,500 people.Primal fearsThe computer model also used scenarios based on the 2002 Gujarat riots in India. Two thousand people died during three days of inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims.Research author Justin Lane said: ""To use AI to study religion or culture, we have to look at modelling human psychology because our psychology is the foundation for religion and culture.""The root causes of things like religious violence rest in how our minds process the information that our world presents.""The results suggest the risk of religious conflict escalates when a group's core beliefs or sacred values are challenged so frequently that they overwhelm people's ability to deal with them. But even then, anxiety only spills over into violence in about 20% of the scenarios modelled.  ""Religious violence is not our default behaviour - in fact it is pretty rare in our history,"" said Mr Lane. ""It is only when people's core belief systems are challenged, or they feel that their commitment to their own beliefs is questioned that anxiety and agitations occur.""We might be able to trick our psychology into accepting others as part of our group when we'd otherwise be triggered toward more primal fears,"" he added. 'Out-group members'The researchers believe one answer to reducing the risk of religious violence and terrorism is to create situations that stop people seeing outsiders as a threat.  The most risky situations are when the difference in the size of two different religious groups is similar and people encounter ""out-group members"" more regularly, perceiving them as dangerous.The encounters need not be face-to-face. It could be that the threat is brought to someone's attention through conventional and social media.  ""We appear to live somewhat in our own information bubbles, but we still receive a lot of information about out-group members and that information appears to trigger our psychology even if there isn't actually a real person there,"" Mr Lane warned.

Artificial intelligence is hammering on the doors of the Radiology Department. Should we let it enter?





Photo: Jørgen Alexander Kamfjord
The dream of constructing artificial people was well described in Greek mythology, where Pandora (1) may well be the best known representation of a 'robot'. Most people are probably not giving it much thought, but the robots have already arrived – a long time ago – and they are generally benevolent. They do things I cannot be bothered doing myself, and the quality of their work is excellent. The dishwasher and the vacuum cleaner are the cornerstones of my happy marriage, because they effectively remove a source of problems associated with living together: clutter. They allow me to spend quality time with my family, and I am genuinely fond of my robots.
Lately, the robots have been taking on increasingly complex tasks, and many of them make use of technology that is covered by the umbrella term of artificial intelligence. Super-smart machines are everywhere: the search engine of my computer understands what I need to know (and buy), some sort of Babel fish on Skype enables me to talk to people from all over the world, and robotic cars are rushing around in the streets. It is almost as if the future has already arrived.
Intelligence is a concept which is difficult to define. It normally includes an ability to understand complex causal connections, learn from experience and make use of learnt information to solve problems. Artificial intelligence is computers with these qualities. The concept includes computer programs that are based on a wide range of symbolic and statistical approaches to learning and reasoning, and that are able to change their own architecture in order to solve tasks in an increasingly better way. In combination with increasing access to computational power and enormous health data sets, one methodology in particular – so-called deep learning (2) – will enable artificial intelligence to find its natural place in every part of the health services.
Radiology is the discipline that lends itself most easily to deep learning. The exceptionally fast technological development in medical imaging generates insane heaps of work for a group of professionals who will soon find it impossible to keep pace. Radiologists are increasingly tied to their computer screens to visually assess a growing flow of diagnostic images. The complexity and number of imaging methods available are growing, but multimodal image data are well suited for automated processing by systems that are based on deep learning and high performance computing. Artificial intelligence will be able to ease virtually every part of the radiology work-flow, from the reading of referrals from general practitioners to the compilation of structured reports, and everything that happens in between.
Witnessing image analysis conducted by well-trained algorithms is like witnessing pure magic. Many, however, suspect that this is black magic. Leading voices suggest that the lid of Pandora's box (1) is now ajar (3, 4), and that we should be considerably more cautious. Like all other technology, artificial intelligence can be used for good as well as evil. Just as quantum physics provided the seed for both the nuclear bomb and MR imaging, it is easy to envisage that artificial intelligence may lead to trouble. Therefore, the health service should – to a much larger degree than is currently the case – take a firm grip on developments to ensure that the robots know who is the boss, and that they are well trained for doing their job: to declutter.
When artificial intelligence is let into the Radiology Department, this will bring dramatic change, but it may well be that the department will be grateful for the robots' assistance. Artificial intelligence is the future, but may also enable us to turn back time to an era when radiologists were not only analytic machines, but were allowed to spend quality time with their patients.
The future appears to be closer than ever.

No one at the Defense Department wants weapons that make their own decisions, said former Deputy Secretary Bob Work.

The term “artificial intelligence” gets thrown around a lot today, especially in government circles, where leaders are eager to get ahead of the technological curve. But the military, at least, doesn’t really want true AI, according to a former deputy defense secretary.“We are not talking about Skynets and we’re not talking about Terminators. Those are what you would call an artificial general intelligence-type weapon,” Bob Work, who served as deputy defense secretary under Presidents Obama and Trump, said Tuesday during a speech at the annual SAP NS2 Solutions Summit. “We’re looking for narrow AI systems that can compose courses of action to accomplish the tasks that the machine is given and it can choose among the courses of action.”Work made a hard distinction between general AI and more narrow forms—what he preferred to call machine intelligence and algorithmic warfare.“Improved autonomy is going to be the natural result of machine intelligence. We always use artificial intelligence, but I think machine intelligence is more accurate,” he said. “It’s the programmed ability to process information and, this is key, to make decisions as well as or better than human beings, and faster.”He offered an example of a smart missile that is able to assess a situation, choose the best target based on preset parameters. In the example, the missile spots an enemy tank formation, determines which is the command tank and picks the most lethal form of attack to incapacitate the enemy.“That is a good thing. It’s a totally autonomous weapon and it will do what it’s asked to do,” Work said. “It won’t say, ‘Hey, I woke up this morning and I decided I want to shoot down an airplane.’ A general AI system sets its own goals and can change them. No one in the Department of Defense is saying we ought to go toward those type of weapons.”Work referenced the department’s Project Maven, a high-profile Pentagon program that made headlines when Google employees petitioned their company to remove itself from the project for ethical reasons. The former deputy secretary noted the true name inside the Pentagon is the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, with a focus on merging human and machine intelligence in a way that improves human decision-making.“Human-machine collaboration is using machines to make better human decisions,” he said. “The human is always in front in terms of DOD thinking.”

World’s First Painting Produced By Artificial Intelligence Fetches Huge Sum

The first “painting” to be produced by artificial intelligence fetched nearly half a million dollars after an auction held by Christie’s in late October 2018.
The portrait of “Edmond De Belamy” sold for $432,500, or 43.5 times the estimated price, Christie’s said in a statement. It is the first piece of Artificial Intelligence art sold at a major auction house.
The new owner is an anonymous phone bidder, who won it after “a battle between three phone bidders, an online participant in France and one gentleman in the room,” the statement continued.ADVERTISEMENT
A genuine Picasso print in the same auction sold for about the same price as the AI painting.
 
 







A section work of art created by an algorithm by French collective named OBVIOUS which produces art using artificial intelligence, is titled ‘Portrait of Edmond de Belamy’ (estimate: $7,000-10,000) at Christies in New York on October 22, 2018. Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images
The AI portrait is of a gentleman dressed in black and framed in gold, resembling a work from the 18th or 19th century. But up close the face is fuzzy and the picture looks unfinished. Instead of an artist’s signature, it has the stamp of a mathematical formula on the bottom right of the painting.
“The art was created by a French collective of artists and artificial intelligence researchers called Obvious with code mostly borrowed from a 19-year-old AI artist and programmer named Robbie Barrat,” according to Adweek. “The group fed a system called a Generative Adversarial Network with a data set of 15,000 pieces painted between the 14th and 20th centuries.
One component of the network would then paint its own work based on what it saw and try to fool another algorithm, which was programmed to tell the difference between real and algorithmically generated art.”

After the sale, Obvious released a statement: “We would like to thank the A.I. community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm, who inspired the name of the Famille de Belamy series, and artist Robbie Barrat.”
Collective member Pierre Fautrel said to ABC News, “We are really fascinated by the power of algorithms. We begin to discuss, if you create art like this, is this art?”
The subject of the painting, Edmond Belamy, is a member of a fictional family of 11 of the collective’s machine-created portraits that resemble the type of aristocrats you might see in classical European portraiture, said Adweek. “While the complexities of facial features typically make portraits tougher for computers to mimic than other forms, the collective felt it was the best way to show off their algorithm’s proficiency, according to Hugo Caselles-Dupré of Obvious.”

Richard Lloyd, International Head of Prints and Multiples at Christie’s, persuaded the collective to put the print up for sale in order to advance the debate about artificial intelligence in art. “I know it’s a debate that’s going on quite widely, I thought that in a way this marked a watershed — or slightly a tipping point,” he told AFP.
Christie’s had an interesting analysis of the painting: “The portrait in its gilt frame depicts a portly gentleman, possibly French and — to judge by his dark frockcoat and plain white collar — a man of the church. The work appears unfinished: the facial features are somewhat indistinct and there are blank areas of canvas. Oddly, the whole composition is displaced slightly to the north-west.”

The sale of the painting has some people talking about the Singularity, the theory that one day an artificial intelligence will emerge and completely change humanity and the world itself. This idea reached popular culture in the film The Terminator.
But as Christie’s writer pointed out, this painting highlights the genuine limitations of the AI program in art.

“It departs from a human idea of an 18th-century portrait. There is something weirdly contemporary about him: he looks unnervingly like one of Glenn Brown’s art-historical appropriations.”

Experts concluded that portrait painting is an extremely tough genre for AI to excel at, since humans are highly attuned to the curves and complexities of a face in a way that a machine cannot be, said Christie’s.

If you were to squint, it might be passable as one of the Old Masters.But of course, all of art is subjective.Obvious, a collective of artists and artificial intelligence researchers based in Paris, created the work by feeding their system 15,000 portraits spanning from the 14th to 20th centuries.Hugo Caselles-Dupré, a member of Obvious, explained the origins of the painting, noting the two parts of an algorithm, the generator and the discriminator.“The Generator makes a new image based on the set, then the Discriminator tries to spot the difference between a human-made image and one created by the Generator,” he said. “The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. Then we have a result.”Keeping with tradition, the bottom of the work is signed ""min G max D Ex [log (D(x))] + Ez [log(1 - D (G(z)))]"" — a piece of code from the algorithm used to create the work.The debate over whether machines can make art — and whether the Old Masters would be rolling in their graves — is just scratching the surface.The sale is also raising questions about ethics when it comes to the marriage of artificial intelligence and art.RecommendedEconomyEconomyLower capital gains tax, cuts to food benefits: What Project 2025 could mean for your walletMarketsMarketsStock market shrugs off Trump assassination attempt, bucking historical norms""Edmond Belamy"" was created using code that Robbie Barrat — a Stanford University researcher who had gained notoriety for teaching a computer to write rap lyrics, based on the work of Kanye West — wrote when he was 17.Barrat shared the free code on GitHub at the time, a common practice among coders.However, after he saw the images for sale in April, Barrat followed up and asked for credit, saying he was under the impression this was an open source project.“Here's the code to the network they copied. If any of you guys want to make a quick $10,000 from my work, now is the perfect time,” Barrat tweeted, referring to the starting price Christie's had set for the portrait.Obvious countered by posting a screenshot of a conversation the collective said it had with Barrat in April, in which he apparently wrote: “You don’t owe me any credit or anything.”Obvious has since tweeted that it has credited Barrat and talked about his contribution in interviews. Barrat and Obvious did not immediately respond to a request for comment by NBC News.Either way, the Stanford researcher clearly isn't impressed.“It’s horrible art, from an aesthetic standpoint,” he told the Washington Post. “You have to put some work into it to call it art. It’s something that everybody can do. You can clone this from GitHub, start your computer and start doing it. I don’t know that that’s what art is about.""Alyssa NewcombAlyssa Newcomb is an NBC News contributor who writes about business and technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has finally arrived on the auction block, smashing sales expectations by over 40-fold. The computer-generated portrait, which was sold by Christie’s on behalf of a trio of French techies who call themselves Obvious, surpassed original estimates ranging between $7,000–$10,000 to earn an astonishing $432,500 price tag.
Days before the hammer fell, however, reports slowly trickled in that Obvious may have cribbed its code from 19-year-old artist and high school graduate Robbie Barrat.
Within the programming world, Barrat has built a reputation for his exceptional generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms that train two discriminant networks to effectively act as “artist” and “judge.” The artist builds a system of patterns while the judge checks the result against an original sample; from there, the artist revises his work and the system repeats itself until the GAN has created a passable work of art.
 
 

Here are some AI generated nude portraits I’ve been working on🍑Usually the machine just paints people as blobs of flesh with tendrils and limbs randomly growing out – I think it’s really surreal. I wonder if that’s how machines see us… pic.twitter.com/tYgzCHGfse— Robbie Barrat (@videodrome) March 27, 2018

Pictures created using AI GANs have a distinct aesthetic that’s somewhere in-between Surrealism and melted candle wax: borders between distinct objects often get blurred or ultra-shiny. Many of the preexisting AI GAN artworks also derive from Romantic landscape paintings or portraiture, which contributes to the spookiness of the style.

Members of Obvious readily admit that they borrowed elements of Barrat’s code, but says they tweaked the algorithm to produce different results. “If you’re just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified,” says Hugo Caselles-Dupré, the tech lead for Obvious and a machine learning PhD in Paris. “But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there.”
This exchange is preserved on one of GitHub’s discussion boards where Caselles-Dupré simply goes by the name, “Caselles.” There, he asks Barrat for a version of the code with enhanced resolution capabilities and questions the original programmer about his pre-trained models on the website.

Am I crazy for thinking that they really just used my network and are selling the results? pic.twitter.com/wAdSOe7gwz— Robbie Barrat (@DrBeef_) October 25, 2018

One day before the Christie’s auction of Obvious’s AI-generated artwork, Barrat publicly questioned precisely how much the French group changed his original code on Twitter. The teenage programmer even posted side-by-side comparisons of Obvious’s “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” (2018) and nine of his own works, which show an uncanny resemblance.
Obvious responded on the Twitter thread showing a video demonstrating their AI’s training process as separate from Barrat’s GAN algorithm. The group also shared an April correspondence with Barret, in which they asked the teenage programmer for his blessing to use his code for an undescribed project.
 
 

“We do not want you to think that we stole your work or anything like that. We were inspired by your work to create our collection,” Obvious writes.
“Yeah — I’m 100% okay with it; sounds like interesting work and I’m glad that you found some of my code useful. You don’t owe me any credit or anything,” responded Barrat, back in April.
However, Barrat has now voiced concerns that Obvious misrepresented their moneymaking intentions as an open source project of democratization. Because of that, he takes issue with the lack of recognition he’s received as an instrumental component to the “Portrait of Edmond Belamy’s” existence.
Responding to comments on Twitter, Barrat also clarified that he actually did retract his permission to Obvious once he realized that they weren’t doing an open source project, but were instead selling the outputs of its algorithm.
In a statement by Obvious provided to Hyperallergic through Christie’s, the collective said:
We would like to thank the A.I. community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm, who inspired the name of the Famille de Belamy series, and artist Robbie Barrat, who has been a great influence for us. It is an exciting moment and our hope is that the spotlight on this sale will bring forward the amazing work that our predecessors and colleagues have been producing. We are grateful to Christie’s for opening up this dialogue in the art community and honored to have been a part of this global conversation about the impact of this new technology in the creation of art.
A Christie’s spokesperson also noted that the collective has given Barrat credit in their Medium post about the project, during a panel with Bloomberg, and in the lot’s cataloging.
Here’s the code to the network they copied. If any of you guys want to make a quick $10,000 from my work, now is the perfect time. https://t.co/V7iCHvL1Dt— Robbie Barrat (@DrBeef_) October 25, 2018

 
 

Code-sharing is a very common practice in the programming community because it’s seen as a democratic way to expedite the development of technology. Unlike appropriation in the art world, such practices rarely attract controversy. The “Belamy” case is an exception because it raises the difficult question of how much code Obvious should have altered for their program to become sufficiently different from Barrat’s original. And if AI-generated art is going to accrue hundreds of thousands of dollars, then what compensation — if any — is owed to the primary coder?

Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence








The emergence of artificial intelligence is altering the way we study, work and communicate — a rapid shift described as the fourth industrial revolution. To prepare the engineering leaders of tomorrow to excel in this environment, U of T Engineering is launching a new minor and certificate in artificial intelligence (AI) engineering in January 2019.
“Machine learning (ML) and AI have exploded in importance in recent years,” said Professor Jason Anderson (ECE), director of the new AI minor. “Demand for ML/AI talent in industry and academia are extremely high. Moreover, as the scope of applications broadens, it is believed that demand will exceed supply in this field for years to come.”
To complete the minor, engineering students will need to take six half-year courses (or equivalent) that explore ML and AI concepts, including a new course in AI fundamentals. Courses also delve into topics such as data mining, neural networks and deep learning. The certificate requires three half-year courses.
The new minor and certificate adds to a growing list of AI-focused initiatives and experiential learning opportunities at U of T Engineering, in anticipation of the complex challenges that lie ahead as AI enables new ways of living and working.
“Applications of artificial intelligence transcend traditional disciplines,” said Cristina Amon, dean of the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. “With this new minor and certificate, our undergraduate students have the opportunity to enrich their experience and explore this important and evolving area alongside world-leading researchers.”
This fall, the Faculty introduced a machine intelligence major in Engineering Science, the first undergraduate engineering program of its kind in Canada. Offered to professional-stream graduate students is the Master of Engineering in Analytics. In addition, U of T Engineering is providing pathways for undergraduates to gain valuable experience in AI through the Professional Experience Co-op Program (PEY Co-op).
“I’m delighted that U of T Engineering is launching these initiatives. The new certificate and minor in AI demonstrate our desire and our agility to continually adapt our undergraduate curricular offerings to incorporate forward-looking technologies crucial to engineering’s future,” said Anderson.
Upon completion of the minor or certificate, Anderson says that students will have the expertise to integrate their knowledge more broadly in other courses in their engineering disciplines. The programs will also prepare students to become leaders in the field, well positioned to pursue lucrative careers in AI when they graduate.
“Students will be well-poised to apply their AI knowledge within Ontario’s, and more broadly, Canada’s high-tech industry. Canada has long stood at the forefront of AI research, and has recently drawn multinationals such as Facebook, Uber and Samsung to establish Canadian labs with an AI focus,” said Anderson. “Many startups and larger enterprises in Toronto apply AI techniques for myriad purposes, making graduates of the minor and certificate highly-sought after.”
Enrolment will begin in January. The program is open to U of T Engineering undergraduate students in all disciplines and all years.
