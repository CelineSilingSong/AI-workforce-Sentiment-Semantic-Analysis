Generative artificial intelligence has rapidly gained traction amongst businesses, professionals and consumers. But what is generative AI, how does it work and what is all the buzz about? Read on to find out.
What is generative AI in simple terms?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that broadly describes machine learning systems capable of generating text, images, code or other types of content, often in response to a prompt entered by a user.
Generative AI models are increasingly being incorporated into online tools and chatbots that allow users to type questions or instructions into an input field, upon which the AI model will generate a human-like response.

How does generative AI work?
Generative AI uses a computing process known as deep learning to analyze patterns in large sets of data and then replicates this to create new data that appears human-generated. It does this by employing neural networks, a type of machine learning process that is loosely inspired by the way the human brain processes, interprets and learns from information over time.
To give an example, if you were to feed lots of fiction writing into a generative AI model, it would eventually gain the ability to craft stories or story elements based on the literature it’s been trained on. This is because the machine learning algorithms that power generative AI models learn from the information they’re fed — in the case of fiction, this would include elements like plot structure, characters, themes and other narrative devices.
Generative AI models get more sophisticated over time — the more data a model is trained on and generates, the more convincing and human-like its outputs become.
Examples of generative AI
The popularity of generative AI has exploded in recent years, largely thanks to the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E models, which put accessible AI tools into the hands of consumers.
Since then, big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have launched their own generative AI tools to capitalize on the technology’s rapid uptake. Google integrates generative AI into Search with AI Overviews. Microsoft plans to build generative AI even more deeply into its PCs with Recall, although the feature has been delayed following security concerns. Apple will debut Apple Intelligence, a mix of proprietary AI models and OpenAI technology, in iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year.
Various generative AI tools now exist, although text and image generation models are arguably the most well-known. Generative AI models typically rely on a user feeding a prompt into the engine that guides it towards producing some sort of desired output, be it text, an image, a video or a piece of music, though this isn’t always the case.
Examples of generative AI models include:
ChatGPT: An AI language model developed by OpenAI that can answer questions and generate human-like responses from text prompts.

Types of generative AI models
Various types of generative AI models exist, each designed for specific tasks and purposes. These can broadly be categorized into the following types.
Transformer-based models
Transformer-based models are trained on large sets of data to understand the relationships between sequential information like words and sentences. Underpinned by deep learning, transformer-based models tend to be adept at natural language processing and understanding the structure and context of language, making them well suited for text-generation tasks. ChatGPT-3 and Google Gemini are examples of transformer-based generative AI models.
Generative adversarial networks
Generative adversarial networks are made up of two neural networks known as a generator and a discriminator, which essentially work against each other to create authentic-looking data. As the name implies, the generator’s role is to generate convincing output, such as an image based on a prompt, while the discriminator works to evaluate the authenticity of said image. Over time, each component gets better at their respective roles, resulting in more convincing outputs. DALL-E and Midjourney are examples of GAN-based generative AI models.
Variational autoencoders
Variational autoencoders leverage two networks to interpret and generate data — in this case, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a simplified format. The decoder then takes this compressed information and reconstructs it into something new that resembles the original data but isn’t entirely the same.
One example might be teaching a computer program to generate human faces using photos as training data. Over time, the program learns how to simplify the photos of people’s faces into a few important characteristics — such as the size and shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, ears and so on — and then use these to create new faces.
This type of VAE might be used to, say, increase the diversity and accuracy of facial recognition systems. By using VAEs to generate new faces, facial recognition systems can be trained to recognize more diverse facial features, including those that are less common.
Multimodal models
Multimodal models can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, images and audio, allowing them to create more sophisticated outputs. An example might be an AI model capable of generating an image based on a text prompt, as well as a text description of an image prompt. DALL-E 3 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 are examples of multimodal models.
What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It’s a large language model that uses transformer architecture — specifically, the generative pretrained transformer, hence GPT — to understand and generate human-like text.
You can learn everything you need to know about ChatGPT in this TechRepublic cheat sheet.
What is Google Gemini?
Google Gemini (previously Bard) is another example of an LLM based on transformer architecture. Similar to ChatGPT, Gemini is a generative AI chatbot that generates responses to user prompts.
Google launched Bard in the U.S. in March 2023 in response to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot AI tool. It was launched in Europe and Brazil later that year.

Benefits of generative AI
For businesses, efficiency is arguably the most compelling benefit of generative AI because it can help automate specific tasks and focus employees’ time, energy and resources on more important strategic objectives. This can result in lower labor costs, greater operational efficiency and insights into how well certain business processes are — or are not — performing.
For professionals and content creators, generative AI tools can help with idea creation, content planning and scheduling, search engine optimization, marketing, audience engagement, research and editing, and potentially more. Again, the key proposed advantage is efficiency, because generative AI tools can help users reduce the time they spend on certain tasks and invest their energy elsewhere. That said, manual oversight and scrutiny of generative AI models remains highly important; we explain why later in this article.
Use cases of generative AI
McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, activities that currently account for around 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated, prompted by the acceleration of generative AI.

Generative AI has found a foothold in a number of industry sectors and is now popular in both commercial and consumer markets. The use of generative AI varies from industry to industry and is more established in some than in others. Current and proposed use cases include the following:

Healthcare: Generative AI is being explored as a tool for accelerating drug discovery, while tools such as AWS HealthScribe allow clinicians to transcribe patient consultations and upload important information into their electronic health record.
Digital marketing: Advertisers, salespeople and commerce teams can use generative AI to craft personalized campaigns and adapt content to consumers’ preferences, especially when combined with customer relationship management data.
Education: Some educational tools are beginning to incorporate generative AI to develop customized learning materials that cater to students’ individual learning styles.
Finance: Generative AI is one of the many tools within complex financial systems to analyze market patterns and anticipate stock market trends, and it’s used alongside other forecasting methods to assist financial analysts.
Environment: In environmental science, researchers use generative AI models to predict weather patterns and simulate the effects of climate change.

In terms of role-specific use cases of generative AI, some examples include:

In customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can help businesses reduce response times and quickly deal with common customer queries, reducing the burden on staff.
In software development, generative AI tools can help developers code more cleanly and efficiently by reviewing code, highlighting bugs and suggesting potential fixes before they become bigger issues.
Writers can use generative AI tools to plan, draft and review essays, articles and other written work — though often with mixed results.

Dangers and limitations of generative AI
A major concern around the use of generative AI tools — and particularly those accessible to the public — is their potential for spreading misinformation and harmful content. The impact of doing so can be wide-ranging and severe, from perpetuating stereotypes, hate speech and harmful ideologies to damaging personal and professional reputation.
SEE: Gartner analyst’s take on 5 ways generative AI will impact culture & society
The risk of legal and financial repercussions from the misuse of generative AI is also very real; indeed, it has been suggested that generative AI could put national security at risk if used improperly or irresponsibly.
These risks haven’t escaped policymakers. On Feb. 13, 2024, the European Council approved the AI Act, a first-of-kind piece of legislation designed to regulate the use of AI in Europe. The legislation takes a risk-based approach to regulating AI, with some AI systems banned outright.
Security agencies have made moves to ensure AI systems are built with safety and security in mind. In November 2023, 16 agencies including the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development, which promote security as a fundamental aspect of AI development and deployment.
Generative AI has prompted workforce concerns, most notably that the automation of tasks could lead to job losses. Research from McKinsey suggests that, by 2030, around 12 million people may need to switch jobs, with office support, customer service and food service roles most at risk. The consulting firm predicts that clerks will see a decrease of 1.6 million jobs, “in addition to losses of 830,000 for retail salespersons, 710,000 for administrative assistants and 630,000 for cashiers.”

What is the difference between generative AI and general AI?
Generative AI and general AI represent different sides of the same coin; both relate to the field of artificial intelligence, but the former is a subtype of the latter.
Generative AI uses various machine learning techniques, such as GANs, VAEs or LLMs, to generate new content from patterns learned from training data.
General AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, broadly refers to the concept of computer systems and robotics that possess human-like intelligence and autonomy. This is still the stuff of science fiction — think Disney Pixar’s WALL-E, Sonny from 2004’s I, Robot or HAL 9000, the malevolent AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Most current AI systems are examples of “narrow AI,” in that they’re designed for very specific tasks.
To learn more about what artificial intelligence is and isn’t, read our comprehensive AI cheat sheet.
What is the difference between generative AI and machine learning?
Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence; broadly, AI refers to the concept of computers capable of performing tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as decision making and NLP. Generative AI models use machine learning techniques to process and generate data.
Machine learning is the foundational component of AI and refers to the application of computer algorithms to data for the purposes of teaching a computer to perform a specific task. Machine learning is the process that enables AI systems to make informed decisions or predictions based on the patterns they have learned.

What is the difference between generative AI and discriminative AI?
Whereas generative AI is used for generating new content by learning from existing data, discriminative AI specializes in classifying or categorizing data into predefined groups or classes.
Discriminative AI works by learning how to tell different types of data apart. It’s used for tasks where data needs to be sorted into groups; for example, figuring out if an email is spam, recognizing what’s in a picture or diagnosing diseases from medical images. It looks at data it already knows to classify new data correctly.
So, while generative AI is designed to create original content or data, discriminative AI is used for analyzing and sorting it, making each useful for different applications.
What is the difference between generative AI and regenerative AI?
Regenerative AI, while less commonly discussed, refers to AI systems that can fix themselves or improve over time without human help. The concept of regenerative AI is centered around building AI systems that can last longer and work more efficiently, potentially even helping the environment by making smarter decisions that result in less waste.
In this way, generative AI and regenerative AI serve different roles: Generative AI for creativity and originality, and regenerative AI for durability and sustainability within AI systems.
How big a role will generative AI play in the future of business?
It certainly looks as though generative AI will play a huge role in the future. As more businesses embrace digitization and automation, generative AI looks set to play a central role in industries of all types, with many organizations already establishing guidelines for the acceptable use of AI in the workplace. The capabilities of gen AI have already proven valuable in areas such as content creation, software development, medicine, productivity, business transformation and much more. As the technology continues to evolve, gen AI’s applications and use cases will only continue to grow.
SEE: Deloitte’s 2024 Tech Predictions: Gen AI Will Continue to Shape Chips Market
That said, the impact of generative AI on businesses, individuals and society as a whole is contingent on properly addressing and mitigating its risks. Key to this is ensuring AI is used ethically by reducing biases, enhancing transparency and accountability and upholding proper data governance.
None of this will be straightforward. Keeping laws up to date with fast-moving tech is tough but necessary, and finding the right mix of automation and human involvement will be key to democratizing the benefits of generative AI. Recent legislation, such as President Biden’s Executive Order on AI, Europe’s AI Act and the U.K.’s Artificial Intelligence Bill suggests that governments around the world understand the importance of getting on top of these issues quickly.

This is according to the AI and the Future of Work in Africa whitepaper produced by Microsoft (www.Microsoft.com) and a collective of industry experts from across the continent.Nearly one billion people in Africa are currently under the age of 35 with the continent projected to be home to almost half of the world’s youth population by the turn of the century, in effect making up half of the potential global workforce of the future. Currently, up to 12 million young Africans enter the labour market annually, but according to a report from the International Labour Organisation, more than 20% are neither in employment, education nor training.“We see a significant role for generative AI to not only transform work environments, but also foster opportunities for the youth to create jobs, innovate and help drive economic growth and stability across the continent,” says Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer at Microsoft Africa.According to the whitepaper, many expect generative AI to drastically change knowledge worker jobs, especially in terms of the type of work done, the skills required, and the outputs produced. McKinsey research (http://apo-opa.co/3VBE9Rl) shows that generative AI (GenAI) could enable labour productivity growth of up to 0.6% annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and the redeployment of worker time into other activities.“Generative AI has significant potential to advance human capabilities,” says Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa. “As more people across Africa get access to GenAI tools through their internet-enabled devices and more affordable data, the barriers to access are being reduced and opportunities for skilling can increase.”“But it is not only information workers that stand to benefit from GenAI.”The promise of GenAI to transform industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and services must be balanced by equipping the youth with the skills needed for an AI-disrupted labour market to ensure that they are not left behind in this technological shift.It is therefore important to build skills across the spectrum, from how to deploy and use GenAI tools effectively at work, to how to build appropriate and innovative applications and technologies on top of these models, to the post-graduate skills of research and innovation in machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and systems to name a few.“Investing in this range of skills gives Africans the best opportunity to create dignified, appropriate jobs, to adapt AI sensitively to indigenous knowledge, to create new value chains, and better AI systems which might reflect for example human-centred and community values. Such systems would add value globally and could counter typical tech-centric models of automation and deskilling,” adds O’Neill.

With culturally and linguistically sensitive design, GenAI can become more tailored to individual workers, learning from interactions and becoming a personalised tool that respects privacy and enhances each worker’s unique skills. It can serve as a guide to foster inclusivity and showcase the diverse skills and abilities of African workers. GenAI can also be appropriated as a community-focused tool that supports collaborative work and communal development.The technology can assist in decision-making, risk assessment, and data analysis, empowering entrepreneurs in their ventures. For the informal sector, tailored GenAI tools will elevate the capabilities of entrepreneurs, providing customised assistance for their unique needs.According to the whitepaper, ensuring a beneficial outcome with GenAI involves proactive governance, inclusive design, investment in education, and a commitment to regulatory and ethical standards. This is a collective responsibility, requiring engagement from policymakers, technologists, and citizens alike.“Technology alone cannot solve the challenges that our youthful continent faces. We need to create policies and practices to ensure that GenAI, and AI in general, is deployed responsibly with AI-related labour being valued and dignified. It requires the macro-economic, labour, and regulatory markets to adapt and be capable of supporting positive change,” adds Bhat.The AI revolution in Africa is no longer just a possibility; it is already underway, and Microsoft is committed to working alongside individuals, governments, partners and stakeholders across the continent to prepare for a future where AI is intricately woven into the fabric of work and society in Africa.To learn more, visit AI and the future of work in Africa (http://apo-opa.co/4cBTfxd) to download the whitepaper.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Microsoft.About Microsoft:  Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” http://apo-opa.co/3XDeKJM) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

With two-thirds of jobs exposed to some degree of automation and GenAI expected to deliver $4.4 trillion in productivity gains, leaders must adopt innovative talent development strategies to stay competitive. Despite an increase in overall enrolments, Coursera data from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2024 shows widening gender disparities in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital skills. To harness the full potential of emerging technologies and mitigate opportunity gaps, we must prioritize AI literacy, address the persistent digital skills gap, and train workforces for the jobs of the future.AI literacy emerges as a global imperativeChatGPT’s launch ignited a global race towards AI literacy. According to Microsoft, 66% of leaders wouldn't hire someone without AI skills, yet, according to Accenture, only 5% of companies have rolled out reskilling at scale.The demand is clear: According to Accenture, 94% of employees want to learn AI skills and individuals are taking the initiative. Meanwhile, Coursera’s Global Skills Report 2024 notes a 1,061% surge in GenAI enrolments on the platform over the past year. Regions like Asia-Pacific (1,270% YoY), Sub-Saharan Africa (1,500% YoY), and Latin America (882% YoY) are also witnessing significant growth, highlighting the global appetite for AI literacy. Have you read?Global Gender Gap Report 2024 Image: World Economic ForumPopular courses from the world’s top AI research institutions and companies, including Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT (Vanderbilt) and Introduction to Generative AI (Google Cloud) are driving this demand. In the first five months of 2024, the platform witnessed more than 900,000 GenAI enrolments as individuals and enterprise learners sought AI skills to boost productivity and remain competitive in a fast-changing workplace. However, women account for only 30% of these enrolments and support from institutions is needed to ensure equitable outcomes for all. Businesses and academic institutions must enable executive education and foundational AI literacy for all employees. Governments also play a crucial role in facilitating mass AI training and adoption. Investments in AI infrastructure, research, and workforce development are essential. For instance, India's $1.2 billion investment in AI projects, Malaysia's National AI Studies Centre and Thailand's AI infrastructure development programme are exemplary efforts. Closing the digital skills gapMore than 9 in 10 jobs now require at least some level of digital proficiency. If digital skills gaps are not addressed, G20 countries could lose as much as $11.5 trillion of cumulative GDP growth by 2028. In 2023, 40% of EU adults lacked basic digital skills.At the World Bank’s 2024 Spring Meetings, ministers from Morocco, Cape Verde, Kenya, and Armenia stressed the importance of electricity and internet access as a precursor to universal digital skills training.Digital connectivity and online learning are powerful tools for promoting equal access in the digital economy. A 2022 International Finance Corporation, European Commission, and Coursera study found that 45% of women and 60% of women caregivers would have had to postpone or stop their studies without online learning. Online education drives broader economic growth, creating one job for every 30 people trained on Coursera in countries like Egypt, India, Mexico and Nigeria.Preparing for future jobs with industry micro-credentials The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 estimates that 60% of workers will require retraining by 2027. Industry micro-credentials have emerged as a vital tool to address growing labour shortages, bridge curriculum gaps, and retrain impacted workers.Companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and AWS, have created more than 45 professional certificates to prepare learners without a university degree or prior work experience for in-demand digital jobs. There was a 61% year-over-year growth in professional certificate enrolments in North America and a 41% growth in the Middle East and North Africa, with learners gravitating toward careers in data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. In Guyana, President Mohamed Irfaan Ali launched a national workforce development program providing free access to Coursera for every Guyanese citizen and public sector employee. Citizens are encouraged to train for digital jobs in fast-growing local industries through credentials like IT Support Specialist from Google, Customer Service Representative from CVS, or Bookkeeper from Intuit.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesSimilarly, in the US, the University of Texas System expanded its Texas Credentials of the Future Initiative, offering no-cost career training to 240,000 students across nine campuses. ACE and ECTS credit recommendations help students and academic institutions get and give academic credit for industry micro-credentials, and AI translations enable learners to take more than 4,700 courses and 50 certificate programmes in 21 local languages. If some sections of the labour force adopt emerging technologies faster due to greater access, while others fall behind, the opportunity gap will widen.

Job security is redefined by layoffs and generative AI


A global study reveals that in the age of GenAI, workers are redefining job security to emphasize upskilling, adaptable skills and opportunities for growth.

Patrick Thibodeau,
Editor at Large



Published: 21 Jun 2024


 
As generative AI reshapes the workplace, a new global study revealed workers' hopes and concerns about their future careers.
Surveying more than 150,000 workers worldwide, the study found that employees are seeking a new kind of job security, rooted in reskilling and career flexibility -- a shift driven in part by GenAI.







This key finding was detailed in the report ""How Work Preferences Are Shifting in the Age of GenAI"" by Boston Consulting Group (BCG); a global alliance of recruitment websites called The Network; and The Stepstone Group, a job platform.
Employees want job security that ensures they can adapt and thrive as skills evolve, regardless of generative AI's impact on their jobs, said Orsolya Kovács-Ondrejkovic, associate director of people strategy at BCG and co-author of the report. She discussed some of the report's main findings with TechTarget Editorial. 
Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Your study found that over 60% of job seekers believe they have the upper hand in labor market negotiations. What's the basis for this belief?



We are still more likely to run out of talent than to run out of jobs.


Orsolya Kovács-OndrejkovicAssociate director of people strategy, Boston Consulting Group




Orsolya Kovács-Ondrejkovic: Despite some recessions and layoffs, particularly in tech, the overall trend shows a persistent talent shortage in most Western economies. Aging populations and a mismatch between available and needed skills contribute to this confidence. If you have specialized skills, you feel confident. We are still more likely to run out of talent than to run out of jobs.
How significant is the aging baby boomer population in workforce trends?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: In countries with decreasing or stagnating populations, which are most of the best [advanced industrialized nations], our clients are painfully aware that they will run out of talent quite soon.
Your research found that work-life balance is a top priority for workers. Why is that?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: People increasingly work to live and not live to work. The importance of a job, as part of one's personal identity and whole life, is going down compared to previous generations. There is a strong desire for rapid advancement into leadership roles in emerging markets, yet work-life balance remains the top priority.
Job security is also a top priority for workers in your survey. How do you reconcile that with recent tech industry layoffs?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: It is not so much that they are worried about losing their current job. It's more they want to be employable in the long term. Employees seek employers who provide opportunities to develop new skills. If a role becomes automated, they prefer employers who offer opportunities to learn new skills rather than simply letting employees go.
Your study found that about 40% of workers use generative AI tools, but the rate was higher in emerging economies. Can you explain the high use of generative AI tools in emerging economies?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: This trend is surprising and may be due to less regulation and a more open mindset in these regions. In Germany, for instance, it's much more regulated. One theory relates to how certain economies leapfrog certain technological development steps.
In the emerging world, not many people use desktop computers; they go straight to mobile. Generative AI's accessibility and availability on mobile may be similar.
Only 5% of workers in the study fear job replacement by AI in the next five years. Some other studies suggest the number is much higher. Can you explain this?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: Our survey asked workers what they expect in a five-year timeline, which might be why the number is lower than other studies that look further ahead. Another BCG study about generative AI's impact over 10 years found that 20% were fearful. Additionally, our sample included a wide range of job types, and many studies that show higher fear percentages often focus on high-skill office jobs.
What was the most surprising finding for you in this report?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: The heightened importance of job security was surprising, especially given that we conducted a similar survey during the height of the COVID crisis. How can job security be more important now than it was back then? The only answer we could come up with was GenAI, which people now have internalized that their jobs may fundamentally change.

Assessing the impact of large language models on the labour market

Though large language models (LLMs) and associated technologies are poised to disrupt jobs, little has been done to evaluate this risk or develop a policy to address it.
Now, a new study has developed a rubric to assess the effects of large language models on labour markets.
The study, ‘GPTs are GPTs: Labor market impact potential of LLMs,’ is published in Science.
Can large language models improve our experiences at work?
Despite a growing literature that aims to understand the labour market impacts of LLMs, there is still no clear understanding of how exposure to AI systems will translate to real-world impacts on labour demand, wages, inequality, job quality, and other key outcomes.
To assess this, the researchers used the O*NET 27.2 database – which covers dozens of occupations and their detailed workflows – and focused on 923 occupations.
They used humans and trained GPT-4 to evaluate if LLMs could reduce the time required for a human to complete a task by at least 50% while preserving or improving quality.
The authors estimate that about 80% of workers are in occupations with at least 10% of job tasks exposed to large language models influence in this way, with 18.5% of workers in occupations with 50% of their tasks exposed.
An additional exploratory analysis revealed 1.86% of tasks could be fully automated with no human oversight.
The science and research industry is fully embracing AI
Overall, the researchers found that generally, higher wage occupations were more exposed to the effects of LLMs than lower wage occupations.
In fact, the two job groups most exposed to LLMs are ‘Scientists and Researchers’ and ‘Technologists’.
However, tasks currently considered out of reach of large language models might become more viable with future innovations, and conversely, tasks that seem more likely to be handled by LLMs might encounter unexpected barriers.
This work highlights the importance of developing policies to ease transitions in LLM adoption and direct their development in a more socially beneficial direction, ensuring that economic gains are large and broadly distributed.

Reports thus far have pointed to a partnership with OpenAI that will, among other things, help supercharge Siri.A fresh round of rumors reported by Bloomberg shed more light on the news expected to be unveiled at Monday’s 10 a.m. PT keynote. First there’s the name: Apple Intelligence. The company was clearly invested in maintaining the AI initials for its own whack at the large language model (LLM) piñata.The name appears to apply to a broader push into the category that could include that OpenAI partnership and a resulting chatbot. Apple Intelligence will arrive as an opt-in beta, similar to developer-focused operating system updates the company releases after WWDC. The system should ship on upcoming versions of the iPhone, iPad and Macs.According to the report, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence poses a significant threat to jobs focused on data entry and administrative tasks. AI excels in processing and organizing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, making these roles highly susceptible to automation. Systems powered by AI can input, organize, and manage data more efficiently than humans, reducing errors and allowing employees to focus on more complex activities.Manufacturing and Assembly Lines:
In the manufacturing sector, Artificial Intelligence and robots have become essential, particularly in repetitive physical tasks. Robots equipped with AI can perform tasks such as product assembly, welding, packaging, with greater precision and efficiency than humans. These systems are particularly useful in high-volume production settings, enabling continuous operation, reducing costs, and increasing productivity.Retail Sales:
Artificial Intelligence has made significant strides in retail sales, with increasing implementation of automated checkout processes and self-service kiosks in supermarkets and retail stores. AI-powered systems can handle transactions independently, manage inventory, provide personalized shopping experiences, and facilitate automated payment processes, diminishing the need for human cashiers.Core Analytical Roles:
Basic analytical functions, such as financial analysis or report generation, are also shifting towards automation. AI systems can process large data sets, identify trends, and create reports faster and more accurately than humans. This automation is particularly beneficial for tasks involving routine data analysis, paving the way for more sophisticated analytical roles that require human creativity and problem-solving skills.Graphic Design for Beginners:
Artificial Intelligence tools are now capable of producing basic design elements and automating simple graphic design tasks that previously required human designers. These tools can create logos, social media posts, and even website layouts efficiently and cost-effectively, posing a threat to entry-level graphic design jobs.Translation Services:
The field of translation has been significantly impacted by AI, with increasingly advanced automated translation services. While accurate language understanding and cultural context still require human expertise, beginner translation roles involving direct text translation are particularly vulnerable to automation.Routine Photography:
AI has also revolutionized corporate photography by automating basic photography tasks such as capturing web shots or company events. AI-powered systems can adjust lighting, framing, and even editing to produce high-quality images with minimal human intervention. While complex and creative photography still demands human talent, routine corporate photography tasks are increasingly handled by AI.Adaptation and Creativity:
As Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve, it is crucial for workforce preparation to focus on areas where human creative and problem-solving abilities are irreplaceable. By embracing change and developing skills that complement intelligent systems rather than compete with them, humans can ensure harmonious coexistence with AI, enhancing human potential rather than replacing it.New Horizons in Artificial Intelligence Impact on Future Job MarketAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to shape the landscape of the job market, new challenges and opportunities are emerging that demand closer examination. While the previous article touched on various aspects of how AI is affecting different job sectors, there are additional facets to consider in understanding its impact on future employment trends.Key Questions:
1. How will the rise of AI impact job creation in emerging industries?
2. What are the ethical implications of AI replacing human workers in certain roles?
3. How can workers adapt and upskill to remain competitive in an AI-driven economy?
4. What regulatory measures are needed to ensure a balanced transition in the job market?Advantages:
One of the key advantages of AI in the job market is increased efficiency and productivity. Automation powered by AI can streamline processes, reduce errors, and free up human resources for more strategic and creative tasks. Additionally, AI technologies can help businesses make data-driven decisions faster and more accurately, leading to improved outcomes and innovation.Disadvantages:
On the flip side, the automation of jobs through AI can lead to displacement of workers in certain industries, raising concerns about job security and income inequality. The rapid advancement of AI also poses challenges in terms of maintaining privacy and data security, as well as potential biases embedded in AI algorithms that may perpetuate social inequalities.Challenges:
One of the key challenges associated with the increasing integration of AI in the job market is the need for continuous learning and upskilling.

Nothing better captures the influence of technology on the general public than the Collins Dictionary selecting &quot;AI&quot; as the word of the year for 2023. As a result, people might believe that in a future where artificial intelligence is unfailing, AI-based technology, at large, can do everything. It can quickly diagnose ailments; our groceries could be purchased by robots and delivered by self-driving cars; AI could even run trains and airplanes; and it could even prepare all our meals, without any human aid. However, this is far from true. Despite the advancements in technology, the majority of jobs will still need to be performed by humans. So instead of trying to replace people, generative AI will be most useful when it comes to enhancing human creativity. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will be a net job creator between now and 2027. So let’s try to debunk some myths about AI and human jobs. Spoiler alert: Your jobs are safe, and if anything, they are better enhanced because of AI. No AI, No Job? With the advent of AI, over half of the skills that people use on a daily basis at work will need to be revised. Hence, the employees who are skilled in AI might pose a threat to those who are not.&nbsp; AI and Big Data jointly ranks 15th as a general core skill today, and it is the third most important skill that businesses are looking for at present. A striking 66% of leaders admit they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills. Furthermore, 71% of these leaders would prefer to hire a less experienced candidate who has AI skills over a more experienced candidate without them. For instance, emerging job roles such as prompt engineers, AI trainers, AI auditors, data detectives, and AI ethicists require specialized skills and knowledge, underscoring the importance of rapid reskilling and upskilling within the workforce.&nbsp; Many employees are capable of and willing to be self-motivated. As a result of which there has been a 160% spike in the use of learning courses designed to build AI aptitude. However, in certain instances, companies will have to pay for this upskilling and reskilling. Hence, businesses are increasingly investing in training programs to upgrade their workforce skills and address talent gaps in their organizations. Also read: Deeptech surge in 2023: India sees 480 new startups but faces funding struggles In India, specifically, the technology companies are involved in this transformation. Over 94% of Indian firms invest in upskilling their employees because of the progress made by artificial intelligence technologies. For instance, tech giants have created AI research centers across the country where they run wide-ranging AI skilling programs through workshops and certifications.&nbsp; The future is brighter than we think&nbsp; There are people who still believe that cellphones can harm human health, regardless of the fact that this thought comes from limited and non-reputable sources. It is easier to look at new inventions and raise questions about its ill effects. Embracing innovation, on the other hand, has the potential to change things for better. Of course, every job will be impacted by AI. However, most of that will be augmenting the skills of the workforce rather than replacing them. Humans created AI, which shows that there is little to no match for our skills and aptitude. In other words, humans will always triumph over AI and other technological systems in all aspects. Hence, rather than fearing AI or other technologies that crop up in the future, we can benefit from viewing them as an added tool that can ease the day-to-day tasks, and enhance our quality of work. In short, AI should be viewed as a complement to human capabilities rather than a replacement. (The author is MD and global CTO of Visionet.

Roblox, the popular online gaming platform, has announced its progress in developing AI tools, specifically in the area of 4D generative AI. The fourth dimension of generative AI is interaction, which means that Roblox is working on creating AI creations that can dynamically interact with the virtual world they inhabit. This advancement would allow game developers to set the stage for unscripted interactions within their games.
According to Morgan McGuire, Roblox’s chief scientist, the power of the platform lies in its focus on interaction between people, objects, and environments. Unlike traditional online games, Roblox’s runtime engine is designed to facilitate complex and spontaneous interactions, inspired by the concept of a metaverse. The goal is to create a world where elements can interact in many-to-many ways, rather than being limited by predetermined actions.

To achieve 4D generative AI, Roblox is addressing several challenges. These include functionality, control, and interactivity. The generated objects need to behave as expected by developers while interacting with the virtual world in a logical manner. McGuire states that the company is training its AI generator using a multimodal approach and incorporating purpose-built optimizers to improve control over the generation process.
Founder David Baszucki provided an example of how a 4D genAI-created object would work. A race car, for instance, would have an engine, moveable parts, and a physics rig that enables it to drive down a track. All of these components would be generated based on a simple text or voice prompt.

Overall, Roblox’s advancements in 4D generative AI have the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. By allowing for more interactive and dynamic experiences, game developers can create virtual worlds that are more immersive and engaging for players. This development aligns with Roblox’s vision of building a metaverse where users can connect and interact in unprecedented ways. With its focus on interaction and innovation, Roblox continues to be at the forefront of the gaming industry.

Large language models are the dynamite behind the generative AI boom of 2023. However, they've been around for a while.
LLMs are black box AI systems that use deep learning on extremely large datasets to understand and generate new text. Modern LLMs began taking shape in 2014 when the attention mechanism -- a machine learning technique designed to mimic human cognitive attention -- was introduced in a research paper titled ""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate."" In 2017, that attention mechanism was honed with the introduction of the transformer model in another paper, ""Attention Is All You Need.""







Some of the most well-known language models today are based on the transformer model, including the generative pre-trained transformer series of LLMs and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT).
ChatGPT, which runs on a set of language models from OpenAI, attracted more than 100 million users just two months after its release in 2022. Since then, many competing models have been released. Some belong to big companies such as Google and Microsoft; others are open source.
Constant developments in the field can be difficult to keep track of. Here are some of the most influential models, both past and present. Included in it are models that paved the way for today's leaders as well as those that could have a significant effect in the future.

19 of the best large language models in 2024





Top current LLMs
Below are some of the most relevant large language models today. They do natural language processing and influence the architecture of future models.
BERT
BERT is a family of LLMs that Google introduced in 2018. BERT is a transformer-based model that can convert sequences of data to other sequences of data. BERT's architecture is a stack of transformer encoders and features 342 million parameters. BERT was pre-trained on a large corpus of data then fine-tuned to perform specific tasks along with natural language inference and sentence text similarity. It was used to improve query understanding in the 2019 iteration of Google search.
Claude
The Claude LLM focuses on constitutional AI, which shapes AI outputs guided by a set of principles that help the AI assistant it powers helpful, harmless and accurate. Claude was created by the company Anthropic. The latest iteration of the Claude LLM is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It understands nuance, humor and complex instructions better than earlier versions of the LLM, and operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus. It’s available for free via Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app.
Cohere
Cohere is an enterprise AI platform that provides several LLMs including Command, Rerank and Embed. These LLMs can be custom-trained and fine-tuned to a specific company’s use case. The company that created the Cohere LLM was founded by one of the authors of Attention Is All You Need. One of Cohere’s strengths is that it is not tied to one single cloud -- unlike OpenAI, which is bound to Microsoft Azure.
Ernie
Ernie is Baidu’s large language model which powers the Ernie 4.0 chatbot. The bot was released in August 2023 and has garnered more than 45 million users. Ernie is rumored to have 10 trillion parameters. The bot works best in Mandarin but is capable in other languages.
Falcon 40B
Falcon 40B is a transformer-based, causal decoder-only model developed by the Technology Innovation Institute. It is open source and was trained on English data. The model is available in two smaller variants as well: Falcon 1B and Falcon 7B (1 billion and 7 billion parameters). Amazon has made Falcon 40B available on Amazon SageMaker. It is also available for free on GitHub.



Gemini
Gemini is Google's family of LLMs that power the company's chatbot of the same name. The model replaced Palm in powering the chatbot, which was rebranded from Bard to Gemini upon the model switch. Gemini models are multimodal, meaning they can handle images, audio and video as well as text. Gemini is also integrated in many Google applications and products. It comes in three sizes -- Ultra, Pro and Nano. Ultra is the largest and most capable model, Pro is the mid-tier model and Nano is the smallest model, designed for efficiency with on-device tasks. Gemini outperforms GPT-4 on most evaluated benchmarks.
Gemma
Gemma is a family of open-source language models from Google that were trained on the same resources as Gemini. Gemma comes in two sizes -- a 2 billion parameter model and a 7 billion parameter model. Gemma models can be run locally on a personal computer, and surpass similarly sized Llama 2 models on several evaluated benchmarks.
GPT-3
GPT-3 is OpenAI's large language model with more than 175 billion parameters, released in 2020. GPT-3 uses a decoder-only transformer architecture. In September 2022, Microsoft announced it had exclusive use of GPT-3's underlying model. GPT-3 is 10 times larger than its predecessor. GPT-3's training data includes Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2 and Wikipedia.
GPT-3 is the last of the GPT series of models in which OpenAI made the parameter counts publicly available. The GPT series was first introduced in 2018 with OpenAI's paper ""Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.""
GPT-3.5
GPT-3.5 is an upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters. GPT-3.5 was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback. GPT-3.5 is the version of GPT that powers ChatGPT. There are several models, with GPT-3.5 turbo being the most capable, according to OpenAI. GPT-3.5's training data extends to September 2021.
It was also integrated into the Bing search engine but has since been replaced with GPT-4.
GPT-4
GPT-4 is the largest model in OpenAI's GPT series, released in 2023. Like the others, it's a transformer-based model. Unlike the others, its parameter count has not been released to the public, though there are rumors that the model has more than 170 trillion. OpenAI describes GPT-4 as a multimodal model, meaning it can process and generate both language and images as opposed to being limited to only language. GPT-4 also introduced a system message, which lets users specify tone of voice and task.
GPT-4 demonstrated human-level performance in multiple academic exams. At the model's release, some speculated that GPT-4 came close to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which means it is as smart or smarter than a human. GPT-4 powers Microsoft Bing search, is available in ChatGPT Plus and will eventually be integrated into Microsoft Office products.
GPT-4o
GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o) is OpenAI’s successor to GPT-4 and offers several improvements over the previous model. GPT-4o creates a more natural human interaction for ChatGPT and is a large multimodal model, accepting various inputs including audio, image and text. The conversations let users engage as they would in a normal human conversation, and the real-time interactivity can also pick up on emotions. GPT-4o can see photos or screens and ask questions about them during interaction.
GPT-4o can respond in 232 milliseconds, similar to human response time and faster than GPT-4 Turbo. The GPT-4o model is free and will be available for developer and customer products.
Lamda
Lamda (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a family of LLMs developed by Google Brain announced in 2021. Lamda used a decoder-only transformer language model and was pre-trained on a large corpus of text. In 2022, LaMDA gained widespread attention when then-Google engineer Blake Lemoine went public with claims that the program was sentient. It was built on the Seq2Seq architecture.
Llama
Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama) is Meta's LLM released in 2023. The largest version is 65 billion parameters in size. Llama was originally released to approved researchers and developers but is now open source. Llama comes in smaller sizes that require less computing power to use, test and experiment with.
Llama uses a transformer architecture and was trained on a variety of public data sources, including webpages from CommonCrawl, GitHub, Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg. Llama was effectively leaked and spawned many descendants, including Vicuna and Orca.
Mistral
Mistral is a 7 billion parameter language model that outperforms Llama's language model of a similar size on all evaluated benchmarks. Mistral also has a fine-tuned model that is specialized to follow instructions. Its smaller size enables self-hosting and competent performance for business purposes. It was released under the Apache 2.0 license.
Orca
Orca was developed by Microsoft and has 13 billion parameters, meaning it's small enough to run on a laptop. It aims to improve on advancements made by other open source models by imitating the reasoning procedures achieved by LLMs. Orca achieves the same performance as GPT-4 with significantly fewer parameters and is on par with GPT-3.5 for many tasks. Orca is built on top of the 13 billion parameter version of LLaMA.
Palm
The Pathways Language Model is a 540 billion parameter transformer-based model from Google powering its AI chatbot Bard. It was trained across multiple TPU 4 Pods -- Google's custom hardware for machine learning. Palm specializes in reasoning tasks such as coding, math, classification and question answering. Palm also excels at decomposing complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
PaLM gets its name from a Google research initiative to build Pathways, ultimately creating a single model that serves as a foundation for multiple use cases. There are several fine-tuned versions of Palm, including Med-Palm 2 for life sciences and medical information as well as Sec-Palm for cybersecurity deployments to speed up threat analysis.
Phi-1
Phi-1 is a transformer-based language model from Microsoft. At just 1.3 billion parameters, Phi-1 was trained for four days on a collection of textbook-quality data. Phi-1 is an example of a trend toward smaller models trained on better quality data and synthetic data.
""We'll probably see a lot more creative scaling down work: prioritizing data quality and diversity over quantity, a lot more synthetic data generation, and small but highly capable expert models,"" wrote Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI employee, in a tweet.
Phi-1 specializes in Python coding and has fewer general capabilities because of its smaller size.
StableLM
StableLM is a series of open source language models developed by Stability AI, the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion. There are 3 billion and 7 billion parameter models available and 15 billion, 30 billion, 65 billion and 175 billion parameter models in progress at time of writing. StableLM aims to be transparent, accessible and supportive.
Vicuna 33B
Vicuna is another influential open source LLM derived from Llama. It was developed by LMSYS and was fine-tuned using data from sharegpt.com. It is smaller and less capable that GPT-4 according to several benchmarks, but does well for a model of its size. Vicuna has only 33 billion parameters, whereas GPT-4 has trillions.


LLM precursors
Although LLMs are a recent phenomenon, their precursors go back decades. Learn how recent precursor Seq2Seq and distant precursor ELIZA set the stage for modern LLMs.
Seq2Seq
Seq2Seq is a deep learning approach used for machine translation, image captioning and natural language processing. It was developed by Google and underlies some of their modern LLMs, including LaMDA. Seq2Seq also underlies AlexaTM 20B, Amazon's large language model. It uses a mix of encoders and decoders.
Eliza
Eliza was an early natural language processing program created in 1966. It is one of the earliest examples of a language model. Eliza simulated conversation using pattern matching and substitution. Eliza, running a certain script, could parody the interaction between a patient and therapist by applying weights to certain keywords and responding to the user accordingly. The creator of Eliza, Joshua Weizenbaum, wrote a book on the limits of computation and artificial intelligence.

Published: 25 Jun 2024


 
Many people feel it's time AI companies paid for the free data lunches that have made their generative systems big and strong.
Recently, a bevy of legal action demanding compensation from AI companies has been filed in the U.S. and Europe. The plaintiffs include authors, artists and major media organizations who have consistently expressed concern about AI stealing their work and producing mediocre derivatives.







An open letter from the Authors Guild -- signed by more than 8,500 authors, including Margaret Atwood, Dan Brown and Jodi Picoult -- urges tech companies responsible for generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Bard, to cease using their works without proper authorization or compensation. The authors want companies to pay for the data they scraped for training -- the ""food"" for AI systems, endless meals for which there has been no bill.
Authors also express concern that generative AI threatens their profession by flooding the market with machine-written content based on their work. This was a problem in recent months as Amazon took action against AI authors spamming the bestseller list with generated works.
Prior to the release of the Authors Guild letter, two North American authors -- Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay -- filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming the organization breached copyright law. The suit argued that OpenAI breached copyright law because ChatGPT generated accurate summaries of the author's works and, therefore, must've trained on the authors' works. They aren't the only ones. Author and comedian Sarah Silverman is also suing OpenAI and Meta for illegally reproducing her memoir, The Bedwetter, without permission. But that argument may not hold up in court because of the way generative AI works.
Individual authors and artists aren’t the only plaintiffs. In December 2023, The New York Times became the first major American news publication to sue OpenAI for using copyrighted works in AI development.

What is generative AI?
Generative AI is the technology that powers ChatGPT and Bard. Text-based generative AI uses algorithms to predict the likely next words in text and generates that text based on a prompt from the user. ChatGPT knows what to generate because it was trained on a large corpus of publicly available data from the internet. It learned patterns from the training and matches those patterns to prompts from the user.
Generative AIs are usually black box AI systems, meaning nobody -- not even the programmers -- understands the exact steps the machine takes to go from input to output. Input goes in, the magic happens and output comes out.
All machine learning and generative AI tools use preexisting works of some kind.


Why are people suing?
People are suing AI companies over copyright. Even though ChatGPT's trained on data from the internet, it does so without permission from the data creators. For example, GPT-3 was trained on Wikipedia and Reddit, among other sources. However, conversations about and segments of copyrighted works could exist in the training material and give large language models enough context to accurately summarize those copyrighted works.
On a larger scale, people are suing because AI is a black box, and it's impossible to know how it works on a granular level. The fear is that people will use AI to avoid taking responsibility for their decisions or the things it produces.
""If AI companies are allowed to market AI systems that are essentially black boxes, they could become the ultimate ends-justify-the-means devices,"" Matthew Butterick, one of the lawyers behind several of the lawsuits, wrote in his blog. ""Before too long, we will not delegate decisions to AI systems because they perform better. Rather, we will delegate decisions to AI systems because they can get away with everything that we can't.""


What AI lawsuits have been filed?
Numerous cases have been brought against generative AI companies regarding copyright and misuse. Here are some of the companies being sued.
GitHub, Microsoft and OpenAI
A class-action suit was filed against these companies involving GitHub's Copilot tool. The tool predictively generates code based on what the programmer has already written. The plaintiffs allege that Copilot copies and republishes code from GitHub without abiding by the requirements of GitHub's open source license, such as failing to provide attribution. The complaint also includes claims related to GitHub's mishandling of personal data and information, as well as claims of fraud. The complaint was filed in November 2022. Microsoft and GitHub have repeatedly tried to get the case dismissed.
Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt
A complaint against these AI image generator providers was filed in January 2023. The plaintiffs alleged the systems directly infringe on plaintiffs' copyrights by training on works created by the plaintiffs and creating unauthorized derivative works. The complaint also takes issue with the fact that the tools can be used to generate work in the style of artists. The judge on the case, William Orrick, said he was inclined to dismiss the lawsuit.
Stability AI
In January 2023, Getty Images issued a complaint against Stability AI for allegedly copying and processing millions of images and associated metadata owned by Getty in the U.K. Getty filed another lawsuit against Stability AI in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware days later, which raised many copyright- and trademark-related claims, and pointed to ""bizarre or grotesque"" generated images that contained the Getty Images watermark and, therefore, damaged Getty's reputation.
OpenAI
Authors Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad are suing OpenAI for allegedly infringing on authors' copyrights. Butterick is one of the attorneys representing the authors. The complaint estimated that more than 300,000 books were copied in OpenAI's training data. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of money. The case was filed in June 2023.
OpenAI and Microsoft
The New York Times is suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. The case, filed December 2023, alleges that millions of New York Times articles were used to train and develop OpenAI’s chatbot and other technology, which now competes with the news organization as a source of reliable information. The case also alleges that OpenAI’s language models mimic the Time’s style and recites its content verbatim. The Times is the first major American news outlet to sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The Times approached the companies earlier in the year to discuss the copyright issue but never reached an agreement.
Eight other newspapers filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft on April 30, 2024, alleging they've purloined millions of copyrighted news articles to train their AI. Newspapers included in the suit are The New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, Denver Post, Mercury News, Orange County Register, St. Paul Pioneer-Press, Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel.
Meta and OpenAI
Sarah Silverman's lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI alleged copyright infringement and said ChatGPT and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama) were trained on illegally acquired data sets with her work contained. The suit alleges the books were acquired from shadow libraries, such as Library Genesis, Z-Library and Bibliotek, where the books can be torrented. Torrenting is a common method of downloading files without proper legal permission. Specifically, Meta's language model, Llama, was trained on a data set called the Pile, which uses data from Bibliotek, according to a paper from EleutherAI, the company that assembled the Pile. The suit was filed in July 2023.
Google
A class-action lawsuit is being brought against Google for alleged misuse of personal information and copyright infringement. Some of the data specified in the lawsuit includes photos from dating websites, Spotify playlists, TikTok videos and books used to train Bard. The lawsuit, filed in July 2023, said Google could owe at least $5 billion. The plaintiffs have elected to remain anonymous.
These copyright cases against big tech companies aren't the first of their kind. In 2015, the Author's Guild sued Google for making digital copies of millions of books and providing snippets of them to the public. The court ultimately favored Google, saying the works were transformative and did not provide a market substitute for the books.
Suno and Udio
Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records filed lawsuits against AI song-generator start-ups Suno and Udio in June 2024 for alleged copyright infringement. One lawsuit describes how Suno-generated songs sound very similar to Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” using prompts such as “1950s rock and roll,” “12-bar blues” and “energetic male vocalist.” The Udio lawsuit alleges something similar, saying many outputs sounded like Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” The record labels are seeking up to $150,000 for each work that was copied without permission.


What questions do these cases address?
The above lawsuits will be important in answering the following questions:

Does training a model on copyrighted material require a license? Generative AI systems make copies of the training materials as part of the training process. Does that interim copying require a license, or is it fair use?
Does generative AI output infringe on copyright for the materials on which the model was trained? If generative output constitutes a derivative work or infringes the training data's reproduction right, then it infringes on copyright. Courts will need to rule whether similarities in output and training data are derived from protected materials or unprotected materials. Who is liable for copyright infringement when AI infringes?
Does generative AI violate restrictions on removing, altering or falsifying copyright management information? The Digital Millenium Copyright Act provides restrictions on removal or alteration of copyright management information, such as watermarks. This is exemplified in the Stability AI case, where the watermark reproduced by Stable Diffusion on generated works constituted false copyright management information.
Does generating work in the style of someone violate that person's rights? This is known as the right of publicity, which varies from state to state. It prohibits the use of someone's likeness, name, image, voice or signature for commercial gain.
How do open source licenses apply to training AI models and distributing the resulting output? The plaintiffs in the Copilot case argued that republishing Copilot training materials without attribution -- and not making Copilot itself open source -- violates open source license terms.

As the cases continue to take shape and answers emerge, companies involved with generative AI tools should watch for guidance around the intersection of AI and intellectual property and check to see if they need risk mitigation strategies.

According to the findings, AI integration has boosted team communication and collaboration (47 per cent) and clarified data-driven decision-making (44 per cent), seamlessly integrating AI into existing workflows remains a challenge (37 per cent). While 41 per cent of modern engineers feel current AI training resources are insufficient, leading to job security concerns (44 per cent), a significant majority   (76 per cent) expect their  organisations to offer access to AI resources and learning platforms for professional development.  Modern engineers believe that following (50 per cent) AI protocols set by their organisations ensures human accountability and control over AI-driven decisions.  “Engineers see the immense potential of AI to boost careers and productivity, and companies need to bridge the knowledge gap and equip our engineers with the skills and support they need to thrive in the AI era,” said Srinivas Reddy, Managing Director at EPAM India.",Education & Careers,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'The Hans India - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png'}","['https://www.facebook.com/thehansindia/', 'https://plus.google.com/+HansIndiaHyderabad/posts', 'https://twitter.com/thehansindiaweb', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hansindia']",,mixed,AI can improve daily work by automating tasks for modern engineers,The Hans India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuum’s Witness Protection ML effect has got me excited about Artificial Intelligence in my NLE






Kevin P. McAuliffe 

June 24, 2024


Comment





I’ll be honest.  For me, much like the 3D phase for post, Artificial Intelligence has really been a big bust.  I can’t think of any Artificial Intelligence workflows that have enhanced my workflows, or made them better.  I’ve seen the videos from Adobe for what’s coming to Premiere and, to be honest, Adobe’s let me down with all the enhancements that were added that would “revolutionize” my workflows in the past.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m sure that there are certain bits and pieces of Artificial Intelligence workflows that help people out, but there really isn’t anything that I can say I use on a regular basis in my workflows.  Until now.  A couple of months ago, I had a “THAT’S IT” moment, where I can easily see myself not only using an AI tool in a whole bunch of different projects, but also where I can easily see this “machine learning” artificial intelligence workflow going in the future.  Good job Boris FX, good job!
INTELLIGENT….IT CERTAINLY IS
Now, I’ll start this article out by saying that I’m not getting a dime from Boris FX for this article.  I’ve been a Continuum since before it was offered free to all Media Composer editors who upgraded to Symphony (I know Media Composer editors all remember that), and have used it in After Effects for as long as I can remember.  Most of my “WOW” benchmarks for advancing my workflows haven’t come from the NLE or Compositing applications.  It’s been from Continuum.   
I mean, let’s be honest, Boris FX have pulled out some pretty surprising acquisitions over the last few years.  GenArts, Imagineer Systems, WonderTouch, Syntheyes, and even the licensing of Primatte technology has really made Boris FX the one stop shop for just about anything an editor or compositor could need.  For me, the biggest leap forward in, easily, the last 15 years has been the integration of Mocha technology not only across almost all of the effects inside of both Continuum and Sapphire, but its licensing in After Effects, which easily makes it the standard for tracking in AE today.  So, you’re probably thinking, what does this have to do with AE and machine learning.  Well, Boris FX just released the 2024.5 update for Continuum, and in it, is a tucked away look at the future of the effects package.  Believe it or not, it’s the Witness Protection effect that will lead the way to the next generation of effects in Continuum, and in the process, save editors and graphic designers countless hours of tedious work, even with the best tools available now.
Now, since everything these days is called “SOMETHING AI”, Boris FX decided to go down a bit of a different path by calling theirs ML or “MACHINE LEARNING”, and you can find the four “ML” effects in Continuum, simply by searching for them.

So, looking at the Media Composer version pictured above (the ML effects are available across the other host applications of Continuum as well), you’ll notice that there are actually four different ML effects including DeNoise, ReTimer, UpRez and Witness Protection which, for Media Composer, is a real-time effect.  So, what is the Witness Protection effect exactly?  Well, you’ve seen it a million times before.  Need to blur someone’s face out who’s walking down the street, as you don’t have permission to use their likeness in your production?  That’s where you would use an effect like this.  However, it’s worked very differently in the past and, to be honest, the effect went from wonky to very cool to awesome.  It started out wonky as it used the Continuum tracker to do all the motion tracking.  We all know how terrible point tracking can be, and having Mocha integrated with almost all the effects in Continuum really stepped this effect up a notch, as it made the tracking process much easier and much more precise.  It was, however, not without its issues.  If the talent walked behind a tree, or lamppost, or other object, it would require more work to be done inside of Mocha and, really, any time this type of effect was required, it always came with a bit of cringe from the editor, as we know how much time it really took to do this type of work, and it could be painfully slow.  Well, not anymore.  How does it work?  Drag and drop.  Yep.  That’s it.  Drag the effect (or apply it, depending on the application you’re using), and that’s it.  Talent walks behind something?  No problem.  The ML (Machine Learning) effect will be dropped back on as they come back out from behind it.  Does your character walk on or off screen?  Again, no problem, as ML will add the effect back on when they reappear.  Take a look at what I mean below:

The effect still contains everything else that you had available to you before, like the ability to switch to a mosaic pattern instead of a blur if you want to, and you can even turn ML off all together if you wanted to apply the effect to something different like a logo on someone’s shirt.



With that said, this is where I really see the potential in this effect.  Right now, the ML component is designed to detect faces, and basically add an ellipse to it as a mask, to then have Continuum either blur or add a mosaic to someone’s face.


I was floored by how quick and accurate it was.  The only adjustment I actually had to make was to add a bit of a feather to the mask, and make it slightly bigger, but otherwise, it did all the work for me.  It’s the first time that I’ve done anything with AI and thought “HOLY ****, I CAN ACTUALLY SEE MYSELF USING THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS”.  Now, let’s take a look at this effect moving forward.  What about logos on shirts or on products?  What about the ability to blur out nudity?  What about the ability to look at a transcript and blur over someone’s mouth who swears.  Now these applications are something that editors, especially ones who work on reality TV can really use in their day to day workflow that will save them an absolute ton of time in the compositing chair.  We can even look across other effects in Continuum to see where applications like this can speed up our workflows.  For example, in any lens flare effect.  Simply type in what you want your lens flare “attached” to, and you’ve already saved me a ton of time.  Sun, headlight, flashlight.  Something so simple, can save use minutes and even hours of time tracking.    For me, this one effect has gotten me excited about Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in my NLE/Compositing application, as it’s something that I can easily see a wide range of editors using, in all different types of productions.  For more information about Continuum 2024.5, you can check it out at borisfx.com .

Mira Murati, chief technology officer of OpenAI, stirred up quite a bit of controversy last week in a discussion when she proclaimed that with generative AI, “some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.”


While’s Murati’s remarks were framed within a context that AI is helping to boost creative pursuits, that’s not how many read it. The pushback was fast and furious. “OpenAI’s mission is to create AGI that can replace people in every viable economic activity. Killing jobs is the end goal,” wrote Dare Obasanjo in an X post.

“Aside from this despicable soundbite, Murati keeps stressing that generative AI will make people ‘more creative.’ But how?” asked Giovanni Colantonio in another X post. “You literally aren't creating. A machine creates the thing for you. It kneecaps creativity, not fosters it.”

PROMOTED
AI advocates “talk about democratizing creativity, but that's not what the tech does,’ Colantonio adds. “It discourages people from actually doing the real creative act of bringing an idea to life and instead encourages ‘creativity’ to be a thing that can be assembled and served like a Big Mac.”

Is AI, particularly generative AI, on a path to usurp the jobs of creatives, as well as the very essence of creativity? Whether its graphic illustrations, written content, photos, films, games, or other creative pursuits, could AI produce new things at the touch of a button?

It’s early, but so far, the evidence seems to point away from that.
“There's no easing up in the race for creative talent in 2024,” a talent report published in the first quarter of this year by Robert Half suggests. A majority of creative and marketing managers covered by the placement service, 55%, “are hiring for new roles, from graphic designer to UX designers, while 43% need to recruit for vacant positions.”

At least 200,000 creative jobs were added to corporate payrolls in 2023, Robert Half estimates. The unemployment rate for graphic designers and web designers was at a relatively low 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Still, underneath what appears to be a solid creative job market lurks uneasiness about its long-term prospects. Close to seven in ten of 4,000 global marketing and creative leaders, 69%, expressed concern over potential job loss across industries due to AI. a survey by Canva attests.
The surveyed leaders also welcomed the addition of AI tools to their activities. At least 69% believe generative AI is enhancing the creativity of their teams. And almost all, 97%, are comfortable with the rise of generative AI — with 72% stating they are “very” comfortable and 25% “somewhat” comfortable.
“We’re in a golden age of creativity and design right now,” said Deepa Subramaniam, vice president at Adobe, which now supports more than seven billion AI-generated images available through its Firefly models. At Adobe Summit in March, I put the question of creative job-killing to Subramaniam, who disagrees with such an assessment, and actually foresees expansion of creative roles.
AI provides the capability to customize and produce art and content on an increasingly wide scale that today’s organizations need, she said. “The hungry consumption for personalized content is not going to be satiated any time soon,” she pointed out. It’s only going to increase. But it’s really hard to create that volume of content manually, and manage it at scale, especially in a world where you're marketing at a global level. There are many languages and cultures that need to be reached.”
Generative AI “is taking the tedium out of content distribution, she said. “You still have to create creative concepts for marketing campaigns. But when you have that concept, you need to create it, localize it, and personalize it at scale.”
To meet these demands, there are “more people doing creative work across all sorts of industries across all sorts of job roles more so than ever before,” Subramaniam added.
For an example of technology’s impact on design-oriented professions, look to engineering, she illustrated. “Engineering has been growing as a really critical domain and group of people with the explosion of technology over the last few decades,” she said. “You're not seeing a shrinking of engineering.”
The takeaway is that technology took on many of the mundane, lower-level tasks of engineering. “Technology and software and coding has taken rote calculations away, but engineering has only been growing, because that unlocks the craft of engineering to figure out higher and higher complex problems.”
Likewise, in creative fields, “there's something like that happening right now,” Subramaniam continued. “Tedious time-consuming tasks can be obviated if not wholly accelerated by AI, opening creatives up to do that higher level thinking.”
As AI and technology open up more creative avenues, “it’s actually going to invite more people in to take on more creative roles,” she continued. “Whether it’s as a creative professional, as a marketer, in any of the creative roles that digital content is powering our entire world.”

       Don’t look now, but budget season is around the corner, and hoteliers will soon have to decide how much time and resources to dedicate to Artificial Intelligence in 2024. To help understand where AI adoption is heading, I’ve rounded up a few key stats on the impact of AI on work and the labor market. 1. Generative AI is now used by 65% of organizations. In 2024, generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude went mainstream. According to a global survey from McKinsey, almost two-thirds of organizations now use them, nearly double the percentage from ten months prior. The most common applications are in sales and marketing and product and service development, but use cases are proliferating across organizations. Three-quarters of respondents predicted that generative AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead. Source: McKinsey, Global Survey on AI, March 2024 2. AI is poised to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. The potential financial impact of AI is enormous. PwC predicts that global GDP (gross domestic product) will increase by as much as 14% in 2030 as a result of AI – the equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion. Growth will be driven by productivity gains and increased consumer demand, as organizations utilize AI to augment labor productivity and automate roles and tasks. Source: PwC, Global Artificial Intelligence Study, 2019 3. AI will affect almost 40 percent of jobs around the world. Historically, automation and information technology have affected routine tasks and low-skilled jobs. “One of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs,” reports the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits.” In advanced economies, about 60% of jobs may be impacted by AI, with roughly half of jobs benefiting from enhanced productivity and half of jobs being reduced or replaced. In contrast, AI exposure is expected to affect 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries. Source: IMF, Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work, January 2024 4. 79% of business leaders believe AI adoption is critical to remain competitive. Many employees have gone all-in on AI, reporting that it saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work. Yet company leadership is lagging, according to a global survey from Microsoft and LinkedIn. Sixty percent of business leaders said their company lacks a vision and plan to implement AI, and only 25% of companies plan to offer AI training this year. Yet 66% of leaders also said they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills. Not content to wait for their employers to catch up, employees are learning and upskilling in AI on their own. Of the AI users surveyed, 78% said they bring their own AI tools to work. Source: Microsoft and LinkedIn, 2024 Work Trends Index Annual Report, May 2024 5. 56% of executives believe their roles will be completely or partially replaced by AI. Much of the discussion about the impact of AI revolves around entry-level employees and mid-level managers. Yet it appears that senior-level positions are also at risk of being displaced or at least heavily augmented by AI. That’s according to a survey of 800 C-suite executives (including 500 CEOs) from edX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. A few more of the survey’s findings: 77% of executives say AI is disrupting their business strategy 87% are struggling to find talent with AI skills 81% feel they have no choice but to learn how to use AI 82% believe workers skilled at using AI should be paid more Source: edX, Navigating the Workplace in the Age of AI, September 2023. 6. 70.1% of short-term rental operators use AI. Statistics on AI usage in the lodging industry are scarce, but I did unearth a survey of 500 short-term rental (STR) property owners and managers from Hostaway. The survey indicates that AI isn’t just for big hotel companies with big budgets. Just over seventy percent of STR managers report using AI tools, and 61.8% believe AI represents a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Currently, STRs are primary using AI tools for: Price optimization Customer service Operational efficiency Marketing Energy management Of respondents, 35.0% said they’re on track to save an equivalent of four workdays this year, or at least two hours per week. For managers of 26 properties or more, the number jumps to 46.6%. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that more than three-quarters of the property managers surveyed are optimistic about AI, whereas only 7.2% expressed a pessimistic view. Source: Hostaway, 2024 Report: AI in the Short-term Rental Industry, May 2024 7. These Are the 8 Most Popular AI Tools in 2024. So, exactly what generative AI tools are people using? According to Quartz, these are the visitor volumes for the top tools for just a three-month period this year, from March to May. ChatGPT — 2.5 billion Gemini — 1.27 billion DeepL — 810.5 million Character — 723.6 million Perplexity – 217.4 million Claude — 186 million Poe — 148 million Copilot — 104.1 million Source: Quartz and Similarweb, June 2024 What Does This Mean for the Hospitality Industry? The data indicates that it’s time for hoteliers to stop dabbling in AI and start getting serious. While the hospitality industry is primarily a people-driven business, the AI use cases are piling up. AI has the potential to transform roles in virtually every department. But it’s not physical jobs in housekeeping, F&B, and guest services that will be most affected, it’s white-collar jobs in sales & marketing, revenue management, operations, finance, and human resources. To stay competitive, hoteliers need to figure out how to leverage AI to increase efficiency and productivity across the property or group, enhance the guest experience, and upskill employees for the future. 8 Key Steps to AI Planning for Hospitality Businesses As a starting point, consider the following steps: Assemble an AI committee Identify AI use cases across departments (think big, start small) Talk to tech vendors about how to leverage AI Familiarize yourself with AI-related ethics and regulations Develop an AI plan with objectives, a timeline, and performance metrics Incorporate AI into company policies and procedures Provide training, exploration, and upskilling opportunities to team members Be transparent about how AI will impact the workplace No sweat, right? There will be winners and losers in the AI race. Now is the time to decide how to ensure your company—and your career—come out on the winning side. Chatbots, Robotics & AI Daniel  E.

Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI

By Broadridge -   June 24, 2024 



ShareTweetShare
By Ariel Junqueira-DeGarcia, Managing Director, Broadridge
Since coming to the scene in November 2022, generative AI (GenAI) has been revolutionizing how we work and pushing companies to explore its benefits. But GenAI, which is capable of producing new content — like images, text, or music — isn’t without its limitations and risks. 
Tools like ChatGPT might seem like they understand user commands, but they don’t actually understand the content. GenAI merely predicts what’s likely to come next based on patterns. Critics warn against blindly trusting GenAI, which can “hallucinate” by making things up. Content that comes from GenAI needs to be checked by a human. Additionally, security is another concern, as many companies fear inadvertently leaking sensitive information to these systems and, in turn, have restricted or prohibited their use in day-to-day operations. 
Despite the shortcomings, the momentum behind GenAI adoption is strong. In Broadridge’s 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study, 45% of firms allow staff to use GenAI tools for work purposes, and another quarter are training staff on how to use them. To stay competitive, companies need to find use cases that use GenAI to its fullest potential while also mitigating risks.
Finding opportunities 
Identifying practical GenAI use cases isn’t always straightforward. Legacy systems, data quality issues, and legal constraints all pose challenges. Even small-scale AI projects can consume resources with little payoff. A strategic approach is essential.
Companies can start by targeting low-hanging fruit by looking for areas where GenAI can augment existing workflows or automate processes. Take client onboarding: firms currently rely on Know Your Customer ops teams to spot high-risk clients by manually sifting through red flags. AI can do this more accurately and quickly.
Another area is trade capture, where firms sometimes struggle to incorporate news headlines into algorithms, relying on standardized data inputs to convert text information into scores. GenAI models trained on large datasets of news and market data can quickly and accurately incorporate headlines into algorithms, leading to more informed decision-making. 
Generative AI can also help firms deal with regulatory changes and upped reporting requirements. With a tsunami of regulatory changes such as T+1, CSDR, and EMIR Refit Phase 2 on the horizon, firms have plenty of opportunities to capitalize on this technology. One example is the move to shorten the U.S. securities settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1. The change requires significant re-engineering of existing exception management practices. Deep learning models can help streamline the settlement process. There are also potential use cases for AI in other parts of the trade life cycle, such as collateral management, settlements, and regulatory reporting. 
A three-step plan to get started 
So, which project is the best to get started with? Before diving into GenAI projects, companies need to ensure that any implementation aligns with long-term strategies and business goals. To help narrow down the field, there are three points that successful projects need to fulfill. 
What: Identify the business case for AI adoption. Identify manual tasks that can be automated or pain points that can alleviated with AI. Out of those projects, identify which can be implemented quickly, in weeks rather than months. 
Why: Describe the measurable benefits of implementing AI by identifying quantifiable metrics and measurable business outcomes to measure success. 
How: Evaluate the cost and feasibility of the project. Gather information on what data is needed to train the model, how the prototype would be implemented and tested, and whether to use a third-party vendor or build in-house. 
By embracing generative AI and adopting a strategic, risk-mitigating approach, companies can unlock a competitive edge, streamline operations, navigate regulatory landscapes, and ultimately, shape the future of their industry. This is not just about staying afloat; it’s about harnessing the power of AI to thrive in the years to come.

However, it cannot replace the originality and creative power of the human mind. This is the message Colette Stallbaumer, GM of Microsoft’s Copilot and co-founder of WorkLab, wants workers to understand.Stallbaumer's message comes in the wake of recent data from a work survey organised by Microsoft and LinkedIn which highlights the surging use of AI in the white-collar workforce. The survey showed that AI is already having a significant impact on how people do their jobs.The integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming workplaces - a change that should be embraced rather than feared, says Stallbaumer, because AI will not only change individual work practices, but could transform the DNA of entire organisations.Rise in use of AI tools at the individual levelAccording to the 2024 annual Work Trend Index report which surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, 75 per cent are already using generative AI at work - a figure that has doubled in the last six months.The growing trend of individuals integrating AI tools at a grassroots level is already showing significant benefits; 85 per cent of respondents reported increased productivity, and 84 per cent noted improvements in creativity, leading to higher employee satisfaction.Women participate more in meeting with an AI female teammate, research showsGenerative AI tools allow workers to allocate more time to human-centric activities, such as team engagement and creative thinking. As such humans will be less doers and more supervisors of AI and AI-generated work and outcomes, explained Stallbaumer.""A salesperson can spend less time on data entry or navigating systems of record and more time nurturing customer relationships. Similarly, a finance professional can reduce time spent searching for data anomalies and focus more on strategic business growth.""While it's encouraging that individuals are deriving value from these changes in their roles, the challenge lies in organising, scaling, and integrating these practices across organisations at a strategic level.Adobe: ‘AI is not going to replace people, but people that use AI may be replacing those that don't’‘Coffee badging’ is the new return to the office trend. What is it and why do mostly men do it? Scaling AI adoption to an organisational level“After individual use begins the hard part of where we are in this technology adoption cycle. Now comes the real work, where people need to really build the habit of working in this new way with AI,” said Stallbaumer.According to the survey, 41 per cent of leaders expect to have to redesign business processes with AI, although how this will happen is still evolving. For example, some efficiencies will be similar across all companies while other AI solutions and changes will be designed for the organisation’s goals.“It's about looking at the opportunities in their business, in those horizontal workflows to actually apply AI to those processes. Every role is a series of tasks, right? And if you begin to break down those tasks, [you can] look at where AI can help.”It’s the companies that can face the challenges and opportunities head on - even as the 'how' is still evolving - that will thrive in the future.Watch the video above to learn more about the findings of Microsoft’s 2024 Work Trends Index report.You can see more content from Cannes Lions here.",NewsArticle,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ai-not-creative-ai-change-050033126.html,"‘AI is not creative, you are’: How AI will change the way we work, according to Microsoft","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/4749285fc61c1dedac5d9250a966ea28'}",2024-06-21T05:00:33.000Z,2024-06-21T05:00:33.000Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Annabel Murphy', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Yahoo News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_news_en-US_h_p_news_2.png', 'width': 310, 'height': 50}, 'url': 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/'}",,,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/4749285fc61c1dedac5d9250a966ea28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Annabel Murphy', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 400, 'height': 400, 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ec36b150-e968-11eb-baef-3c41b6928f57'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A growing number of workers worldwide are considering changing employers within the next year due to rising workloads and the rapid pace of technological change, surpassing the levels seen during the “Great Resignation” of 2022, a report by PwC said.
The 2024 Global Workforce Hopes & Fears Survey, conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries, revealed that a surprising 28% of respondents are likely to switch employers within the next year.
This figure marks a notable increase compared to the peak of the “Great Resignation” in 2022, which saw 19% of workers considering a change, and 26% in 2023.
 
 
 













 
 

“As workers face heightened uncertainty, rising workloads, and continue to confront financial stress, they are prioritizing skills growth and embracing new and emerging technologies such as generative AI to accelerate their careers,” Carol Stubbings, Global Markets and Tax & Legal Services Leader at PwC UK said in the report. “Job satisfaction is no longer enough. Employees are placing an increased premium on skills growth in a climate characterized by constant technological change.”

The desire to move is strongly linked to the need for skills development and the adoption of new technologies.
“Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds (67%) who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor in any decision to job-switch,” Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK said.  “All the while, fewer than half (46%) said they strongly or moderately agree that their employer provides adequate opportunities to learn new skills. Investing in employee upskilling programs will be critical to the retention of talent and ensuring their organizations remain competitive in a constantly evolving marketplace.”
 
 
 













 
 

According to another poll conducted by EY in March with over 250 industry leaders, half of the participants expect a trend of simultaneous layoffs and hiring as companies grapple with the evolving skillsets required in the AI era.
“How employees and employers address rising workloads, heightened uncertainty, macroeconomic pressures and technological transformation will vary based on geography, industry, and role,” Brown said.  “But survey responses this year highlight employees are embracing new and emerging technology such as GenAI to transform their roles and responsibilities and to create efficiencies.”
What’s driving the shift?
While the specific reasons behind this trend may vary, the report sheds light on several potential contributing factors.  A significant number of employees reported experiencing a faster pace of change in their workplaces compared to the previous year. 
 
 
 













 
 

“Nearly two-thirds (62%) say they have experienced more change at work in the past year than the 12 months prior, with two-fifths (40%) noting their daily responsibilities have changed to a large or very large extent,” the report added.

Ask




Nearly half (44%) admitted feeling a lack of clarity regarding the purpose behind these changes, potentially leading to confusion and frustration.
This sense of uncertainty appears to coincide with rising workloads.  The survey found that 45% of respondents reported an increase in their daily responsibilities, potentially leading to feelings of overwhelm and dissatisfaction.
 
 
 













 
 

Around 45% of respondents said, “I have had to learn to use new tools or technologies in order to do my job.”
In response to these pressures, employees are increasingly looking to AI and other technologies to improve their work efficiency and career prospects.
“Nearly two-thirds (62%) of employees surveyed say it will create efficiencies in their time at work, rising to 82% for daily users of the technology,” Brown said. “However, organizations and business leaders play a critical role. They must drive this change, ensuring they have AI strategies, frameworks, guidance, and training in place to ensure their employees are skills-ready for a constantly evolving workplace.”
 
 
 













 
 

Additionally, 76% of daily GenAI users anticipate that these tools will lead to higher salaries.
“Technology is fundamentally changing the way work gets done and the skills employers seek. Employees value organizations that invest in their skills growth, enabling them to stay relevant and thrive in a digital world,” Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK said in the report highlighting the transformative potential of AI in the workplace. “Proactive upskilling programs and a focus on the employee experience are crucial for businesses looking to retain talent and drive successful transformations.”
The upskilling imperative
Upskilling has become so valuable to employees that they see it as a company differentiator. Almost half of employees say that having opportunities to learn new skills is a key consideration when it comes to their decision to stay with their employer or leave for another job, the report said.
 
 
 













 
 

Despite the enthusiasm for AI, there remains a significant gap in access and training. Among employees who have not used GenAI at work in the past year, one-third (33%) do not see opportunities to use the technology, 24% lack access to the tools, and 23% do not know how to use them.
This gap underscores the need for employers to invest in comprehensive training and technology access to ensure all employees can benefit from advancements in AI.
“Leaders must provide a clear and transparent roadmap for the future, which includes laying out their ambitions and the steps required to meet those objectives,” Brown added. “When it comes to ensuring employees are skilled for the AI age, organizations must ensure they are developing AI strategies, frameworks, guidance, and training programs. More broadly, they also need to create guidance and mentoring about the types of skills employees need to build as technology transforms all industries. It’s also important to create a culture of learning and experimentation, recognizing that new and emerging technologies and their impact on roles and responsibilities are constantly evolving.”
 
 
 













 
 

The survey also revealed that less than half (46%) of all employees believe their employer provides adequate opportunities to learn new skills that will be beneficial to their careers. This lack of development opportunities is a driving force behind the high percentage of workers considering job changes.

While challenges remain, there are also positive signs. Job satisfaction has increased, with 60% of workers expressing at least moderate satisfaction, up from 56% in 2023. Additionally, financial stress has slightly eased, with 45% of workers having money left over each month, an increase from 38% last year. However, more than half (52%) still report experiencing some degree of financial stress.
“Taken together, these stats show how critical it is for companies to create ample opportunities for all employees to develop skills on the job and to ensure that leaders are providing guidance and mentoring about what kinds of skills employees need to build,” the report suggested. “It’s also important to create a culture of learning, where creating time for learning on the job is part of the organization’s DNA.”

User-ChatGPT Interaction Model: A Comprehensive Overview:
The interaction between users and AI, particularly with ChatGPT, represents a dynamic and evolving domain. This relationship is defined by the user’s task-oriented prompts and the AI’s responses. Users start by defining a task based on their expectations and skills and then communicate this via prompts to ChatGPT. The AI processes these prompts and generates textual responses. Users then evaluate these responses against their expectations, refining their prompts and expectations through iterative engagement. This model highlights the challenges of understanding ChatGPT’s internal workings and the proprietary nature of its data while emphasizing the importance of analyzing user tasks to gauge the impact of AI on human skills.
Data and Methodology:
This study investigates the tasks users assign to ChatGPT and the potential impact on human skills using Twitter data and the European Skills, Competencies, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy. Data were gathered from 911,637 English tweets from November 2022 to January 2023, focusing on various terms related to ChatGPT. After filtering and processing, 616,073 tweets were analyzed. Tasks mentioned in these tweets were identified using Named Entity Recognition (NER), capturing patterns involving ChatGPT and action verbs. A rule-based approach was applied, yielding 87,313 tasks. To refine the data, preprocessing included lemmatization and synonym grouping, resulting in 5,554 unique functions. These tasks were then semantically matched to relevant ESCO skills. Finally, sentiment analysis using the Twitter RoBERTa model assessed user reactions to these tasks, with sentiment scores calculated for each skill to determine the overall impact.
Exploring Public Opinions and Polarization Around ChatGPT: A BERT-Based Analysis:
This study explores public sentiment and topic polarization regarding ChatGPT by leveraging confirmation bias theory and advanced NLP models. By analyzing tweets, the research aims to understand public opinions and develop a polarization model based on confirmation bias. Utilizing BERT for sentiment analysis (BERTSentiment) and topic modeling (BERTopic), the study identifies emotional responses and thematic discussions related to ChatGPT. The findings highlight ChatGPT’s societal significance, how opinions form and diverge, and the role of group dynamics in online discussions. This approach provides a perspective on the impact of emerging technologies on public discourse.
Conclusion: Looking Ahead in the Era of ChatGPT and Generative AI:
As ChatGPT and similar Generative AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise significant impacts on human skills across various domains, from technical proficiency to creative problem-solving. The study underscores the transformative potential of these tools in reshaping job markets and educational paradigms. However, it also highlights the critical need for responsible deployment and skill development among users to maximize benefits and mitigate risks. As we navigate this dynamic landscape, understanding AI tools’ nuanced capabilities and limitations, like ChatGPT, will be crucial in harnessing their full potential for societal advancement and sustainable innovation. This marks just the beginning of a narrative that will shape the future of human-AI interaction.

The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse digital workplace applications is advancing at a rapid pace. Digital workplace leaders need to leverage “productivity zones” to identify what aspects of productivity can be improved for information-centric work.
Employees that are engaged in information-centric work do not generally do that work in strict, task-driven or rigid workflow structures where productivity is easily measured. They often organize the way they work in a flexible manner, frequently switch activities, and interact with many people. These interactions may only be tangentially related to their tasks, but they still have an impact on productivity.
Measuring and improving information worker’s productivity needs to factor in experiences that go beyond the task itself such as the choices the staffs make when sequencing and prioritizing their work, or how much they depend on the input of others. Treating work patterns as zones can help identify where technologies like GenAI can help employees to be more productive.
Productivity zones represent a way to better understand information work employee experiences beyond task-driven productivity approaches. Digital workplace leaders can consider the following nine zones to help segment the different digital experiences employees encounter as they perform information-centric work.

Planning: Organizing and self-managing the work.
Creating: Composing, designing and refining knowledge artifacts.
Meeting: Gathering people to share information, make decisions, document actions, and grant individual perspectives and a shared vision.
Analyzing: Assessing the effort, artifacts, data and content needed for work.
Collaborating: Conducting conversations and joint efforts to execute the work.
Coordinating: Interacting with team members and others to refine work efforts, align timelines, schedule deliverables, and reevaluate assignments.
Networking: Connecting with colleagues to gain and share expertise, community feedback, or information.
Decision-making: Reaching an authoritative judgment or conclusion that affects individual and team actions for a given work activity.
Finding: This zone deals with discovering and utilizing the content, people, or other data related to the work at hand.

There isn’t a uniform route through these zones. It’s possible for employees to navigate through the zones multiple times for a specific activity. Digital workplace leaders must analyze and understand of what zones to “weight” more than others. The areas where GenAI might have a more profound impact and productivity value are those zones with more weight attached to them.
With GenAI, the lack of historical insights necessitates identifying areas of potential benefit. While GenAI appears to offer a general uplift in work efficiency for all types of work, questions remain as to whether GenAI will deliver improvements to business results beyond personal productivity. Personal productivity might be improved, but if the work is dependent on synchronizing tasks and results with team members, then individual productivity gains can be negated — unless the productivity gain is felt across the team. For instance, GenAI in collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack can help summarize chat threads and highlight key conversations, saving time compared to scanning lengthy chat histories.
To equip business stakeholders and GenAI advocates with deeper insights, applying the concept of productivity zones to use cases proves beneficial. These use cases allow digital workplace leaders to frame GenAI’s potential business value and productivity impact for line of business leaders. They can also guide decisions on whether to implement GenAI broadly across the organization for overall productivity enhancement or restrict it to specific work activities and employee groups.
Ultimately, use cases can distinguish the capabilities and impact of numerous digital workplace application vendors, all of whom are integrating GenAI into their products. These accumulated insights form a feedback loop to fine-tune deployment scenarios.
Gartner analysts will discuss more topics related to AI and digital workplace technologies at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo conference, taking place November 11-13, in Kochi, India. Media registration can be booked via sonika.choubey@gartner.com.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword, or a concept confined to the realms of science fiction. It is a rapidly evolving technology that has already begun to reshape various aspects of our lives and holds the potential to fundamentally transform society in ways we are only beginning to understand.
The concept of AI, which encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and more, has been a subject of both awe and controversy. Its capabilities have expanded from simple automated tasks to complex problem-solving, predictive analytics, and even mimicking human interactions. The impact of AI on society is multifaceted, influencing everything from the economy and employment to ethics and governance.
Economically, AI has the potential to create significant efficiencies, reduce costs, and drive innovation. Industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing have seen AI-driven advancements that improve service delivery and product development. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data to assist in diagnosing diseases or tailor financial advice to individual consumer profiles.

However, the rise of AI also brings challenges, particularly in the job market. Automation and intelligent systems could displace certain job roles, necessitating a shift in workforce skills and education. This transition may lead to short-term disruptions but could also open up new opportunities for employment in AI-related fields.
Ethically, AI presents complex questions about privacy, surveillance, and decision-making. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the balance between leveraging AI for societal benefits and protecting individual rights becomes increasingly delicate. There is a growing call for transparent and responsible AI development, ensuring that these systems are fair, unbiased, and accountable.
Governance is another area where AI’s influence is evident. AI can enhance public services, improve policy decisions, and streamline governmental processes. However, it also requires new regulations and frameworks to manage its deployment and mitigate risks associated with advanced AI technologies.
The advent of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a global conversation about the future of work. With the potential to automate a wide range of tasks, ML is often viewed with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. The question on many minds is: Will machine learning replace humans in the workforce?
The answer is nuanced. Reports suggest that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, potentially affecting a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe. However, this shift does not necessarily equate to a direct loss of jobs. Instead, it heralds a transformation in the nature of work itself.
Machine learning is poised to automate routine and repetitive tasks, which can lead to job displacement in certain sectors. Yet, it also has the potential to create new jobs and spur a productivity boom. The key lies in adaptation and reskilling. As AI reshapes industries, new roles are emerging for AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts, scientists, and digital transformation experts.
The economic impact of AI is significant. The McKinsey Global Institute projects that AI could add approximately $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, translating to an additional 1.2% GDP growth per year. This growth stems from labor automation and innovation in products and services.
For businesses and individuals alike, the imperative is to embrace the change. Companies must invest in training their workforce to harness the power of AI effectively. For workers, acquiring new skills and adapting to evolving job demands will be crucial for thriving in the age of AI.
The transformative nature of AI is not without its skeptics. Some argue that the hype surrounding AI exceeds its actual impact, while others caution against unchecked AI development leading to unintended consequences. Nonetheless, the consensus among experts is that AI is a transformational technology that warrants informed engagement from all sectors of society.
AI is genuinely transformational, with the capacity to alter the fabric of society in significant ways. It is a technology that demands careful consideration, inclusive dialogue, and careful regulations.

Crikey
AI-generated news is unhuman slop. Crikey is banning it
Until artificial intelligence can generate a headline as incisive or beautiful as 'Pissing in the Sink', we will never use it to write our articles.

Crikey’s first-ever edition arrived in inboxes on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2000. It included a reflection on Lachlan Murdoch from his former philosophy tutor, pseudonymous insider gossip from the former political staffer Christian Kerr, and lists of journalists who’d previously worked in politics. There was a profile of Rupert Murdoch lieutenant Col Allan titled “Pissing in the Sink”. 
From our inception, we have been so very Crikey. There are a lot of things that make up Crikeyness, but central is its humanness. Like most people, we want to cut through the bullshit, know how the world and power works, hear the gossip, tell stories, take the piss and have fun. We write the way we wish other people would write, which is the way we talk to each other, for our readers.
In the near quarter-century of dispatches — during which newsletters went from being cool, to cringe, back to cool and is now swinging back towards cringe again — Crikey has remained remarkably consistent because our job didn’t change. We didn’t pivot to iPad or video. We just kept doing the same old Crikey: having people write about people for other people. Fundamentally, this is what we think journalism is about.
But there is a threat to this philosophy. Artificial intelligence, specifically advances in generative AI, has been the defining tech trend of the past 18-odd months. Every industry has been experimenting with how to use the technology, including the media. Predictably, some are already using it to create the news. While some outlets have been caught publishing AI-written articles without disclosure, others are openly publishing articles and artwork made by a machine even though it makes most Australians uneasy.
OpenAI, Meta and Google’s AI chatbots repeated Australian political paedophile conspiracy theoryRead More
Our official position at Crikey is that this stinks. To understand our revulsion, you need to understand how generative AI, specifically large language models, work.
The first step in creating one of these models is hoovering up a huge amount of data. Most data is ripped from the internet without permission en masse. Companies that do this have ingested lots of intellectual property belonging to people who did not agree to being sucked into someone’s AI-generated, low-quality information and even some illegal and abhorrent images. 
The next step is training on the data to understand the relationships between all the words and phrases. For example, if you input “the founder of Crikey is”, the most common response among its dataset is probably something like “Stephen Mayne”, which is true. But AI doesn’t draw on years of close observation of Australian media when it answers this question. It makes a calculation based on all the times other people have continued that sentence to come up with its response.
The point is that AI does not understand what it’s being asked to do. It doesn’t know what words mean. It does not think or care about who’s reading what it’s putting out. It certainly does not consider the different angles of a story and who stands to gain from accepting the spin. It’s mindless regurgitation, like a press gallery journalist repeating a politician’s promise without interrogating it.
There are a lot of other reasons to dislike the AI hype and its industry of boosters. It’s a hugely energy-intensive technology that requires incredible amounts of power to use and train, significantly more than other computing methods to complete the same task like searching the web. 
It produces bullshit — not our words, bullshit is a scientific, technical term — when it frequently and confidently tells lies. Even when it tells the truth, its answers have racial and sexual biases. 
The technology can’t be separated from its unscrupulous creators. The industry’s original sin was stealing the world’s data without permission. Everything it produces is fruit from the poisonous tree. Companies say you can opt out of having your data collected, but only told us this after they got their fill of information. And sometimes these companies lie about letting you opt out.
These companies have grown rich and fat by selling subscriptions and advertising on the data they stole from us. This digital colonial mindset continues in AI’s users, too. They use it to reproduce our art, our photographs, our writing and our faces, all without permission and often to our displeasure.
I tricked a selfie AI age-verification demo into letting a child ‘buy’ a knifeRead More
No matter how advanced it gets, AI can never do the work of journalism. It can’t pick up the phone, go somewhere, speak to people, or think of a new angle or problem or solution. That doesn’t mean it can’t be used as a poor substitute. As we’ve already seen in Australia, people are already using AI to rip off other people’s journalism for their own gain and to compete against real stuff. They steal the eyeballs and dollars required to do the work that they think is valuable enough to take for themselves. 
The current state of AI is an industry built around a wasteful, violating technology used to create poor imitations of work, riddled with errors and biases, that threaten the very systems that produce the information from which they seek to extract value.
That’s a good reason to boycott it, but our reason is simpler: AI-generated content is bad to read and see. It’s bland and beige. It’s slop that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny but is a close enough approximation to something real that it can fill up space where people don’t pay attention. It’s something that someone didn’t care enough about to spend time to write or create. 
It is the opposite of what Crikey is. We believe that AI can never replicate our essential Crikeyness. A thousand chatbots in a thousand years would never come up with a title as evocative, incisive or beautiful as “Pissing in the Sink”. Using AI to generate Crikey would be an insult to you, the reader, as well as everyone who has made Crikey what it is. We’ve fiddled with AI image generation and the occasional block of text as a proof of concept in the past, and our editorial guidelines already require that any AI-generated content is disclosed. But we want to go a step further.
Crikey will never use AI to create what you read and see from us. We will spend the time writing the drafts, we will make the calls, we will read the documents, we will scheme for ways to piss off the right people. We will do the hard, time-consuming, expensive work — because if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be doing what our audience deserves. We join a movement of people rejecting AI-generated content to fight for the real stuff, and we invite other news organisations to join us.
We promise that everything you read and see in Crikey is made by a real person who gives a shit.

The recent “AI for Community Impact Summit” organised by Microsoft in Johannesburg, South Africa, buzzed with excitement.  As a participant, I was particularly thrilled to witness the launch of a groundbreaking white paper: “AI and the Future of Work in Africa.” This insightful document co-authored by a diverse group of thought leaders explores the potential impact of generative AI on the African workforce.
Here are 7 key points to understand why this white paper is must-read:
                           Next   Stay       Stunned by thousands of storks flying over the sky in Gia Viễn dike, Ninh Bình - Nếm TV            40         42                                                                                                              00:00                                                       00:00  /  00:00           10 Sec             
Collaborative Expertise: The paper benefits from the combined insights of thought leaders from Microsoft Research Africa, Microsoft Philanthropies, University of Pretoria, NEPAD, Lelapa AI, and Oxford University.
Focus Areas: This comprehensive analysis explores the impact of generative AI on various aspects of African work. Ultimately, the goal is to chart a course for a dignified and inclusive future of work.

Motivation and Context: The workshop that produced this white paper was driven by the potential of generative AI to transform the African workplace. Africa’s young population and diverse socio-economic landscape present unique challenges and opportunities. The core question is: How can generative AI be harnessed to create a dignified future of work for all Africans?
Key Themes: To address this question, the workshop focused on four key themes: macroeconomic impacts, jobs and skills in the labour market, worker perspectives, and the development of Africa-centric AI platforms.
Challenges and Concerns: The paper acknowledges the challenges Africa faces in adopting AI. These include a lack of data reflecting African realities, which hinders the effectiveness of AI models. Additionally, broader economic impacts, like job displacement and inequality, require careful policy design. Limited digital infrastructure and a skilled workforce could further restrict Africa’s ability to harness AI’s potential.
A Promising Future: Despite the challenges, the paper paints a promising picture for generative AI in Africa. From automating tasks in manufacturing and transportation (leading to significant productivity gains) to creating new AI-driven jobs for the continent’s young, tech-savvy population, AI presents a chance to empower workers by freeing them from repetitive tasks. Most importantly, the development of African-centric AI tools specifically designed for the continent’s unique needs offers the chance to tackle socio-economic challenges and position Africa as a frontrunner in responsible AI development.


Building a Strong Foundation: The white paper emphasizes the need for a strong foundation for responsible AI in Africa. This requires investments in digital infrastructure and education to equip the workforce with the necessary skills. Creating inclusive AI policies that prioritize education, worker protections, and stakeholder involvement is crucial. Furthermore, AI development should be designed with a human-centered approach, focusing on complementing human skills rather than replacing them. This necessitates training data and AI tools built specifically for African contexts. Prioritizing the development of Africa-centric solutions and fostering collaboration among stakeholders are paramount to ensure AI development respects local knowledge and traditions.
To gain a deeper understanding, you can access the white paper’s executive summary via https://shorturl.at/YXsd5 or download the full report here https://shorturl.at/6biYD.
This insightful document provides a valuable framework and recommendations for Africans, particularly policymakers, industry leaders, research communities, and various stakeholders, to navigate the challenges and possibilities of AI. The paper serves as a wake-up call for Africa to actively participate in shaping its own future and ensure it is not left behind in this technological shift. Significantly, the paper highlights that of the 29 countries in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (designed to promote responsible AI development grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and economic growth), only one African country (Senegal) is currently represented [Pg. 15 of the white paper].
This white paper offers a compelling roadmap for Africa to embrace AI as a tool for progress and shared prosperity.

California Lawmakers Consider Action to Regulate AI
The effects of artificial intelligence on employment, society and culture are wide reaching, and that’s reflected in the number of bills circulating the Legislature.

Wendy Lee and Suhauna HussainLos Angeles Times(TNS)
For four years, Jacob Hilton worked for one of the most influential startups in the Bay Area — OpenAI. His research helped test and improve the truthfulness of AI models such as ChatGPT. He believes artificial intelligence can benefit society, but he also recognizes the serious risks if the technology is left unchecked.
Hilton was among 13 current and former OpenAI and Google employees who this month signed an open letter that called for more whistleblower protections, citing broad confidentiality agreements as problematic.


“The basic situation is that employees, the people closest to the technology, they’re also the ones with the most to lose from being retaliated against for speaking up,” says Hilton, 33, now a researcher at the nonprofit Alignment Research Center, who lives in Berkeley, California.
California legislators are rushing to address such concerns through roughly 50 AI-related bills, many of which aim to place safeguards around the rapidly evolving technology, which lawmakers say could cause societal harm.
However, groups representing large tech companies argue that the proposed legislation could stifle innovation and creativity, causing California to lose its competitive edge and dramatically change how AI is developed in the state.
The effects of artificial intelligence on employment, society and culture are wide reaching, and that’s reflected in the number of bills circulating the Legislature. They cover a range of AI-related fears, including job replacement, data security and racial discrimination.
One bill, co-sponsored by the Teamsters, aims to mandate human oversight on driverless heavy-duty trucks. A bill backed by the Service Employees International Union attempts to ban the automation or replacement of jobs by AI systems at call centers that provide public benefit services, such as Medi-Cal. Another bill, written by Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, would require companies developing large AI models to do safety testing.
The plethora of bills come after politicians were criticized for not cracking down hard enough on social media companies until it was too late. During the Biden administration, federal and state Democrats have become more aggressive in going after big tech firms.
“We’ve seen with other technologies that we don’t do anything until well after there’s a big problem,” Wiener said. “Social media had contributed many good things to society … but we know there have been significant downsides to social media, and we did nothing to reduce or to mitigate those harms. And now we’re playing catch-up. I prefer not to play catch-up.”
The push comes as AI tools are quickly progressing. They read bedtime stories to children, sort drive-through orders at fast food locations and help make music videos. While some tech enthusiasts enthuse about AI’s potential benefits, others fear job losses and safety issues.
“It caught almost everybody by surprise, including many of the experts, in how rapidly (the tech is) progressing,” said Dan Hendrycks, director of the San Francisco-based nonprofit Center for AI Safety. “If we just delay and don’t do anything for several years, then we may be waiting until it’s too late.”
Wiener’s bill, SB1047, which is backed by the Center for AI Safety, calls for companies building large AI models to conduct safety testing and have the ability to turn off models that they directly control.
The bill’s proponents say it would protect against situations such as AI being used to create biological weapons or shut down the electrical grid, for example. The bill also would require AI companies to implement ways for employees to file anonymous concerns. The state attorney general could sue to enforce safety rules.
“Very powerful technology brings both benefits and risks, and I want to make sure that the benefits of AI profoundly outweigh the risks,” Wiener said.
Opponents of the bill, including TechNet, a trade group that counts tech companies including Meta, Google and OpenAI among its members, say policymakers should move cautiously. Meta and OpenAI did not return a request for comment. Google declined to comment.
“Moving too quickly has its own sort of consequences, potentially stifling and tamping down some of the benefits that can come with this technology,” said Dylan Hoffman, executive director for California and the Southwest for TechNet.
The bill passed the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee on Tuesday and will next go to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and Assembly Appropriations Committee, and if it passes, to the Assembly floor.
Proponents of Wiener’s bill say they’re responding to the public’s wishes. In a poll of 800 potential voters in California commissioned by the Center for AI Safety Action Fund, 86% of participants said it was an important priority for the state to develop AI safety regulations. According to the poll, 77% of participants supported the proposal to subject AI systems to safety testing.
“The status quo right now is that, when it comes to safety and security, we’re relying on voluntary public commitments made by these companies,” said Hilton, the former OpenAI employee. “But part of the problem is that there isn’t a good accountability mechanism.”
Another bill with sweeping implications for workplaces is AB 2930, which seeks to prevent “algorithmic discrimination,” or when automated systems put certain people at a disadvantage based on their race, gender or sexual orientation when it comes to hiring, pay and termination.
“We see example after example in the AI space where outputs are biased,” said Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, D-Orinda.
The anti-discrimination bill failed in last year’s legislative session, with major opposition from tech companies. Reintroduced this year, the measure initially had backing from high-profile tech companies Workday and Microsoft, although they have wavered in their support, expressing concerns over amendments that would put more responsibility on firms developing AI products to curb bias.
“Usually, you don’t have industries saying, ‘Regulate me’, but various communities don’t trust AI, and what this effort is trying to do is build trust in these AI systems, which I think is really beneficial for industry,” Bauer-Kahan said.
Some labor and data privacy advocates worry that language in the proposed anti-discrimination legislation is too weak. Opponents say it’s too broad.
Chandler Morse, head of public policy at Workday, said the company supports AB 2930 as introduced. “We are currently evaluating our position on the new amendments,” Morse said.
Microsoft declined to comment.
The threat of AI is also a rallying cry for Hollywood unions. The Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists negotiated AI protections for their members during last year’s strikes, but the risks of the tech go beyond the scope of union contracts, said actors guild National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
“We need public policy to catch up and to start putting these norms in place so that there is less of a Wild West kind of environment going on with AI,” Crabtree-Ireland said.
SAG-AFTRA has helped draft three federal bills related to deepfakes (misleading images and videos often involving celebrity likenesses), along with two measures in California, including AB 2602, that would strengthen worker control over use of their digital image. The legislation, if approved, would require that workers be represented by their union or legal counsel for agreements involving AI-generated likenesses to be legally binding.
Tech companies urge caution against overregulation. Todd O’Boyle, of the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said California AI companies may opt to move elsewhere if government oversight becomes overbearing. It’s important for legislators to “not let fears of speculative harms drive policymaking when we’ve got this transformative, technological innovation that stands to create so much prosperity in its earliest days,” he said.
When regulations are put in place, it’s hard to roll them back, warned Aaron Levie, chief executive of the Redwood City, California-based cloud computing company Box, which is incorporating AI into its products.
“We need to actually have more powerful models that do even more and are more capable,” Levie said, “and then let’s start to assess the risk incrementally from there.”
But Crabtree-Ireland said tech companies are trying to slow-roll regulation by making the issues seem more complicated than they are and by saying they need to be solved in one comprehensive public policy proposal.
“We reject that completely,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “We don’t think everything about AI has to be solved all at once.”

Africa stands at a pivotal moment to redefine the future of work with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a whitepaper jointly authored by Microsoft and industry experts across the continent. 
With nearly one billion Africans under the age of 35, representing a substantial portion of the global youth workforce by the century’s turn, the potential for leveraging AI to drive economic growth and innovation is immense.
Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer at Microsoft Africa, emphasizes the transformative role of generative AI (GenAI) in not only reshaping work environments but also in creating new opportunities for youth employment and entrepreneurship across Africa.
The whitepaper highlights McKinsey research projecting that GenAI could boost annual labor productivity growth by up to 0.6% through 2040, contingent on widespread adoption and effective redeployment of worker time. Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa, underscores the democratizing impact of GenAI tools, now increasingly accessible through internet-enabled devices and affordable data plans.
Beyond enhancing traditional knowledge worker roles, GenAI holds promise for revolutionizing sectors such as agriculture and healthcare, provided that African youth are equipped with requisite skills to thrive in an AI-driven job market. Skills development spanning AI deployment, application development, and advanced research are crucial to harnessing AI’s potential while preserving indigenous knowledge and community-centric values.
Microsoft advocates for culturally sensitive AI design that respects privacy and promotes inclusivity, tailoring AI tools to empower entrepreneurs and enhance decision-making capabilities across diverse sectors, including the informal economy.
Effective governance, inclusive design practices, educational investment, and adherence to ethical standards are identified as essential prerequisites for realizing the full benefits of GenAI in Africa. Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to collaborating with governments, partners, and stakeholders to ensure responsible AI deployment that fosters dignified labor practices and sustainable economic development.
As Africa accelerates into an AI-enabled future, proactive adaptation of macroeconomic policies and regulatory frameworks is imperative to support positive societal transformation.

Live00:0001:3301:33 A new analysis conducted by researchers from Harvard Business School, the German Institute for Economic Research, Technische Universität Berlin, and Imperial College Business School highlights a significant change in the freelance job market. It concludes that the launch of ChatGPT has resulted in a 21 percent drop in job postings for writing and coding roles on a major freelance platform. The team examined data from a prominent global freelancing platform and compared it with Google Trends data. This thorough approach enabled them to draw conclusions about AI's impact on freelance jobs. Decline in Writing and Coding Jobs Researchers Ozge Demirci, Jonas Hannane, and Xinrong Zhu revealed a notable reduction in the demand for freelancers with skills in writing and coding. The study attributes this decline to advancements in generative AI such as ChatGPT, which can efficiently handle these tasks. They write: “Using data from a global freelancer platform, we quantify a 21% greater decline in demand for automation-prone jobs compared to manual-intensive jobs after ChatGPT introduction. Writing is the job category most affected by ChatGPT, followed by software, app and web development, and engineering.” Interestingly, the study shows that jobs requiring manual labor have remained steady. This indicates that while AI has taken over certain cognitive tasks, it has not yet made inroads into jobs that require physical skills. Impact of Image-Generating AI The rise of AI technologies that generate images has also influenced the market, causing a 17 percent decrease in job postings for image creation. This aspect further demonstrates AI's growing role in automating traditionally human-driven creative tasks, say the authors: “We also find a 17% more pronounced decrease in demand for graphic design and 3D  odeling jobs following the release of Image-generating AI technologies. Our findings also suggest that freelancers with certain skills may face more competition after the introduction of GenAI tools. Given the already intense competition for job opportunities in online labor markets […], the increased substitutability between freelancer jobs and GenAI could further decrease earnings in the short term.” The study's findings emphasize how generative AI is reshaping the freelancing landscape. Fields, where AI can replace human workers, are witnessing a significant reduction in job opportunities for freelancers. Other Research Henley Wing Chiu, an analyst at Bloomberry, reports similar findings regarding generative AI's impact on the freelance sector. He analyzed real freelancing positions on Upwork, the prominent freelance platform, from November 1, 2022—a month prior to the release of ChatGPT—until February 14, 2024, to determine which jobs have been most adversely affected. The 3 categories with the largest declines were writing, translation and customer service jobs. The # of writing jobs declined 33%, translation jobs declined 19%, and customer service jobs declined 16%. Outside of these 3-4 job categories, most of the other job categories were not negatively impacted. Source: Henley Wing Chiu / Bloomberry Regarding pay, there have also been substantial shifts since ChatGPT and other generative AI tools emerged. Translation jobs were the worst hit, with more than a 20% decrease in hourly rates, followed by video editing/production and market research. Graphic design and web design jobs were the most resilient. Both of them not only increased in volume but also increased in hourly pay a bit. Source: Henley Wing Chiu / Bloomberry Upwork: AI Skills in High Demand Research from Upwork also highlights the significant impact of generative AI on the freelance job market. According to an internal study, there has been a remarkable increase in job posts and searches related to generative AI on the platform. From Q1 to Q2 of 2023, job posts in this category surged by over 1000%, while related searches grew by more than 1500%. This indicates a growing recognition of the value and potential applications of generative AI among businesses. Key findings from the research include the top generative AI-related skills in demand, such as ChatGPT, BERT, Stable Diffusion, TensorFlow, and in general AI chatbots. The demand is not limited to specific tools but extends to comprehensive applications and services that utilize these technologies. This shift shows that businesses are moving beyond searching for singular AI tools to exploring broader applications and services that can enhance various aspects of their operations. Upwork has responded to this trend by launching a new AI Services Hub, which connects businesses with skilled AI professionals and offers tools like the AI-powered job post generator and enhanced chat features to streamline the hiring process. Additionally, Upwork has partnered with Jasper, a leading generative AI content generation platform, to provide freelancers with advanced tools that boost productivity and quality of work.

Approaching AI with curiosity




In today’s fast-paced business world, ignoring technology is not an option, and the field of accounting is no exception. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer, helping accounting firms streamline processes, improve accuracy, and deliver more value to their clients. However, firms are still cautious about adopting GenAI technology into their workflows. The 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from the Thomson Reuters Institute found that 30% of tax and accounting firms are in the consideration phase of whether to use GenAI tools, while 49% have no current plans to use.  
How are industry leading firms implementing GenAI technology? This article explores how different accounting firms use AI in their operations to drive efficiency and excellence in their services.
How many accounting firms use AI?
According to survey respondents, 8% of tax firms identified as using GenAI technology, with 13% of firms planning to use the tech soon.

The adoption of AI in the accounting industry in recent years has been on the rise. Accounting firms of all sizes from global giants to local boutiques are increasingly turning to AI solutions to enhance their services. This shift is driven by the realization that AI can automate mundane tasks, reduce errors, and free up accountants to focus on higher-value advisory work. 
Interestingly, accountants seem to be implementing GenAI tech through personal, open-source tools for their work over industry-specific tools. 27% of tax firm survey respondents who already use a GenAI tool are using open-source technology (i.e. ChatGPT) over 8% using an industry-specific tool.

This trend could soon shift as more industry-specific technology providers introduce their own GenAI solutions within the coming years. 
How do the Big 4 use artificial intelligence?
The “Big 4” accounting firms—Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY), PwC, and KPMG—have led the way with AI adoption. They have heavily invested in AI-powered tools and solutions to provide clients with more advanced and insightful services. Here’s a glimpse of how they use AI: 

Document review: Deloitte has internally developed an automated document review platform. The tool uses cognitive technologies and fits into their practitioners’ existing workflows, allowing them to evaluate an entire population of contracts to find key information. 
Auditing: EY is embedding AI technology into their audit process. They are using AI to analyze and extract data from unstructured data, such as contracts, and analyze large data sets to help respond to the risks of material misstatement due to fraud. 
IT: In-house teams at PwC have developed customized software applications for employees that synthesize data, complete and review code, generate documentation, and more. They have seen 20% to 50% productivity gains in their development processes because of GenAI. Additionally, PwC professionals have access to an enterprise version of ChatGPT-4o for themselves and their clients.
Client solutions: KPMG’s Trusted AI framework helps their member firms’ clients design, build, deploy, and use AI tech solutions in a responsible and ethical manner, building loyalty and partnerships.

How do smaller accounting firms use AI?
Smaller accounting firms might not have the same resources as the Big 4, but they are also embracing AI to stay competitive and offer better services. According to the GenAI report, the top five use cases for tax firms using or planning to use GenAI were: 

Accounting/bookkeeping automation: Firms are using AI-powered software to automatically categorize expenses, reconcile accounts, and generate financial reports. This saves time and reduces the risk of manual errors for firms.
Tax research: Firms use AI-powered algorithms in tax research tools to return data from human-edited, tax-specific content. This provides authoritative answers from trusted sources quickly and accurately.
Tax return preparation: Firms are using AI to automate the extraction and analysis of data from various financial documents, significantly reducing the time and effort required to prepare accurate tax returns. GenAI also assists in identifying applicable deductions and credits tailored to individual or corporate financial scenarios, ensuring compliance and optimization of tax liabilities.
Tax advisory: Firms are using AI tools to generate predictive insights, helping clients plan for future tax implications based on their financial decisions. This provides a more strategic role to tax professionals, allowing them to offer value-added services.
Document review: Firms use AI to summarize key points from contracts, invoices, and receipts and can quickly identify anomalies that require further investigation. This capability not only speeds up the review process but also enhances the accuracy and reliability of financial audits and compliance checks.


Among the firms actively using or planning to use GenAI, 42% said they use the technology daily, if not multiple times a day. An additional 31% said they are using it weekly.
Approaching AI with curiosity
In the accounting world, AI is not a threat but an opportunity. It can empower firms of all sizes to offer better services, improve efficiency, and thrive in an ever-changing industry. As AI continues to advance, those who approach it with curiosity and a willingness to embrace new technology will likely stay ahead of this trend.

Why banning generative AI at work won’t work


4 Jun 2024

IT leader Jamie Moles advises companies to embrace AI by developing tools and processes to use it securely, because this tech phenomenon isn’t going anywhere.
Those who have been in the IT industry for any period of time know the truth: banning tools in the workplace doesn’t work. Consider that back in the day, we used to monitor how long users were on the internet or block access to the internet altogether. Now businesses are operated entirely through internet-based tools and restrictions are minimal. This is the reality under which generative AI operates.
The explosion of generative AI tools – and subsequent use in the workplace – have many IT leaders concerned about the security risks to their businesses. But if history tells us anything, the mass proliferation of this technology means that bans won’t work. In fact, a recent survey from ExtraHop found that 32pc of organisations have banned generative AI tools, but only 5pc say employees never use these tools at work.
So, what should IT leaders do?
The reality of generative AI
Organisations might be able to block certain generative AI services at the domain level, but there are so many tools out there and so many more coming. It is important to understand that the maintenance effort to keep blocking emerging tools will become unmanageable very quickly. Though ChatGPT will no longer allow users to create security threats, it is far from the only generative AI or large language model (LLM) tool out there.
The only option is to accept that these tools are a new, permanent extension of the modern workplace, and recognise the strong value they offer employees in boosting productivity. This potential to change the workplace and enhance the employee experience is evidence enough that banning this technology is not appropriate for future success. As with any new technology, generative AI still needs to have guardrails in place, and that means leaders need to focus on people, processes and tooling.
Improving company processes
Setting up good policies around the use of generative AI is a critical first step to governing their use in the workplace. The good news is that there are already several solid models on how to safely store and transmit sensitive data – think GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS. Implementing general data security best practices when developing policies is a good starting point.
ExtraHop’s research found that 90pc of respondents want the government involved in regulating AI. While we have seen some initial movement, from the US AI executive order to the EU AI Act, it’s essential to remember that governments are slow-moving beasts. They will provide recommendations and guidance when they can, but the ultimate responsibility for securing corporate data lies with a corporation itself.
Training people
All company AI policies should include strong security training which requires cooperation between non-technical leadership and the more technical leaders who oversee security. It’s equally important to involve employees who are actually using these tools so leaders can understand the benefits of specific use cases and how restrictions could potentially limit their workflow, as well as ensuring they understand the risks of leaking sensitive corporate data.
AI training should be clear and straightforward. For example, users shouldn’t share anything with these tools that is marked as sensitive or internal information. The ultimate goal of training should be to teach users to assess risk themselves in an intuitive way – and if they don’t know, to ask. A good rule of thumb: anything you would not send in an email to external organisations should never be shared with or uploaded to a generative AI service.
Investing in the right tools
The right security tools are a necessary backstop to security training. Though more than 80pc of IT and security leaders said that they were confident that their organisation’s current security stack could protect them from generative AI threats, 74pc are planning to invest in generative AI security measures.
The most valuable way to protect against data leakage with generative AI is to audit the use of the tools. Visibility measures that can help with monitoring data transfers are key.
Most organisations already have the basic tools for monitoring who is accessing certain sites and how often: firewalls and proxies. Both have the ability to monitor every site users connect to on the internet.
Certain security appliances can offer even more insight through measuring bytes in and bytes out. If IT leaders have broad network visibility and see users are sending more bytes out than they should – in the form of data they’re uploading to LLMs – they can assess risk quickly and address the problem easily.
Leaning into innovation
Though it’s been more than a year since ChatGPT made its debut, generative AI technology has made massive strides in the industry. As we see it used more on personal devices for messages, searches and more, we’ll quickly hit a stage where users expect to use these tools on their corporate devices, and they won’t necessarily wait for approval – nor will they know they’re doing something wrong without the right guardrails.
Fortunately, we live in a technology-first society, and many have been quick to raise concerns and create awareness around the risks of generative AI.
To a large extent, this loud and early alarm will encourage AI companies to improve safety in the generative AI products and self-regulate to meet market expectations.
That being said, relying on AI companies’ or government guidance is not an answer, nor is implementing a ban and hoping users will adhere to it. Generative AI is already bringing massive benefits to the workplace, and it’s poised to do so much more. To take advantage of these benefits in the safest way possible, leaders need to integrate generative AI planning into their people, processes and tooling. Generative AI is here to stay.

Facts, it has been said, are stubborn things. For generative AI, a stubborn fact is that it  consumes very large quantities of compute cycles, data storage, network bandwidth, electrical power, and air conditioning. As CIOs respond to corporate mandates to “just do something” with genAI, many are launching cloud-based or on-premises initiatives. But while the payback promised by many genAI projects is nebulous, the costs of the infrastructure to run them is finite, and too often, unacceptably high.
Infrastructure-intensive or not, generative AI is on the march. According to IDC, genAI workloads are increasing from 7.8% of the overall AI server market in 2022 to 36% in 2027. In storage, the curve is similar, with growth from 5.7% of AI storage in 2022 to 30.5% in 2027. IDC research finds roughly half of worldwide genAI expenditures in 2024 will go toward digital infrastructure. IDC projects the worldwide infrastructure market (server and storage) for all kinds of AI will double from $28.1 billion in 2022 to $57 billion in 2027.
But the sheer quantity of infrastructure needed to process genAI’s large language models (LLMs), along with power and cooling requirements, is fast becoming unsustainable.
 
 
 













 
 

“You will spend on clusters with high-bandwidth networks to build almost HPC [high-performance computing]-like environments,” warns Peter Rutten, research vice president for performance-intensive computing at IDC. “Every organization should think hard about investing in a large cluster of GPU nodes,” says Rutten, asking, “What is your use case? Do you have the data center and data science skill sets?”

Shifting to small language models, hybrid infrastructure
Savvy IT leaders are aware of the risk of overspending on genAI infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud. After taking a hard look at their physical operations and staff capabilities as well as the fine print of cloud contracts, some are coming up with strategies that are delivering positive return on investment.  
Seeking to increase the productivity of chronically understaffed radiology teams, Mozziyar Etemadi, medical director of advanced technologies at Northwestern Medicine undertook a genAI project designed to speed the interpretation of X-ray images. But instead of piling on compute, storage, and networking infrastructure to handle massive LLMs, Northwestern Medicine shrank the infrastructure requirements by working with small language models (SLMs).
 
 
 













 
 

Etemadi began by experimenting with cloud-based services but found them unwieldy and expensive. “I tried them, but we couldn’t get [generative AI] to work in a favorable cost envelope.” That led Etemadi to the realization that he would have to spearhead a dedicated engineering effort.
Heading a team of a dozen medical technologists, Etemadi built a four-node cluster of Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers with eight Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs, connected with Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. Running in a colocation facility, the cluster ingests multimodal data, including images, text, and video, which trains the SLM on how to interpret X-ray images. The resulting application, which was recently patented, generates highly accurate interpretations of the pictures, feeding them to a human-in-the-loop (HITL) for final judgement.
“It’s multimodal, but tiny. The number of parameters is approximately 300 million. That compares to ChatGPT, which is at least a trillion,” says Etemadi, who envisions building on the initial X-ray application to interpret CT scans, MRI images, and colonoscopies.
 
 
 













 
 

He estimates that using a cloud-based service for the same work would cost about twice as much as it costs to run the Dell cluster. “On the cloud, you’re paying by the hour and you’re paying a premium.” In contrast, he asserts, “Pretty much any hospital in the US can buy four computers. It’s well within the budget.”

When it comes to data storage, Northwestern Medicine uses both the cloud and on-premises infrastructure for both temporary and permanent storage. “It’s about choosing the right tool for the job. With storage, there is really no one-size-fits-all,” says Etemadi, adding, “As a general rule, storage is where cloud has the highest premium fee.”
On premises, Northwestern Medicine is using a mix of Dell NAS, SAN, secure, and hyperconverged infrastructure equipment. “We looked at how much data we needed and for how long. Most of the time, the cloud is definitely not cheaper,” asserts Etemadi. 
 
 
 













 
 

The cost calculus of GPU clusters
Faced with similar challenges, a different approach was taken by Papercup Technologies, a UK company that has developed genAI-based language translation and dubbing services. Papercup clients seeking to globalize the appeal of their products use the company’s service to generate convincing voice-overs in many languages for use in commercial videos. Before a job is complete, an HITL examines output for accuracy and cultural relevance. The LLM work started in a London office building, which was soon outgrown by the infrastructure demands of generative AI.
“It was quite cost-effective at first to buy our own hardware, which was a four-GPU cluster,” says Doniyor Ulmasov, head of engineering at Papercup. He estimates initial savings between 60% and 70% compared with cloud-based services. “But when we added another six machines, the power and cooling requirements were such that the building could not accommodate them. We had to pay for machines we could not use because we couldn’t cool them,” he recounts.
And electricity and air conditioning weren’t the only obstacles. “Server-grade equipment requires know-how for things like networking setup and remote management. We expended a lot of human resources to maintain the systems, so the savings weren’t really there,” he adds.
 
 
 













 
 

At that point, Papercup decided the cloud was needed. The company now uses Amazon Web Services, where translation and dubbing workloads for customers are handled, to be reviewed by an HITL. Simpler training workloads are still run on premises on a mixture of servers powered by Nvidia A100 Tensor Core, GeForce RTX 4090, and GeForce RTX 2080Ti hardware. More resource-intensive training is handled on a cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Building on its current services, Papercup is exploring language translation and dubbing for live sports events and movies, says Ulmasov.
For Papercup, infrastructure decisions are driven as much by geography as by technology requirements. “If we had a massive warehouse outside the [London] metro area, you could make the case [for keeping work on-premises]. But we are in the city center. I would still consider on-premises if space, power, and cooling were not issues,” says Ulmasov.
Beyond GPUs
For now, GPU-based clusters are simply faster than CPU-based configurations, and that matters. Both Etemadi and Ulmasov say using CPU-based systems would cause unacceptable delays that would keep their HITL experts waiting. But the high energy demands of the current generation of GPUs will only increase, according to IDC’s Rutten.
 
 
 













 
 

“Nvidia’s current GPU has a 700-watt power envelope, then the next one doubles that. It’s like a space heater. I don’t see how that problem gets resolved easily,” says the analyst.  
The reign of GPUs in genAI and other forms of AI could be challenged by an emerging host of AI co-processors, and eventually perhaps, by quantum computing.
“The GPU was invented for graphics processing so it’s not AI-optimized. Increasingly, we’ll see AI-specialized hardware,” predicts Claus Torp Jensen, former CIO and CTO and currently a technology advisor. Although he does not anticipate the disappearance of GPUs, he says future AI algorithms will be handled by a mix of CPUs, GPUs, and AI co-processors, both on-premises and in the cloud.
 
 
 













 
 

Another factor working against unmitigated power consumption is sustainability. Many organizations have adopted sustainability goals, which power-hungry AI algorithms make it difficult to achieve. Rutten says using SLMs, ARM-based CPUs, and cloud providers that maintain zero-emissions policies, or that run on electricity produced by renewable sources, are all worth exploring where sustainability is a priority.

For implementations that require large-scale workloads, using microprocessors built with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are a choice worth considering.
“They are much more efficient and can be more powerful. You have to hardware-code them up front and that takes time and work, but you could save significantly compared to GPUs,” says Rutten.
 
 
 













 
 

Until processors that run significantly faster while using less power and generating less heat emerge, the GPU is a stubborn fact of life for generative AI, and implementing cost-effective genAI implementations will require ingenuity and perseverance. But as Etemadi and Ulmasov demonstrate, the challenge is not beyond the reach of strategies utilizing small language models and a skillful mix of on-premises and cloud-based services.

Weak AI vs. Strong AI
When discussing artificial intelligence (AI), it is common to distinguish between two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Let's explore the characteristics of each type:

Weak AI (Narrow AI)

Weak AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks and are limited to those tasks only. These AI systems excel at their designated functions but lack general intelligence. Examples of weak AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation algorithms, and image recognition systems. Weak AI operates within predefined boundaries and cannot generalize beyond their specialized domain.

Strong AI (General AI)

Strong AI, also known as general AI, refers to AI systems that possess human-level intelligence or even surpass human intelligence across a wide range of tasks. Strong AI would be capable of understanding, reasoning, learning, and applying knowledge to solve complex problems in a manner similar to human cognition. However, the development of strong AI is still largely theoretical and has not been achieved to date.
Master Tools You Need For Becoming an AI EngineerAI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramTypes of Artificial Intelligence 
Below are the various types of AI:
1. Purely Reactive
These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win. 
2. Limited Memory
These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered.
3. Theory of Mind
This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built. 
4. Self-Aware
Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious.
Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning
Let's explore the contrast between deep learning and machine learning:
Machine Learning: 
Machine Learning focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Here are key characteristics of machine learning:
Feature Engineering: In machine learning, experts manually engineer or select relevant features from the input data to aid the algorithm in making accurate predictions.
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning: Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data with known outcomes, and unsupervised learning, where algorithms discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data.
Broad Applicability: Machine learning techniques find application across various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

How Does Artificial Intelligence Work?
Put simply, AI systems work by merging large with intelligent, iterative processing algorithms. This combination allows AI to learn from patterns and features in the analyzed data. Each time an Artificial Intelligence system performs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its performance and uses the results to develop additional expertise.
Ways of Implementing AI 
Let’s explore the following ways that explain how we can implement AI:
Machine Learning
It is machine learning that gives AI the ability to learn. This is done by using algorithms to discover patterns and generate insights from the data they are exposed to. 
Deep Learning
Deep learning, which is a subcategory of machine learning, provides AI with the ability to mimic a human brain’s neural network. It can make sense of patterns, noise, and sources of confusion in the data.
Consider an image shown below:

Here we segregated the various kinds of images using deep learning. The machine goes through various features of photographs and distinguishes them with a process called feature extraction. Based on the features of each photo, the machine segregates them into different categories, such as landscape, portrait, or others. 
Let us understand how deep learning works. 
Consider an image shown below:

The above image depicts the three main layers of a neural network:
Input Layer
Hidden Layer
Output Layer
Input Layer
The images that we want to segregate go into the input layer. Arrows are drawn from the image on to the individual dots of the input layer. Each of the white dots in the yellow layer (input layer) are a pixel in the picture. These images fill the white dots in the input layer.
We should have a clear idea of these three layers while going through this artificial intelligence tutorial.
Hidden Layer
The hidden layers are responsible for all the mathematical computations or feature extraction on our inputs. In the above image, the layers shown in orange represent the hidden layers. The lines that are seen between these layers are called ‘weights’. Each one of them usually represents a float number, or a decimal number, which is multiplied by the value in the input layer. All the weights add up in the hidden layer. The dots in the hidden layer represent a value based on the sum of the weights. These values are then passed to the next hidden layer.
You may be wondering why there are multiple layers. The hidden layers function as alternatives to some degree. The more the hidden layers are, the more complex the data that goes in and what can be produced. The accuracy of the predicted output generally depends on the number of hidden layers present and the complexity of the data going in.

Output Layer
The output layer gives us segregated photos. Once the layer adds up all these weights being fed in, it'll determine if the picture is a portrait or a landscape.
Example - Predicting Airfare Costs
This prediction is based on various factors, including:
Airline 
Origin airport 
Destination airport
Departure date
We begin with some historical data on ticket prices to train the machine. Once our machine is trained, we share new data that will predict the costs. Earlier, when we learned about four kinds of machines, we discussed machines with memory. Here, we talk about the memory only, and how it understands a pattern in the data and uses it to make predictions for the new prices as shown below:

AI Programming Cognitive Skills: Learning, Reasoning and Self-Correction
Artificial Intelligence emphasizes three cognitive skills of learning, reasoning, and self-correction, skills that the human brain possess to one degree or another. We define these in the context of AI as:
Learning: The acquisition of information and the rules needed to use that information.
Reasoning: Using the information rules to reach definite or approximate conclusions.
Self-Correction: The process of continually fine-tuning AI algorithms and ensure that they offer the most accurate results they can.
However, researchers and programmers have extended and elaborated the goals of AI to the following:

Logical Reasoning 
AI programs enable computers to perform sophisticated tasks. On February 10, 1996, IBM’s Deep Blue computer won a game of chess against a former world champion, Garry Kasparov.

Knowledge Representation
Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language that was created to underpin the “new world” of computing exemplified by “human-computer symbiosis.”

Planning and Navigation 
The process of enabling a computer to get from point A to point B. A prime example of this is Google’s self-driving Toyota Prius.


Natural Language Processing 
Set up computers that can understand and process language.

Perception 
Use computers to interact with the world through sight, hearing, touch, and smell.

Emergent Intelligence 
Intelligence that is not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the rest of the specific AI features. The vision for this goal is to have machines exhibit emotional intelligence and moral reasoning.
Some of the tasks performed by AI-enabled devices include:
Speech recognition 
Object detection
Solve problems and learn from the given data 
Plan an approach for future tests to be done

Machines today can learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and even perform human-like tasks with help from artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence examples today, from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars, are heavily based on deep learning and natural language processing. There are several examples of AI software in use in daily life, including voice assistants, face recognition for unlocking mobile phones and machine learning-based financial fraud detection. AI software is typically obtained by downloading AI-capable software from an internet marketplace, with no additional hardware required.

6. How is AI helping in our life?
AI and ML-powered software and gadgets mimic human brain processes to assist society in advancing with the digital revolution. AI systems perceive their environment, deal with what they observe, resolve difficulties, and take action to help with duties to make daily living easier. People check their social media accounts on a frequent basis, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites. AI is not only customizing your feeds behind the scenes, but it is also recognizing and deleting bogus news. So, AI is assisting you in your daily life.
7. What are the three types of AI?



The three types of AI are:
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): Also known as Weak AI, it specializes in performing specific tasks and lacks general cognitive abilities.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Refers to Strong AI capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across various domains, similar to human intelligence.
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence in all aspects, potentially capable of solving complex problems and making advancements beyond human comprehension.



8. Is AI dangerous?
Aside from planning for a future with super-intelligent computers, artificial intelligence in its current state might already offer problems.
9. What are the advantages of AI?
The advantages of AI include reducing the time it takes to complete a task, reducing the cost of previously done activities, continuously and without interruption, with no downtime, and improving the capacities of people with disabilities.
10. What are the 7 main areas of AI?



The main seven areas of AI are:
Machine Learning: Involves algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Computer Vision: Deals with giving machines the ability to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos.
Robotics: Combines AI and mechanical engineering to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks autonomously.
Expert Systems: Utilizes knowledge and reasoning to solve complex problems in specific domains, mimicking human expertise.
Speech Recognition: Involves converting spoken language into text or commands, enabling machines to interact with users through speech.
Planning and Decision Making: Focuses on algorithms that allow AI systems to make choices and optimize actions to achieve specific goals.

Answer


Is AI-generated content copyrighted?


The current legal landscape surrounding AI-generated content is murky and fraught with confusion. Here's where it currently stands and what to know before publishing.

Published: 05 Jun 2024


 
Copyright law, as it currently stands, was written at a time when humans were directly involved in fair use practices, such as citing sources and creating derivative works, which is copyrighted work that comes from other copyrighted work. However, various generative AI tools can create text, images, songs, videos and other content. New AI models can scan copyright-protected content at scale to distill an image's style, a novel's plot or a program's logic. Once trained on protected content, these AI models can generate new content different enough from the original that some might consider it fair use.







Yet, users of popular GenAI platforms can't determine how these services were trained.
""The problem with AI-generated content is that users don't know exactly where the AI is sourcing things from and which parts of the content it creates are from scratch or just pulled from another piece of copyrighted content, or even another person's AI-generated artwork on the platform,"" said Nizel Adams, CEO and principal engineer at AI consultancy Nizel Corp.
If an organization wants to incorporate AI-generated content into its marketing or content strategies, it must consider the following two questions to avoid copyright infringement.

Can AI-generated content be copyrighted?
If users of GenAI platforms don't know what content the tools were trained on, then they might hesitate to adopt these platforms in case their AI-generated content is already copyrighted and doesn't fall within fair use.

The U.S. Copyright Office has provided some guidance on this topic, but the overarching answer is that AI-generated content can sometimes be copyrighted, according to David Siegel, partner at Grellas Shah LLP. Siegel said he expects more guidance as the courts tackle the issue.
Thus far, the Copyright Office, in line with existing case law, has explained that for a work to be afforded copyright protection in the U.S., it must have a human author. Yet, Siegel said he is not sure what that means in the world of AI.
""If the only human involvement is the input of a chat prompt into ChatGPT, for example, one cannot obtain copyright protection for the raw result of that prompt,"" he said.
On the other hand, if a user inputs a prompt into an AI tool, gets a response and then modifies the result in creative ways, that can potentially result in content afforded copyright protection. However, only human-authored parts of the work can be copyrighted.
In other words, AI can be a tool authors use to generate materials and create copyrighted works. ""But that is a far cry from what most people think about when considering whether AI-generated content can be copyrighted, which is traditionally focused on copyrighting raw outputs,"" Siegel said.


What is considered copyright infringement for AI-generated content?
Users might wonder if AI-generated content trained on protected intellectual property is considered copyright infringement. This question has a murkier answer and is the subject of numerous lawsuits on images, songs and books. For example, in early 2023, TikTok, Spotify and YouTube removed an AI-generated song that mimicked the voices of rapper Drake and R&B artist The Weeknd. However, the implications for AI-generated content less similar than this example are unclear.
A copyright infringement inquiry begins with the long-established test of access and substantial similarity, according to William Scott Goldman, managing attorney and founder at Goldman Law Group. Overall, this means the case would have to prove that the AI or a human read the content and that it's similar enough to convince a jury it was copied.
""Although there is no established case law for generative AI just yet, I believe without clear-cut proof of access, such infringement claims will fail unless the copying in question is deemed identical to the original,"" Goldman said.
However, Goldman also said he believes copyright owners and plaintiffs could assert unauthorized use, especially if this use is not considered de minimis -- too small to be considered meaningful -- and the resulting work is substantially similar to the original.
Once both issues have been demonstrated, the case would turn on a fair use defense. GenAI could be considered a derivative work under existing copyright law if it contains sufficient original authorship, Goldman said.
Courts now grapple with whether AI-generated content sufficiently differs enough from the originals under existing fair use precedents.





Lawsuits over AI-generated content
Various lawsuits regarding AI-generated content and GenAI tools have started to make their way through the courts -- both related and unrelated to copyright.
In November 2022, programmers filed a class-action lawsuit against GitHub, Microsoft and OpenAI focusing on breach of contract and privacy claims. In January 2023, the same law firm also filed a class-action lawsuit related to AI-generated image services, such as Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DreamUp, which raises copyright infringement issues.
A few days later, Getty Images also filed a lawsuit relating to Stable Diffusion, arguing the service had ""copied more than 12 million photographs from Getty Images' collection, along with the associated captions and metadata, without permission from or compensation to Getty Images,"" according to the lawsuit. In July 2023, Sarah Silverman and other authors sued OpenAI and Meta, claiming the GenAI training process infringed on the copyright protection of their works.
These lawsuits differ in important ways, according to Siegel. Stability AI allegedly uses images from the web to train its models. As a result, Getty's customers arguably have less need to license more images from Getty. This gets at the heart of copyright law, which is to incentivize people to develop creative works. Photographers and artists might be less willing to spend time and resources developing photos and images if those are used to train AI to replace them.
""If you are a photographer, would you be willing to spend your time and resources creating photos if those photos were going to be used to train an AI model, without compensation or permission, and potential licensees of your images could simply go to the AI model instead? Doubtful,"" Siegel said.
The Silverman case against OpenAI and Meta centers around the ability to provide summaries of books without permission to create derivative works from the authors. Siegel said this case differs from the Getty Images one because its use is similar to CliffsNotes, which is considered fine because people can still buy the book to get the full story.


To use or not to use?
In his May 2024 article ""AI lawsuits explained: Who's getting sued?,"" TechTarget Site Editor Ben Lutkevich noted that settling cases involving the use of AI will help answer the following questions:

Do you need a license to train a GenAI model on copyrighted material?
Does AI-generated content infringe on the copyright of the materials used to train the model?
Does GenAI violate controls regarding removal or alteration of copyright information?
Is work generated by AI in the style of someone else a violation of that person's rights?
What are the ramifications of using open source licenses to train AI models?

Read Lutkevich's full article about copyright lawsuits brought against GenAI companies.




How will AI change copyright laws?
The short-term future of AI-generated content copyright will likely aim to clarify existing concepts, such as fair use and authorship for the AI age. Most AI companies rely on fair use to justify how they train their models, but it presents a gray area, Siegel said.
""To the extent the U.S. wants to foster the development of AI businesses, the laws around the use of copyrighted works in training AI models need to be sufficiently clear that even an early-stage startup can predictably determine whether their business model will run afoul of copyright laws. We are not even close to that point,"" Siegel said.
Overall, AI is changing copyright law. It is causing the legal system to define what constitutes authorship and how to protect human-generated content even if it contains AI-generated content, said Robert Scott, managing partner and Scott & Scott LLP.
In the U.S., the Copyright Office guidance states that works containing AI-generated content are not copyrightable without evidence that a human author contributed creatively. New laws can help clarify the level of human contribution needed to protect works containing AI-generated content.

  Weather forecasters in Taiwan had their hair blown back when they saw a typhoon up close, created on a computer that slashed the time and energy needed for the job.
It’s a reaction that users in many fields are feeling as generative AI shows them how new levels of performance contribute to reductions in total cost of ownership.
Inside the AI of the Storm
Tracking a typhoon provided a great test case of generative AI’s prowess. The work traditionally begins with clusters of CPUs cranking on complex algorithms to create atmospheric models with a 25-kilometer resolution.
Enter CorrDiff, a generative AI model that’s part of NVIDIA Earth-2, a set of services and software for weather and climate research.
Using a class of diffusion models that power today’s text-to-image services, CorrDiff resolved the 25-km models to two kilometers 1,000x faster, using 3,000x less energy for a single inference than traditional methods.
CorrDiff Cuts Costs 50x, Energy Use 25x
CorrDiff shines on the NVIDIA AI platform, even when retraining the model once a year and using statistical groups of a thousand forecasts to boost the accuracy of predictions. Compared to traditional methods under these conditions, it slashes cost by 50x cost and energy use by 25x a year.
That means work that used to require nearly $3 million for a cluster of CPUs and the energy to run them can be done for about $60,000 on a single system with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. It’s a massive reduction that shows how generative AI and accelerated computing increases energy efficiency and lowers total cost of ownership.
The technology also helps forecasters see more precisely where a typhoon will land, potentially saving lives.
“NVIDIA’s CorrDiff generative AI model opens the door to the use of AI-generated kilometer-scale weather forecasts, enabling Taiwan to prepare better for typhoons,” said Hongey Chen, a director of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction.
The Taiwan forecasters could save nearly a gigawatt-hour a year, using CorrDiff. Energy savings could balloon if the nearly 200 regional weather data centers around the world adopt the technology for more sustainable computing.
Companies that sell commercial forecasts are also adopting CorrDiff, attracted by its speed and savings.
Broad Horizons for Energy Efficiency
NVIDIA Earth-2 takes these capabilities to a planetary scale. It fuses AI, physics simulations and observed data to help countries and companies respond to global issues like climate change. That will help address the impacts of climate change, which is expected to cost a million lives and $1.7 trillion per year by 2050.
Accelerated computing and generative AI are bringing new levels of performance and energy efficiency to many applications. Explainers on green computing and why GPUs are great for AI provide more context and some examples.
Compare the costs and energy consumption of popular workloads running on an x86 CPU-based server versus an NVIDIA GPU server with this simple calculator. And watch Huang’s keynote address at COMPUTEX to get the big picture.

Asana is developing an AI “teammate” feature that embeds generative AI (genAI) into the flow of work for users of its work management app. The teammates — created using “trigger and action” format in Asana’s existing workflow automation tools — can perform tasks such as carrying out research and interact with co-workers to help coordinate work.
The new feature accesses information on the Asana work graph —  data on the work a team does, and the people doing the work — and relies on large language models [LLMs] from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI. 
“When people think about working with AI like working with the teammate, they get better value out of it, because they’re better able to give it instructions, give it feedback, and effectively partner with it,” said Paige Costello, head of AI at Asana.
 
 
 













 
 

There are a variety of ways to customize a teammate, said Costello. One example (from a customer testing the feature) involves the work request process for a design team. Here, a “request triage” assistant can check an incoming work request form to determine whether it contains sufficient detail about the scope of the request. If not, the AI assistant sends a message back offering suggestions for more information to include.

That process can save back-and-forth messages between coworkers trying to get the correct information, Paige said.
Another customer — a marketing firm — set up an AI teammate to conduct research around clients. In that case, the teammate can generate a first draft brief with information on clients’ previous brand campaigns and what they’re known for.
 
 
 













 
 

The Asana app already has workflow automation tools, but the addition of LLMs allows for more powerful automations. “What’s really exciting about embedding LLMs into work management is that there’s judgement, there’s nuance,” said Costello.  “Instead of it being a black and white rule — ‘if these things are missing, ask this’ — it’s directional, like, ‘here’s what we typically look for; use your judgment.’”
That said, given the unreliability of LLMs, there’s potential for the teammates to introduce errors into the work management process. 
Costello said it’s important to have a “human in the loop,” when the AI assistant takes action. “We want to make sure that humans are the ultimate deciders,” she said. “They’re the ones that are accountable, they’re the ones completing the work: AI is just helping. AI shouldn’t be moving work forward in a way that is not permissioned effectively by the team or the person driving that work.”
 
 
 













 
 

The AI teammate feature could potentially be accessed by a broad range of Asana users, said Chris Marsh, research director at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“I believe the AI teammate is designed to appeal in a general sense, in that the aim is to have the teammate enhance general team workflows,” he said, noting it could improve withaccess to more data in Asana’s work graph over time. 
“It’ll inevitably be a work in progress in terms of how helpful it is from the launch, but what it does represent is AI being applied to the next tranche of use cases in work management,” Marsh said.
 
 
 













 
 

He expects “market interest” in the capabilities of a tool such as Asana’s AI teammate. 
A recent 451 Research survey indicated that 44% of employees see “low or no impact” of AI on their workforce tools. Only 24% said AI has had a moderate impact. But when survey participants were asked about the types of technologies that could enhance how they work, the popular response was an “an AI assistant that can help with automating basic tasks and more strategic kinds of work design,” said Marsh. 
“So, few are seeing AI’s impact so far, but a lot want to see it and want to see it in the form of an AI assistant to do the kinds of things Asana’s AI teammate is focused on doing,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

The AI teammate feature is currently in beta trial with select customers. Asana is evaluating different pricing models with more specifics available closer to a general availability launch. 
No launch date has yet been set.

Compare human intelligence vs artificial intelligence and explore their impact on the future of work and society.,https://schema.org,,,," From the realm of science fiction into the realm of everyday life, artificial intelligence has made significant strides. Because AI has become so pervasive in today's industries and people's daily lives, a new debate has emerged, pitting the two competing paradigms of AI and human intelligence. 
While the goal of artificial intelligence is to build and create intelligent systems that are capable of doing jobs that are analogous to those performed by humans, we can't help but question if AI is adequate on its own. This article covers a wide range of subjects, including the potential impact of AI on the future of work and the economy, how AI differs from human intelligence, and the ethical considerations that must be taken into account.
What Is Artificial Intelligence?
The term artificial intelligence may be used for any computer that has characteristics similar to the human brain, including the ability to think critically, make decisions, and increase productivity. The foundation of AI is human insights that may be determined in such a manner that machines can easily realize the jobs, from the most simple to the most complicated. 
Insights that are synthesized are the result of intellectual activity, including study, analysis, logic, and observation. Tasks, including robotics, control mechanisms, computer vision, scheduling, and data mining, fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.
What Is Human Intelligence?
The origins of human intelligence and conduct may be traced back to the individual's unique combination of genetics, upbringing, and exposure to various situations and environments. And it hinges entirely on one's freedom to shape his or her environment via the application of newly acquired information.
The information it provides is varied. For example, it may provide information on a person with a similar skill set or background, or it may reveal diplomatic information that a locator or spy was tasked with obtaining. After everything is said and done, it is able to deliver information about interpersonal relationships and the arrangement of interests.
Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence: A Comparison
The following is a table that compares human intelligence vs artificial intelligence:

Parameters


Human Intelligence


Artificial Intelligence 


Evolution


The cognitive abilities to think, reason, evaluate, and so on are built into human beings by their very nature.


Norbert Wiener, who hypothesized critique mechanisms, is credited with making a significant early contribution to the development of artificial intelligence (AI).


Essence


The purpose of human intelligence is to combine a range of cognitive activities in order to adapt to new circumstances.


The goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to create computers that are able to behave like humans and complete jobs that humans would normally do.


Functionality


People make use of the memory, processing capabilities, and cognitive talents that their brains provide.


The processing of data and commands is essential to the operation of AI-powered devices.


Pace of operation


When it comes to speed, humans are no match for artificial intelligence or robots.


Computers have the ability to process far more information at a higher pace than individuals do. In the instance that the human mind can answer a mathematical problem in five minutes, artificial intelligence is capable of solving ten problems in one minute.


Learning ability


The basis of human intellect is acquired via the process of learning through a variety of experiences and situations.


Due to the fact that robots are unable to think in an abstract manner or make conclusions based on the experiences of the past. They are only capable of acquiring knowledge via exposure to material and consistent practice, although they will never create a cognitive process that is unique to humans.


Choice Making


It is possible for subjective factors that are not only based on numbers to influence the decisions that humans make.


Because it evaluates based on the entirety of the acquired facts, AI is exceptionally objective when it comes to making decisions.


Perfection


When it comes to human insights, there is almost always the possibility of ""human mistake,"" which refers to the fact that some nuances may be overlooked at some time or another.


The fact that AI's capabilities are built on a collection of guidelines that may be updated allows it to deliver accurate results regularly.


Adjustments 


The human mind is capable of adjusting its perspectives in response to the changing conditions of its surroundings. Because of this, people are able to remember information and excel in a variety of activities.


It takes artificial intelligence a lot more time to adapt to unneeded changes.


Flexibility


The ability to exercise sound judgment is essential to multitasking, as shown by juggling a variety of jobs at once.


In the same way that a framework may learn tasks one at a time, artificial intelligence is only able to accomplish a fraction of the tasks at the same time.


Social Networking


Humans are superior to other social animals in terms of their ability to assimilate theoretical facts, their level of self-awareness, and their sensitivity to the emotions of others. This is because people are social creatures.


Artificial intelligence has not yet mastered the ability to pick up on associated social and enthusiastic indicators.


Operation


It might be described as inventive or creative.


It improves the overall performance of the system. It is impossible for it to be creative or inventive since robots cannot think in the same way that people can.

What Brian Cells Can Be Tweaked to Learn Faster?
According to the findings of recent research, altering the electrical characteristics of certain cells in simulations of neural circuits caused the networks to acquire new information more quickly than in simulations with cells that were identical. They also discovered that in order for the networks to achieve the same outcomes, a smaller number of the modified cells were necessary and that the approach consumed fewer resources than models that utilized identical cells.
These results not only shed light on how human brains excel at learning but may also help us develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems, such as speech and facial recognition software for digital assistants and autonomous vehicle navigation systems.
The researchers focused on adjusting the ""time constant,"" or the pace at which one cell makes a decision about its own fate based on the actions of its associated cells. Some cells make decisions rapidly, while others take longer to respond and base their choice on the actions of nearby cells.Become a AI & Machine Learning Professional$267 billionExpected Global AI Market Value By 202737.3%Projected CAGR Of The Global AI Market From 2023-2030$15.7 trillionExpected Total Contribution Of AI To The Global Economy By 2030Artificial Intelligence EngineerIndustry-recognized AI Engineer Master’s certificate from SimplilearnDedicated live sessions by faculty of industry experts11 Months monthsView ProgramPost Graduate Program in AI and Machine LearningProgram completion certificate from Purdue University and SimplilearnGain exposure to ChatGPT, OpenAI, Dall-E, Midjourney & other prominent tools11 Months monthsView ProgramprevNextHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:Indrakala Nigam BeniwalTechnical Consultant, Land Transport Authority (LTA) SingaporeI completed a Master's Program in Artificial Intelligence Engineer with flying colors from Simplilearn.

Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence: What Will the Future of Human vs AI Be?
The capabilities of AI are constantly expanding. It takes a significant amount of time to develop AI systems, which is something that cannot happen in the absence of human intervention. All forms of artificial intelligence, including self-driving vehicles and robotics, as well as more complex technologies like computer vision, and natural language processing, are dependent on human intellect.
Impact of AI on the Future of Jobs
1. Automation of Tasks
The most noticeable effect of AI has been the result of the digitalization and automation of formerly manual processes across a wide range of industries. These tasks, which were formerly performed manually, are now performed digitally. Currently, tasks or occupations that involve some degree of repetition or the use and interpretation of large amounts of data are communicated to and administered by a computer, and in certain cases, the intervention of humans is not required in order to complete these tasks or jobs.
2. New Opportunities
Artificial intelligence is creating new opportunities for the workforce by automating formerly human-intensive tasks. The rapid development of technology has resulted in the emergence of new fields of study and work, such as digital engineering. Therefore, although traditional manual labor jobs may go extinct, new opportunities and careers will emerge.
3. Economic Growth Model
When it's put to good use, rather than just for the sake of progress, AI has the potential to increase productivity and collaboration inside a company by opening up vast new avenues for growth. As a result, it may spur an increase in demand for goods and services, and power an economic growth model that spreads prosperity and raises standards of living.
4. Role of Work
In the era of AI, recognizing the potential of employment beyond just maintaining a standard of living is much more important. It conveys an understanding of the essential human need for involvement, co-creation, dedication, and a sense of being needed, and should therefore not be overlooked. So, sometimes, even mundane tasks at work become meaningful and advantageous, and if the task is eliminated or automated, it should be replaced with something that provides a comparable opportunity for human expression and disclosure.
5. Growth of Creativity and Innovation
Experts now have more time to focus on analyzing, delivering new and original solutions, and other operations that are firmly in the area of the human intellect, while robotics, AI, and industrial automation handle some of the mundane and physical duties formerly performed by humans.
Will AI Replace Humans?
While AI has the potential to automate specific tasks and jobs, it is likely to replace humans in some areas. AI is best suited for handling repetitive, data-driven tasks and making data-driven decisions. However, human skills such as creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving still need to be more valuable and easily replicated by AI.
The future of AI is more likely to involve collaboration between humans and machines, where AI augments human capabilities and enables humans to focus on higher-level tasks that require human ingenuity and expertise. It is essential to view AI as a tool that can enhance productivity and facilitate new possibilities rather than as a complete substitute for human involvement.

The Department of Energy’s national labs have an especially critical role to play in the advancement of artificial intelligence systems and research into the technology, a top federal official said Tuesday during a Joint Economic Committee hearing on AI and economic growth.
Jennifer Gaudioso, director of the Sandia National Laboratory’s Center for Computing Research, emphasized during her testimony the role that DOE’s national labs could have in both accelerating computing capacity and helping support advances in AI technology. She pointed to her own lab’s work in securing the U.S. nuclear arsenal — and the national labs’ historical role in promoting high-performance computing. 
“Doing AI at the frontier and at scale is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and solving complex global challenges,“ Gaudioso said. “Breakthroughs in one area beget discoveries in others.”
Gaudioso also noted the importance of building AI systems based on more advanced data than the internet-based sources used to build systems like ChatGPT. That includes government datasets, she added.

“What I get really excited about is the transformative potential of training models on science data,” she said. “We can then do new manufacturing. We can make digital twins of the human body to take drug discovery from decades down to months. Maybe 100 days for the next vaccine.” 
The national labs’ current work on artificial intelligence includes AI and nuclear deterrence, national security, non-proliferation, and advanced science and technology, Gaudioso shared. She also referenced the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security and Technology — a DOE effort focused on using supercomputing for AI. The FASST initiative was announced last month. 
Last November, FedScoop reported on how the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee was preparing its supercomputing resources — including the world’s fastest supercomputer, Frontier — for AI work. 
Tuesday’s hearing follows the White House’s continued promotion of new AI-focused policies, and as Congress mulls legislation focused on both regulating and incubating artificial intelligence

Published on 3 June 2024








After capturing the public’s imagination in 2022, generative Artificial Intelligence (gen AI) began to permeate the business landscape in 2023. 2024 remains a crucial year for the future of AI, with researchers and organisations pushing the boundaries by developing new algorithms and models to tackle increasingly complex tasks.
A recent IBM report found that three out of four (75%) global CEOs believe that the organisation with the most advanced gen AI will have the ultimate advantage. Moreover, 43% of CEOs said they will use gen AI to inform strategic decisions. Companies worldwide are recognising the benefits of gen AI and its crucial role in their success. This is driving a new era of work, productivity and opportunities across industries. AI is projected to enhance human productivity and unlock an astounding $16-trillion in value by 2030. In perspective, the fifth largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was about $3.7-trillion. When combined with automation technology, gen AI can help clients improve interactions with customers and partners, as well as boost operational efficiency and productivity. 
Slow but steady AI adoption in Africa
This is not just a global phenomenon; half of the African CEOs surveyed in our IBM report expect to realise significant value from advanced AI and analytics. However, adopting AI is not without its obstacles. Many businesses on the continent and beyond are grappling with a multitude of challenges. Globally, 82% of IT professionals say IT complexity is impeding success in deploying AI, while 55% of business leaders lack key information regarding their technology spending decisions. In Africa, many organisations face barriers such as costs, market and regulatory factors, workforce readiness, infrastructure, skills gap, ethics and governance.


Saad Toma, General Manager, IBM Middle East & Africa
Become an AI-first organisation to stay ahead
To overcome these challenges, organisations must move to an AI-first approach, where AI is integrated into their business strategy across the lifecycle. Being AI-first enables businesses to be value-creators rather than solely value users. Companies that will lead their respective industries for the next decade or two will be the ones that decide to be AI-first. That is why we launched watsonx in 2023 to develop trusted AI and drive innovation for organisations in every sector or industry. Building an open-source AI community is a core part of our AI strategy. At our recent THINK conference, we further enhanced watsonx’s data and automation capabilities to make it more open, cost-effective, and flexible for businesses.  We achieved this by releasing a family of IBM Granite code models to the open-source community. We launched InstructLab with Red Hat, to enhance large language models and open the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute. We also announced IBM Concert that uses AI-powered automation to help businesses to discover gaps, prioritise insights, reduce complexity and streamline operations for more innovation and cost-effectiveness.
Putting IBM AI solutions and watsonx to work across industries
Since the launch of watsonx, we have over 700 client pilots running and managing over 1,200 AI models globally. We have also increased the accessibility of watsonx by making it available on AWS Marketplace, reaching 92 countries worldwide, including 18 in Africa. To name a few examples, we are leveraging watsonx’s geospatial foundation model built from NASA’s satellite data to ensure climate resilience with the Government of Kenya. watsonx is enabling local scientists to track and visualise tree-planting activities to assist the government’s goal of planting 15-billion trees by 2032. Working with Neostream Technology, an IBM business partner based in Kenya, we successfully deployed and integrated IBM Instana with M-GAS – a premium provider of liquefied petroleum gas in the country. The deployment of Instana has provided real-time monitoring and visibility. This has empowered M-GAS to track critical business applications with granular application-level insights. This has empowered M-GAS to address issues across all layers of their technology stack that previously could not be delivered by traditional monitoring tools. Lastly, Instana’s intuitive interfaces and customizable dashboards have offered rapid issue identification and resolution, fostering team collaboration, minimising downtime, and enabling M-GAS to intervene proactively to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to their customers.
In the Middle East, we partnered with the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority to launch an open-source Arabic Large Language Model, ALLaM on watsonx.  This has enabled the deployment of Arabic gen AI models, which opens the possibility of building AI models for Africa using the continent’s rich and diverse languages. Globally, working with Transport for London, we deployed IBM Maximo to assist in managing the day-to-day maintenance efforts for more than 10,000 internal technicians within the London Underground. Above ground, the software enables the tracking, support and oversight of numerous contractors – helping extend existing equipment’s life and keeping commuters happy.
Across the world, organisations are leveraging IBM’s AI business solutions to solve business challenges. Their use cases range from banking and financial services, energy, telecommunications, climate change and sustainability, customer services and entertainment to name a few.
The right partnerships and governance are key
The adoption of gen AI is accelerating across enterprises as organisations aim to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities. To achieve this, organisations need to have a robust AI strategy and the right level of investment. They also need to establish and implement clear and consistent standards or guardrails concerning the utilisation of AI across all strategic focus areas. Most importantly, they need the right partner who understands the overall business objective and how to overcome barriers preventing AI adoption. Such collaborative partnerships are critical for developing robust data and AI strategies, filling the skills gaps, and guiding the organisational change necessary for successful AI adoption.

According to research that was conducted by McKinsey, as a result of artificial intelligence, approximately 12 million people will have to change their job market by 2030, which is comparable to the employment shifts that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings were disclosed by Kweilin Ellingrud, a senior partner at McKinsey and the head of its Global Institute, during its meeting with the media.There are assumptions that some industries, such as health care and STEM subjects, may increase their share due to AI sector development. Yet, the bulk of employment changes are expected to fall into four primary areas: administrative support, customer service and sales, food service, and production and manufacturing..Ellingrud pointed out that numerous positions in these areas are repetitive, involve gathering data, and require simple data analysis. These tasks are ideal for automation, a capability that AI excels at. A McKinsey study, co-written by Ellingrud, suggests that around 11.8 million employees in jobs facing a decline in demand will have to switch to new occupations by 2030.Despite these significant shifts, the report, as reported by Business Insider, emphasizes that every employee should get ready for some form of adjustment. The broad implementation of generative AI and conventional automation systems is expected to affect approximately 30% of duties in numerous existing roles. This implies that almost everyone will have to modify their work methods to fit the new technologies.&nbsp;.Ellingrud underscored the importance of employees taking the initiative to adapt to these shifts. ""It's essential for individuals to keep abreast of the changing employment environment and acquire skills that are less likely to be automated,"" she mentioned. This involves concentrating on sectors where analytical thinking, human ingenuity, and emotional understanding are qualities that machines cannot replicate.The study further shows that employment is poised to witness drastic change by 2030 through the influence of AI, such that millions will need to change their careers. Some professions, such as those in the fields of healthcare, and especially STEM, are expected to increase in demand, but countless mere clerical roles are expected to be replaced by robots in the near future.

Over 18 million people in the UK have now used Generative AI (GenAI), according to new findings from Deloitte’s 2024 Digital Consumer Trends research, based on a survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75.
In the UK, three in five (60%) people are now aware of GenAI and over a third (36%) have used a GenAI tool, an increase of 26% (13 million people) from May 2023. However, notable gender and age gaps were apparent in the findings with 43% of men having used GenAI, compared to just 28% of women. The technology is also primarily used by younger groups, with 62% of people aged 16-34 having actively used it, compared to only 14% of 55-75 year olds.Related Company ProfilesDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu LtdView all
GenAI in the workplace
One in seven people (14%) have used GenAI for work, equating to around seven million people, increasing from four million a year ago. Of those using GenAI for work, three in four (74%) claim a productivity boost of either ‘a fair amount’ or ‘a great deal’. However, just 27% of those in work claim that their employer encourages the use of GenAI, suggesting that the majority work may be doing so without their employer’s official endorsement.
Among those who have used GenAI for work, the most popular reasons are generating ideas (44%) and looking up information (41%), followed by creating written content (39%), writing/editing emails (38%), and summarising text (37%).
Commenting on this, Deloitte partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research, Paul Lee, said: “Employees are moving faster than their employers when it comes to adopting GenAI to transform how they work. While workers are signalling that GenAI can boost their output and save them time, many employees may not be supported, encouraged, or explicitly endorsed to use the technology by their organisation.

“While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology. Additionally, usage has to thrive among all types of employees, not just certain demographics, if the tools are to be most effective.”

Over 18 million people in the UK have now used Generative AI, according to new findings from Deloitte’s 2024 Digital Consumer Trends research, based on a survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75.

</div>
In the UK, three in five (60%) people are now aware of GenAI and over a third (36%) have used a GenAI tool, an increase of 26% (13 million people) from May 2023. However, notable gender and age gaps were apparent in the findings with 43% of men having used GenAI, compared to just 28% of women. The technology is also primarily used by younger groups, with 62% of people aged 16-34 having actively used it, compared to only 14% of 55-75 year olds.
<h4>GenAI in the workplace</h4>
One in seven people (14%) have used GenAI for work, equating to around seven million people, increasing from four million a year ago. Of those using GenAI for work, three in four (74%) claim a productivity boost of either ‘a fair amount’ or ‘a great deal’. However, just 27% of those in work claim that their employer encourages the use of GenAI, suggesting that the majority work may be doing so without their employer’s official endorsement.

Among those who have used GenAI for work, the most popular reasons are generating ideas (44%) and looking up information (41%), followed by creating written content (39%), writing/editing emails (38%), and summarising text (37%).

Paul Lee, partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Deloitte, commented: “Employees are moving faster than their employers when it comes to adopting GenAI to transform how they work. While workers are signalling that GenAI can boost their output and save them time, many employees may not be supported, encouraged, or explicitly endorsed to use the technology by their organisation.

“While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology. Additionally, usage has to thrive among all types of employees, not just certain demographics, if the tools are to be most effective.”
<h4>Improving AI fluency is vital for businesses</h4>
The survey also demonstrates that the frequency of use of GenAI is variable. Amongst those using the technology, one in three (36%) do so either daily or weekly, whereas two in five (41%) use it less than monthly. Of these low-frequency users, 23% did not find it helpful, 19% were not satisfied with its answers and 18% claimed they did not know how to use it well.

Meanwhile, many of those aware of GenAI are not familiar with its risks, including potential inaccuracies and biases. Among those aware of GenAI, 25% believe it is always factually accurate, and 26% think it is unbiased. Those who have used GenAI are even more likely to be unaware of risks, as 36% of users believe it is always accurate, and 36% think it is unbiased.

However, among those aware of GenAI, more than half (59%) would be less inclined to trust an email if they knew it was created with GenAI. Similarly, 56% would be less inclined to use a customer service if they knew they were conversing with a GenAI assistant.

Costi Perricos, partner and global Generative AI lead at Deloitte, said: “Whether organisations have supportive or strict policies on the use of Generative AI, it is clear that improving business AI fluency is vital. GenAI deployment should be accompanied by a thorough learning and development programme, including training on ethics and responsible use, and guidance on how to get the most value from GenAI tools. HR leaders have a key role to play, creating a clear framework in which their workforce can operate.”

Lee concluded: “In 2024, companies ought to be asking what they should do with GenAI, rather than focusing purely on everything it could do. The C-suite is increasingly looking for proof of return on investment in technologies before funding large scale deployment across their workforce. However, there are barriers to this, as quantifying employee productivity can be difficult, particularly in knowledge-based roles.

“Businesses are also exploring customer facing GenAI tools but should be aware that they may face some initial hesitance as fluency improves. Customers may be more welcoming of GenAI if they can be convinced that it enables a better, faster experience, with higher quality answers. Business leaders must fund and drive this education.”

At Think 2024, some the latest breakthroughs were on display.IBM is working on a range of generative AI technologies meant to make work simpler and more efficient. At Think 2024, some the latest breakthroughs were on display.Consider the telephone. At one time, to call someone, you had to talk to an operator to place your call; then the rotary phone connected you directly. Eventually push-button phones automated the dialing, and now, we can even ask a virtual assistant to call someone without even looking at the phone.Throughout history, humans have created machines to find simpler, faster, and safer ways to do things. As computers have become more powerful over the decades, we’ve been able to use them to automate increasingly complex tasks. It’s led to the birth of entire new fields marrying automation and business needs. But with the advent of generative AI, we're on the cusp of another revolution that has the potential to radically alter the way we work.We’ve already started to see the promise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), and IBM has been working on a myriad of methods, models, and projects to automate every aspect of business, from front-office processes (like customer service and sales engagement), to back-office process (such as HR or procurement) and physical infrastructure, like manufacturing plants. Each of these areas can be improved by a range of generative AI language and code technologies, spanning a breadth of technical domains. This includes breakthroughs in content extraction, code generation, retrieval-augmented generation (or RAG), summarization, multi-turn conversational AI, APIs, planning, and more. These features are all powered by IBM’s Granite language and code models, which were unveiled in detail at this year’s Think conference.Teams across IBM are using these emerging tools to build systems that save businesses time, money, and heaps of stress.Reimagining how the world codesDiagnosing and addressing IT issues as they happenThe future of manufacturing Automating away time-consuming work Reimagining how the world codesToday, developers are only as good as the time they have — and the information at their fingertips. They spend countless hours hunting around the web for bug fix solutions, or snippets of code that solve the problem they’re working on.This month, IBM also open-sourced its state-of-the-art Granite code models. Available to anyone, they stand up to any comparable model for tasks like fixing code, explanations, or translating code between languages. For the team at IBM Research, these models are a step towards ensuring that anyone’s legacy systems can be supported, as well as tomorrow’s — after all, today’s modern applications will be legacy software in the future.At Think this year, IBM announced watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. This new assistant can summarize existing Java code, make recommendations and execute code upgrades, detail code changes, and even generate unit tests. IBM automated test generator framework increases testing coverage by up to about 50%, spanning a range of benchmarks (including code class, method, branch, and line coverage) for IBM Granite and other models. The generated tests are in comprehensible natural language and are easy for developers to maintain.Most of the modern web is built on languages like Java and Python, incompatible with languages like COBOL, which most developers no longer learn. Web apps on the cloud are more flexible and scalable, but traditional structures like mainframes help companies keep data secure on their premises. While many automated systems that allow mainframes to work with cloud services exist, setting them up and maintaining them can be arduous.This is why IBM released new capabilities for watsonx Code Assistant for Z at Think. These include new abilities to explain COBOL code and translate it into Java on clients’ premises with code that is 95% parseable by z/OS COBOL benchmark test. Similarly, new capabilities were released for watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed entailing interactive playbook generation and explanation, achieving a 20% quality improvement in generated playbooks. Citibank is using watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and Broadridge Solutions is using watsonx Code Assistant for Z.Diagnosing and addressing IT issues as they happenIt’s not just code that’s being automated — it’s the way the entire web runs. As the cloud has matured into the always-on, infinitely capable computing system that underpins the way the world runs, it has required legions of IT professionals to ensure that sites and servers are as reliable as possible.Site reliability engineers (or SREs) are the people responsible for the health of those systems. They are often overwhelmed as they try to manage the issues with massively complex systems that companies expect to be working at least 99.9999% of the time. Everything from servers to end-user computers, and cloud networking infrastructure — it’s a Herculean task to keep it all running, let alone figure out when small discrepancies are about to turn into major problems. To even log all the information on the health of every part of a system creates a deluge of information that’s nearly impossible for anyone to sift through. Part of the focus of IBM Research’s work in IT operations (or ITOps, as it’s often called) has been creating tools to automate the collection and analyzing of IT health data for engineers to be able to find problems and work on ways to fix them. Whether that’s a cluster of users experiencing latency issues, or a server with less-than-ideal uptime, the engineer needs as much information on the situation as possible before offering a diagnosis.IBM is also bringing AI and generative updates to its IT automation portfolio, including intelligent remediation for Instana, GPU optimization for Turbonomic, and cloud cost management tools (often called FinOps) for Turbonomic and Apptio. The Instana updates include generative AI technologies that can summarize IT issues, figure out a probable cause, and recommend actions to take — along with the actual code changes to implement.The trace-based reinforcement learning technique applied for probable cause analysis increases the true positive rate by a factor of 1.6 and reduces the false positive rate by a factor of 200 when compared to conventional application performance monitoring tools. Some of these technologies have been implemented in Red Hat’s support business and to date, have resulted in more than 2,500 deflected calls per year. IBM Research is also working with several companies to turn these concepts into working solutions for their systems. Beyond major incidents, there’s also the potential for AI systems to help monitor resource allocations using Turbonomic — IBM has started testing how GPUs are apportioned on its own systems, and for the cluster that works to train our own AI models, the amount of spare GPU capacity at any given moment shot up by a factor of five. The future of manufacturing Beyond the world of IT, AI is upending how we build and supply everything. Humanity moved from the steam engine to the factory line, through to programmable machines, and now AI. With each revolution, production improved dramatically, as businesses were able to be more cost effective, scale more easily, and produce their goods more efficiently. AI has the potential to automate even more.The fundamental underpinning of plant operations (often referred to as Asset Ops) is how work orders are managed. It’s a key part of IBM’s Maximo Application Suite. At Think this year, IBM introduced automated work order intelligence for Maximo, underpinned by IBM’s Granite model. This includes the ability to predict work order failure codes, using models to generate synthetic data. IBM is also using this software on its own sites and expects to save some 10,000 hours of productivity each year. When it comes to managing plants, businesses today are limited by the information they have access to. But with generative AI, the amount of information that can be taken into consideration, and the sorts of insights that can be gleaned from it, is set to explode.IBM’s open source Granite time-series models are a major step in this direction. The tiny time mixer (TTM) model in particular, based on an encoder-decoder architecture, significantly outperforms other models for forecasting tasks, with a 3% to 40% accuracy improvement (as measured by mean square error) over other state of the art models — even though the models are considerably smaller than others (1 million parameters, compared to 2.4 million to 311 million). Additionally, TTM can enable better continuous monitoring of assets and processes for anomalies — with significantly fewer false positives. Models of this nature, in tandem with automated work order intelligence, will allow enterprises to take a bold step towards closed loop automation for physical systems. Automating away time-consuming work Saving time and making processes simpler isn’t just for industrial applications. The struggles of a modern office worker are often bound up in simple, but necessary, tasks that just waste a lot of time. Everyone has filled their time with things like filling out forms, copying information, moving files from one place to another — things that over time, build up to be a sizable chunk of one’s day. Over the years, tools that make common business processes easier through automation started to spring up. IBM’s own Orchestrate product came out of years of research into automated software and can now make tasks of varying complexity extremely easy — from repeatedly adding rows to tables, to things like generating an expense report or creating a job requisition. But even with all these capabilities, generative AI offers the potential to make these sorts of business process automations more flexible and catered to specific users incorporating pertinent technology in the automation build and conversational AI spaces.  At Think, IBM unveiled watsonx Orchestrate Assistant Builder, which helps businesses build assistants composed of underlying skills that fit the exact tasks they need completed, whether that’s in human resources, sales, procurement, or anywhere else. These skills and underpinning open API specifications can be quickly built, enhanced, and validated, transforming the build experience.Many of the automation examples above rely on predefined tasks and workflows, but IBM Research is also building generative interfaces for automation tasks that users want to create on the fly. They could write in plain English what they need done — rather than clicking away on pages looking for the specific tasks they’re after.These systems can invoke APIs, sequence multiple APIs, query databases with natural language, and summarize retrieved content, just using IBM’s Granite LLM. We expect technology like this to build on some of the early success already experienced with watsonx Orchestrate by the likes of Sports Clips who have witnessed several orders of magnitude reduction in time to execute HR tasks — from hours to minutes.This is where the industry is heading. The closer we can get to having simple conversations with the software and machines that we use to complete our work every day, the faster we can get more done.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate04 Jun 2024AuthorsMike MurphyTopicsAIGraniteShareWhat’s an LLM context window and why is it getting larger?NewsKim Martineau24 Jul 2024AIAI for CodeGenerative AIGraniteNatural Language ProcessingOpen SourceMeet AI-Hilbert, a new algorithm for transforming scientific discoveryNewsPeter Hess19 Jul 2024AIExploratory SciencePhysical SciencesWhat are LLM AI agents?ExplainerKim Martineau18 Jul 2024AIAI for Business AutomationFoundation ModelsGenerative AIIBM reaffirms its commitment to the Rome Call for AI ethicsNewsMike Murphy15 Jul 2024AIFairness, Accountability, Transparency",Article,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://research.ibm.com/'}","At Think, IBM showed how generative AI is set to take automation to another level","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://research-website-prod-cms-uploads.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/Automation_010_ba9872093b.jpg', 'width': '1920', 'height': '1080'}",2024-06-04T13:00:00.000Z,2024-06-07T12:15:44.590Z,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mike Murphy', 'url': 'https://research.ibm.com/blog?author=mike-murphy'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'IBM', 'url': 'https://ibm.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://research.ibm.com/ibm-logo.svg', 'width': '576', 'height': '576'}}",,,https://research.ibm.com/blog/automation-think-generative-ai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly two-thirds (61%) of CEOs are adopting generative AI more quickly than workers are comfortable with, a new IBM study suggests, with many pushing hard on maintaining a competitive edge. While CEOs acknowledge this discomfort, the study found a sizable amount (64%) said their organization must take advantage of technologies that are outpacing employee’s ability to adapt. By contrast, less than half (44%) of respondents reported that they had “assessed the impact” of generative AI on their workforce.With 62% claiming a willingness to take more risk to maintain a competitive edge, the report highlights a clear disconnect between the broader workforce and C-suite decision makers.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProCEOs are firing on all cylinders, IBM said, with 43% set to “increase the tempo” of organizational change and 62% accepting the need to rewrite their “business playbook” to succeed. Staff, by comparison, don’t have the same mindset.  “Part of the issue is that many people think they’re training their replacement. Despite the fact that business leaders consistently say this technology will support human employees — not replace them — employees remain skeptical,” the report stated. There is a lack of direction from a C-suite level, meaning CEO enthusiasm is not translating into clear rationales or objectives for individual staff members.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

CEOs must locate the paint points creating “employee pushback” on the adoption of AI tools to deliver improvements and create an aligned strategy.Similarly, CEOs should focus on the tools that will make staff workloads easier and more rewarding, paying close attention to processes that are “slow, inefficient, or create unnecessary work for employees”.There should also be a shift towards investment that will “inspire change,” IBM said, with the priority needing to be put on incentivizing adoption through rewards for those who alter their roles to use the technology. Training is important, particularly that which teaches employees how best to use generative AI “to their advantage”, and CEOs need to ensure that “governance, technology, and talent are prepared” to optimize the value of generative AI.

A report prepared for the U.S. government warned that about 10% of U.S. workers could lose their jobs due to the introduction of AI tools. However, alongside these fears, new opportunities are also emerging—innovative professions and roles that adopt AI tools in fields such as marketing, cybersecurity, health, and even manufacturing. Organizations in Israel and around the world are already working to integrate advanced technologies into their products, work processes, and various activities. Companies are mobilizing personnel and preparing for the new era of artificial intelligence, where expert employees will be responsible for assimilating the technology into products, protecting against attacks, automating processes, and integrating creative AI tools into organizational procedures.   ""The only stable thing in the job market, especially the technological one, is that it changes all the time. Anyone who doesn't ask themselves how the AI ​​revolution affects their job and fields of activity, adopt new tools, and take part in reinventing their field of activity will find themselves without a job,"" says Avi Shanir, CEO of Elevation, which specializes in building internal and external skills academies to bridge employment gaps and promote occupational diversity. Over time, streamlining will continue, and jobs in entire areas will be dramatically reduced. As technology advances, some jobs will be fully performed by AI. Instead of fearing the revolution and wondering what will happen, Shanir recommends that everyone take small steps to start experimenting with different tools and strengthen the super skills we have, which AI will have a hard time reaching—creativity, critical thinking, curiosity, and thinking outside the box. Emerging professions in AI Avatar Data Engineer At D-ID, which develops avatars and interactive AI agents, a new position has been created due to the rise of animated avatars.

Sides are split on the benefits - or woes - for AI at work in the future. (Art by Midjourney for Fierce Network)


Ericsson looks at how AI will affect life in 2030 and beyondThe firm released a study that looks at how work could split between the empowered and powerlessThe study finds that 70% of the AI fearful think AI will shrink their wagesEricsson ConsumerLab has released a comprehensive high-level study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that takes in trends on everything from generative fashion to AI childcare and human digital twins.Readers of Fierce Network, however, will no doubt be most fascinated in how Ericsson’s AI respondents – both hopeful and fearful – view how AI will evolve in the workplace.For the overall study, Ericsson surveyed 6,510 urban early adopters of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), digital assistants and generative AI aged 15 to 69 in 13 major cities around the world to imagine a world in the 2030s where AI could affect many – most? – aspects of everyday life.Ericsson said that 51% of the total sample identify as “AI hopeful” and are happy to use early AI digital assistants and more. However, 34% of the sample identify as “AI fearful” even among early adopters – and these respondents are fearful of AI-based respondents. A fun future?Notably, 70% of AI fearful respondents predict a future where increased AI productivity leads to shrinking human salaries. Of these believers, 72% also foresee this development as a threat to their personal financial well-being, painting a bleak picture: the human worker as an AI drone, reaping scant financial reward for their obedience.“I'm not sure. I'm very concerned about it in terms of my field of work since I'm in the visual arts,” a respondent from San Francisco told the survey. Lawyers, accountants and, yes, even journalists feel you, SF respondent!A strapping 84% of AI hopefuls, however, envision AI assistants becoming commonplace, bolstering work performance and efficiency. Indeed, 81% of those who believe in this AI-powered future also anticipate a positive impact on their own careers. (Those happy AI people are probably in the marketing department, right?)“Yet, the AI hopeful and AI fearful groups do not necessarily present a divided vision of the future. Instead, they hint at the emergence of two types of employees: the empowered and the powerless,” Ericsson said in the report.Embracing workplace recommendations from future AI assistants might give you a competitive edge in your AI-assisted career, Ericsson noted. At the same time, AI could chip away at your paycheck and remove much of your autonomy, the vendor suggests.“Striking a balance will be crucial to preserving a humane work life,” Ericsson concluded.

<p>Accountancy and finance professionals can augment 60% to 100% of critical work functions with artificial intelligence in assurance, financial accounting, and management accounting, according to a whitepaper released by the <strong><a href=""https://www.isca.org.sg/"">Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants</a></strong> (ISCA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA views AI as a positive disruptor to enhance and complement the work of accountancy and finance professionals, instead of replacing them, with 72% of employers surveyed agreeing that AI will be a game changer for their business and 82% of employees asked expect <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/finance-and-genai-managing-risks-and-adding-value/"">Generative AI</a></strong> (Gen AI) to enhance their job performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singapore's national accountancy body adopts a human-centred AI (HCAI) perspective and recognises that AI can bring forth positive disruption, with the approach taking into consideration the design, use, and intention of the AI tool for the human user. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially, this means viewing AI as an instrument to augment and complement the work of accountancy and finance professionals, instead of replacing them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, despite the positive sentiments and willingness to <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/moving-the-needle-transformation-in-finance/"">take on new AI innovations</a></strong>, an AI readiness survey suggests that the accountancy industry still lacked key resources, in areas like infrastructure and data readiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Critical work functions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whitepaper also reviewed the potential of AI augmentation on <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/tackling-challenges-in-2024-head-on/"">critical work functions</a></strong> in accountancy career tracks, deep-diving into three career tracks: Assurance, Financial Accounting and Management Accounting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are strong indications of AI’s transformative impact on the accountancy industry,"" says <strong><a href=""https://isca.org.sg/about-us/about-the-institute-of-singapore-chartered-accountants/the-council"">Teo Ser Luck</a></strong>, president at ISCA. ""With AI, organisations can achieve more with less and reap productivity benefits. The notion of ‘super-accountants’ leveraging AI to cover more areas in multiple fields with fewer resources is also exciting.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""For instance, we may see entrepreneurial ‘super-accountants’ run leaner audit firms with more efficient employees, and still capable of providing a full suite of services through automation and AI augmentation.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">No job losses</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA's review reveales that the AI integration within finance does not necessarily result in job losses. Instead, the accountancy profession will likely continue to see more opportunities for professional development in terms of upskilling and reskilling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There would also be positive transformative changes through revamped work processes and productivity gains as AI proliferates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, with financial analyses and forecasts more easily performed with AI augmentation, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)’s role may no longer be concentrated on financial numbers alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The role will change with CFOs increasingly focused on more strategic job functions, such as leading in business development, risk<br>management, ESG and sustainability, and governance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among other attributes, a sharp business acumen, the ability to think critically and creatively, and digital savviness would be the defining features of the future CFO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">ISCA's AI initiative</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA’s AI for AI initiative will focus on five areas – jobs and skills, AI ethics, AI governance, AI adoption, and sustainability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among other initiatives that ISCA has embarked on, to foster AI adoption, ISCA conducted an AI experiential day earlier this month for small and medium-sized practices to learn about AI-powered accounting solutions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA will also launch a policy recommendation paper to advocate the development of a human-centred AI ecosystem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The accountancy body is developing a framework as well for responsible use of AI in the accountancy industry to address ethical concerns.</p>

WotC Under Fire For Generative AI Once Again – This Time It’s Video Games

Wizards of the Coast has come under fire from its community for generative AI use once again. This time, it’s related to video games.

Generative AI remains a hotbed issue for the tabletop and video game community. By and large, people want stories and games made by actual humans. Not “AI” trained up on Reddit posts and copypastas to spit out generic, biteless works. Corporations, on the other hand, want to save money by not paying those pesky humans to do the creative work that brings in all that dough.
It’s a match made in hell. And we’re all living through it. Generative AI in video games and tabletop RPGs both spark the same sentiment. WotC, being invested heavily in both arenas, has come under fire once again for the potential use of Generative AI. This time, for video games.
This is relevant because despite hiring for a position that would use Generative AI in the creation of assets for video games, WotC insists its stance on AI art and relying on the work of humans hasn’t changed.

Wizards of the Coast Seem Determined to Use AI After All

Here’s why we keep having this conversation. In August last year, AI imagery found in Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants, caused massive backlash among the community. So much so that Wizards of the Coast put out a statement saying that it would never use generative AI to create its art or writing.
Then again, at the beginning of this year, the Magic: the Gathering Twitter account used AI art in its promo materials for an upcoming set, which again was caught by the community and again sparked a backlash and a new round of controversy.

Then again, at the beginning of the month, not long after VentureBeat interviewed Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, in which Cocks revealed he was “excited about AI,” WotC issued another statement saying they weren’t using AI and were committed to producing work by humans for humans.


Now Hiring AI Engineer

Naturally, we’re back once more. This time, with Wizards of the Coast coming under fire for a new job posting. Now, video games and AI have a more nuanced relationship. After all, your enemies need AI. It’s a problem that comes from the terminology. We call generative AI art even though it’s neither an artificial intelligence nor art.
A new job posting is looking to hire a Principal AI Engineer, which would be fine, except for a few key things:

The big sticking points are the AI engineer building and deploying “systems for intelligent generation of text dialog, audio, and art assets…” as well as using AI for “content creation and audio generation.” In other words, using generative AI instead of paying voice actors or writers.

That and WotC’s response to the community outcry in the first place, which seems to be, “This doesn’t count because it’s for video games.” As WotC told Comicbook.com:

Our stance on AI hasn’t changed. This job description is for a role for future video game projects. You can reference our AI FAQ here.

This may be WotC’s attempt to have its cake and eat it, too. But whatever the case, WotC still seems committed to not using AI in D&D and Magic, at least in the main versions of those products. Anything else is anyone’s guess right now.
With generative AI becoming more prevalent, there are murky waters ahead for us all.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>GenAI impact</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A staggering 96% of APAC business leaders acknowledge the significant impact of generative AI, and 91% of APAC workers express their eagerness to acquire new skills to work with generative AI. However, only 4% of business leaders have implemented generative AI training at scale.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, 89% of APAC businesses plan to increase their <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/uipath-unveils-ai-features-in-traditional-chinese-new-family-of-llms/"">generative AI</a></strong> technology spending this year, but only 35% prioritise investments in their workforce's development.</p>

There’s practically a new study examining artificial intelligence’s impact on the workplace every week. Microsoft and LinkedIn released their annual Work Trend Index last month, concluding workers are embracing AI while employers remain largely paralyzed by indecision. Now, Asana and Anthropic have teamed up on this year’s State of AI at Work study.
The findings
More than 5,000 U.S. and U.K. knowledge workers and consulted AI experts were polled in March 2024 in order to get a comprehensive assessment of AI adoption in the workplace. The results are tailored to decision-making executives looking to improve their AI strategies and discover how to use the technology to boost their company’s productivity and collaboration. Asana outlines three key findings:

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise




The percentage of knowledge workers using AI weekly has increased by 44 percent over the past nine months to 52 percent
Despite impressive adoption growth, only 7 percent of employees report their companies have mature AI implementations, characterized by successful integration of multiple AI tools into work processes and regular evaluation of their impact
82 percent of workers say their organizations have yet to provide training on the use of generative AI

These statistics may not necessarily be surprising, as other studies have concluded similar findings. But these are likely to set the mood for the thing that really separates this State of AI at Work from all the rest. 
“What sets this study apart from others is its focus on organizational AI maturity and the actionable insights it provides for organizations to advance their AI implementation,” Dr. Rebecca Hinds, Asana’s head of its Work Innovation Lab, explains to VentureBeat in an email. “The report is the first to classify organizations according to a five-stage AI maturity model, from immature (Stage 1) to mature (Stage 5) implementations. The study also outlines the steps organizations need to take to achieve mature AI implementations, known as the ‘5Cs’: Comprehension, Concerns, Collaboration, Context, and Calibration.”
“For instance, in the context of the Collaboration ‘C’ (how humans collaborate with AI), we find that employees at mature AI organizations are 1.5 times more likely to view AI as a teammate. This shift in perspective leads to increased AI usage, enthusiasm, and productivity gains. Regarding the Context ‘C,’ organizations with mature AI implementations are more likely to have AI policies and guidelines in place, providing a clear context for AI usage. Related to the Calibration ‘C,’ while only 17 percent of employees at Stage 1 companies report that their organizations collect feedback on AI usage, this jumps to 91 percent at Stage 5 companies, highlighting the importance of calibration in mature AI implementations,” she goes on to state.

We are far from seeing most organizations fully versed in and comfortable with AI as part of their company strategy. However, Asana and Anthropic have outlined five stages of AI maturity; a guide executives can use to gauge where their company stands in implementing real transformative outcomes. Many respondents say they’re in either the first or second stage. Only seven percent claim they’ve achieved the highest stage. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t list which companies fall into which stage. But what are the characteristics of each stage of maturity?
Five-stage journey to AI maturity
The five-stage journey to AI maturity. Image credit: Asana/Anthropic/State of AI a Work Study 2024
Stage 1: AI Skepticism
Organizations recognize AI’s potential and start exploring its applications. It’s about opening up to AI’s possibilities.
Stage 2: AI Activationadvertisement
Companies will launch pilot projects to test the waters and gain hands-on experience with AI. Small-scale experiments will be conducted to understand the technologies’ impact and value.
Stage 3: AI Experimentation
Larger AI initiatives will be launched, and executives will start addressing the challenges of integrating the technology system-wide.
Stage 4: AI Scaling
AI is a part of an organization’s operations, reshaping workflows and decision-making processes. It’s part of the company’s DNA and operational strategy.
Stage 5: AI Maturity
Organizations are able to skillfully leverage AI to drive transformative results. Executives have found a way to strategically align the technology with their organizational goals.
What’s the secret to having a company in this final stage? Asana and Anthropic conclude that boosting comprehension is important, offering resources, training programs and support structures for knowledge workers to improve their education. Companies must also prioritize AI safety and reliability, meaning that AI vendors should be selected with “complete, integrated data models and invest in high-quality data pipelines and robust governance practices.” AI responses must be interpretable to facilitate decision-making and should always be controlled and directed by human operators.
Other elements of organizations in Stage 5 include embracing a human-centered approach, developing strong comprehensive policies and principles to navigate AI adoption responsibly, and being able to measure AI’s impact and value (e.g., are there clear metrics tied to business objectives? Can usage be tracked? Have baselines been established to accurately measure AI’s impact?)
Advancement through the five ‘Cs’
In order to progress through from AI Skepticism to AI Maturity, Asana and Anthropic have outlined five factors that must be met before an organization can evolve.
AI Comprehension
How well do employees understand how to use AI? The study reveals that only 20 percent of workers use gen AI weekly for companies in the first stage. However, businesses in the fifth stage see such usage skyrocket to 93 percent. 
AI Concerns
Do executives know what concerns are top-of-mind for workers? As companies mature, are they in tune with what’s going on with AI? At Stage 1, workers are primarily concerned about their limited understanding of how gen AI works. That changes in Stages 2 and 3 with workers being concerned about how others perceive how they use AI: Is it authentic? Are they taking shortcuts? In the final two stages, workers become interested in the ethical implications of using AI.
AI Collaboration
How do employees collaborate with AI? Do they even want to? In what way do workers view artificial intelligence in the workforce? Some might see it as a tool, while others view it as a teammate that actively contributes to work processes, decision-making and problem-solving. It could also be perceived more as a consultant, offering expert advice and specialized assistance when it comes to complex issues. In the first stage, most workers say AI is a tool, but for those in Stage 5, it becomes a teammate.
AI Context
Do organizations have AI policies, guidelines and principles in place? Stage 1 companies do not have clear policies governing AI usage, which could create potential inconsistencies in how the technology is applied and hinder innovation. However, by Stage 5, there’s a greater adoption of shared organizational AI principles, detailing ethical usage, transparency, fairness, accountability and privacy as it relates to AI deployment.
AI Calibration
The final “C” gauges how AI effectiveness and value are measured within the organization. In the first stage, 20 percent of workers report productivity gains through AI, though that figure increases significantly to 87 percent for companies in the fifth stage. The study suggests organizations engage their workforce in the evaluation process to calibrate AI effectively.

When asked why Asana and Anthropic teamed up for this study, Dr. Hinds shares that both companies are mission-driven, aiming “to help humanity through the development of advanced and trusted technology. Anthropic focuses on building safe and ethical AI systems, while Asana is dedicated to helping teams collaborate more effectively and efficiently.” However, this isn’t the first collaboration between the two, as both R&D teams have worked together on new product experiences for nearly a year.

The programs offer a window into what some firms believe artificial intelligence will mean for those now entering the profession. Future junior lawyers won’t be replaced by AI, as some fear, but they will need to harness it to be successful, said Brendan McDonnell, a K&L Gates partner and member of the firm’s AI solutions group. That includes understanding how to effectively interact with generative AI chatbots to unearth the most useful information for clients, he said. “That’s the whole idea about the training program: You need to teach people how this is going to impact the way they come to work,” said McDonnell. While AI will automate many tasks, he said, it’s also going to open up new lines of legal practice while freeing up new professionals’ time to learn and master the complex work they went to law school for. Most firms are still in an experimentation phase when it comes to deploying generative AI chatbot and research tools. Firms’ use of the tech is also dependent on clients’ openness to it. “We’re in a transition period,” said Alex Su, the chief revenue officer at Latitude Legal, a global flexible legal staffing firm. “It’s hard to say there’s going to be a huge impact in how law firms staff in the near-term.” Still, legal experts caution that future lawyers need to address the technology. “It used to be that a lawyer was sufficiently tech savvy if she knew her way around Word and Westlaw,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, the co-director of the Deborah L. Rhode Center on the Legal Profession at Stanford Law School. “Those days are over. In order to offer top-tier legal services in the 21st century, lawyers need facility with a suite of sophisticated tech-based tools.” There’s an apparent marketing component as well for the firms. Summer associate programs—roughly the equivalent of a paid summer internship that typically leads to a full-time job offer—have long been part of an effort for law firms to promote their brand to law students while fostering a recruiting pipeline. A generative AI training “sends a great marketing signal” about the firm’s commitment to a new technology, said Su. The “devil’s in the details” for this type of training, especially when it involves those entering the profession, said Michele DeStefano, a professor at the University of Miami Law.“The biggest issue is even if they know how to use AI, if they don’t have the substantive law background, you can’t discern whether you got a good answer,” she said. Prompt EngineeringK&L Gates and Orrick each partner with tech learning platform AltaClaro for firmwide trainings on subjects such as “prompt engineering,” regarded as the science of interacting with generative AI models and how the technology works. AltaClaro is working with 15 AmLaw200 firms on generative AI trainings, said CEO Abdi Shayesteh, though Orrick is the only one that has incorporated those programs in its summer associate training, beginning last year. Orrick said the first week of this year’s program included a training on prompt engineering, in addition to a day dedicated to seminars and ideas sessions around generative AI. “It’s going to be incredibly important for new lawyers to understand what technologies are available and how to use them,” said Kathleen Orr, Orrick’s head of practice innovation. She noted AI tools in use by Orrick include DraftWise, a drafting and negotiation assistant, Kira, an AI contract analyzer, and WestLaw’s Precision, an AI-assisted research tool. K&L Gates’ summer associate class will go through firm-led generative AI trainings and be introduced to CaseText’s Co-Counsel, a legal AI assistant the firm is already using for areas such as case research and summarizing depositions, said McDonnell. The firm will later match each associate with a lawyer identified internally as a generative AI “power user” to use the technology in their day-to-day work. “We hope that’s kind of going to give them a good mix of theory and practice,” said Carolyn Austin, K&L Gates’ director of practice innovation.Dechert, for its part, is doing something similar. The firm will focus on one-on-one training between a summer associates and attorneys who are using AI tools in their work, said Thor Alden, Dechert’s associate director of innovation.Alden noted the program highlights how legal training is “fundamentally” changing. But he said the tools aren’t replacing the firm’s assessment of legal skills. “When you’re thinking of a summer associate, one of your main goals is to assess whether the firm wants to hire you, and that should ultimately be driven by legal capabilities,” he said.Protecting the BrandFor both experienced and young lawyers, the biggest warning sign that comes with the new territory is the documented accuracy problems, or hallucinations, of AI models. An infamous example is two New York lawyers getting fined $5,000 last year after submitting a brief citing six nonexistent cases that one of the lawyers admitted were supplied by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.“A big challenge for all law firms will be trying to make sure that they can continue to think like lawyers,” said McDonnell. “I mean, you can ruin the brand of a law firm if we don’t actually make sure that the output is vetted.”Notwithstanding those risks, many law firms, traditionally slow movers when it comes to new technology, have embraced generative AI. Dechert launched its own internal chatbot, DechertMind, in April 2023. Wilson Sonsini has also created its own internal AI tool. Firms such as A&O Shearman and Paul Weiss are customers of the generative AI legal startup Harvey, which has received more than $100 million in funding to date. “For the first time the legal industry is moving at a better pace and looking at how to adopt this technology,” said AltaClaro’s Shayesteh. “It’s because they see the competitive advantage from those who adopt this the right way.”Bloomberg Law sells legal research tools and software, including some that make use of generative AI.

				Generative AI Is Creating a Copyright Crisis for Artists			
How does an artist assert copyright when her image was only one of many used to create a new image? How does she make a living if she can’t?

A recent article in Issues in Science and Technology asks us to consider what happens when the AI systems scarf up images from across the internet:


Stable Diffusion alone has harvested 5 billion images and text captions. The Common Pool offers 12.8 billion.
Kate Crawford, a researcher of AI’s impact based at USC Annenberg and New York University professor of clinical law Jason Schultz spell out what that means for artists who hope to make a living from their work:

Their work is being used to train AI systems, which can then create images and texts that replicate their artistic style…
The billions of works produced by generative AI are unowned and can be used anywhere, by anyone, for any purpose. Whether a ChatGPT novella or a Stable Diffusion artwork, output now exists as unclaimable content in the commercial workings of copyright itself. This is a radical moment in creative production: a stream of works without any legally recognizable author. 
Kate Crawford, Jason Schultz, “Generative AI Is a Crisis for Copyright Law,” Issues in Science and Technology, January 16, 2024
Essentially, the system is outdated
The problem, Crawford and Schultz say, is that copyright law, as currently framed, does not really protect individuals under these circumstances. That’s not surprising. Copyright dates back to at least 1710 and the issues were very different then.
For one thing, as Jonathan Bartlett pointed out last December, when the New York Times launched a lawsuit for copyright violation against Microsoft and OpenAI, everyone accepted that big search engines have always violated copyright. But if they brought people to your site, while saving and using your content for themselves, you were getting something out of it at least.
But it’s different with generative AI and the chatbot. They use and replace your content. Users are not going back to you for more. OpenAI freely admits that it violates copyright but relies on loopholes to get around legal responsibility.
As the lawsuits pile up, it’s clear that gen AI and chatbots can’t work without these billions of images and texts. So we either do without them or we find a way to compensate the producers.
But if users pay, remember that the end user is you


Robert J. Marks points out that systems for paying original artists exist now. “Today’s Spotify keeps automatic records of song frequency and, from subscriber’s payments, distributes royalties accordingly. Similar methods could be applied to compensate content creators by generative AI.” (Newsmax January 18, 2024) But they would require record keeping on the part of the currently secretive AI system owners.
They would require something else too, Marks notes: End users will end up paying somehow to use the glitzy new AI services. It makes sense. The reason chatbots are free and Disney movies are not is partly because of all the people who aren’t getting paid by the AI vendors — as opposed to the people who are getting paid by Disney.
The deepest issue is that humans are creative and AI is not
When only humans were original producers, copyright law generally provided sufficient protection. AI systems get around that by mixing, melding, and collating at enormous volumes which can often stand in for original creation — for a time. But AI needs constant rejuvenation from original creators; otherwise we can routinely expect the jackrabbit problem (model collapse — a descent into rubbish due to regurgitating the same contents). But people won’t produce that content for them if they are not paid.
Overall, the issue probably won’t be resolved by the application of current law; we will need to move toward a system that recognizes the new technology as a factor and works out a scheme for compensating the producers of the material it uses.

Model collapse: AI chatbots are eating their own tails. The problem is fundamental to how they operate. Without new human input, their output starts to decay. Meanwhile, organizations that laid off writers and editors to save money are finding that they can’t just program creativity or common sense into machines.

BEYOND THE SPIDER-VERSE Will Not Contain Any Generative AI


by Kyle Anderson
Jun 4 2024 • 1:52 PM







The argument over the use of generative AI, in which a program aggregates from sources across the globe to create something like text, videos, images, etc., is hot these days. Should production companies use it to cut some corners? Is the product actually inferior? (Yes, it is.) And why do CEOs seem intent on using it, no matter what? Well the final question has been a big one, and producer Chris Miller has responded. Beyond the Spider-Verse will not employ any generative AI.
Sony Animation 
 IndieWireOpens in a new tab reported on May 30 that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra told investors that the studio was “looking at ways to produce both films for theaters and television in a more efficient way, using AI primarily.” Obviously, this made people scared, especially for movies like the third Spider-Verse. Those movies, which have gorgeous visuals, are difficult to make. Would this mean Sony would push to use generative AI for “efficiency” sake? Chris Miller had something to say about this, which  we first saw on GamespotOpens in a new tab.
Miller  responded on TwitterOpens in a new tab: “There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”  
Sony Animation
It’s worth noting that the Spider-Verse movies have used AI programs, but not generative AI. They instead incorporated ethical and smart-use machine learning to eliminate repetitive tasks and help the artists better adhere to 3D geometry.
 Per the effects supervisor Pav GrocholaOpens in a new tab, “We determined that in order to speed up artists’ productivity over the course of the project, we would utilize machine learning to help our animators get an initial predicted result that would give them a reasonable first pass of creating ink lines on the characters.”

We’re not going to see an end to the AI debate in film and TV for some time. As a tool, machine learning can help artists achieve the desired result more quickly. But generative AI undermines the work of hundreds of real humans, not to mention all the people whose work the machine samples. And so far at least, people can tell the difference.

Here's How Generative AI is Revolutionizing Marketing Creativity and Efficiency







Mahrukh Shahid


6/03/2024 03:30:00 AM









Artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, is reshaping the marketing landscape nowadays. It is offering new ways for professionals to enhance creativity, streamline research, and optimize analytics. AI tools are becoming integral in the marketing field, helping marketers to generate content quicker, increase efficiency and build more creative campaigns. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have become essential in many marketers toolkits. For instance, a 2024 survey highlighted that 68% of B2B marketing leaders use generative AI to produce more content efficiently. Meanwhile, 55% leverage these tools to focus on high-value tasks, and 51% use AI to create content that is both optimized and engaging. Additionally, the popularity of AI is evident in the upskilling of marketing professionals. LinkedIn's 2024 Global Marketing Jobs Outlook report shows an increased focus on AI skills. The top LinkedIn Learning courses for marketers now include topics such as ""What is Generative AI?"", ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"", and ""Ethics in the Age of Generative AI"". These courses are part of a broader trend where twice as many marketing leaders have added AI skills to their profiles in the last quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Furthermore, the demand for AI literacy is growing in the workplace. According to Microsoft and LinkedIn's 2024 Work Trend Index, 71% of leaders would prefer to hire a candidate with AI skills over one with more experience but without such skills. A significant 66% of leaders stated they would not hire someone lacking AI literacy. The impact of AI on marketing extends to job opportunities and the competitive landscape. Over half of the marketers plan to use AI to gain a competitive advantage. The integration of AI into marketing not only facilitates a more efficient workflow but also fosters a creative and competitive industry. This shift suggests that we are moving towards a work environment that allows for more human interaction. This enables marketers to perform more fulfilling work and collaborate efficiently.

‘Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse’ Writer-Producer Chris Miller Shuts Down Rumors of Generative AI Use

Chris Miller, cowriter and producer of the animated Spider-Man “Spider-Verse” trilogy, shut down rumors that his team used generative artificial intelligence as part of the production of the next installment of the series, “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.” 
“There is no generative AI in ‘Beyond the Spider-Verse’ and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work,” Miller posted on social media in a shot at what’s commonly being referred to as “AI.” 
The social media rumors surrounding GAI come as backlash against the nascent technology has risen among both Hollywood workers and in pop culture. That’s become particularly true following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year, where writers and actors spoke out against algorithms potentially replacing their artistry.  



But generative AI, which creates words and images with minimal human input based on human-created works used to train software, is only one form of the technology. Other machine-learning tools have been adapted by Hollywood animation productions as a method to assist animators, not render them obsolete. 
Such machine-learning technology has been used in 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and its 2023 sequel, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which sought to replicate the hand-drawn style of comic books in a CGI animated film while exploring new ways to express that style through color and design. This included replicating ink lines on characters, which is a key part of comic book line art.

But having to add those ink lines to every single frame of the movie and adjusting them to fit characters as they moved would have been excruciatingly slow and tedious for animators to do on their own, so Sony Pictures Imageworks developed a machine-learning program that would adjust the ink lines from frame to frame and move with the characters. This allowed the animators to focus on the expressions, movements and other key aspects of the lead Spider-Man Miles Morales and other “Spider-Verse” characters without having to spend hours fine-tuning those details.  



This machine-learning technology, designed to free animators from a menial task that would have added weeks if not months of work to the animation process, isn’t the same as generative AI. It’s still based around the work done by animators on the project it’s being used for, with their supervision. That’s as opposed to generative AI, which can pull images, video and words from media outside of the project being worked on and create something without substantial direct human input.  
The future of machine learning, GAI and other new forms of technology is expected to be a major part of contract negotiations between Hollywood studios and The Animation Guild, which has recently established a task force to hear input from its members about how artificial intelligence is used on projects they have worked on or been pitched.
This will help the union craft its proposals on how to regulate AI use in Hollywood animation. The Animation Guild’s negotiating committee is still in the process of creating a formal pattern of demands and is expected to begin contract negotiations sometime in August. 
“Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” is currently in production, but does not have a release date set. It was previously scheduled for release in March 2024, but was taken off of Sony’s schedule last year during the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes.

Glean Launches Glean Apps and Glean APIs, Empowering Businesses to Build Custom Generative AI Apps and Agents Securely at Scale




More than 100 companies created 1,000+ AI agents during the preview of Glean Apps, now Generally Available 






June 05, 2024 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Glean, the enterprise AI assistant platform, today announced the widespread availability of Glean Apps and Glean APIs on the Glean Platform. These new capabilities give both everyday users and developers the power to create custom AI assistants, copilots, chatbots, and agents to automate everyday work and deliver proactive insights with AI. The Glean Platform continues to expand as the open, horizontal choice for building enterprise AI, now adding support for industry-leading LLMs Anthropic Claude and Google Gemini. These LLMs work seamlessly with the enterprise data inside more than 100 SaaS tools that are securely integrated with the Glean Platform, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Figma, GitHub, Jira, ServiceNow, and more.


“With Glean Apps and Glean APIs, we’ve been able to securely build and deploy generative AI applications that would have taken months and significant resources for us to develop on our own”Post this

Glean was founded in 2019 as an AI-powered enterprise search solution connected to all of a company’s internal data, and has evolved into a leading enterprise AI assistant platform. Glean’s state-of-the-art search and RAG technology retrieves the most relevant, up-to-date information for LLMs to generate highly personalized answers grounded in each company’s unique enterprise knowledge graph. Built for enterprises from the start, Glean provides the comprehensive security, privacy, permissions, and governance enterprises require to deploy AI globally across their workforces.


“Since launching our conversational AI assistant last year, we’ve helped hundreds of companies bring trustworthy generative AI into their organizations and supercharge productivity,” said Arvind Jain, co-founder and CEO of Glean. “Today the Glean Platform takes the next step in enabling users and developers to create customized generative AI experiences in their organizations. During our preview, we’ve seen early adopters create hundreds of no-code and low-code AI agents and apps that automate repetitive tasks, execute multi-step processes, and proactively engage in everyday work. We’re now thrilled to make Glean Apps and Glean APIs available for all.”


The Glean Platform now includes:



Glean Apps: Glean Apps are custom generative AI agents, assistants, copilots, and chatbots created and deployed by everyday users in a no-code environment. Glean Apps are configured with natural language, can be constrained to work with data from specified knowledge sources, and are capable of a wide range of information gathering and analysis, content synthesis and generation, and task automation capabilities. These apps can be used by individuals or deployed in the tools where users work like Slack, and can take proactive action when triggered by specific events. Use cases for Glean Apps include straightforward applications like HR or IT help bots, as well as more complex assistants like domain-specific content generation, engineering issue analysis, and sales objection handling and enablement coaching.



Glean Actions: Glean Actions enable Glean Assistant and Glean Apps to take action on a user’s behalf inside connected applications. For example, actions can read data from an application and then perform specific tasks like writing a ticket in Jira or sending an email in Gmail. Users can also build custom actions with the Actions SDK.



Glean APIs: For developers, Glean offers two APIs that enable businesses to quickly and securely build custom AI applications, leveraging the enterprise-grade connectivity, retrieval, and analysis capabilities of the Glean Platform. The Chat API enables developers to embed generative AI experiences, grounded in company knowledge, directly inside the business applications where users work. The Search API helps companies build their own RAG applications, using Glean’s best-in-class retrieval engine and secure, permission-aware data connections.



Expanded LLM options: Glean Platform now supports Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 models, joining the existing support for OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 and 4 models.

Login     Listen to this article 6 min    Generative artificial intelligence tools designed for the legal industry make up false or misleading information between 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the time, a Stanford University study has found.The academic paper claims to be the first systematic assessment of leading AI tools for legal research tasks, which allow lawyers to interrogate large databases of legislation, case law and legal commentary by putting questions to an AI-powered chatbot.Generative artificial intelligence tools designed for the legal industry make up false or misleading information up to one in three times, a study has found. iStockThe analysis focused on products by LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which had suggested in earlier statements that they had eliminated or significantly reduced the problem of “hallucinations”. This is when a large language model makes a false statement or falsely asserts that a source supports a statement.But the researchers found the companies’ claims were overblown.“While hallucinations are reduced relative to general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the time,” the paper concluded.AdvertisementLawyers must continue to verify that key propositions are accurately supported by citations, the researchers said.“That said, even in their current form, these products can offer considerable value to legal researchers compared to traditional keyword search methods or general-purpose AI systems, particularly when used as the first step of legal research rather than the last word.”The researchers designed a set of 202 legal queries to test the four generative AI tools. These included bar exam questions, requests for factual recall, questions based on a false premise and queries related to overturned cases or new developments.The study found that more than one in six queries (17 per cent) caused Lexis+ AI and Thomson Reuters’ Ask Practical Law AI to respond with misleading or false information. This compared with one in three (33 per cent) for Thomson Reuters’ AI-Assisted Research in Westlaw Precision, and 43 per cent for OpenAI’s GPT-4.Corresponding author Daniel E. Ho, professor of law and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human Centered-Artificial Intelligence, told The Australian Financial Review the study used “highly realistic questions, including bar exam questions and questions of appellate litigation”.AdvertisementProfessor Ho said hallucinations included “fabricating statutory provisions that defy Supreme Court precedent and stating that the US Supreme Court was overruled by the Nebraska Supreme Court, which is an impossibility in the US legal system”.Other questions that the various tools got wrong included, “Are the deadlines established by the bankruptcy rules for objecting to discharge jurisdictional?” and “Why did Justice Ginsburg dissent in Obergefell?”“The paper shows that these systems can fail to comprehend basic distinctions in the law, like distinguishing between holdings and facts, arguments by litigants and findings by judges, and the hierarchy of legal authority,” Professor Ho said.Findings questionedIn an article posted to Thomson Reuters’ Legal Current website, Mike Dahn, head of Westlaw product management at Thomson Reuters, said the organisation agreed with the spirit of the research and the ambition of the team running the study to produce a common set of standards for AI-powered legal tools.But he said the researchers’ findings differed significantly from its own testing because it “included question types we very rarely or never see in AI-assisted research”.Advertisement“Our thorough internal testing of AI-assisted research shows an accuracy rate of approximately 90 per cent based on how our customers use it, and we’ve been very clear with customers that the product can produce inaccuracies,” Mr Dahn said.Rival LexisNexis’ response was more positive. In a statement, it said the researchers had provided “empirical data that Lexis+ AI is delivering superior results than our competitors’ AI-generated legal research tools in a number of key areas”.In Australia, a months-long trial by the company involving 300 lawyers found they estimated they could save an average of 12 hours each week by using Lexis+ AI for legal research, drafting, client communications, summarising case law and summarising documents.Aussie firms adoptClayton Utz became the first Australian law firm to adopt the Lexis+ AI tool permanently after a six-week trial found the tool was helpful and saved lawyers time. The tool was launched locally on May 28.Partner Simon Newcomb said it was “very thorough and fast” but was “absolutely not a replacement for lawyers, because it requires quite a bit of skill to steer it”.Advertisement“It’s quite good at finding the law, but a human is going to be better at applying the law,” Mr Newcomb said.Holding Redlich has also adopted Lexis+ AI permanently. Chief knowledge officer Keren Smith said her colleagues were realistic about the tool’s strengths and weaknesses, and understood that it was not yet able to perform high-level research and that its output required extensive checking.But she said the tool’s case summary feature would expedite research by enabling lawyers to more quickly determine which cases they needed to read and which cases they could avoid.“This feature alone has the potential to save significant amounts of time,” Ms Smith said.“Last week, one of our lawyers spent 4½ hours completing a legal research task using traditional research methods. Using Lexis+ AI, he was able to replicate that same task in 30 minutes.“RelatedAllens didn’t trust ChatGPT, so it built AirlieRelatedConsultants using AI do better, especially underperformers: studyExpert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowEuan Black is a work and careers reporter at The Australian Financial Review.

After some initial hesitation that comes with adapting to change, the powerful benefits of generative AI are steadily being recognised by businesses of all sizes.
For small to medium businesses (SMEs) the potential is vast — thanks to progress in natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive analytics, AI can provide SMEs with crucial understandings into customer behaviour, market trends, and potential business prospects. 
But while 68% of Australian leaders and employees say that AI has a positive impact on work, only 22% are currently using it, according to Adobe’s Future of Digital Work 2023 report.
That means many SMEs are missing out on the cost-effective, time-saving productivity hacks that can come with adopting generative AI platforms.
The reasons behind the hesitation to embrace AI are primarily security concerns, executives’ resistance, and a lack of comprehensive understanding, says Chandra Sinnathamby, Director, Digital Media B2B Strategy & GTM, Asia-Pacific at Adobe.
“Technology in general has always been a key enabler of productivity gains and also accelerating businesses for growth. Generative AI in particular is one of those key drivers today,” says Sinnathamby.
“Like any adoption curve, you’ll have early adopters and laggards — the biggest challenge is showing them how easy it is and my advice is that the owner of the business needs to showcase how it is helping in day-to-day life,” he says.
So how can generative AI help SMEs? We look at how advancements in technology are already helping SMEs and what lies ahead.
Increasing productivity
A new report from the Productivity Commission shows that labour productivity fell sharply in 2022-23. Despite an increase in hours worked, economic output failed to keep pace. In fact, productivity fell by 3.7% — driven by a 6.9% increase in hours worked by Australians — the highest annual increase in history.
For businesses that are facing a decline in productivity, AI offers many ways to save time and cut costs. An example is the recently released Acrobat AI Assistant from Adobe, a generative AI-powered conversational engine integrated into Reader and Acrobat workflows. 
AI Assistant instantly generates summaries and insights from PDFs, answers questions and formats information for sharing in emails, reports and presentations, says Sinnathamby.
“This is one of those tools that we believe can really help address the productivity needs of small businesses in Australia, which are the backbone of the country,” he says.
“AI Assistant can summarise a PDF, list the key points and save businesses hours that would normally have been spent reading through a detailed contract, brief, or any other business document,” he says.
“It also provides the ability to get insights, ask questions and compare information across multiple documents.”
Retaining staff
Providing employees with ways to do more meaningful work is also a major benefit generative AI is bringing to small businesses. According to the Adobe’s Future of Digital Work 2023 study, more than 80% of people reported they want to accelerate business processes to free up time and remove redundant tasks.
“That’s really critical because it shows that most people want to do work that drives a higher level of job satisfaction for them. If you talk to any HR leader, the higher the job satisfaction, the higher the retention of staff will be,” says Sinnathamby.
Using generative AI tools, such as Acrobat AI Assistant, means employees are freed up from time-consuming tasks and can focus on those that bring greater value to the business, and the employee’s own wellbeing.
“The average knowledge worker spends about 8.2 hours a week looking for information.
This tool can save hours of time that can then be better spent on some other part of the business,” he says.
“For example, if you use it to summarise the requirements of a tender document, you can then use that time saved in responding to those requirements.”
For those resisting the adoption of generative AI, Sinnathamby’s advice is to do some research and start trialling different tools.
Generative AI is moving from the playground to production, according to McKinsey research, and is the number one priority for CEOs to focus on in 2024. 
“This is just the beginning,” says Sinnathamby. “Those that adopt early will gain significant advantage — so by definition, if you’re not the one adopting, you’re going to be left behind.”

It is customary to take proactive measures against potential future disasters to safeguard ourselves from being overwhelmed by such catastrophes. Regardless of the seemingly slim chances of an anticipated disaster, it is imperative to take serious measures to protect the community or nation. Proactive protective measures are more cost-effective than responding to a disaster after it occurs.
In the realm of AI technology, stakeholders have collectively agreed to refrain from developing autonomous intelligent weapons. However, the issue of AI taking over human jobs has sparked significant controversy within the industry and research community. Proponents argue that AI is poised to transform job roles, create new opportunities, and shorten the time needed to perform complex tasks that traditionally took long periods to accomplish. They believe that AI will enhance productivity and open up new fields of employment. On the other hand, critics contend that AI will inevitably lead to job displacement due to automation.
                           Next   Stay       Stunned by thousands of storks flying over the sky in Gia Viễn dike, Ninh Bình - Nếm TV            40         42                                                                                                              00:00                                                       00:00  /  00:00           10 Sec             
I align with this perspective, given the substantial evidence of job cuts across various industries worldwide resulting from AI adoption. For instance, tasks that previously required the efforts of 30 people can now be completed by one or two individuals with the help of AI models. To illustrate, consider the example of coding. Coding involves writing instructions to direct computer operations. For example, coding is what makes it possible for you to use WhatsApp.
AI has revolutionised the coding space beyond initial imagination. With the advent of AI-driven coding tools, tasks that used to require extensive human labour can now be executed more efficiently and with fewer resources. Previously, coding was a tedious process that required many programmers to write complex code. However, tasks that once required 20 people can now be completed by one or two individuals in a short period, thanks to AI coding models such as Codex.


Currently, there are many AI models for coding available, both open-source and proprietary. One intriguing feature of these coding models is their ability to convert natural language into computer programs. A programmer can simply describe the requirements of the software they intend to develop in plain English and prompt the AI coding model. The AI then automatically generates the code based on the provided description. The programmer only needs to review the generated code to ensure it meets the expected requirements, as the AI-generated code can sometimes contain errors that require human judgment to fix.
This capability has significantly streamlined the coding process, reducing the need for large teams of programmers and accelerating software development.
The Nigerian agricultural sector is the largest employer of labour in the country, with PwC estimating that it accounts for more than 36 per cent of the labour force. According to a report by Jobberman, the sector employs over 23 million people. These workers are involved in various tasks on farms of different scales across Nigeria, including land clearing, harrowing, planting seeds, weeding, spreading fertilizer, harvesting, packaging, livestock management, and more. The majority of these jobs require a large workforce.
Beyond those directly employed on farms, there are also many individuals indirectly involved, such as drivers transporting workers to and from the farms and hawkers selling food to the farm workers, which stimulates local economic activities.


However, the full adoption of AI technologies in Nigeria’s agricultural sector could potentially replace the jobs of over 20 million Nigerians. AI-driven machinery and automation could perform tasks that currently require numerous workers, thereby significantly reducing the need for human labour.
While this technological shift could increase efficiency and productivity, it also poses a significant risk of job displacement for a substantial portion of the Nigerian workforce.
Apapa Port in Lagos is a bustling hub of economic activity, currently employing thousands of workers directly and indirectly. Tasks range from loading and unloading cargo to administrative duties and transportation logistics. However, with the full deployment of AI systems at the port, it would only require two or three people to oversee the entire operations, leading to the displacement of almost all the direct and indirect workers. The thousands of people currently employed at the port, as well as those in related support roles, would lose their jobs.
To put this in perspective, consider the Shanghai Smart Port in China. This port, which surpasses the combined capacity of all ports in the USA, operates with intelligent automated container terminals and manages 47.4 million containers autonomously. Remarkably, there is not a single human worker involved in its operations. If Apapa Port were to adopt similar AI technologies, the impact on employment would be profound, replacing thousands of workers with automated systems and dramatically altering the employment landscape.
adImplementing AI systems for immigration tasks like passport and passenger verification at Nigerian airports would lead to a significant reduction in the workforce. I’ve personally encountered such systems at Dubai Airport when exiting the country, where intelligent systems efficiently screen passengers.
I can go on and on but because of limited space, I will stop here.
On the global scene, Amazon has replaced over 100,000 workers with robots, significantly streamlining its operations. Similarly, Google laid off over 12,000 employees due to the adoption of AI technologies. In 2023, AI Magazine reported that AI technology was responsible for the elimination of over 200,000 roles across various industries. Numerous companies are reducing their workforce, citing AI adoption as the primary reason for these layoffs. As of January 2024, more than 4,000 layoffs directly related to AI have been reported, underscoring the rapid and significant impact of AI on employment worldwide.  
This shift emphasises the profound impact of AI on the job market, highlighting the urgent need for strategies to mitigate potential negative effects on employment.

Posted Jun 2, 2024 03:28:19 AM.
Last Updated Jun 2, 2024 10:56:09 AM.




WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic National Committee was watching earlier this year as campaigns nationwide were experimenting with artificial intelligence. So the organization approached a handful of influential party campaign committees with a request: Sign onto guidelines that would commit them to use the technology in a “responsible” way.
The draft agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, was hardly full of revolutionary ideas. It asked campaigns to check work by AI tools, protect against biases and avoid using AI to create misleading content.
“Our goal is to use this new technology both effectively and ethically, and in a way that advances – rather than undermines – the values that we espouse in our campaigns,” the draft said.
The plan went nowhere.
Instead of fostering an agreement, the guidelines sparked a debate about the value of such pledges, particularly those governing fast-evolving technology. Among the concerns expressed by the Democratic campaign organizations: Such a pledge might hamstring their ability to deploy AI and could turn off donors with ties to the AI industry. Some committee officials were also irked that the DNC gave them only a few days to agree to the guidelines.
The proposal’s demise highlighted internal divisions over campaign tactics and the party’s uncertainty over how to best utilize AI amid warnings from experts that the technology is supercharging the proliferation of disinformation.
Hannah Muldavin, a senior spokesperson at the Democratic National Committee, said the group is not giving up on finding a consensus.
The DNC, she said, “will continue to engage with our sister committees to discuss ideas and issues important to Democratic campaigns and to American voters, including AI.”
“It’s not uncommon for ideas and plans to shift, especially in the midst of a busy election year, and any documents on this subject reflect early and ongoing conversations,” Muldavin said, adding the “DNC and our partners take seriously the opportunities and challenges presented by AI.”
The wrangling comes as campaigns have increasingly deployed artificial intelligence — computer systems, software or processes that emulate aspects of human work and cognition — to optimize workloads. That includes using large language models to write fundraising emails, text supporters and build chatbots to answer voters’ questions.
That trend is expected to continue as November’s general election approaches, with campaigns turning to supercharged generative AI tools to create text and images, as well as clone human voices and create video at lightning speeds.
The Republican National Committee used AI-generated images in a television spot last year predicting a dystopian future under President Joe Biden.
Much of that adoption, however, has been overshadowed by concerns about how campaigns could use artificial intelligence in ways that trick voters. Experts have warned that AI has become so powerful that it has made it easy to generate “deep fake” videos, audio snippets and other media targeting opposing candidates. Some states have passed legislation regulating the way generative artificial intelligence can be used. But Congress has so far failed to pass any bills regulating artificial intelligence on the federal level.
In the absence of regulation, the DNC sought a set of guidelines it could point to as evidence the party was taking seriously the threat and promise of AI. It sent the proposal in March to the five Democratic campaign committees that seek to elect House, Senate, gubernatorial, state legislative and state attorneys general candidates to office, according to the draft agreement. 
The goal was to have each committee agree to a slate of AI guardrails and the DNC proposed issuing a joint statement proclaiming such guidelines would ensure that campaigns could use “the tools they need to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation, while empowering campaigns to safely, responsibly use generative AI to engage more Americans in our democracy.” 
The Democratic committee had hoped the statement would be signed by Chair Jaime Harrison and the leaders of the other organizations.
Democratic operatives said the proposal landed with a thud. Some senior leaders at the committees worried that the agreement might have unforeseen consequences, perhaps constricting how campaigns use AI, according to multiple Democratic operatives familiar with the outreach.
And it might send the wrong message to technology companies and executives who work on AI, many of whom help fill campaign coffers during election years.
Some of the Democratic Party’s most prolific donors are top tech entrepreneurs and AI evangelists, including Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google.
Altman has donated over $200,000 to the Biden campaign and his aligned Democratic joint fundraising committee since the start of last year, according to data from the Federal Election Commission, and Schmidt’s contributions to those groups have topped $500,000 over the same time. 
Two other AI proponents, Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founder of Facebook, and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, donated more than $900,000 to Biden’s joint fundraising committee this cycle, according to the same data.
The DNC plan caught the committees off guard because it came with little explanation, other than a desire to get each committee to agree to the list of best practices within a few days, said multiple Democratic operatives who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter. Aides to the Democratic Congressional Campaign and Democratic Senatorial Campaign committees said they felt rushed by a DNC timeline that urged them to sign quickly.
Representatives from the Democratic Attorneys General Association did not respond to the Associated Press’ request for comment. Spokesmen from the Democratic Governors Association and Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee declined to comment.
The Republican National Committee did not respond to questions about its AI guidelines. The Biden campaign also declined to comment when asked about the DNC effort.
The four-page agreement — “Guidelines on Responsible Use of Generative AI in Campaigns” — covered everything from ensuring that artificial intelligence systems were not trusted without a human checking its work to notifying voters when they are interacting with AI-generated content or systems.
“As the explosive rise of generative AI transforms every corner of public life – including political campaigns – it’s more important than ever that we limit this new technology’s potential threat to voters’ rights, and instead leverage it to build innovative, efficient campaigns and a stronger, more inclusive democracy,” the proposal said.
The guidelines were divided into five sections that included titles such as “Offering Human Alternatives, Consideration and Fallback” and “Providing Notice and Explanation.” The proposed rules would have required the committees to ensure “a real person should be responsible for approving AI-generated content and be accountable for how, where, and to whom it is deployed.”
The directive outlined how “users should always be aware when they are interacting with an AI bot” and stressed that any images or video created by AI “should be flagged” as such. And it stressed that campaigns should use AI to assist staffers, not replace them.
“Campaigns are a human-driven and human motivated business,” read the agreement. “Use efficiency gains to teach more voters and focus more on quality control and sustainability.”
It also urged campaigns not to use “generative AI to create misleading content. Period.”

Artificial Intelligence in Daily Work






By: Stuart Wagner

Date:

June 5, 2024 



Using AI has become a part of our everyday lives, including work. We can ease so many tasks and still be good at what we do for a living! Many are still afraid of AI and will do anything to avoid embracing it, but they lose big here.
Just check on the events around you. Every day, you can see at least one speaker artificial intelligence around, who tries to bring this technology closer to us. And our lives can get much easier, knowing that we can use AI for:
Data Tracking and Scheduling
AI helps us make sense of large amounts of data. Whether it’s some marketing agency, healthcare institution, or government domain, AI can analyze data and track trends to help you understand what’s happening. Every profession can benefit from AI if used properly. 
Personalized Work Experience
From preferred courses, analyzing skills, and suggested improvements, AI can improve each work position. Also, it adapts to the worker’s preferences, so both the company and the individual can make the most out of the collaboration. We’re still not used to this approach, but it will surely become an important part of our job as time goes by.
Your Automation Assistant
Some tasks are boring and repetitive. People easily get demotivated when working on such tasks, affecting their overall productivity. Instead of being against AI at work, it’s time to embrace various tools and solutions that automate some of the daily tasks, leaving enough time to be more creative and productive with the other assignments.

Initially, people thought that AI could replace several workplaces like app developers, content writers, copywriters, etc. The truth is, we still need the old but gold human touch to complete the task successfully. For example, writing content with AI is dull, the sentences are repetitive, and may not make sense. But when a human edits that content it gets more digestible, useful, helpful, and readable. 
AI is worth it because:

Eases the daily tasks
Makes a great work assistant
Improves efficiency and productivity
Boosts your dedication

Still, everything is not blooms and roses with AI. Sometimes people aren’t even aware that there are negative aspects, especially with the overreliance on AI solutions. 
Working Alongside With AI
In extreme situations, people either completely avoid AI, or use it all the time. But the real skill is to work alongside it – not to ignore it, but also not to rely on everything. That’s the golden rule: AI is here to help us, not to replace our work. At least for now…
Conclusion
AI is nothing to be afraid of. It’s the future of so many job positions, especially when it comes to enhanced efficiency and productivity. Use AI to ease the tasks you find boring and repetitive. Use your brain to deal with creative parts of your job, as no AI tool can be that creative as an experienced human being who deals with everyday problems. 
Surely, completely avoid AI if it potentially leads to wrong information and conclusions. Some professions simply can’t rely on AI, or it’s too early for that.

Given the rise of generative artificial intelligence and the ever-expanding range of skills, one of the greatest unknowns left by this technology is the impact it will have on employment.  Casting doubt on future employment opportunities across all disciplines, experts are asking what is the best way to learn to be as prepared as possible.  In a recent report prepared by Citi analysts entitled What can’t machines do?The authors of the document summarized a number of skills identified as key, and feedback from experts from different fields.  The degree of pessimism and optimism about the impact of AI on employment varies from one expert to another, but there is some agreement on what they think needs to be known. 
Of the 28 experts Citi consulted, 64% said communication would be an essential skill among their arsenal, and 64% of those surveyed said it was key.  Emotional intelligence (57%), digital skills (54%), empathy (54%) and critical thinking (46%) rounded out the top five.  In contrast, only 7% of those surveyed believed that an entrepreneurial mindset and self-awareness would be critical, with organizational ability ranked lowest, with only 4% of those surveyed mentioning it.  
Apart from compiling a more or less predictable list of skills that are said to help avoid or minimize the impact of AI, the highlight of the report is the words of the 28 experts included in it.  Reading them, one can discern three different currents among them: those who believe that AI will not be such a systemic change, those who believe that skills need to be reordered (the vast majority), and those who argue that the social contract is just around the corner. is about to change, with a revolution in how we understand work, because people will be displaced.
An important tool, but not that revolutionary
Robert Buckland, a senior adviser at Engine AI, a company that helps other companies implement AI, is a leading voice among experts who don’t believe it will have such a systemic impact.  Buckland says the first thing he did when he received questions from Citi was translate them to two of today’s leading chatbots.  “They gave me very similar answers.  Gain digital skills, practice human-AI collaboration, develop critical thinking, the most humane humanities, and continue to learn throughout your life.  It was as if both AIs were reacting the same way.  When I escalated the questions to my colleagues at Engine AI, I received much more detailed answers,” he begins by explaining. 
According to Buckland, one of his colleagues responded: Whatever you decide to improve, you should never lose sight of the impact of AI.  “Learning languages ​​helps with analytical and critical thinking, as well as understanding other cultures, but don’t expect to get a job as a translator.”  Another suggested that he choose professions that are less threatened by AI.  “You may be an electrician or a plumber, but even there you will likely be using AI to better compete with other electricians and plumbers.” 
Finally they responded that maybe it wasn’t that revolutionary.  “AI is a tool.  Just like Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel.  They all help improve productivity.  Anyone who does not use these tools is already left behind today.  Word and Excel are necessary but not sufficient for success in many of today’s professions.  AI will be no exception.” 
Technology that changes what matters 
Most of the experts in the Citi report fall into this category: they believe that AI will change the employment paradigm because it will change what knowledge is important and what is not.  Carl Benedikt Frey, associate professor of artificial intelligence at the Oxford Internet Institute, says there is a short answer to the question of which skills will be key: “all those that AI is not good at.”  The short answer is yes, but that by no means closes the question because then comes the definition of what they are. 





  



Benedikt Frey believes that personal communication and creativity are among the fundamental elements.  Widespread assumption.  Other experts, such as Chris Butt, founder of Cognisess and Yondur, a human resources company, add emotional intelligence, critical thinking and adaptability.  Many people agree with this short list. 
Bill Schaninger, advisor to Modern Executive Solutions, emphasizes the fact that knowledge of artificial intelligence itself and leadership will be two important assets to keep in mind.  Another point of agreement among experts is that the education system is destined to be very different, or at least it should be from their point of view.  In addition to suggesting that AI should be taught across disciplines rather than just methods, they believe the system should focus on teaching skills such as adaptation, problem solving and lifelong learning rather than being based on “memorization and regurgitation”.  information.”    
A revolution that will make us obsolete
Anton Korinek, a professor at the University of Virginia and Darden School of Business, may be the expert who offers the most troubling vision.  First, Korinek distinguishes between time frames.  “In the next five years, the most important skill for office workers will be the ability to use AI versatility.  The good side is that the technologies we have and will have in the short term make people more productive, the bad side is that they reduce the market value of human capital,” he says about the very near future. 
“In the medium to long term, it is foreseeable that artificial intelligence systems will be able to be more efficient than humans in all cognitive functions, including jobs requiring creativity or emotional intelligence.  Leaders of major artificial intelligence labs estimate that this will happen in less than five years, but I think it will take a couple more years.  Robotics won’t be far behind when it comes to automating physical tasks.  My fear is that human labor will become an obsolete asset,” he says. 
Given the difficulty of understanding this idea, Korinek uses a comparison.  “If you were born 200 years ago, gaining physical strength would make you a more valuable worker.  Since then, mechanization has reduced the value of physical strength in employment.  Just as the legendary John Henry succumbed to the tireless efficiency of the steam engine, office workers will also see their labor costs fall, only at a much faster rate.”  According to the professor, neither people, nor companies, nor governments are ready for what will happen.  He believes that if we want to preserve democracy and humanity in a world in which robots and artificial intelligence do cognitive and physical work better than we can, we need to rethink the role of work and the structure of the economic system. 
“Instead of engaging in a futile zero-sum game in which we try to counteract the effects of increasingly efficient machines with more varied abilities, we need to focus our efforts on making AI have human values.  At the same time, we must update our economic system to ensure that the benefits of AI are available to everyone.  We must act now,” Korinek concludes.  
Whatever happens, which no one knows for sure yet, Citi is leaving something undeniable in its document.  “AI will not wait for anyone.  “The race between the progress of artificial intelligence and the ability of humans to adapt has already begun.”

Asana's Work Innovation Lab has just released the State of AI at Work 2024 report, and it is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research regarding generative AI to date. The report discusses surprising use cases for the technology at work, breaks down the path to widespread AI usage, and explores adoption mindsets and the journey organizations must embark upon. This report moves the research and discussion beyond who is using AI and for what purpose and gets into the nuance of what it means, how it feels, and what opportunities it unlocks. All statistics referenced throughout the rest of this article are from Asana's report.


A new way for companies to assess where they are on their AI journey
Companies are at an AI tipping point. More than half (52%) of knowledge workers now use generative AI weekly — a 44% increase in just nine months. People are using it whether companies have a plan for AI or not — and only 31% of companies have a formal AI strategy in place. Those companies without a plan had better pick up the pace.

A good starting point is to figure out where they are on Asana's AI maturity model, which is detailed in the report. It consists of five stages: skepticism, activation, experimentation, scaling, and maturity. Rebecca Hinds, head of the Asana Work Innovation Lab, discusses the maturity model and the highlights of the report.

PROMOTED
When it comes to adoption, ""It's not that everyone should be at stage five,"" Hinds says. ""Rather, it's about how you get to that next step of the maturity curve.""

That journey itself brings opportunities and challenges. ""What stood out to me was how the concerns change as you move step to step,"" says Hinds. ""Concerns are inevitable, and they are healthy, but if you are less mature in your implementation of AI, the concerns are going to center on comprehension and understanding of how to use the technology. As companies reach those more mature stages, concerns shift toward ethics and responsible AI.""
This is a helpful guideline for how organizations should tailor their approach. Less mature companies should probably focus on comprehension, whereas those who have fully embedded AI will be more focused on ethics and re-designing jobs.

AI adoption is about mastering mindsets
55% of workers feel optimistic about using generative AI compared to just six months ago, and that optimism undoubtedly fuels experimentation. The top use cases for AI at work are email generation, information summarization, content generation, technical writing, ideation and brainstorming, and data analysis.

""The use case that stood out to me was brainstorming,"" says Hinds. ""There's this overwhelming narrative that the one aspect of human work AI can't take over is the creative thinking, brainstorming, and ideation."" A theory the study posits is that generative AI can help overcome ""blank page syndrome"" as well as provide feedback on initial ideas before they are shared in a group brainstorming setting.

Leadership modeling is one of the most important tools for any behavior change initiative, and executives are embracing AI at higher rates than people at all other levels of the organization. While 69% of executives report using generative AI at work at least weekly, only 43% of individual contributors do the same.
""Executives are more confident in their own skill set, and they are less concerned about job replacement,"" says Hinds. ""This is largely because they are responsible for strategic work that has yet to be replaced — most skill displacement at the moment is with administrative tasks.""
""So much of the learning at the moment is happening through personal experimentation and personal exposure, and a lot of executive learning is coming from conferences and that exposure has been helpful for executives to at least understand potential use cases of the technology,"" she says. This highlights a resource gap in training provided for executives and individual contributors. Executives are twice as likely to say that their organization has allocated budget for generative AI training.
Companies need to train their people and encourage experimentation, but framing messages correctly is incredibly important to overcome hesitancy in adoption — especially in unfamiliar areas. 64% of knowledge workers have little to no familiarity with the generative AI tools they could use at work. They're less enthusiastic about it as well, with only 50% being excited about the possibilities of AI vs 67% of executives.
""The way we frame technology in the stories we tell and the metaphors we use as we bring them into our organization matters — and it matters significantly for those individual contributors,"" says Hinds. She also isolates the word ""artificial"" as particularly problematic. ""It seems less real, more scary, and more like a black box. Why can't we replace it with 'amplified' or 'augmented' to convey that this technology is meant to amplify our human skills? It's not meant to be in conflict.""
Where's the best place to start embedding AI throughout the organization?
Hinds points out that AI is only going to improve. Therefore, this is the prime time to experiment with AI and learn with the technology as new models develop. You can't just dabble and expect to see results, though. 39% of ""dabblers"" report productivity gains whereas 89% of daily users report productivity gains. The message to employees is: start experimenting.
For companies, Hinds also has a clear starting point. ""One step you can take, no matter where your organization is on its AI journey, is to establish a set of principles for AI. Often executives will push back against having a concrete policy for AI, saying that it's too early for official guidelines, but even if you're super early on your journey, you can put together a list of principles in terms of how you see the role AI plays in your organization. What are your underlying beliefs in how the technology should be used?""
Hinds emphasizes that humans are at the heart of this. ""We should be building for human and AI teams and adopting a human-centric approach."" Even if they don't understand the technology, they still need to know the intention of bringing it into the workplace. ""When people see AI as a teammate rather than a tool, they're interacting with it differently. They tend to think more broadly about the use cases and how they can work with the technology — not just what it can do for them.""

Study finds UK organisations broadly deploying generative AI to support existing jobs, but execs say employment not affected

 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not yet replacing jobs in the UK, but is being broadly deployed to support existing roles, a study has found, indicating that fears the technology would have an immediate effect on employment may have been exaggerated.
Nearly three-quarters of UK tech leaders, such as chief information officers and chief technology officers, said they had deployed generative AI to at least some employees, but 99 percent said it was not yet replacing jobs, found the Tuesday study by digital services consultancy Nash Squared.
More than half of respondents were instead using generative AI to support existing jobs, the study found.
“In our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary,” said Nash Squared chief executive Bev White.

AI business case
She added that the study indicated organisations with company-wide generative AI deployments were actually more likely than the average to be increasing tech headcount over the next year.
Organisations are rapidly bringing in policies and even chief officers to specifically handle generative AI, with the number of firms with such policies doubling over the past six months.
One in twenty UK-based firms now have chief AI officers, a figure Nash said it expects to rise over time to one in ten.
Nearly 40 percent of UK tech leaders said they remained concerned about the misuse of generative AI tools while more than half, or 55 percent, said they had yet to find a clear business case for them beyond personal productivity.

Budgets were also a constraining factor, with 27 percent citing this as an impediment to rolling out the technology.
A recent study found that public awareness of generative AI lagged far behind the industry’s hype around the technology, with 30 percent of respondents in the UK saying they had never heard of it.
Tech investment
Investment in technology generally remained strong for UK tech leaders, with 43 percent expecting to increase their tech budget in the next 12 months and just over one-third expecting to increase their tech headcount.
Sixty-seven percent said they were being held back by the economy, but there was a general expectation that things would bounce back by the start of next year.
Firms have also begun increasing the number of days employees were expected in the office, with 19 percent doing so in the past six months, typically moving from 2-3 days to 3 days.
Some 87 percent said they found hybrid arrangements were working ‘quite’ or ‘extremely well’, but the study noted that more days in the office did have an impact on issues such as diverse hiring.
Sixty-six percent of UK tech leaders said progress on sustainability had either stayed the same or declined, and a similar 68 percent reported the same with diversity initiatives.

The remarkable rise of generative artificial intelligence opened a universe of potential and brought a flood of founders and investors into the sector. 
As a result, Generative AI will usher in a new age of human creativity, but only once we work with it properly. 





Generative AI’s most profound implications and incredible possibilities are in creativity and content, where you find the challenges that will shape its future. 
Understanding Generative AI’s current shortcomings and how to remedy them will determine future success. The “first movers” of the AI craze involve industries and sectors with seriously outdated processes; it took Generative AI to start a change, but anything would have helped. 
But first, companies need to focus on the right problems and create models that enable human brilliance and continuously capture it.
Why what works for process does not work for content
The problems with content stem from a process that was under no pressure to evolve for centuries. Newspapers and TV channels, for example, had a virtual monopoly on the flow of verified information into society, until, suddenly, they didn’t.  
- A message from our partner -
The effect of this legacy is starkest in journalism. The loss of impactful but labour-intensive work, like investigations, and the urge to drive traffic through extreme biases and sensationalism are harming the world. Quantity rose, but quality fell away. 
And that is key to understanding the issue facing Generative AI. 
The hard part is not “Generating” the work. The hard part is conceiving the idea, finding new information, choosing how to present it, and then presenting it. It is a shifting confluence of quantifiable and intangible factors that inform a good content decision. 





It is ridiculous to think that automating creative micro-decisions that factor in culture, moments in time, society, and language will produce good content. 
You can automate to average at best – only by relying on information, media assets, and observations made outside your automation. 
For the first movers, it is straightforward to feed financial, harvest, or supply chain data into a model that brings it up at a demand. This disguises the “hard parts”, gathering the data (the work of many people over many years) and then the end-decision, or combined effect of a series of decisions, made by highly specialised people. 
To make original, accurate, and valuable content requires nuanced judgements enabled by being close to throughput – the entire production line behind the final output of content. 
Both the inputs and outputs of a single piece of creative work require subtleties of judgement of equal importance to any larger-scale decisions – and if the labour-saving factors do not perfectly alleviate the need to make those decisions, those process stages are not improved. 
In fact, in that scenario they’ve become worse: if you have to edit a single sentence or brush-stroke, being distanced from the labour becomes a severe disadvantage. Anyone who takes a minor creative risk – a quirk in their video, or a play in words that tests the rules of grammar – beats everything you produce. 
Even if you nail it, content evolves so subtly and so quickly, you end up in the same position. The less labour-intensive it becomes, the faster it evolves and the faster audience expectations rise. 
Tools change, but people don’t. Spellcheck did not eliminate the need for literacy – it just made us write faster. 
Reimagining people, AI, and process for a new content reality
AI will always work best when built around the fundamental skills and creative powers of actual – good – journalists, creatives, and writers: to originate a story, fact-check it, and approve it for publication; to conceive ambitious artwork, refine it, and bring it together. 
This is not a prophecy of doom – it’s the start of a revolutionary age for creativity. This is why I created my company and spent 5 years proving it across every possible scenario. Those who do content well will win big, but that means combining human brilliance with AI as a solution. 





The latest Google update obliterated a host of companies using generative AI to spam the world. I’ve seen this happen up close – a client insisted on using us for localisation only, and used ChatGPT to lay out their drafts. It went well for 6 weeks – then their entire investment went up in smoke. 
There is already a lot of content—content about everywhere and everything—but it is rarely informative, assuming it is accurate. We do not need more. 
That client experiment happened before Google’s update – it was natural selection. 
Authority in content will proliferate as specialists in niche areas emerge, their quality standing out from a sea of mediocrity. That means the winners will also become the de facto authorities for their niches. 
General-purpose, average content rapidly becomes useless. Even if that content has great SEO, Search is adapting to the new reality, and even if optimised-but-average content gets traffic for now, it will lose audience trust. 
How mistakes in generative AI happen
Every time a new tool comes on the market to “solve” some content aspect, another countdown begins. 
Huge investment is going into Generative AI wrappers that have focused use cases but no competency in originating the inputs they get from ChatGPT. Even those that approach it differently have the same flawed assumptions about the product. 
Using GPT-4 or an equivalent to automate a structure for SEO, by definition, guarantees that those structures will end up classed as spam, whether by search engines or by people. 
People are pouring money in because they can understand and contextualise the application of Generative AI with other technologies, but it is a victim of the same forces that plagued content investments. 
Those who know content are not thinking differently; those who think differently don’t know enough about content to understand the problems to solve, let alone how to break the problems down into solvable processes. They either don’t credit disciplines other than their own (usually coding and climbing academic ladders) or think automating to a finished product will de facto eliminate the issue. 





The best example is “fact-checking.” What startups really mean is corroborating via news sources or Wikipedia, etc. – this is not real fact-checking (which goes much deeper). It kills the chance for editorial judgements on information and the opportunity for subtle style changes. 
The developers may not see that as either possible or relevant – and that is precisely why they are not qualified to make these judgements. Content specialists, journalists, and media leaders share the blame here: holdover attitudes from before the digital age stifle original thinking and remain prevalent across age cohorts. 
The safest route, so the thinking goes, is to make tools. That can work, but not to the potential that Generative AI should carry. 
Investors want to back tools they can license. Imagine the best-case scenario: a dream client plugs all these new AI solutions into their centralised system. Now, they theoretically have less to do – but even if it works perfectly, internal and external expectations shift, and they suddenly have to manage a Frankenstein monster of plugins for just a subtle difference. That is more work, not less, just to maintain an average outcome. 
Founders and investors who do not understand how the above scenario is inevitable will be ruthlessly punished by the market. There is no out-spending that fate. 
Why solving Generative AI reveals the future of work
Content is about people, society, and how we think. It is the basic social function of communicating an idea – through both language and all that is left unsaid – from one person to another. Whether a mock bird call in the jungle, an immersive VR experience of the aftermath of war, or rebellious fashion trends. 
What sets Generative AI apart from prevailing wisdom is that the enormity of its potential demands a correspondent revolution in content processes. 
Generative AI demands a total rethink of how we work with technology, and how to reconstitute work itself. 





Everything from how content is made, to how expertise is cultivated – even how people are found, trained, and engaged – has to be remade to fit a system that enables higher thinking. That system can then enable the capture of “higher thought”, leading to the cultivation of Generative AI models with functions that have lasting creative and informational utility. 
To do this, every element of these Generative AI systems has to be radically different from what came before. That includes how you develop talent as well as technology. 
Every process must deliver efficiency gains on its own, work as part of a grander whole, and allow for managing, adjusting, and optimising AI throughout the system. The leaps of efficiency these radical changes demand must be apparent at scale, at the micro level, and when evaluating every element independently. 
This is how you build the flexibility creativity demands into a Generative AI solution. 
Integrating people with technology
Content has a bright future – the brightest ever – but it will only come by moving us closer to the core of what content really is: extracting an intangible “idea” out of the world and getting it to other human brains. 
Current Generative AI thinking distances people from influencing content’s communicative core, and that needs to change. 
Changing processes in this way will be extraordinarily difficult, from understanding the necessity to conceiving how and all the way through to implementation. It will take a lot of hard work to accomplish these goals. 
And so it should. 
What comes after will be the true age of creativity, dwarfing anything humanity achieved before. It is worth the struggle.

Westlaw Precision Australia combines cutting-edge technology with the authority of more than a century of legal knowledgePaid for byAbout this contentMon 17 Jun 2024 21.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Jun 2024 21.44 EDTShareImproving work-life balance and increasing productivity: is the future of the legal profession already here?Imagine approaching a routine task with the groundwork done for you. For lawyers who conduct legal research, this can be a reality, thanks to the launch of AI-assisted research on the Westlaw Precision Australia platform by Thomson Reuters.Typically, legal work, including research, can take days or even weeks, based on the complexities and nuances of the law and facts in any case. In Westlaw Precision Australia, lawyers can ask the AI-assisted tool a legal question, just as they might ask a trusted colleague. The tool reads and responds to the question at superhuman speed, using Thomson Reuters’ trusted content.As AI technology aids the legal profession by simplifying research, James Jarvis, the vice-president of global legal solutions for Thomson Reuters Asia and emerging markets, says there are enormous implications for lawyer workflow and the profession more broadly.View image in fullscreen“This is at the heart of AI-assisted research on Westlaw Precision Australia; less time hunting for relevant information unlocks time to focus on other things, such as the quality of work product and legal strategy,” he says.If lawyers spend less time finding the law, they have more time to spend on creative advice and strategy to achieve the best outcomes for clients.Jarvis says Thomson Reuters is developing responsible AI focused on augmenting and accelerating how lawyers work, rather than trying to replace them with technology.Driven by natural language, generative AI is human centricThomson Reuters is synonymous with information. The company has been a provider of legal information in Australia since 1898. Globally, it leads knowledge communities with technology-based solutions across law, news and media, tax and accounting.For more than a decade, AI has been used in Westlaw to enable information retrieval and document summarisation. The difference with Westlaw Precision Australia is that large language models (LLMs) have improved search responses in unprecedented ways.Generative AI that uses LLMs is based on transformers trained on massive datasets – this is what the large refers to – enabling the network to learn context and meaning. It’s the learning and language that are key here.View image in fullscreen

LLMs recognise, summarise, and generate natural language and content. Thomson Reuters’ use of LLMs is specifically focused on the legal information they provide to Australian lawyers.“When answering the lawyer’s question,” Jarvis says, “we focus the LLM on the exact language of Australian law, and we tell the AI: ‘Don’t just answer the question based on your statistical understanding of language patterns; use that understanding and specifically use it with these Australian cases, legislation and regulations.’One of the most powerful advances is generative AI’s capacity for understanding context, which makes results customised, adaptive and intelligible.The rapidly advancing technology is only as relevant as the customers and clients at the centre of these deep learning technologies, Jarvis says. “Generative AI legal search on Westlaw Precision Australia is enabled by a conversational user experience, which humanises and simplifies our sophisticated legal technology, making it easier for lawyers to use every day.”Unlocking value through the power of generative AIAI-assisted research on Westlaw Precision Australia analyses and identifies Australian primary law relevant to the lawyer’s often complex and nuanced questions, delivering answers that are synthesised from the relevant passages of the law. Footnotes to the passages in identifiable legal authorities ensure accuracy and confidence, because the AI response is based on Australian law.View image in fullscreenThis is light years away from keywords and Boolean searches that restricted results to exact matches and required the lawyer to review long lists of cases, statutes and regulations.“This is Thomson Reuters’ responsible AI at its best, shifting much of the research from the lawyer to the technology,” Jarvis says. “We’re accelerating and augmenting a thorough research process.”There can be no doubt that AI is exponentially transforming our working lives, but lawyers have a low tolerance for bias, so the tools they use must be trustworthy and authoritative, not just fast.“What we do know is firms are increasingly actively looking at ways to drive more value from the time they are given back,” Jarvis says.Time translates to value, but the process must be trusted for it to be useful. Jarvis says the advantages that AI offers are in step with the trusted technological solutions Thomson Reuters has always delivered.Generative AI is changing the legal profession and Thomson Reuters’ Westlaw Precision AI-assisted research is leading the way.Explore more on these topicsThomson Reuters: AI futuresadvertisement featuresShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI Set to Disrupt Jobs and Widen Inequality, IMF Warns

 18 June 2024 In Business, Technology  Business Matters 





The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued a stark warning about the profound labour disruptions and inequality that generative AI may cause, urging governments to bolster economic protections to safeguard their economies.

In a recent report, the IMF highlighted that advancements in AI technology could lead to significant job market disruptions, particularly affecting higher-skilled professions. Unlike previous technological shifts, generative AI might result in substantial job losses in roles requiring advanced skills, potentially exacerbating economic disparities.
To address these challenges, the IMF recommends that governments strengthen unemployment insurance and other safety nets to support workers displaced by AI advancements. Enhancing these measures is essential to protecting the well-being of citizens and maintaining economic stability.
Despite these concerns, the IMF acknowledges AI’s potential to boost productivity and enhance public service delivery. However, the rapid adoption of this technology introduces significant risks that must be managed carefully. In response, the European Union has proposed the AI Act, a comprehensive regulation aimed at mitigating AI-related dangers, including potentially banning applications that threaten safety and fundamental rights.
**Educational and Training System Updates**
Preparing for the future requires updating education and training systems. As the job market evolves, there will be a greater need for lifelong learning and opportunities for workers to reskill and adapt to new roles. The IMF’s report emphasizes the importance of sector-based training, apprenticeships, and reskilling programs to help workers transition to new tasks and sectors in an AI-driven economy.
“We want people to benefit broadly from the potential that this technology holds and ensure that opportunities are created for them,” said Era Dabla-Norris, deputy director at the IMF’s fiscal affairs department and co-author of the report. She noted that the “transition could be painful for workers” facing longer unemployment spells due to a lack of necessary skills in the age of AI, which may require more time to acquire than in the past.
**Industry Insights**
Sheila Flavell CBE, COO of FDM Group, stressed the need for a collaborative effort between government, education, and industry to provide a level playing field and ensure staff can safely maximise AI benefits. She advocated for a combination of apprenticeship schemes and upskilling and reskilling programmes to create digitally adept multigenerational workforces.
Dr Adeshola Cole, CEO of Tritek Consulting, emphasised the importance of staff equipping themselves with the necessary skills to manage AI development. He highlighted the rush by organisations to adopt AI tools, often without having the digitally skilled staff to manage AI risks, underscoring the need for practical sector-based training.
Sai Bendi, Software Development Manager at Encompass Corporation, pointed out that employers must provide the learning and development support needed for individuals to keep up with technological changes and feel confident in utilising AI solutions effectively.
As generative AI continues to transform industries, the IMF’s warning underscores the urgency for comprehensive strategies to manage its impact on the job market and ensure equitable economic growth.

<p>""AI is a business imperative. With generative AI being used by 88% of knowledge workers at work, it is impressive to see employees in Hong Kong are much more willing to empower themselves to adopt innovations than most other regions. However, AI transformation is not a one-time event – it's an ongoing journey that requires leaders' commitment, adaptability, and strategic leadership,"" said&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://hk.linkedin.com/in/cally-chan-8a5b5731""><strong>Cally Chan</strong></a></strong>, general manager of Microsoft Hong Kong and Macau.</p>

<p>Moreover, the study uncovers a strategic approach by Hong Kong leaders in&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/sustainability-and-it-infrastructure-hurdle-ai-deployment-in-singapores-public-sector/""><strong>AI deployment</strong></a></strong>. A significant 86% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work, indicating a high level of personal investment in the technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also noteworthy that 23%&nbsp;of AI power users likely heard about the importance of using generative AI at work from their CEO, showing a top-down approach to promoting AI adoption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, 77% of leaders are more inclined to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them, highlighting the value they place on AI proficiency.</p>

Alex Gay, Sr. Director of Product Marketing, Adobe Document Cloud 
Enterprise knowledge workers face numerous obstacles that hinder their productivity, including information overload, manual data entry, and repetitive tasks. Documents are at the center of their work, containing critical information that knowledge workers need to extract, analyze, and transform into valuable insights. That is where AI comes in; it has immense potential to help knowledge workers quickly analyze large volumes of data, identify patterns, and provide valuable insights. Today, we announced new advances in Acrobat AI Assistant with those benefits in mind, helping customers unlock new levels of productivity by supercharging their document-related tasks including data extraction, summarization, content generation, and review. 
But exactly how much time is saved? What are the quantifiable productivity gains? To better assess the impact that AI Assistant has on enterprise productivity, we commissioned benchmark research conducted by Pfeiffer Consulting to analyze the efficiency and productivity gains of AI Assistant across various lines of business. ​ The study covered 16 real-world workflow scenarios in Sales, Human Resources, Legal & Compliance, Marketing & Communications, Finance, and Research & Development. ​
The research findings revealed that Acrobat AI Assistant was on average four times faster than traditional methods for 16 different knowledge worker tasks. ​For complex assignments, such as summarizing complex safety protocols, AI Assistant saved almost two hours. ​ The research reported that by speeding up time-consuming and repetitive tasks, AI Assistant frees up time, concentration, and creativity for higher-value aspects of a project. ​ The versatility of AI Assistant allows it to execute a variety of document-related tasks, including providing insights, answering questions, retrieving, and organizing information, comparing documents, and composing texts in various styles. ​
Driving productivity gains across all departments
The research highlighted 5 key lines of business that represent common tasks and challenges faced by knowledge workers. Each covered different levels of complexity, from simple fact-finding tasks to more complex assignments such as summarizing safety protocols or creating detailed presentations based on industry trend reports: 

Sales: Traditionally, summarizing a product brochure, creating a short presentation, and summarizing findings in an email for clients took 46 minutes. ​ However, with AI Assistant, the same workflow could be completed in under 12 minutes, representing time savings of over 70%. ​This allows sales professionals to focus on higher-value aspects of their work, such as client interactions and strategic planning. ​
Human Resources: Human resource professionals spend a significant amount of time digging for information across multiple documents, including resumes, employee records, and policy documents. With AI Assistant, HR professionals completed tasks in significantly less time. For example, summarizing leave benefits from an employee handbook took under five minutes with AI Assistant, compared to almost 20 minutes without it. This enables HR professionals to be more efficient in sharing information with executives and employees.
Legal: Creating a legal brief from a research report traditionally took just under one hour. ​ AI Assistant reduced the time spent on this task to just under nine minutes by prompting the five key subjects and copying and pasting the results into Word for further editing. ​ This significant time-saving allows legal professionals to allocate more time to other critical tasks.
Research & Development: ​ AI Assistant resulted in a substantial reduction in time spent on administrative tasks in the research and development domain, which can help drive more efficiency and focus on core research activities, leading to faster innovation and development cycles. ​​
Marketing & Communications: ​ Creating a blog post from a 3000-word article traditionally took nearly an hour and a half. ​ AI Assistant reduced the time it takes to write the blog post by less than a third, thanks to its ability to generate two versions of the blog post. ​ The writer can then paste the blog post into Word for additional editing and refinement. ​ This time-saving allows marketers to produce content more efficiently.

The City of Gilbert, Arizona is one example of a large organization using AI to turn document data into actionable insights and free up time for more valuable tasks. 
“With one of the highest population growth rates in the country, Gilbert, Arizona is undergoing rapid transformation, and our organization is exploring AI technologies to support this growth,” said Eugene Meijia, Chief AI Strategy and Transformation Officer, City of Gilbert, Arizona. “We see a lot of potential in Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant to enable our town to significantly cut down the time it takes to review and update policy documents, synthesize large plans or proposals, and analyze prior events. With Adobe’s document expertise and approach to protecting the integrity of data and AI responses, getting our security and compliance team on board with Adobe was quite straightforward.” 
Adapting to knowledge worker styles
AI Assistant caters to both non-specialized and specialized knowledge workers. ​ Non-specialized users, such as students, bloggers, social media professionals, and HR assistants, can benefit from AI Assistant’s ability to quickly parse and extract data from PDFs and generate summaries. ​ Specialized users, such as auditors, patent attorneys, financial analysts, contract attorneys, and senior research scientists, can leverage AI Assistant to streamline complex tasks involving specialized material. ​ It enables them to retrieve specific information, perform comparisons and compilations, structure documents, and even generate sophisticated texts based on document content. ​
The Pfeiffer research highlights the diverse advantages AI Assistant offers across various business sectors, from HR to research and development. These benefits include boosted productivity, diminished manual effort, enhanced accuracy, and improved compliance. It also underscores that AI Assistant significantly streamlines document-related tasks, enabling knowledge workers to focus on more valuable activities that drive business success. Download the full report and learn more about how customers can use AI Assistant to supercharge their productivity here.

Among recent updates and controversies including high-level defections, last month the company quietly announced Media Manager, scheduled for release in 2025. A tool purportedly designed to allow creators and content owners to control how their work is used, Media Manager is really a shameless attempt to evade responsibility for the theft of artists’ intellectual property that OpenAI is already profiting from.OpenAI says this tool would allow creators to identify their work and choose whether to exclude it from AI training processes. But this does nothing to address the fact that the company built its foundational models using authors’ and other creators’ works without consent, compensation or control over how OpenAI users will be able to imitate the artists’ styles to create new works. As it’s described, Media Manager puts the burden on creators to protect their work and fails to address the company’s past legal and ethical transgressions. This overture is like having your valuables stolen from your home and then hearing the thief say, “Don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance to opt out of future burglaries ... next year.” Advertisement             Hollywood Inc.   Apple announces deal with OpenAI. Will it be a game-changer?   Apple announced new artificial intelligence-powered tools, including a partnership with OpenAI that allows Siri to surface answers from ChatGPT. June 10, 2024   Writers, artists, journalists and other creative workers have consistently asked that OpenAI and other generative AI companies obtain creators’ consent before using their work to train artificial intelligence products, and that the organizations refrain from using works without express permission. Last July, more than 16,000 authors signed a letter to leading AI companies demanding that the businesses obtain permission and pay for works they use to train their AI. Yet OpenAI continues to trample on artists’ rights and rebuff their appeals, as we saw recently when it launched a ChatGPT audio assistant with a voice similar to Scarlett Johansson’s despite the actor’s clear and repeated refusals.Although Johansson won her battle — OpenAI “paused” the offending voice from its offerings after the actor threatened legal action — the best chance for the wider community of artists is to band together. AI companies’ cavalier attitude toward creators’ rights and consent extends to people at all levels of fame.         Hollywood Inc.   Scarlett Johansson also thinks OpenAI’s new voice sounds like her. She’s not happy about it   Johansson, who portrayed the voice of a computer program in ‘Her,’ was not behind OpenAI’s ‘Sky’ voice assistant. Another actor provided the voice, OpenAI said. May 20, 2024   Last year the Authors Guild, along with 17 other plaintiffs, sued OpenAI and Microsoft, demanding that authors receive what they are due. That suit is ongoing and other creative professionals and copyright owners have also taken legal action. Among these are a class action filed by visual artists against Stability AI, Runway AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art, a lawsuit by music publishers against Anthropic for infringement of song lyrics, and suits in the U.S. and U.K. brought by Getty Images against Stability AI for copyright infringement of photographs.   AI companies often argue that it would be impossible for them to license all the content that they need and that doing so would bring progress to a grinding halt. This is simply untrue. OpenAI has signed a succession of licensing agreements with publishers large and small. While the exact terms of these agreements are rarely released to the public, the compensation estimates pale in comparison with the vast outlays for computing power and energy that the company readily spends. Payments to authors would have minimal effects on AI companies’ war chests, but receiving royalties for AI training use would be a meaningful new revenue stream for a profession that’s already suffering.Authors’ earnings have been in precipitous decline for more than a decade. In 2022, the median annual writing-related income for full-time writers was just over $20,000, down nearly 50% from 2009. And the data for 2023 look even more dire. AI-generated books, sometimes listed as written by real authors without the writer’s permission, flood Amazon, where anyone searching might buy them instead of the creative work the human author spent months or years writing. Meanwhile, OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, Anthropic at $18.4 billion and French AI startup Mistral at $6.2 billion. These companies claim they need our work to succeed but can’t afford to pay for it. Any human author can tell you that this narrative has blatant inconsistencies.We cannot trust tech companies that swear their innovations are so important that they do not need to pay for one of the main ingredients — other people’s creative works. The “better future” we are being sold by OpenAI and others is, in fact, a dystopia. It’s time for creative professionals to stand together, demand what we are owed and determine our own futures.

The Air Force and Space Force last week unveiled their own experimental tool — the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-Training Transformer, or NIPRGPT. And in 2023, the Navy rolled out a conversational AI program called Amelia that sailors could use to troubleshoot problems or provide tech support.Swanson said she’s optimistic about the potential for generative AI, especially for laborious specialties like contract writing and policy where automation could release some strain on the Army’s workforce.“In the area of contracts and in the area of policy, I think there’s a huge return on investment for us,” she said. “Might [AI] one day be able to write a contract? We hope so. But we’ve got to pilot and test it and make sure everybody’s comfortable with it first.”The large language model the service will use for the effort is different from systems like ChatGPT, Swanson said, because it is trained on Army data. It will also provide citations that indicate where the data it provides originated, a feature that will help the service fact-check that information.The pilot is part of a broader effort within the Army to identify both the pitfalls and the opportunities that come with widely adopting AI tools. In March, the service announced a 100-day plan focused on reducing the risk associated with integrating AI algorithms.As part of that exercise, Swanson said, the Army reviewed its spending on AI research and found that testing and security are the two biggest gaps toward fielding these tools more broadly. The service also identified 32 risks and 66 mitigations it can implement to reduce their impact. Further, it created a generative AI policy that it will apply to the pilot in order to set parameters for the effort. That policy includes a requirement that there be a “human in the loop.”The generative AI pilot will lead into the next phase of the effort — a 16-month focus on how to use the technology operationally. Findings from that work will inform the Army’s budget for fiscal 2026.“So the 100 day plan is setting the conditions — where are we at — and then the 500 day plan is really about operationalizing it,” she said.Florent Groberg, vice president of strategy and optimization at private investment firm AE Industrial partners, said that as the Army moves through these review processes and experiments with AI, it should be transparent with industry about what it wants and then move quickly to leverage the tools companies are developing.“To me, it’s really understanding the framework of what you want to accomplish,” he said during the same panel with Swanson. “Put some boundaries out there and then go do it.”About  Courtney AlbonCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

This allows them to spend more time on creative tasks (53%) and with their family (49%), as well as end their work day earlier (45%).Respondents mostly used generative AI to draft communications (44%), summarise long-form content (34%) and brainstorm (34%).The study by enterprise AI and automation company UiPath also found that Singaporean workers believe generative AI tools can drive greater business value. Nearly half (58%) think those tools have the context needed from their business's own data to support business processes and drive value.However, they are concerned about security risks (38%), inaccurate output (34%) and compliance risks (31%) when using generative AI. They also experience a lack of direction around company policy on the use of generative AI tools, with 42% indicating that their company has not offered any training or guidelines on how to use the technology.“To realise Singapore’s ambition to become a global AI hub through the National AI Strategy 2.0, wide adoption of technologies like generative AI and business automation will be critical to sustaining its competitive advantage in a digital economy. For businesses that haven’t been able to turn AI potential into results, automation is a crucial piece of the puzzle that makes AI actionable. To inculcate a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, as well as strategic private-public partnerships will be key to help workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI,” says Jess O’Reilly, area vice president for Asia at UiPath.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in SingaporeConfronting the generative AI paradox: Unpacking business challengesTech news in less than 5 minutes – June 2024What does it take to strengthen collaboration in a hybrid workplace?Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the WorldGet in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trendsFollow the market issue situation with our daily updatesOr want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

This evolutionary process will have to be coaxed along with high levels of methodological rigor, risk awareness and nimble adaptability—not just from the government but from all interested parties.The conviction comes through between the lines of a June 17 blog post authored by Troy Tazbaz, director of the FDA’s Digital Health Center of Excellence.Launched in 2020 as a branch of the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the DHCoE works to “foster responsible AI innovations in healthcare,” Tazbaz reminds, “while ensuring these technologies, when intended for use as medical devices, are safe and effective for the end-users, including patients.”Noting the center’s desire to encourage collaboration between healthcare AI stakeholders and its own people, Tazbaz offers three observations to help foster the requisite harmony. 1. Life-cycle planning for AI models can reduce risk. By adopting agreed-upon standards and best practices covering the various phases of AI models’ lifespans, stakeholders can actively help mitigate risks for the long term, Tazbaz suggests. “This includes, for instance, approaches to ensure that data suitability, collection and quality match the intent and risk profile of the AI model that is being trained,” he writes. More:  ‘The healthcare community together could agree on common methodologies that provide information to a diverse range of end users, including patients, on how the model was trained, deployed and managed through robust monitoring tools and operational discipline.’2. Quality-assurance measures can positively impact clinical outcomes.Continuous performance monitoring before, during and after deployment is one way to carry QA through an AI model’s life cycle, Tazbaz points out. Meanwhile transparency and accountability “can help stakeholders feel comfortable with AI technologies.” More: ‘Quality assurance and risk management, right-sized for healthcare institutions of all sizes, can help provide confidence that AI models are developed, tested and evaluated on data that is representative of the population for which they are intended.’3. Shared responsibility can help ensure success. Efforts around AI quality assurance “have sprung up at a grassroots level across the U.S. and are starting to bear fruit,” Tazbaz writes. “Solution developers, healthcare organizations and the U.S. federal government are working to explore and develop best practices for quality assurance of AI in healthcare settings.” More: ‘These efforts, combined with FDA activities relating to AI-enabled devices, may lead to a world in which AI in healthcare settings is safe, clinically useful and aligned with patient safety and improvement in clinical outcomes.”Read the whole thing. Related reading:How to attain and sustain transparency in medical devices outfitted with AI ‘First federal CIO’ gives 3 reality checks on governmental AI Against malpractice for using clinical AI, the best defense is a good offense Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

Meet My Personal Learning and Career Coach: Artificial Intelligence

AI is beginning to transform education, training, and workforce development, often in surprising and unexpected ways. At a recent AEI event, Leslie Sizemore, Associate Vice President of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education talked about how state higher ed is using AI technology to help train students as Advanced Peer Support Specialists (APSS), who help guide individuals through substance use disorder recovery.
Kentucky’s community colleges are experimenting with an AI chatbot with the goal of accelerating learning and guiding students along an integrated career pathway. Using CONVO, a GPT trained on the APSS educational materials, students can engage in realistic scenarios that simulate interactions with individuals with a substance use disorder. These simulations provide a safe environment for students to practice core peer support skills. Their hands-on nature helps to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application and so better prepare students for real-world situations.
CONVO’s 24/7 accessibility and real-time feedback helps create a customized and personalized learning experience. In addition to providing in-depth feedback on students’ interactions, it can suggest conversations, recommend conversational strategies, and reference course material for review. After the conversation, students can share a transcript with their instructor for additional feedback. CONVO also helps students plan their personal educational pathways advising students on course requirements and financial aid resources needed to reach their educational goals.
There’s an important lesson here about education and training programs generally. Our current systems are often unable to offer the kind of tailored instruction needed to improve student and worker performance, especially that of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. As a recent study found, chatbots can help call center workers boost their job performance, productivity, and job satisfaction through interpersonal skills coaching. It increasingly looks like AI could rewrite the rules of education and training, enabling low or no cost tutoring in a wide range of learning and work environments. Such tutors will only become more useful and important as AI’s multimodal capabilities expand and improve. Watch Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy, and his son demo GPT-4o and try not to be impressed as it provides instantaneous—and humanlike—math coaching.
At its best, technology helps us surpass our natural limitations. Planes enable flight, medicine improves our health and extends our lifespans, and the Internet enables global knowledge-sharing and communication. On its current trajectory, AI may also accelerate skills acquisition, extending our professional capacities and boosting our careers with less of the arduous effort and time-investment that accompanies traditional learning. The potential impact of AI technology in improving and accelerating learning holds great promise for solving some of our most difficult human capital challenges.

Deloitte Australia rolls out AI platform across workforce




7:46am on 17 June 2024



Link copied









The news: Deloitte Australia will begin rolling out its new artificial intelligence platform MyAssist across its workforce after more than a year of development, as part of its strategy to become an ""AI-fueled organisation"".The numbers: The audit and consulting group will roll out MyAssist to its entire workforce of 13,000 from Monday.Deloitte said that a trial of around 1,300 users found that a core set of common tasks can account for up to 50% of the work time of  some users, and it is these tasks that the MyAssist platform has been optimised to support. As part of this trial, 70% of users reported the new platform ""meaningfully improved"" overall work productivity and 65% reported an improvement in work quality. The context: MyAssist offers apps that are optimised for various tasks such as research, content drafting and code development, in addition to general and document chat capabilities. It is also designed to be scaled through the creation of AI-enabled apps by users that address specific business problems, such as personal productivity apps that help users complete multiple related tasks. Deloitte said the functionality in MyAssist builds on the capability and learnings from the company's global network and extends it for the Australian market, in line with Australian regulations and guidelines.
What they said: Deloitte Australia CEO Adam Powick said: ""Generative AI is the most important business productivity tool we have seen for many years, and at Deloitte we are committed to upskilling and equipping everyone in our organisation to use generative AI to improve the speed and quality of work outcomes."" ""MyAssist is a sophisticated and secure generative AI platform which provides users with access to a number of different models and applications supporting common tasks like information research, analysis and evaluation, data handling and code development and testing,"" he said.Deloitte Australia AI Institute lead Kellie Nuttal said: ""GenAI is restructuring the way we work by reducing administrative burdens and allowing resources to be reinvested into higher value activities.""""Our strategy is to be an AI-fuelled organisation,"" she said. ""In the past 12 months more than 5,000 of our people have  undertaken GenAI training and I’m excited to see what they will be able to achieve using MyAssist.""

Just look at Microsoft: The company basically conquered the meaning of “computing at work,” and it's adding AI functionality directly into its products.Since last year, the entire Microsoft 365 suite—including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Teams, and more—has adopted “Copilot,” the company’s AI assist tool. Think of it like Clippy from back in the day, only now way more useful. In Teams, you can ask the bot to summarize your meeting notes; in Word, you can ask the AI to draft a work proposal based on your bullet list, then request it tighten up specific paragraphs you aren’t thrilled with; in Excel, you can ask Copilot to analyze and model your data; in PowerPoint, you can ask for an entire slideshow to be created for you based on a prompt.These tools don’t just exist: They’re being actively created by the companies that make our work products, and their use is encouraged.

If you use the internet to hire someone else to do your job, then pass that work off as your own, that’s not using the tool to do your work better. That’s wrong. If you simply ask Copilot or ChatGPT to do your job for you in its entirety, same deal. You also have to consider your own company’s guidelines when it comes to AI and the use of outside technology. It’s possible your organization has already established these rules, given AI’s prominence over the past year and a half or so: Maybe your company is giving you the green light to use AI tools within reason. If so, great! But if your company decides you can’t use AI for any purpose as far as work in concerned, you might want to log out of ChatGPT during business hours. But, let’s be real: Your company probably isn’t going to know whether or not you use AI tools if you’re using them responsibly. The bigger issue here is privacy and confidentiality, and it’s something not enough people think about when using AI in general. In brief, generative AI tools work because they are trained on huge sets of data. But AI is far from perfect, and the more data the system has to work with, the more it can improve. You train AI systems with every prompt you give them, unless the service allows you to specifically opt out of this training. When you ask Copilot for help writing an email, it takes in the entire exchange, from how you reacted to its responses, to the contents of the email itself.As such, it’s a good rule of thumb to never give confidential or sensitive information to AI. An easy way to avoid trouble is to treat AI like you would you work email: Only share information with something like ChatGPT you’d be comfortable emailing a colleague. After all, your emails could very well be made public someday: Would you be OK with the world seeing what you said? If so, you should be fine sharing with AI. If not, keep it away from the robots.If the service offers you the choice, opt out of this training. By doing so, your interactions with the AI will not be used to improve the service, and your previous chats will likely be deleted from the servers after a set period of time. Even so, always refrain from sharing private or corporate data with an AI chatbot: If the developer keeps more data than we realize, and they're ever hacked, you could put your work data in a precarious place.

Unlike “traditional” AI which relies on predetermined rules and patterns, generative AI can produce novel content – like text, video, images, and music. In a way, unlike old AI, generative AI can think outside the box. Its implications are profound and sprawling, with the potential to reshape virtually every branch of society.
Conversations about AI often turn on whether it will be a net positive or negative for society, but our new research as part of an international team suggests that acknowledging AI’s apparent paradoxes can help us develop a clearer picture about its risks and potential benefits. We focused on four major areas of society: information, work, education and healthcare.
Work
Digital technologies have a history of skewed benefits. More educated workers benefit while less-educated workers are displaced through automation – a trend known as “skill-biased technological change”. By contrast, generative AI promises to enhance rather than replace human capabilities, potentially reversing this adverse trend. Studies have shown that AI tools like chat assistants and programming aids can significantly boost productivity and job satisfaction, especially for less-skilled workers. 


Nonetheless, uneven access to AI technologies could worsen existing inequalities as those lacking the necessary digital infrastructure or skills get left behind. For example, generative AI is unlikely to have much direct impact on the global south in the near future, due to insufficient investment in the prerequisite digital infrastructure and skills.
School
Generative AI can enhance personal support and adaptability in learning. Chatbot tutors, for instance, are set to transform educational settings by providing real-time, personalised instruction and support. This technology can realise the dream of dynamic, skill-adaptive teaching methods that directly respond to student needs without constant teacher intervention.
Yet, it must be carefully implemented to avoid perpetuating or introducing biases, not only in terms of the information that is fed into AIs but also in how they are used. For instance, a study revealed that female students report using ChatGPT less frequently than their male counterparts. This disparity in technology usage could not only have immediate effects on academic achievement, but also contribute to a future gender gap in the workforce.
Healthcare
Generative AI could help doctors make better choices. But it could also drive them to make worse ones.
Generative AI could augment human capacities in the practice of medicine by guiding practitioners during diagnosis, screening, prognosis and triaging. It could reduce workloads, thereby making medical care more accessible and affordable. One study found that the integration of human and AI judgment led to superior performance compared to either alone, showing just how well humans and AI can work together.
That said, the diagnostic performance of some expert physicians may not be improved by AI. Another study focusing on radiology found that AI can in fact cause incorrect diagnoses in situations that otherwise would have been correctly assessed. This highlights the need for balanced integration that supplements rather than replaces humans.
Disinformation
Will generative AI exacerbate the spread of misinformation or reduce it? Generative AI promises personalised online content, potentially enhancing and customising a user experience. It can also broaden access to content – for instance, via instant language translations or by making it easier for people with disabilities to access content.
However, it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for “surveillance capitalism”. AI may collect massive amounts of personal data that can then be exploited for corporate gain, including by leveraging people’s biases or vulnerabilities.
We’re already seeing the spread of misinformation through advanced and personalised “deepfakes”, and we may soon see AI being used to micro-target voters with persuasive fake content that could significantly affect elections.
Yet, there is also hope that AI can help with these problems. One study found that entering into a dialogue with generative AI significantly reduces conspiracy beliefs among conspiracy believers. The AI appears to be able to answer conspiracy believers’ complex questions about potential conspiracies in a way that no human can.
How should governments respond?
When we looked at how the EU, UK and US were attempting to build regulatory frameworks around these issues, our main observation was that they are falling into the trap of overlooking the potential for AI to aggravate socioeconomic inequalities.
Policy-making should balance AI innovation with social equity and consumer protection. Future regulatory improvements should include equitable tax structures, empowering workers, controlling consumer information, supporting human-complementary AI research, and implementing robust measures against AI-generated misinformation.
We find ourselves at a critical historical crossroads, where today’s decisions will have global consequences for generations to come. It’s an exciting yet daunting moment to be alive, charged with heavy responsibilities. Each of us plays a crucial role as architects of the future. We can all contribute to driving the course towards the positive use of what could be humanity’s greatest innovation, or its worst.

Full list of Israeli high-tech funding rounds in 2024 BlinqIO, founded by Israeli entrepreneurs Tal Barmeir and Guy Arieli and headquartered in Delaware, has developed autonomous human-like virtual testers operated by AI. The startup’s platform provides an essentially infinite pool of human-like testers that can be integrated into the development process, allowing companies to allocate higher value work to their human workforce.   Founders Barmeir and Arieli previously founded Experitest, acquired by TPG for tens of millions of dollars in 2020. BlinqIO leverages generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance its operations. The AI test engineer comprehends requirements and autonomously creates and maintains test automation code using Playwright. With multilingual capabilities, the AI can operate in over 50 languages, boosting efficiency for websites and apps across various sectors including banking, travel, airlines, retail, and more.   This funding round will enable BlinqIO to establish new offices in the U.S. and expand its workforce beyond the current 15 employees.

– Upskilling and reskilling programs are becoming increasingly crucial as technology rapidly evolves. Continuous learning and acquiring new skills are essential for individuals to remain competitive in the workforce, especially in areas where AI and automation are replacing traditional job roles.Key Questions:
1. How can policymakers and businesses ensure a smooth transition for workers affected by automation and AI?
2. What ethical considerations should be addressed when integrating AI into the workforce?
3. How can organizations balance the need for efficiency with the preservation of human creativity and decision-making?Advantages and Disadvantages:
– Advantages: AI and automation can increase productivity, efficiency, and accuracy in various tasks, leading to cost savings and improved outcomes. They can also handle repetitive or dangerous tasks, allowing humans to focus on more complex and creative work.
– Disadvantages: Concerns about job displacement, loss of human touch in interactions, and potential biases in AI algorithms pose challenges. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancement may outstrip the ability of some workers to adapt, leading to increased inequality in the workforce.Related Links:

AI skills could soon rival experience when employers select job candidates.
Research from Microsoft, LinkedIn and PwC underlines how quickly AI is changing profiles and suggests how job seekers need to adapt to succeed.
The World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance and Education 4.0 framework focus on deploying AI effectively and responsibly and ensuring that education systems provide the next generation of workers with AI skills training.


AI aptitude could soon rival experience when choosing between job candidates. This is according to a new international study by Microsoft and LinkedIn on labour and recruitment trends due to the rise of generative AI. The research also predicts the rise of AI super users as the labour market – which has already undergone significant change in recent years – will shift again.

The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report draws on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, hiring trends from LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 productivity data and research with Fortune 500 companies.


Generative AI could give job candidates an edge


The research reveals that three-quarters of people surveyed use generative AI at work, with the majority (78%) bringing their own AI tools into the workplace, especially in small and medium-sized businesses.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 25:43Loaded: 2.31%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -25:43 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

AI emerges as a tool to help people deal with an increased pace and volume of work that more than two-thirds of respondents struggle with (68%), helping them offload menial tasks.


However, many of those drawing on AI at work fear that doing so might make them look replaceable (53%) and worry that AI could replace their jobs (45%).

But it looks like the opposite could be the case.
Over the past eight years, hiring for technical AI roles was up 323%, and businesses are now turning to non-technical talent with the skills to apply generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot.

Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed say they wouldn’t hire a candidate without AI skills. Nearly three-quarters said they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them.

AI specialist skills command a premium


This trend is consistent with PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer, which found that jobs requiring AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all jobs combined. The exponential need for AI-qualified staff has been on an upward trajectory since 2016 – well before the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI models.

Moreover, PwC’s analysis of half a billion job ads from 15 countries shows that, on average, AI specialist jobs command up to a 25% premium in pay. While technologists see some of the highest wage premiums, AI skills also pay dividends for professionals such as lawyers, sales and marketing managers, and accountants.

This further underlines that AI skills are needed across roles and industries. The top three occupations that have added AI to their skills and aptitudes on LinkedIn are creatives: content writers, graphic designers and marketing managers. Following hot on their heels are entrepreneurs and business professionals, along with the web and software developers you might more naturally expect to find on the list.
The rise of the AI super user


Workers clearly understand the role of AI for advancing their career prospects.


More than three-quarters of people surveyed for Microsoft and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Index felt that AI skills will be necessary for staying competitive in the job market. They also view AI knowledge as a way to get promoted faster (69%) and broaden their job opportunities (79%).

And people are acting on it: attendance of LinkedIn Learning courses on AI for non-technical professionals has increased 160% in the past six months.
The research predicts that AI upskilling – whether through formal learning or simply by using AI tools in the workplace – may lead to the rise of ‘AI power users’.

Power users are those who are ahead of the curve in terms of their AI use. They use it several times a week at work, benefitting from making their workload more manageable, boosting their creativity or helping them focus on the most important work. It also makes them feel more motivated and enjoy work more.



How to become an AI power user?


If the research findings are anything to go by, then becoming an AI power user is the way to go to further career progression. So, what are the habits that mark out a power user? According to the 2024 Work Trend Index, it’s some of the following:


Experiment with different ways of using AI: power users are more than two-thirds more likely than other survey respondents to do so.
Always ask yourself, “How can AI help?”: power users are nearly 50% more likely to pause to explore what AI could contribute before tackling a new task, to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), for example, by researching new prompts (+56%).
‘Bookend’ your working day with AI: 9 in 10 power users use AI tools to start their day and get set up for the next day.
Redesign your ways of working with AI and save time: power users are much more likely than other respondents to use AI for a wide range of tasks, including catching up on meetings, analyzing information, designing visual content, brainstorming ideas and even interacting with customers.
Redesign business processes with AI: power users don’t just stop at reorganizing their own ways of working; they are also 66% more likely to redesign entire business processes and workflows in the organization using AI tools.


Getting business and education ready for the AI future


With PwC finding that skillsets for what it terms ‘AI-exposed occupations’ are changing 25% faster than in roles where AI is less relevant, adopting some, if not all, of these habits could dramatically improve people’s future career development.

However, the findings also mean that organizations and educational systems must do major work to prepare the current workforce and future generations for an AI-driven world of work.

As part of its mission to build more resilient, productive, equitable and human-centric workplaces, the World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance focuses on deploying AI effectively and responsibly. The Education 4.0 framework aims to ensure education and training systems teach AI skills and leverage AI for better learning.

We’re #1! Survey reveals that Singaporean workers use generative AI the most at work
Jess O’Reilly, Area Vice President, Asia at UiPath. Image source: UiPath.
Singaporean Millennial and Gen Z workers are more likely to use Gen AI tools at work and have seen greater time-saving benefits from implementing these tools compared to older generations. At least that is according to the findings of a global survey of 9,047 full-time employees from nine countries from business automation company UiPath.
According to the survey, 60% of local workers have used generative AI during work hours to solve work problems. These have included, drafting communications (44%), summarising long-form content (34%), and brainstorming (34%).

Uncertainty gives rise to burning out
Against the backdrop of increasingly challenging economic conditions, Singaporean workers are facing increasing workloads and almost a third (30%) of employees in Singapore indicated feeling extremely or very burnt out.
To reduce this, Singaporean workers want their workload reduced (62%), more time and bandwidth to get tasks done (46%), and access to AI and automation, including Gen AI tools (43%).
This is because Gen AI is seen as a potential solution to combat burnout by giving employees time back in their day. 62% of Singaporean workers who use Gen AI at work believe it has saved them time on work-related tasks, with more than 42% saving 10 or more hours.
Jess O’Reilly, Area Vice President, Asia at UiPath said: 
The findings from our survey indicate that Singaporean workers who do utilise both technologies (Gen AI and automation) have seen greater productivity and an improved work life balance. To inculcate a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, as well as strategic private-public partnerships will be key to help workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI.
The results of this survey serve to reinforce why the Singapore Government, working with partners DataRobot, IBM, Singtel, and Temasek, launched Project Moonshot. This is a testing toolkit designed to address security and safety challenges often associated with the use of large language models (LLMs), the cornerstone of many AI-driven solutions.

Increased use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is not replacing jobs, according to a pulse survey of technology leaders.
Research by Nash Squared, a global provider of technology and talent solutions, found that although 74% of UK tech leaders have deployed GenAI to at least some extent to employees, almost all (99%) say it is not replacing jobs.
Half (51%) said they are using GenAI as a personal productivity tool to support existing jobs, to make them more effective.
Bev White, CEO of Nash Squared, said: “Although the ’replace-jobs’ impact of GenAI is headline-grabbing news, in our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
“As organisations change and grow, AI will be stitched into the operations and structure; its impact happening bit by bit. In fact, the pulse survey indicates that organisations with company-wide implementations of GenAI are in fact more likely to be increasing tech headcount in the next year than the average.”
The research also found that, as GenAI is being rapidly rolled out more widely, appointments of a chief AI officer (CAIO) is increasing with one in 20 UK organisations already having a person in the role and a similar proportion planning to appoint one.

But for the majority of organisations, AI strategy still sits with the tech leader, the chief information or technology officers.
The survey also found that to support employees and ensure the safe use of GenAI in their organisations, UK tech leaders have rapidly rolled out GenAI policies, with the number with a policy in place doubling in just six months.
For many, this has been a “retrofit” policy after GenAI has been adopted, but almost four in 10 tech leaders remain concerned about the misuse of GenAI tools.
Tech leaders in the UK see the potential of AI, but 55% have yet to find a clear business case beyond a personal productivity tool, and 27% are struggling with budgetary constraints.
White added: “There’s no doubt there have been some incredible advances. One tech leader mentioned how the last year has seen a giant leap in cancer screening through AI – good news for us all. Another talks about how machine learning has supported the fundraising revenue for their higher education institution, opening access to a wider student population.”
The research found that 43% expect to increase their tech budget, and 36% plan to increase their tech headcount.
Nineteen per cent of respondents say they have increased the number of days employees are expected in the office. For those organisations where employees are mandated to be in the office, the typical time expected has moved from 2-3 days to 3 days. Most leaders are happy with the results: 42% say it is working ‘extremely well’ (up 20% in six months), while 45% say ‘quite well’, although some say more days in the office does have consequences, especially on diverse hiring.
The survey was carried out in May 2024 among 322 tech leaders globally including 182 in the UK.

In a 2018 Financial Times article, The Long Wait for a Productivity Resurgence, it was noted that “No economist has done more to promote the revolutionary implications of information technology than MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson”. Brynjolfsson was then professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, a role he held for 20 years, while also serving as director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy (IDE). During his two decades at MIT, Brynjolfsson distinguished himself as one of the world’s leading researchers on productivity and work, and on the economics of information, AI, and the digital economy. An economist by training, Brynjolfsson has focused on how AI drives productivity. When it comes to the business productivity implications of AI, who better to provide a perspective on the current state of AI and its potential to transform work.


I first met Erik Brynjolfsson during his tenure at MIT. At the time, I attended a number of IDE events, and Brynjolfsson joined me for one of a series of Fortune 1000 CIO roundtable tables that I organized and hosted during these years. When I published my book, Fail Fast, Learn Faster: Lessons in Data Driven Leadership in an Age of Disruption, Big Data, and AI, in 2021, I referenced Brynjolfsson’s pioneering work at the intersection of digital, data, and AI, which was years ahead of its time. In works such as 2016’s The Second Machine Age, co-authored with Andrew McAfee, and in a 2017 MIT Sloan Management Review article, “How to Thrive – and Survive – in a World of AI Disruption”, Brynjolfsson anticipated the impact that AI would have on work and business productivity.

In June 2020, during the COVID outbreak, Brynjolfsson was presented with the opportunity to relocate across the country to become the Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Professor and Senior Fellow with Stanford University in Palo Alto, and to launch the Digital Economy Lab at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI). The mission of the Digital Economy Lab is to improve our understanding of the economic implications of the rapid improvements in AI and other digital technologies. Led by Brynjolfsson, it includes faculty from multiple departments across Stanford. Research focuses on developing new economic models and empirical research, including measuring, forecasting and guiding the human and societal impact of AI, and particularly in ways that create widely shared prosperity.

I had the opportunity to catch up with Brynjolfsson in recent weeks. Brynjolfsson’s research examines the effects of not only AI but also other information technologies on business strategy, productivity and performance, and digital commerce. He believes that the impact of a changing economy will be felt by everyone, crossing boundaries of wealth, status, geography, and culture. Central to the mission of the Lab is a belief in the power of human work, and a belief that augmenting human capabilities with machine capabilities through AI will lead to beneficial gains for everyone. As Brynjolfsson noted as far back in 2017 “AI won’t replace managers, but managers who use AI will replace those who don’t.”

I asked Brynjolfsson how it felt to relocate to the West Coast and in close proximity to Silicon Valley. Brynjolfsson expressed deep love for MIT but added that it was invigorating to be near and a part of such a strong innovation community, both at Stanford and in Silicon Valley. I noted that I had recently had the opportunity to hear HAI director Fei-Fei Li speak at the Wall Street Journal Tech Live event in Laguna Beach and had written about that experience, and been inspired to read her memoir about her life in AI. HAI has assembled a strong leadership team and distinguished fellows, including the recent announcement that noted MIT researcher Sandy Pentland would be joining the HAI team as part of Brynjolfsson’s Digital Economy Lab.

Brynjolfsson recently participated in an extensive interview with the Financial Times, which appeared under the headline, “Erik Brynjolfsson: ‘This Could be The Best Decade in History – or the Worst”. I asked Brynjolfsson about his perspective on AI in the context of history, and where he would place AI among the pantheon of transformative technologies. “I think it’s most comparable to the Industrial Revolution” commented Brynjolfsson, noting however that, “while the Industrial Revolution played out over more than a century, AI will play out much faster, in a matter of a few decades”. AI is coming along “faster than anyone really expected” added Brynjolfsson, citing AI in healthcare as an area of great potential for human good.

I noted that in his Financial Times interview, Brynjolfsson had commented that people often use AGI – artificial general intelligence — as a synonym for human-level intelligence. However, “I think it will become apparent that humans have a narrow kind of intelligence and that truly general intelligence will have a much broader set of capabilities”. This was not something I commonly hear, so I asked Brynjolfsson to elaborate. This led to a discussion of augmentation, and how AI can and should be used to augment human skills and intelligence, which is at the heart of driving improved productivity. Brynjolfsson explained that technologists need to look at how AI can be used not just to “imitate or repeat human tasks”, but how AI can be used to “augment and complement” employees.

As an extension of his commitment to improving productivity, Brynjolfsson is embarking on a new business venture focused on “task-based analysis”, which refers to the concept of looking at tens of thousands of tasks and ranking them based on which tasks AI can help the most with. Brynjolfsson has launched a venture, Workhelix, which combines research and data to quantitatively assess a company’s GenAI opportunity. Workhelix co-founder and CEO James Milin explains, “The approach that we’ve pioneered starts with a granular question: can GenAI double the productivity of a task without reducing quality?” He continues, “Using our algorithms and data, we answer this question for every task in an organization, then work upward to understand how jobs, and ultimately each company, can benefit from GenAI”.
Brynjolfsson is a powerful advocate of the productivity potential that can be achieved through AI, envisioning double-digit gains in economic productivity, and commenting that he foresees the potential for “massive economic disruption” leading to the creation of new occupations and new companies in the coming years. Brynjolfsson believes this can lead to greater social benefits, manifested in the form of higher wages and greater prosperity. He expands upon this thesis in an article, The Turing Trap: The Promise and Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence, noting that, “When AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, than humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value you created”. He adds, “Augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services”.
As with any technology and period of historic transformation, responsibility ultimately resides with us as human beings. Brynjolfsson has argued that because we have more powerful tools than ever before “this could be the best decade in history – or the worst”, noting that “misinformation, viruses or weapons, cyber-attacks, and phishing attacks” remain threats. He points to risks posed by information overload, fake news, and other nefarious uses. Brynjolfsson concludes that the future of AI will largely depend on the steps we take today as humans to place a premium on intelligent governance, safeguards, and guardrails. Brynjolfsson warns us simply, “We should not fly blind.”

Generative artificial intelligence is poised to change how fashion works, but whether that’s good news or bad news might depend on what job you’re doing.
If you’re in control of budgets, AI offers opportunities to cut headcounts or reallocate resources more profitably. However, if you’re starting out in a career, AI could reduce opportunity, particularly in starter roles.
As tasks become faster and easier, brands see an opportunity to shift some manual tasks from humans to machines. First up for streamlining: human-led and often time-consuming roles, such as copywriting, coding, customer service, clienteling, photo editing and 3D design and illustration.
Brands are already utilising the power of AI to cut production and operations costs. In May, LVMH awarded its 2024 Innovation Award to Chinese startup FancyTech, a platform that is collaborating with LVMH brands. FancyTech uses generative artificial intelligence to produce videos from 3D product models and creative briefs. A separate prize went to Blng, an LA-based company that uses AI to convert sketches of jewellery into visualisations. Meanwhile, AI investment from the likes of LVMH-owned Sephora is focused on improving chatbots to supercharge the customer experience online.
The Estée Lauder Companies is using generative AI to measure customer sentiment, aid in writing copy and make product recommendations; a new innovation lab, with Microsoft, is developing tools that help internal teams identify and respond to trends, such as an internal chatbot that helps brands source products that identify specific problems. Revolve has tested it for generating new product designs, while Adore Me is enabling customers to customise their own bra and panty sets. Adore Me also uses generative AI to inform SEO-optimised product descriptions, but VP of strategy Ranjan Roy says that, ultimately, any copy customers end up seeing is approved and finalised by human employees.
AI provides opportunities in the fashion and retail sectors across multiple categories, according to Lamees Butt, CEO and founder of Riser, an AI-powered career matchmaking app for brands — “from the way trends are consumed and created to the retail customer journey”. It will “profoundly impact” the workforce, particularly in roles related to design, marketing and customer service, Butt says.
Some businesses have moved fast to maximise the opportunity. Swedish e-commerce payment company Klarna says AI has contributed to 37 per cent of its cost savings, equating to $10 million annually, for tasks related to external marketing, image production and general company efficiency.
A study from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), released in January, suggests that almost 40 per cent of employment worldwide is exposed to AI. Advanced economies are most exposed, while also being better positioned to leverage its benefits.
Roles such as retail specialists and store managers will “take the heat more than others”, says Adam Jackson, founder and CEO of AI recruiting app Braintrust, but he sees change everywhere. “AI is automating tasks like trend prediction, inventory management, and even churning out creative clothing patterns.”
Talented employees or applicants need not worry, he assures. “Many retailers are deploying AI to their advantage, focusing on hiring the right talent, as opposed to collecting the most résumés,” he says.
The ability to work with AI is becoming an essential skill to add to the average CV. Fashion job boards are introducing roles that require AI competency, such as data governance managers at LVMH or data scientists at Estée Lauder Companies — roles that require candidates to be comfortable with the “implementation of AI capabilities”.
Mindful implementation
As fashion and retail hurries to implement generative AI solutions, experts warn of the risks of moving too fast.
For all its potential, AI could prompt a knee-jerk response from overexcited business leaders. Partha Gopalakrishnan, president of Brane Group, a consultancy specialising in AI solutions, and a former senior executive at Infosys, has noted “a spate of layoffs, teething errors in retailers’ systems and even big firms ceasing working with creative agencies and freelancers”.
Gopalakrishnan is concerned that the human factor may be neglected by fashion executives prioritising quick-win opportunities. “Fashion and retail executives need to take a step back and rethink their approach. [The industry] needs to invest in talent, culture and training first, and then it can start to fold AI into its operations,” he says.
He suggests that retailers should be looking to employ “highly adaptable candidates” with the ability to unlearn and relearn, complemented by the introduction of comprehensive internal training and upskilling.
In the interim, some governments are stepping in to alleviate concerns around the impact. Last autumn, for example, the US Biden administration issued an executive order calling for support when it comes to job training, with hopes to mitigate job displacement.
Some companies, already in this mindset, have invested in training programmes to help employees gain AI and data analysis skills. Nike, for example, deploys AI-powered tools that provide its senior leadership team with access to custom analytics tailored to support decision-making. Tapestry-owned Coach has an internal dashboard that provides relevant data to all employees, enabling staff to understand trends and make more informed recommendations. German-based Hugo Boss has worked with external consultancy Metyis to build out what it describes as a “dedicated data science campus”.
Upskilling
Momentum is building in upskilling teams. Estée Lauder and Microsoft have collaborated on creating an AI innovation lab to upskill Estée Lauder employees. The company is able to use Microsoft’s tech expertise to develop in-house solutions that are specific to its business, and therefore didn’t require additional employees to build out these efforts.
Altava Group, a fashion-tech company that emerged from LVMH’s La Maison des Startups business accelerator, has launched a proprietary generative AI tool for accessible 3D fashion design. The business is upskilling its team and hiring employees with specific skill sets relating to machine learning and AI, says founder and CEO Andy Ku. “We are upskilling our team in distributed computing, blockchain and data learning — considering [the development of] our AI engine and our [new] target vertical, which includes 3D asset and item creation using data from our experience in luxury fashion use cases.”
Riser’s Butt advises brands to use AI tools that keep human connection and creativity — known to be key drivers of success — front of mind. “People and purpose are the most powerful parts of any brand,” says Butt. “The companies that will win are those open to embracing new solutions that blend technology with a human-centric approach, ensuring that AI enhances — rather than replaces — the unique value that only people can bring.”

Hearing the terms generative AI and ChatGPT sparks fear among many, raising concerns about job security and future relevance. This reaction is understandable, Never in our lifetimes has a technological disruption been this vast or swift. However, generative AI is also a solution to many workplace challenges, likely making us happier and more fulfilled.


At a recent press event, I heard this phrase: ""I love my work, and I hate my day."" This phrase captures the frustration many employees feel when bureaucracy and routine tasks overshadow the more fulfilling aspects of their jobs. For instance, if you are an HR Business Partner, a significant portion of your time might be spent answering repetitive questions like “How do I add a partner to my benefits?” or “What do I need to do to change my official name?” That leaves little room for higher-level, strategic work. Providing rote answers probably doesn’t keep you inspired at work. You likely enjoy building relationships with your internal clients or working strategically to build programs that drive engagement and bolster team cohesion. These monotonous activities consume much of the workday, limiting time for more meaningful and enjoyable tasks. As a result, your joy factor at work diminishes. AI can help.

The Role Of Generative AI
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can alleviate this issue by speeding up or even eliminating the soul-sucking elements of your job. This, in turn, frees you up to focus on what you love doing. Research supports the positive impact of AI on workplace satisfaction, “Companies that have adopted AI technologies report a 40% increase in productivity,” according to a McKinsey report.

Generative AI Tools Can Enhance Workplace Happiness
No matter your role, there are ways AI can be used to increase your fulfilling-to-frustrating activity quotient.

Administrative Assistance
AI can handle repetitive administrative tasks, such as scheduling meetings, managing emails, organizing travel, and generating reports. This reduces the time you spend on mundane activities, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks.

To leverage AI effectively and enhance your job satisfaction, follow these steps:


Get Clear on Your Tasks: Identify the tasks in your workday that diminish your enthusiasm. Determine which ones take up the most of your time.
Identify AI-Compatible Tasks: From your list, identify the tasks that could be accomplished by AI, either fully or partially.
Research Tools: Explore AI tools and solutions that can help you automate these tasks. This might involve experimenting with different AI platforms to find the best fit for your needs, talking to others in your field, or taking a course.
Implement: Starting with one routine task, create your plan for incorporating AI, then measure the impact. Once you have that process sorted, take on your next most monotonous task, and then the next.


Adopt generative AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline your workload, reduce monotony, and focus on what truly drives you. This not only enhances your job satisfaction but also bolsters your personal brand attribute of “change agent.” Embracing AI is not just about keeping up with technology; it's about creating a more enjoyable and meaningful work experience.

IRIS Software Group Unveils Generative AI, Chatbot and Automation Features for HR, Recruitment and Payroll ProfessionalsNew intelligent functionality in Networx, Cascade and Staffology platforms will help more than 3,600 businesses reduce time spent on manual processesFrom the CIPD Festival of Work tradeshow, IRIS Software Group (IRIS), a leading global software provider of accountancy, edtech, HR and payroll solutions, today announced the integration of new generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), chatbot and automation functionality within its Networx recruitment, Cascade HR and Staffology payroll platforms. Integrating these intelligent technologies will help more than 3,600 businesses streamline workflows, enhance productivity and operational efficiencies.
Building Job Descriptions with Generative AI
Recent research indicates 68% of organisations have increased their use of AI tools in the recruitment process. To help HR professionals and recruiters save time, IRIS has integrated new GenAI functionality into its recruitment software Networx – boosting productivity for more than 400 businesses.
First introduced as a trial in July 2023 and now generally available, HR and recruiting professionals can instantly build full job descriptions with GenAI by inputting the basic information for a role, such as job title, salary, location and company benefits. While human oversight, review and approval is still required, this feature helps remove the bulk of manual effort for HR professionals, freeing them up to focus on more high-level and strategic tasks.  
Enhancing User Experience with Chatbot Functionality 
In June 2024, IRIS unveiled ‘IRIS Cascade Assistant’, a new Chatbot feature. Powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the Cascade chatbot is designed to understand employees' questions and retrieve answers from Cascade's Help Centre. The chatbot is available 24/7 and operates like a conversation, making it easy for users of all levels of technical expertise to engage effortlessly. Currently undergoing testing with a small group of customers, this chatbot feature will be available to more than 1,200 businesses in July.
Streamlining Payroll Management with Automatic Backpay Adjustments Feature
In October 2023, IRIS launched a new Staffology Payroll Automatic Backpay Adjustments feature, designed to help 2,000 businesses streamline payroll management. When this new feature is turned on, it automatically calculates back pay for any paylines.
	In addition, Staffology Payroll already offers existing automation features, such as:

Autopilot automatically finishes pay runs and starts new ones based on user preferences. Users can set and schedule this feature to run as early as six days before the payment date and select a preferred time for the send.

Auto Submit Full Payment Submission (FPS) automatically sends the required payment information to HMRC when a pay run is completed.

Auto Submit Journal posts a journal for each pay run if it’s connected to an accounting platform.

Auto Submit Payments triggers payment distribution when linked to a payment platform.

Auto Emails automatically sends summary emails and payslip copies to employees when a pay run is finalised, allowing customisation of recipients, content and attachments.
Stephanie Coward, Managing Director of Human Capital Management (HCM) at IRIS said, “These latest updates to Networx, Cascade and Staffology empower recruitment, HR and payroll professionals to streamline their day-to-day operations, reduce administrative workload, and achieve greater strategic impact. For many years, IRIS has thoughtfully, and responsibly, built intelligent technologies into our products to help teams spend less time on tedious and repetitive tasks. As always, we will continue to explore new AI technologies and partnerships -- while also ensuring human oversight and building appropriate guardrails into our processes.”
	In February 2024, IRIS became the first payment platform provider to integrate UNIPaaS’ AI Assist into IRIS Pay, an embedded payment solution within its software ecosystem. This partnership leverages generative AI to help prevent late invoice payments by recommending the most effective payment methods for each customer based on historical data.
	Today’s Networx, Cascade and Staffology features will be available for demonstration at IRIS' stand (D31) at the CIPD Festival of Work.

CIOs are growing cautious about hiring, but predictions that the rise of generative AI will have a rapid effect on jobs may have been over blown.While almost three-quarters of tech leaders have deployed generative AI, there’s no sign of it replacing workers – at least, not yet, according to a survey by recruiter Nash Squared. It found that 72% of the tech chiefs have deployed generative AI to at least some employees, with one-in-five deploying it enterprise-wide.Rolling out AI has been helped by the relative simplicity and low costs of generative AI productivity tools. Nash Squared said that, rather like the growth of cloud computing 10 years ago, much of the deployment has happened in the ‘shadows’ with users acquiring tools beyond the watchful eye of the IT department.The survey quoted one tech leader as saying part of the reason their company rolled out generative AI tools was to “stop people doing it themselves and to put proper governance in place”.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProThe survey found nearly half (42%) of companies now have a generative AI policy – up from 21% in November last year – with a similar number planning to put one in place soon.However, Nash Squared warned that for many firms, this has been a “retrofit” after generative AI has been rolled out or adopted.“Those organizations that have a policy are equally as likely to be concerned over misuse of Ai as those that don’t, suggesting the policy is having a limited effect,” the report said.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Only one-in-ten have reported job roles changing, and just 1% are seeing jobs replaced.AI is creating at least one staffing change though, with the appointment of Chief AI Officers (CAIO). One-in-twenty organizations already have one, with a similar proportion planning to appoint one. However, for the majority of organizations, the AI strategy still sits with various senior tech leaders, the CIO, or CTO.Bev White, CEO of Nash Squared, said the report shows that the early warnings over widespread job losses as a result of generative AI haven’t yet materialized. This process will be gradual, he added.“Although the ’replace jobs’ impact of GenAI is headline grabbing news, in our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary,” he said. “As organizations change and grow AI will be stitched into the operations and structure; its impact happening bit by bit.”The tech hiring outlook is still grimStill, if AI isn’t having an impact on jobs now, the outlook for hiring is less than rosy. The survey found that 43% of IT chiefs said they expected their overall tech budget would increase next year. That might seem positive, but it’s lower than the years from 2021 to 2023 which saw larger expected increases.More worrying for IT workers, tech chiefs are less likely than ever to expect to hire more staff. Only 36% of executives said they expect their technology headcount to increase over the next year (53% said it would stay the same and 11% expected it to drop).As Nash Squared pointed out, this is not only lower than its last report (36% versus 50%), it’s the lowest since it began measuring this factor.RELATED WHITEPAPER(Image credit: Proofpoint)Get insight into the risky behaviors of 7,500 end users“While tech investment seems to remain stable, digital leaders are looking to increase the impact of technology through technology itself (for instance in using AI for code development and customer support) and are currently cautious about adding people,"" the report said.It quoted one survey respondent who said “we want to grow our impact, not our headcount”.In a twist, organizations that have company-wide implementations of generative AI are actually more likely to be increasing tech headcount in the next year than the average (43 per cent versus 36 per cent), further complicating the relationship between AI and jobs.Two-thirds of digital leaders said the economy was holding them back at least to some extent; on the plus side, many thought the economy would return to ‘normal’ in six to nine months.“For many digital leaders the advent of GenAI marks a useful ‘pivot’ to refresh digital strategies – and budgets – as they look to the future,” the report said.

Credit: IMFOpinion by Era Dabla-Norris, Ruud de Mooij (washington dc)Wednesday, June 19, 2024Inter Press ServiceWASHINGTON DC, Jun 19 (IPS)  - New generative-AI technologies hold immense potential for boosting productivity and improving the delivery of public services, but the sheer speed and scale of the transformation also raise concerns about job losses and greater inequality. Given uncertainty over the future of AI, governments should take an agile approach that prepares them for highly disruptive scenarios.A new IMF paper argues that fiscal policy has a major role to play in supporting a more equal distribution of gains and opportunities from generative-AI. But this will require significant upgrades to social-protection and tax systems around the world.How should social-protection policies be revamped in the face of disruptive technological changes from AI? While AI could eventually boost overall employment and wages, it could put large swaths of the labor force out of work for extended periods, making for a painful transition.Lessons from past automation waves and the IMF’s modeling suggest more generous unemployment insurance could cushion the negative impact of AI on workers, allowing displaced workers to find jobs that better match their skills. Most countries have considerable scope to broaden the coverage and generosity of unemployment insurance, improve portability of entitlements, and consider forms of wage insurance.At the same time, sector-based training, apprenticeships, and upskilling and reskilling programs could play a greater role in preparing workers for the jobs of the AI age. Comprehensive social-assistance programs will be needed for workers facing long-term unemployment or reduced local labor demand due to automation or industry closures.To be sure, there will be important differences in how AI impacts emerging-market and developing economies—and thus, how policymakers there should respond. While workers in such countries are less exposed to AI, they are also less protected by formal social-protection programs such as unemployment insurance because of larger informal sectors in their economies. Innovative approaches leveraging digital technologies can facilitate expanded coverage of social-assistance programs in these countries.Should AI be taxed to mitigate labor-market disruptions and pay for its effects on workers? In the face of similar concerns, some have recommended a robot tax to discourage firms from displacing workers with robots.Yet, a tax on AI is not advisable. Your AI chatbot or co-pilot wouldn’t be able to pay such a tax—only people can do that. A specific tax on AI might instead reduce the speed of investment and innovation, stifling productivity gains. It would also be hard to put into practice and, if ill-targeted, do more harm than good.So, what can be done to rebalance tax policy in the age of AI? In recent decades, some advanced countries have scaled up corporate tax breaks on software and computer hardware in an effort to drive innovation. However, these incentives also tend to encourage companies to replace workers through automation. Corporate tax systems that inefficiently favor the rapid displacement of human jobs should be reconsidered, given the risk that they could magnify the dislocations from AI.Many emerging market and developing countries tend to have corporate tax systems that discourage automation. That can be distortive in its own way, preventing the investments that would enable such countries to catch up in the new global AI economy.How should governments design redistributive taxation to offset rising inequality from AI? Generative-AI, like other types of innovation, can lead to higher income inequality and concentration of wealth. Taxes on capital income should thus be strengthened to protect the tax base against a further decline in labor’s share of income and to offset rising wealth inequality. This is crucial, as more investment in education and social spending to broaden the gains from AI will require more public revenue.Since the 1980s, the tax burden on capital income has steadily declined in advanced economies while the burden on labor income has climbed.To reverse this trend, strengthening corporate income taxes could help. The global minimum tax agreed by over 140 countries, which establishes a minimum 15-percent effective tax rate on multinational companies, is a step in the right direction. Other measures could include a supplemental tax on excess profits, stronger taxes on capital gains, and improved enforcement.The latest AI breakthroughs represent the fruit of years of investment in fundamental research, including through publicly funded programs. Similarly, decisions made now by policymakers will shape the evolution of AI for decades to come. The priority should be to ensure that applications broadly benefit society, leveraging AI to improve outcomes in areas such as education, health and government services. And given the global reach of this powerful new technology, it will be more important than ever for countries to work together.Fernanda Brollo, Daniel Garcia-Macia, Tibor Hanappi, Li Liu, and Anh Dinh Minh Nguyen also contributed to the staff discussion note on which this blog is based.Source: IMFIPS UN BureauFollow @IPSNewsUNBureauFollow IPS News UN Bureau on Instagram© Inter Press Service (2024) — All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press ServiceWhere next?

tl;dr
 Generative AI can 'hallucinate' when unsure of an answer, making up incorrect responses. Oxford researchers developed a statistical model to identify likely AI 'hallucinations.' This method distinguishes between AI uncertainty in content and expression, aiding reliability. 



Generative AI can have “hallucinations” when it doesn’t know the answer to a question; here’s how to spot it.
Researchers from the University of Oxford have devised a new method to help users work out when generative AI could be “hallucinating.” This comes about when an AI system is posed a query that it doesn’t know the answer to, causing it to make up an incorrect answer.
Luckily, there are tips to both spot this when it’s happening and prevent it from happening altogether.
How to stop AI hallucinations
A new study by the team at the University of Oxford has produced a statistical model that can identify when questions asked of generative AI chatbots were most likely to produce an incorrect answer.
This is a real concern for generative AI models, as the advanced nature of how they communicate means they can pass off false information as fact. That was highlighted when ChatGPT went rogue with false answers back in February.
With more and more people from all walks of life turning to AI tools to help them with school, work, and daily life, AI experts like those involved in this study are calling for clearer ways for people to tell when AI is making up responses, especially when related to serious topics like healthcare and the law.
The researchers at the University of Oxford claim that their research can tell the difference between when a model is correct or just making something up.
“LLMs are highly capable of saying the same thing in many different ways, which can make it difficult to tell when they are certain about an answer and when they are literally just making something up,” said study author Dr Sebastian Farquhar while speaking to the Evening Standard. “With previous approaches, it wasn’t possible to tell the difference between a model being uncertain about what to say versus being uncertain about how to say it. But our new method overcomes this.”
However, there is of course still more work to do on ironing out the errors AI models can make.
“Semantic uncertainty helps with specific reliability problems, but this is only part of the story,” he added. “If an LLM makes consistent mistakes, this new method won’t catch that. The most dangerous failures of AI come when a system does something bad but is confident and systematic.
“There is still a lot of work to do.”

Physics professor Richard Taylor, seen here with a painting of unknown origin, has been using computers to analyze the work of Jackson Pollock since the 1990s.

Artificial intelligence can spot art forgeries, study findsA team led by the UO’s Richard Taylor used Jackson Pollock paintings to train an AI programWith potential price tags of more than $100 million, Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings have inspired countless imitators, igniting fierce debate whenever similar works of unknown origin are discovered. But a team led by a University of Oregon professor has developed an artificial intelligence tool that can help resolve these debates by authenticating Pollock’s paintings with 98.9 percent accuracy, giving art experts a new, science-backed method for detecting forgeries.They reported their findings this week in the journal PLOS ONE.“It’s almost like the American dream to find a Jackson Pollock painting in your attic,” said Richard Taylor, a UO College of Arts and Sciences physics professor and Pollock enthusiast. “After the initial excitement, how do you find out if it’s a long-lost master work or a compelling imitation? That’s where the machine now comes in.”  

 









An artificial intelligence tool developed by UO researchers can distinguish between Jackson Pollock and his imitators with 98.9 percent accuracy. 



 









The image on the left depicts a portion of “Blue Poles,” one of Pollock’s most famous works, while the one on the right shows an imitation.

Training computers to spot fractalsThe tool harnesses machine learning to recognize visual characteristics such as fractal patterns found in Pollock’s unique “poured” compositions. Machine learning is the ability of computer systems to learn patterns found in a training dataset and then make decisions without any additional programming. Fractals are naturally occurring patterns that repeat at increasingly small scales, visible in trees, clouds, snowflakes and coastlines.

 









UO physics professor Richard Taylor

​​​​​Pollock’s unusual technique of pouring out paint while walking around his canvas created similar patterns within his art, making it an ideal candidate for computer analysis, Taylor said.Julian Smith and Caleb Holt, both UO doctoral graduates, trained an artificial neural network to identify those patterns by feeding it images from Taylor’s personal collection of nearly 600 digitized artworks, the largest digital collection of Pollock paintings, imitations and other abstract works ever assembled, according to their study.But it takes thousands of images to train a neural network effectively. To overcome that challenge, Holt and Smith devised a novel machine learning strategy for image study, breaking each picture into smaller “tiles” at a variety of different scales. Because of their fractal nature, Pollock’s paintings are recognizable whether looking at the full artwork or just a small corner, Holt said. That made it possible for the machine learning program to identify the same patterns in each section of a painting as in the whole.“We could take an image of a Jackson Pollock painting and chop it up,” he said. “Now we could have 20,000 images, as many as we need to train a machine learning model reliably.”

 









Richard Taylor peeks underneath Jackson Pollock’s “One” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, looking for telltale signs of authenticity.

The resulting tool, while highly accurate, functions as a “black box,” offering no visibility into how it arrives at its conclusions. The team conducted rigorous testing to determine not only whether it works but why it works, Smith said.“I can see that it’s providing a result, but I don’t really know what’s going into all of the little decisions being made,” he said. “The worry is that your AI is doing its job but for the wrong reasons. We found that it’s doing exactly what we thought it should.” “We could take an image of a Jackson Pollock painting and chop it up,” he said. “Now we could have 20,000 images, as many as we need to train a machine learning model reliably.”Caleb Holt, UO doctoral graduateBecause the tool can receive data and deliver results without human interference in its decision-making process, it has the potential to help end the Pollock-related fraud scandals that “come along routinely like trains” in the art world, Taylor said.“A lot of the controversy around art authentication is whether the humans involved are biased or have a motive,” he said. “We wanted to be able to feed things in with no human contamination.”But computers can't do it aloneThe researchers emphasize that their authentication technique is not intended to be used in isolation and won’t be putting any art experts out of a job. Rather, when coupled with other techniques such as materials analysis and visual inspection, AI can provide a scientific complement to human expertise.“Some of the greatest Pollock scholars sometimes get it wrong; the human eye gets it wrong,"" Taylor said. “If AI can help sort these cases out pretty quickly, we will be doing the whole art world a service. It’s a really beautiful opportunity for an art-science collaboration.”Taylor has been using computers to analyze Pollock’s art since the 1990s, when he realized the paintings contained the same fractal patterns he had been studying in nature, a style he dubbed “fractal expressionism.”“Pollock managed to distill the essence of nature and put it onto a canvas,” he said. ""I believe he would be absolutely amazed that a computer now studies his artworks and can separate his master works from imitations with remarkable accuracy.” But the AI tool isn't just for settling authenticity disputes. The researchers say their study provides scientific evidence that Pollock’s artistic signature is quantifiably different than that of other artists who mimic his poured paint technique, confirming that Pollock’s contributions to modern art go beyond merely popularizing the pouring technique.It also raises thought-provoking questions about whether artificial intelligence can appreciate art, Taylor added. “Our computer can spot a fake far more accurately than a human,” he said. “Is that a form of artistic appreciation? In a way, artificial intelligence does appreciate a Jackson Pollock painting.”Story by Nicole KruegerPhotos by Chris Larsen

As businesses increasingly adopt AI to improve efficiency, certain jobs are more vulnerable to automation. Here are five fields at risk from AI.Data Analysts and BookkeepersJobs that involve data analysis, bookkeeping, and basic financial reporting are highly susceptible to automation. These roles, which focus on repetitive administrative tasks, are prime candidates for AI-driven efficiency improvements.Read more: Best Accounting Software""When thinking about the implications for specific jobs, these tools are more likely to replace tasks than jobs, which may mean that you need fewer people to do the work or it could mean that more people are needed because the productivity is much higher with all the low value work is being done by machines,"" Carter Price, senior mathematician at the RAND Corporation think tank, told Newsweek.Customer Service RepresentativesThe customer service sector is already experiencing significant changes due to AI. Chatbots and AI-powered assistants are increasingly handling customer inquiries, reducing the need for human agents.According to a study by Gartner, by 2025, 80 percent of customer service and support organizations will be applying generative AI technology in some form.This trend is already visible, with companies like IBM and British telecommunications giant BT Group citing AI as a reason for job cuts&#8203;&#8203; and hiring slowdowns.""We have already seen the deployment of these technologies in customer service roles either as chatbots or as chatbots hooked up to text to voice systems,"" Price said.""An LLM can quickly search all the relevant manuals or other text documentation to find the relevant information.""However, this still is likely to need human supervision and complex cases will need to be handled by humans,"" he added.LLM stands for large language model&mdash;a type of AI algorithm capable of drawing on vast quantities of data to generate content.Media Content CreationAI's ability to read, write, and understand text-based data puts media jobs at risk, including roles in advertising, content creation, technical writing, and journalism.""LLMs, in their most basic form, have a tenuous relationship with the truth but are facile with written text,"" Price explained. ""The transformer, the core technology behind LLMs, was originally developed for machine translation back in 2017. However, transformers proved so effective with text generation that they are being used as generalized tools for examining and producing text, images, sounds, and other data forms.""The AI tools we interact with today have been augmented and are better with the truth but still make suggestions like eating rocks [...].""There is a lot of ongoing work to make these tools more reliable and we can expect significant improvements in the coming months and years,"" he added.Legal Assistants and ParalegalsThe legal industry is not immune to the impacts of AI. Roles such as paralegals and legal assistants, which involve consuming large amounts of information and synthesizing it into legal briefs or opinions, are particularly vulnerable.AI can replicate many of these tasks, although complete automation is unlikely due to the need for human judgment.""Many paralegal tasks require sifting through large data sets of text which is something that LLMs excel at. However, these jobs also require careful attention to language and accuracy [...]. Thus, it is very important for a human to oversee the work just as a senior attorney will review the work of a paralegal or associate,"" said Price.Financial AnalystsFinancial analysts and personal financial advisors are also at risk. These professionals handle significant amounts of numerical data, identifying trends and making investment recommendations.Read more: The Best Investing Apps for Any Type of InvestorAI can analyze data, highlight investment trends, and forecast better investment mixes more efficiently than humans.""For [...] financial analysts, a lot of data analysis the tasks can and have been automated even before LLMs by the people in these jobs themselves. This allows analysts to focus on higher value work like interpreting the results or digging deeper into the subject.""Because the whole point of these jobs is to extract accurate information from noisy data, human supervision is very important. As AI systems become more trustworthy, the level of supervision will likely decline,"" said Price.Do you have a story we should be covering? Do you have any questions about AI?

New York (CNN) — Corporate America is rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to automate work once exclusively done by humans.
Nearly half (46%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday.
Those tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
That’s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns.
The findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive.
“You can’t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,” Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview.
The CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta Fed, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms — large or small — plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans.
Why bosses are deploying AI
Some of this is already happening — especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI.
Nearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3.
Bosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers.
The CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%).
Still, the good news for workers is that some experts don’t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away.
“I don’t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,” said Graham. “In the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise — but not laying someone off. In part that’s because this is all-brand new.”
AI co-pilots on the way?
Yet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren’t already.
“This could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,” said Graham.
Reid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future.
“Years, not decades, but years, not months,” Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. “I believe in three to five years, we’ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that’s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner…to doing your job and writing and so forth.”
Hoffman, who last year wrote a book called “Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI” with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot.
“It’s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced — but will be replaced by other humans using AI,” he said. “The whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.”
AI and inflation
For now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures.
The CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers – behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy.
Most CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace.
However, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn’t.
Graham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn’t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now.
“It doesn’t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,” he said.
‘Significant risks’
The CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI — even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together.
The rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both “tremendous opportunities and significant risks.”
A report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation “insufficiently addresses” how hedge funds are already using AI.
The report warned that there are “no regulations or requirements” mandating “when and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.”
Graham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI.
“There has been rapid adoption of AI,” he said. “I hope it’s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.”

See our ethics statement. Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeFor the past couple of weeks, Adobe has faced intense backlash over changes to its terms of service agreement — and now, it’s trying to patch things up. On Tuesday, Adobe announced a tweaked version of its terms of service agreement that makes it clear the company will not train AI on user content stored locally or in the cloud.The section defining Adobe’s access to user content now includes several distinct categories, including one dedicated to generative AI. Adobe’s updated terms explicitly state that its software “will not use your Local or Cloud Content to train generative AI.” But there’s one exception: if your work is submitted to the Adobe Stock marketplace, the company can use it to train Adobe Firefly.These additions to the terms of service, according to Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief strategy officer, aren’t actually changing anything — Adobe says its stance on AI training just wasn’t clearly laid out before, leading to confusion. “We’ve explicitly said we will not train generative AI on your content,” Belsky said during an interview with The Verge. “It was always a policy that we had as a company. We always made that very clear, but we never explicitly said that.”RelatedUS sues Adobe for ‘deceiving’ subscriptions that are too hard to cancel Adobe’s new terms of service aren’t the problem — it’s the trustThe new terms also address user concerns about Adobe scanning content created under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), saying the company does not “scan or review” work stored locally on your device. Adobe will only automatically scan content uploaded to the cloud to “ensure we are not hosting illegal or abusive content, like Child Sexual Abuse Material.” It will also only subject work uploaded to the cloud to human review if it’s flagged or reported as illegal, or if you opt in to a prerelease, beta, or Adobe’s product improvement program.Adobe’s changes to its terms of service agreement sparked an uproar earlier this month after users misread changes as giving the company permission to use their work for AI training. The outcry stemmed from creatives who have grown frustrated with the company’s outsize grasp on the creative industry. Even the federal government has taken notice of users’ complaints about Adobe, as the Department of Justice is suing the company for allegedly hiding expensive cancellation fees and making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions.A lot of user frustration dates back to Adobe’s shift to a subscription-only model in 2012, something Belsky acknowledged as a point of contention. “I think that that was a change for some customers that probably rubbed them negatively,” Belsky said. “I think that when something like this [the terms of service update] happens, my observation is that we see a bit of a resurgence of that frustration. That may have been seeded back when we made that model change.”It’s great that Adobe’s tweaking its terms of service to make them more transparent, but this may just serve as a small patch on top of a much larger wound that will likely take more time — and close attention — to heal.Comments6 Comments / 6 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeFinal Cut Pro 2 on M4 iPad Pro: what you need to know

This did not go down well with many users, who criticized Apple for intentionally restricting Apple Intelligence to newer devices to increase sales. However, Apple has now clarified why the set of AI features, as part of Apple Intelligence, is limited to newer devices. John Giannandrea, Apple’s AI chief, blames the computational power required to run large language models on the device as the reason why Apple Intelligence is limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads with M-series chips. “The inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive. So it’s a combination of bandwidth in the device, the size of the ANE [Apple Intelligence Neural Engine], and the oomph in the device to actually run these models fast enough to be useful,"" Giannandrea said during John Gruber’s The Talk Show. “You could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow it would not be useful,” he further added. Apple Intelligence, Cupertino’s implementation of artificial intelligence, isn’t an app or a chatbot like ChatGPT. Rather, it’s an integrated layer of artificial intelligence embedded in Apple’s newer versions of operating systems. Apple Intelligence is essentially a flavor of AI, and it runs natively on your iPhone or Mac. Because it runs on-device, it requires a lot of processing power, which is why only select Apple devices can run it. While many Apple users find it disappointing, the truth is they need to upgrade to the latest Apple devices—either the iPhone 15 Pro or an iPad with the newer M-series chip—to meet the requirements needed to run Apple Intelligence. This means an older iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPhone 15 won’t support it.  Apple Intelligence’s AI features include an all-new Siri, AI-assisted writing tools, real-time call transcripts, and the ability to create unique emojis, among many other things. Analysts hope this approach could spur device upgrades, as Apple has lately seen sluggish iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales. But Apple doesn’t think Apple Intelligence is some sort of scheme to increase iPhone sales. “Otherwise, we would have been smart enough just to do recent iPads and Macs, too,” replied Greg Joswiak, Apple’s marketing head, debunking theories around selling more Apple devices by intentionally limiting Apple Intelligence to newer devices. However, the bigger question is whether the standard iPhone 16, due for launch later this fall, will get Apple Intelligence, or if users will need a pro model to use the full suite of AI features.

Rene Bystron spent hundreds of hours at his last startup building an app that helps teach people how to use generative AI tools. And it was through that experience that the Seattle entrepreneur came to a realization. 
“There’s this massive need in the market for a tool that allows people to leverage AI for workflow-specific tasks without prompting,” Bystron told GeekWire. 
Bystron is the co-founder and CEO of DeltaGen, a new Seattle-based startup developing software that aims to help companies use AI tools that don’t require “prompting,” or the process of queuing AI systems for a specific answer.
Bystron previously launched and led AI LaMo, which built games, quizzes, and other interactive content to teach people how to improve their prompt engineering skills and interact with chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.
“I’m cannibalizing years of work — I built my career in prompting,” Bystron said. “But I’ve just seen hundreds of companies and done dozens of generative AI workshops to know that this doesn’t come to people naturally.”
DeltaGen is building a platform targeted at enterprise workflows, starting with financial professionals. Its tool identifies workflows associated with a particular job by scanning LinkedIn profiles of users, and then provides solutions designed for specific tasks. 
“You don’t really need to write anything,” Bystron said. “You select and choose.”





Bystron said the software leverages around 30 APIs from different AI models and picks the best one for a particular job. 
“There are models that work better for some workflows, and others that work better for others,” he said.
DeltaGen is still in beta mode. It plans to generate revenue using a traditional software-as-a-service model, charging users for premium features.
The 5-person company recently joined the latest cohort of the Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator, a Denver, Colo.-based program designed for tech startups addressing labor market challenges. Another Seattle startup, Incskill, is also participating in the three-month program. 
Techstars earlier this year shut down its Seattle accelerator. 
Bystron previously was a project leader at Boston Consulting Group, and founded and led Meltingpot Forum, a large multidisciplinary speaker event in the Czech Republic.
DeltaGen co-founder and CTO Avinash Uddaraju previously co-founded Gritly, which also participated in Techstars’ workforce accelerator and was acquired by IIA Healthcare. Other co-founders at DeltaGen include CMO Abdullah Raja and COO Casey McCullar.

IMF proposes tax on AI carbon emissions to counter job loss, income inequality
A carbon tax could also curb AI's environmental toll

Why it matters: Generative AI has emerged as a powerful but disruptive new technology, already bringing major changes to how many people work – and causing job losses for many others. Now, the International Monetary Fund believes that those job losses may hamper tax collections, so something has to give. One of their proposals to compensate is a carbon tax on the energy-intensive server farms powering these AI systems. 
This idea was floated in an IMF discussion paper titled ""Broadening the Gains from Generative AI: The Role of Fiscal Policies."" The paper's core argument is that while generative AI can be a huge productivity booster, it also risks widening inequality and hitting government coffers hard as jobs get automated.
Traditional automation tended to replace routine, lower-skilled jobs. Generative AI's cognitive capabilities mean it could start making inroads into fields like computer programming, accounting, and many other white-collar roles we thought were safe – ""potentially amplifying job losses in cognitive occupations,"" according to the paper. Fewer workers means less income tax revenue for governments.
Therefore, the IMF thinks that fiscal policies need to adapt. One suggestion is rethinking how we tax capital versus labor income. Capital (think machines, software, etc.) is often taxed less than labor, but if AI is letting capital replace human workers en masse, that balance may need rejigging.

They also raised concerns about ""winner-take-all"" markets dominated by a few mega-firms that can afford the massive computing costs of developing cutting-edge AI systems.

A carbon tax on those energy-hungry AI server farms could help level that playing field a little. ""Given the large amount of energy consumed by AI servers, taxing the associated carbon emissions is a good way to reflect the external environmental costs in the price of the technology,"" noted the IMF.
After all, AI is a real energy hog. Last year, research from AI startup Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University showed that generating a single AI image can eat up as much power as recharging a smartphone. Text generation is far more efficient, but is still no slouch in the electricity department. An AI tax based on their emissions could encourage more efficient practices.
The IMF stopped short of advocating a blanket ""AI tax"" since that could hamper innovation and adoption in countries that implement it, causing them to fall behind competition. But they did muse that AI could help upgrade old tax bureaucracies, allowing concepts like real-time property taxes based on market values.
""Gen AI will turn classic tax theory upside down and urge a rethink of the old ways of doing things. It may, for instance, usher in the design of a personalized progressive value-added tax, an income tax based on lifetime income, or a real-time market-value-based property tax.""
Of course, these proposals are more about preparing for various scenarios than concrete recommendations.
The potential job impacts are staggering. Earlier projections from the IMF estimated AI could affect nearly 40% of global jobs, rising to around 60% for rich countries. Whether that means humans being displaced or simply working alongside AI assistants remains to be seen.

California Takes Action to Protect Job ApplicantsKhari Johnson, CalMattersJun 20Save ArticleSave ArticleFailed to save articlePlease try againEmail (Adriana Heldiz/CalMatters; iStock)California regulators are moving to restrict how employers can use artificial intelligence to screen workers and job applicants — warning that using AI to measure tone of voice, facial expressions and reaction times may run afoul of the law.
The draft regulations say that if companies use automated systems to limit or prioritize applicants based on pregnancy, national origin, religion or criminal history, that’s discrimination.
Members of the public have until July 18 to comment on the proposed rules. After that, regulators in the California Civil Rights Department may amend and will eventually approve them, subject to final review by an administrative law judge, capping off a process that began three years ago.
The rules govern so-called “automated decision systems” — artificial intelligence and other computerized processes, including quizzes, games, resume screening, and even advertising placement. The regulations say using such systems to analyze physical characteristics or reaction times may constitute illegal discrimination. The systems may not be used at all, the new rules say, if they have an “adverse impact” on candidates based on certain protected characteristics.
The draft rules also require companies that sell predictive services to employers to keep records for four years in order to respond to discrimination claims.

A crackdown is necessary in part because while businesses want to automate parts of the hiring process, “this new technology can obscure responsibility and make it harder to discern who’s responsible when a person is subjected to discriminatory decision-making,” said Ken Wang, a policy associate with the California Employment Lawyers Association.
The draft regulations make it clear that third-party service providers are agents of the employer and hold employers responsible.
The California Civil Rights Department started exploring how algorithms, a type of automated decision system, can impact job opportunities and automate discrimination in the workplace in April 2021. Back then, Autistic People of Color Fund founder Lydia X. Z. Brown warned the agency about the harm that hiring algorithms can inflict on people with disabilities. Brown told CalMatters that whether the new draft rules offer meaningful protection depends on how they’re implemented and enforced.
Researchers, advocates and journalists have amassed a body of evidence that AI models can automate discrimination, including in the workplace. Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that resume screening software made by the company Aon discriminates against people based on race and disability despite the company’s claim that its AI is “bias-free.” An evaluation of leading artificial intelligence firm OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 technology found that the large language model can exhibit racial bias when used to automatically sift through the resumes of job applicants. Though the company uses filters to prevent the language model from producing toxic language, internal tests of GPT-3 also surfaced race, gender, and religious bias.

Wearing glasses or a headscarf or having a bookshelf in the background of a video job interview can skew personality predictions, according to an investigative report by German public broadcast station Bayerischer Rundfunk. So can the font a job applicant chooses when submitting a resume, according to researchers at New York University.
California’s proposed regulations are the latest in a series of initiatives to protect workers from businesses using harmful forms of AI.
In 2021, New York City lawmakers passed a law to protect job applicants from algorithmic discrimination in hiring, although researchers from Cornell University and Consumer Reports recently concluded that the law has been ineffective. And in 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Justice Department clarified that employers must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act when using automation during hiring.
The California Privacy Protection Agency, meanwhile, is considering draft rules that, among other things, define what information employers can collect on contractors, job applicants, and workers, allowing them to see what data employers collect and to opt out from such collection or request human review.
Pending legislation would further empower the source of the draft revisions, the California Civil Rights Department. Assembly Bill 2930 would allow the department to demand impact assessments from businesses and state agencies that use AI in order to protect against automated discrimination.

Outside of government, union leaders now increasingly argue that rank-and-file workers should be able to weigh in on the effectiveness and harms of AI in order to protect the public. Labor representatives have had conversations with California officials about specific projects as they experiment with how to use AI.

Google, University of Tokyo to launch AI project to solve regional issues


June 19, 2024 (Mainichi Japan)






















Google LLC announces it will launch an initiative that uses generative artificial intelligence to address challenges faced by local communities in Tokyo on June 19, 2024. (Kyodo)



    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Google LLC said Wednesday it will collaborate with the University of Tokyo to launch an initiative that uses generative artificial intelligence to address challenges faced by local communities in Japan, such as a shrinking workforce, with successful models to be rolled out nationwide by 2027.







    Yutaka Matsuo, a professor at the university known for being a leading figure in AI research, will be involved in the project, which will first be piloted in Osaka and Hiroshima prefectures, Google said at a technology conference in Tokyo.




    Students who have completed courses in Matsuo's laboratory will work with Google engineers to construct generative AI models to solve specific issues.




    In Osaka, the focus will be on resolving employment mismatches due to skews in the types of professions that job seekers prefer. A successful model, for example, would be able to suggest positions that job seekers themselves may not have realized were suitable, or illustrate ideal career paths leading to a desired job.

Training and upskilling staff in order to best take advantage of artificial intelligence's potential takes on greater importance in particular, but tried-and-true communication and leadership skills can't be left by the wayside either, the data tells us.Research on current workplace trends was conducted by Arizent, parent company of National Mortgage News, who surveyed 550 individuals in seven financial services segments. The total included 55 mortgage professionals involved in leadership or hiring decisions at their companies. Respondents answered questions revolving around a range of topics, such as the skills of their peers to their work-from-home status.       ",NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/list/ai-has-companies-and-workers-thinking-about-reskilling'}",How AI is disrupting the mortgage workforce,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/b2/43/af70f35741c0adc27a64a959ad23/artificial-intelligence.jpeg'}",2024-06-20T15:11:56.638Z,2024-06-24T16:37:54.123Z,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', 'affiliation': 'National Mortgage News', 'articleSection': 'Author', 'description': 'Spencer Lee is a reporter based in New York City, covering technology and affordable housing.', 'image': {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/f3/25/057a7ffa430496cb4c1870b3018e/spencer-lee-headshot.jpg'}, 'jobTitle': 'Reporter', 'name': 'Spencer Lee', 'url': 'https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/author/spencer-lee'}]","{'foundingDate': '', 'name': 'National Mortgage News', 'sameAs': [], 'logo': {'@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/54/5e/6aaf5bcd4840ba2a3ddec2c2543f/nationalmortgagenews-brand-logo-color-no-padding.svg', 'height': '40px', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization'}",,,https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/list/ai-has-companies-and-workers-thinking-about-reskilling,https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/b2/43/af70f35741c0adc27a64a959ad23/artificial-intelligence.jpeg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', 'affiliation': 'National Mortgage News', 'articleSection': 'Author', 'description': 'Spencer Lee is a reporter based in New York City, covering technology and affordable housing.', 'image': {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/f3/25/057a7ffa430496cb4c1870b3018e/spencer-lee-headshot.jpg'}, 'jobTitle': 'Reporter', 'name': 'Spencer Lee', 'url': 'https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/author/spencer-lee'}]",,,Listicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-20T15:11:56.638Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel says he has used ChatGPT in his studies.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)Schools and universities have been scrambling to keep up since ChatGPT and other generative AI language programs were released in late 2022.University student Lan Lang, 18, said quite a few people used generative AI for assessments such as English assignments.""I do get Chat to like explain stuff to me if teachers don't really explain it that well,"" Lan Lang said. Sam and Lan Lang say generative Al can be a helpful tool for students.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)She said she used AI detection software on her work.""We put it through Turnitin, which just basically detects if you've used AI, or if you've copied off anyone else's work,"" she said.Caught out in schoolsHigh school teacher Ryan Miller said he wasn't seeing a lot of generative AI used in the Year 12 and Year 8 classes he taught but understood from colleagues other age groups were using it. Ryan Miller says students get a warning when caught using AI for assignments.(Supplied: Ryan Miller)""What I hear, when I'm in the staff room, is that a lot of Year 9s, 10s, [and] 11s are pushing the boundaries,"" Mr Miller said.He said Year 12 students tended to be more careful after being warned at the start of the year and constantly reminded of consequences.""Basically, they're told if their work is seen to be made ... predominantly with AI, that it won't be assessed,"" he said.Mr Miller said Year 8s, being a little newer to the school, hadn't used it as much.He said teachers tended to give students a warning if they were detected using generative AI.""And nine times out of 10 they'll probably own up to it and say, 'Yeah, look, it wasn't ... 100 per cent my own work',"" he said. He said students would rewrite the work so it could be assessed again.""But it's sort of a one warning per kid, per year for most teachers, I think,"" he said.Fellow teacher Hugh Kinnane said generative AI was probably ""pretty rife"" in assignment work.He said he most regularly saw it cropping up with students who were trying to avoid doing any work.""And then it's a last-minute job,"" he said. Jennie Shaw says her university has embraced the use of artificial intelligence.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)Drawing the lineUniversity of Adelaide Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic Jennie Shaw said while her university embraced the use of AI, it could still be used to cheat.Is it art if it's by AI? Brisbane Portrait Prize committee accused of jumping on 'slippery slope'The Brisbane Portrait Prize will allow AI artworks for the first time in this year's competition in a move that has left some in the industry ""uneasy"".Read more""So we're saying, of course, that is not allowed,"" Dr Shaw said.She said generative AI was included in academic integrity modules for first-year students.""We make it really clear to students what is OK and what is not OK,"" she said.Dr Shaw said there were instances when students were encouraged to use generative AI and then critique the quality of its answer.""What we are asking our students and our staff to do is to reference when they do use it,"" she said.She said it was a requirement that as much content as possible was checked by similarity detection software.According to Turnitin's website — which is used by the University of Adelaide as well as many other universities across Australia to detect AI-generated content— the company is committed to a false positive rate of less than 1 per cent to ensure not students are falsely accused of misconduct.AI arms raceThe software has put students at the centre of a battle for superiority between programs generating answers for their assignments and those designed to catch them out.And according to Australian Institute for Machine Learning senior lecturer Feras Dayoub, some are getting caught in the crossfire. Feras Dayoub says AI detection tools are not 100 per cent accurate.(BTN High: Cale Matthews)He said companies that created AI chatbots were trying to be undetectable while companies that created AI detection software wanted to detect everything.""There will be a lot of false positives,"" Dr Dayoub said.He said it could be an unpleasant experience for the student if the detector was wrong. Students Ethan (left) and Nicholas say they have noticed issues with AI-detecting programs.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)University student Ethan, 19, said single words were sometimes highlighted in his Turnitin submissions.""It can be a bit inaccurate,"" Ethan said.Dr Shaw said she understood the detection software had its faults.""We would find probably two thirds of anything they pick up saying there's some unacceptably high levels of similarity here is often just picking up patterns in language,"" she said.""I know some universities have chosen to turn it off because it does turn up lots of false positives.""We're choosing to use it at this point.""Changing educationThe Department of Education released a nationwide framework in December last year for the use of generative AI in schools.Subscribe to the BTN NewsletterDo you want to be notified when the next BTN High stories arrive?

In a groundbreaking revelation, a global survey by business automation company UiPath found that Singaporean Millennials and Gen Z workers lead the world in using generative AI tools at work. This survey involved 9,047 full-time employees from nine countries and highlights how these young Singaporean workers leverage AI to save time and increase productivity compared to older generations.
Generative AI adoption among younger workers
Singapore's younger workers enthusiastically embrace generative AI to tackle various work-related tasks. The survey indicates that 60% of local employees have used these tools during work hours. Typical uses include drafting communications (44%), summarising long-form content (34%), and brainstorming ideas (34%). These applications demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of generative AI in everyday work scenarios.
Battling burnout with AI
Amidst harsh economic conditions, Singaporean workers are experiencing heavier workloads, leading to increased stress and burnout. Nearly a third (30%) of employees in Singapore reported feeling extremely or very burned out. To combat this, workers are seeking ways to reduce their workloads (62%), have more time and capacity to complete tasks (46%), and gain access to AI and automation tools, including generative AI (43%).
Generative AI is viewed as a promising solution to alleviate burnout by giving employees more time to focus on critical tasks. The survey reveals that 62% of Singaporean workers who use generative AI believe it has saved them significant time, with over 42% reporting savings of 10 or more hours per week.
Expert insights and government initiatives
Jess O'Reilly, Area Vice President of Asia at UiPath, emphasised the positive impact of generative AI and automation on productivity and work-life balance. She stated, “The findings from our survey indicate that Singaporean workers who utilise both technologies have seen greater productivity and an improved work-life balance. To foster a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, and establish strategic private-public partnerships will be key to helping workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI.”
The survey results align with the Singapore government's efforts to promote AI adoption. In collaboration with partners like DataRobot, IBM, Singtel, and Temasek, the government launched Project Moonshot. This initiative provides a testing toolkit designed to address the security and safety challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), which are fundamental to many AI-driven solutions. Project Moonshot aims to ensure that AI technologies are implemented securely and effectively, supporting the broader digital transformation of Singapore's workforce.
In summary, the UiPath survey underscores the significant role of generative AI in enhancing productivity and reducing burnout among Singaporean workers. With continued government and private sector support, Singapore is well-positioned to lead the global digital transformation landscape.

So, what does it mean for you?",,http://schema.org,,,,"  Artificial IntelligenceExplore what generative AI can do for your professional work June 10, 2024 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  June 10, 2024 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Watch our on-demand webinar for details and demos of the first and only professional-grade GenAI assistant, CoCounsel—and a sneak peek at its newest skill, CoCounsel Drafting. Should you trust a GenAI Legal Assistant to work for you? Watch on-demand webcast >  Since the launch of ChatGPT less than 2 years ago, there’s been a fundamental shift in what we can expect machines to competently do for us. Generative AI is giving professionals the opportunity to not just get tasks done more quickly, but to do them more thoroughly and accurately, transforming what it means to work.   Because this technology can read, analyze, and write at a postgraduate level, it understands the context and complexity in a request, and what’s required to fulfill that request, allowing it to produce results on par with what you’d expect from someone on your team. Consider that today 81% of professionals believe GenAI can be applied to their work. And that 79% of business and technology leaders expect GenAI to drive substantial transformation over the next 3 years—with 31% saying it will happen in less than a year. GenAI is here to stay. So, what does that mean for you?  Revolutionary era, revolutionary solution These leaps forward in AI technology have made it possible to build not just GenAI-powered tools but a true GenAI assistant. An intelligent, proactive product that can itself make use of GenAI tools to complete substantive, sophisticated, multi-step work, just as you could expect a colleague to do.  This is why we believe that within 3 years, every professional will have one. But do you know which GenAI assistant is right for your work? The answer is CoCounsel. Our professional-grade assistant brings the power of GenAI to complete the task at hand, from within the products you already use every day. CoCounsel works alongside you, ready to perform sophisticated research, analyze dense and voluminous information, and produce a variety of content—in minutes. With CoCounsel, for the first time, you can delegate complex work to AI and trust the results. Today, CoCounsel lives within our law firm and corporate legal solutions, including Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel and Practical Law Dynamic with CoCounsel. Checkpoint Edge with CoCounsel, our first generative AI product for tax professionals, is in beta, with CoCounsel Audit and CoCounsel Advisory on their way. Early work is beginning on CoCounsel Fraud Detection and CoCounsel Investigators for risk & fraud professionals. And we’ve begun integrating with customers’ most-used third-party programs, such as Microsoft 365 and database management solutions, with Microsoft Word, Outlook, and SharePoint integrations in beta.  CoCounsel: The GenAI for professionals Learn more >  Your future GenAI colleague is already on the way  Today’s CoCounsel is just the beginning. Our vision for this transformative product is guided by the principle of “less is more” when it comes to solving problems with technology. That’s why we’re developing a single, simple way to tap into all Thomson Reuters GenAI capabilities. So even as we build more CoCounsel skills and more third-party integrations that you can use in more places, the experience for you will become less and less complex.  Over time, today’s separate products, which now include CoCounsel, will be simultaneously accessible through one CoCounsel chat interface. You’ll simply tell the GenAI assistant what you need to accomplish, and it will remember the overall context of the work and draw from its vast, common “pool” of capabilities across products to get the job done. The experience for you will be a single, ongoing “conversation” with an intelligent, proactive assistant—CoCounsel. The result? More time for you to do the strategic work machines can’t do, so you can better serve your clients, increase your competitive edge, and grow your business.  The most important for a solution professionals can count on—and what we mean by “professional-grade”—is that it addresses concerns regarding the safe and responsible use of GenAI in your work. CoCounsel is rooted in our market-leading, verified databases of content, understands professional standards, and can deliver reliable results at superhuman speed. And most important, it’s encrypted end-to-end, so your data—and your customers’—remains private and secure.  This is professional-grade generative AI.   The skill you’ve been waiting for—CoCounsel Drafting   This summer, CoCounsel Drafting will join CoCounsel’s broad set of skills, enabling you to create documents seamlessly and efficiently, by uniting Thomson Reuters content, your content and expertise, and the power of GenAI within Microsoft Word.  At launch, CoCounsel Drafting will assist legal professionals, connecting Practical Law Dynamic with CoCounsel, soon followed by a full roadmap of capabilities supporting litigation needs, with connection to Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel.  Revolutionize drafting with generative AI Draft faster than ever before with CoCounsel Drafting from Thomson Reuters – built on the content you know and trust. Lock in promotional pricing today CoCounsel Drafting will solve the problem of wondering where to start, by connecting to your content, finding relevant past work, and letting you validate and select the right document for the task at hand. The next difficult part of drafting is review and negotiation, and CoCounsel Drafting will be there to help you understand how a redlined document deviates from a standard, then map those changes against a playbook, flagging risks, identifying key missing language, and providing suggestions for alternatives. Finally, CoCounsel Drafting will check for common errors, missing definitions, numeration issues … all the last-step work that must happen before you get your document out the door. The professional landscape is evolving, fast, and those who win in the end will choose the right partner for their ongoing GenAI journey. Thomson Reuters CoCounsel is already leading the way, but even more importantly, we have a concrete, long-term vision we’re uniquely equipped to deliver on, to deliver ever-simpler experiences and ever-increasing benefits.Get going on your GenAI journey. Watch our webinar about today’s CoCounsel and our vision for this transformative product. Watch on-demand webcast >   Never miss an update on AI for your work.

 What Is GenAI And Why Is It So Important For Finance?
The term “generative AI” (GenAI) refers to tools powered by algorithms that can create new content based on existing data. ChatGPT may have taken the world by storm with its ability to write anything from prose and poetry to complex computer code, but its potential uses go far beyond.
Of particular relevance to banking and finance professionals is its ability to interpret data, from simple statistics to vast spreadsheets filled with huge amounts of real-time transactional information.

Rather than presenting information as complex graphs or charts that then have to be interpreted, AI can quickly highlight what is important and what is just noise that can be ignored. Importantly, these interpretations can be personalized depending on the role of the person they’re intended for.

This means professionals will spend less time on routine information-based tasks and more time making decisions and strategizing, as well as on face-to-face business. One survey found that 75 percent of junior financial services workers believe up to a quarter of their workload could be automated by AI.
So here’s a rundown of how generative AI will be integrated across specific tasks and responsibilities that are critical to keeping the financial world ticking!
How Will Generative AI Change Finance Work?
Generative AI tools will streamline transaction processing by automating many of the routine tasks such as data entry, validation and reconciliation. As GenAI systems become more powerful and accurate, this will mean banks and other financial institutions can offer faster, more reliable and perhaps even cheaper services to their clients.
All financial services institutions dedicate significant resources to detecting and preventing fraud. This involves analyzing potentially millions of transactions and flagging those with specific characteristics that indicate fraud. GenAI can do this far more quickly than any human and can also report results in a way that makes it simple for a human risk assessor to step in and understand why a particular transaction could be suspicious.
Managing investments is another important element of financial services, and generative AI algorithms can assist with analyzing markets, assessing the performance of companies and other assets, identifying trends and evaluating the effectiveness of investment strategies. Investment managers can then spend more face-to-face time with their clients, getting a better understanding of their needs and requirements.
Insurance underwriting is likely to be revolutionized by generative AI, which is able to understand and interpret information around risk, providing more detailed and accurate assessments that will help underwriters make more informed decisions. It can also be used to generate synthetic data, which follows the patterns and rules of real-world data, to fill holes when there is not enough real-world data available.
For those working on the regulation and compliance side of financial services, generative AI will help with analyzing and interpreting complex regulatory texts and legal documents. This means banks and insurers will more quickly identify risks of costly and damaging breaches.
Customer services will also be heavily impacted by the GenAI revolution. We may have found chatbots and automated customer service systems frustrating in the past. But a new generation of ChatGPT-like chatbots, powered by large language models (LLMs), will answer many questions more quickly and efficiently than human operators, improving customer satisfaction and retention rates. Rather than meaning human customer service agents are redundant, they will have more time for complex and sensitive work.
The Future Role Of Financial Professionals
As generative AI increasingly transforms information-based work across the finance industry, the role of finance professionals in society will shift, too.
The traditional view of the highly pressured analyst working late into the night, hunched over a monitor and interpreting charts and statistics, will hopefully become a thing of the past.
Many will find that unique human abilities, such as communication, interpersonal skills, strategic decision-making and teambuilding, will become increasingly important to their career progression.
The time saved by automating routine tasks can instead be used to build firmer relationships with clients and colleagues. Additionally, there will be more chances to pursue ongoing learning and skills development, creating professionals capable of adapting to the changing nature of their business.
This is a change that everyone, not just those in financial services, will have to prepare for. Those who embrace it now – in the relatively early years of the AI revolution – will set themselves up for more fulfilling and rewarding careers.

<p>The Department of Teacher Education, Section for English and Foreign Languages, offers a full-time, 3-year position as a Ph.D. candidate to take part in the project “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” in cooperation with<a href=""https://www.ntnu.no/ilu/forskning/nted-digit/nted"" target=""_blank""> the research group on technology and learning in education: NTED-DIGIT</a>. The project leaders are <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tom.nurmi"" target=""_blank"">Associate Professor Tom Nurmi</a>, <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.rokenes"">Associate Professor Fredrik Mørk Røkenes</a>,  and <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/han.han"" target=""_blank"">Postdoctoral Researcher Han Han</a>.</p>

<p>Although AI has the potential to be a tool in climate modeling and remediation efforts, its extractive resource and supply chain costs, e-waste pathways, and carbon footprint actively contribute to pollution and global warming. This project examines how language education can be a site of critical information literacy around environmental climate research and the cost/benefits of AI technologies. The “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” project explores how AI ed-tech (e.g., text-to-image generators DALL-E/MidJourney) influences students’ epistemic beliefs about environmental climate research and (mis)information in English in the school while also investigating the pedagogical potential of current trends in AI-climate-related natural sciences and humanities projects (e.g., biodiversity monitoring, pollution detection, AI in eco-literature, etc.).  </p>

<p>For a position as a Ph.D. candidate, the goal is to complete a doctoral education and obtain a doctoral degree. The Ph.D. candidate will be affiliated with the research group New Technologies and Educational Design (NTED-DIGIT) and connected to the group’s research activities (seminars, workshops, conferences, etc.). NTED-DIGIT’s main objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develop new knowledge about emerging technologies, formative design, and learning processes at all levels of education.</li>
	<li>investigate the use of information and communications technology for teaching and learning using diverse methodological approaches.</li>
	<li>explore the development of teachers’ professional digital competence across subject disciplines and educational contexts.</li>
	<li>identify the impact of digitalization on processes related to teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research to explore AI’s influence on perspectives about controversial scientific topics, such as environmental climate research, which is an emerging area of research in language education that presents challenges and opportunities for students’ epistemic beliefs. The use of generative AI tools to generate and influence online information and manipulate perceptions is expanding, especially in English, thus increasing the importance of developing students’ critical literacy in language education.  The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research about how (mis)information in environmental climate research and artificial intelligence (AI) in language education in different language education contexts, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school and teacher education. The candidate should pursue practices with emerging AI-powered technologies (for instance, popular science texts and resources about climate research influenced by content creation tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E/MidJourney) and study how student knowledge is relevant to the design of language teaching. This research will contribute to the discourse of environmental humanities, language education, and AI technologies in education.</p>

Moreover, 43% of CEOs said they will use gen AI to inform strategic decisions. Companies worldwide are recognizing the benefits of gen AI and its crucial role in their success. This is driving a new era of work, productivity and opportunities across industries. AI is projected to enhance human productivity and unlock an astounding $16 trillion (https://apo-opa.co/4c8KytI) in value by 2030. In perspective, the fifth largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was about $3.7 trillion. When combined with automation technology, gen AI can help clients improve interactions with customers and partners, as well as boost operational efficiency and productivity.  Slow but steady AI adoption in AfricaThis is not just a global phenomenon; half of the African CEOs surveyed in our IBM report (https://apo-opa.co/3yOCZdH) expect to realise significant value from advanced AI and analytics. However, adopting AI is not without its obstacles. Many businesses on the continent and beyond are grappling with a multitude of challenges. Globally, 82% of IT professionals say IT complexity is impeding success in deploying AI, while 55% of business leaders (https://apo-opa.co/3yLNA93) lack key information regarding their technology spending decisions. In Africa, many organizations face barriers such as costs, market and regulatory factors, workforce readiness, infrastructure, skills gap, ethics and governance. Become an AI-first organization to stay aheadTo overcome these challenges, organizations must move to an AI-first approach, where AI is integrated into their business strategy across the lifecycle. Being AI-first enables businesses to be value-creators rather than solely value users. Companies that will lead their respective industries for the next decade or two will be the ones that decide to be AI-first. That is why we launched watsonx (https://apo-opa.co/4catrIm) in 2023 to develop trusted AI and drive innovation for organizations in every sector or industry. Building an open-source AI community is a core part of our AI strategy. At our recent THINK conference, we further enhanced watsonx’s data and automation capabilities to make it more open, cost-effective, and flexible for businesses.  We achieved this by releasing a family of IBM Granite code models to the open-source community. We launched InstructLab (https://apo-opa.co/4catsfo) with Red Hat, to enhance large language models and open the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute. We also announced IBM Concert (https://apo-opa.co/4cattQu) that uses AI-powered automation to help businesses to discover gaps, prioritize insights, reduce complexity and streamline operations for more innovation and cost-effectiveness.Putting IBM AI solutions and watsonx to work across industriesSince the launch of watsonx, we have over 700 client pilots running and managing over 1,200 AI models globally. We have also increased the accessibility of watsonx by making it available (https://apo-opa.co/3XbtlvD) on AWS Marketplace, reaching 92 countries worldwide, including 18 in Africa. To name a few examples, we are leveraging watsonx’s geospatial foundation model built from NASA’s satellite data to ensure climate resilience with the Government of Kenya (https://apo-opa.co/4c76YvI) watsonx is enabling local scientists to track and visualize tree-planting activities to assist the government’s goal of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. Working with Neostream Technology, an IBM business partner based in Kenya, we successfully deployed and integrated IBM Instana with M-GAS – a premium provider of liquefied petroleum gas in the country. The deployment of Instana has provided real-time monitoring and visibility. This has empowered M-GAS to track critical business applications with granular application-level insights. This has empowered M-GAS to address issues across all layers of their technology stack that previously could not be delivered by traditional monitoring tools. Lastly, Instana’s intuitive interfaces and customizable dashboards have offered rapid issue identification and resolution, fostering team collaboration, minimizing downtime, and enabling M-GAS to intervene proactively to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to their customers.In the Middle East, we partnered with the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority to launch an open-source Arabic Large Language Model, ALLaM on watsonx (https://apo-opa.co/4catuUy).  This has enabled the deployment of Arabic gen AI models, which opens the possibility of building AI models for Africa using the continent’s rich and diverse languages. Globally, working with Transport for London (https://apo-opa.co/3XebtAe), we deployed IBM Maximo to assist in managing the day-to-day maintenance efforts for more than 10,000 internal technicians within the London Underground. Above ground, the software enables the tracking, support and oversight of numerous contractors – helping extend existing equipment’s life and keeping commuters happy.Across the world, organizations are leveraging IBM’s AI business solutions to solve business challenges. Their use cases range from banking and financial services, energy, telecommunications, climate change and sustainability, customer services and entertainment to name a few.The right partnerships and governance are keyThe adoption of gen AI is accelerating across enterprises as organizations aim to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities. To achieve this, organizations need to have a robust AI strategy and the right level of investment. They also need to establish and implement clear and consistent standards or guardrails concerning the utilisation of AI across all strategic focus areas. Most importantly, they need the right partner who understands the overall business objective and how to overcome barriers preventing AI adoption. Such collaborative partnerships are critical for developing robust data and AI strategies, filling the skills gaps, and guiding the organizational change necessary for successful AI adoption.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of GITEX Africa.Media filesDownload logoThis Press Release has been issued by APO.

This is according to a new international study by Microsoft and LinkedIn on labour and recruitment trends due to the rise of generative AI. The research also predicts the rise of AI super users as the labour market – which has already undergone significant change in recent years – will shift again. The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report draws on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, hiring trends from LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 productivity data and research with Fortune 500 companies.AI is becoming the rule rather than the exception in the workplace. Image: Microsoft, LinkedInGenerative AI could give job candidates an edgeThe research reveals that three-quarters of people surveyed use generative AI at work, with the majority (78%) bringing their own AI tools into the workplace, especially in small and medium-sized businesses. AI emerges as a tool to help people deal with an increased pace and volume of work that more than two-thirds of respondents struggle with (68%), helping them offload menial tasks. However, many of those drawing on AI at work fear that doing so might make them look replaceable (53%) and worry that AI could replace their jobs (45%).But it looks like the opposite could be the case.AI skills could make or break a job candidate’s chances to clinch a role.  Image: Microsoft, LinkedInOver the past eight years, hiring for technical AI roles was up 323%, and businesses are now turning to non-technical talent with the skills to apply generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed say they wouldn’t hire a candidate without AI skills. Nearly three-quarters said they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. AI jobs have been growing rapidly since the early 2010s.  Image: PwCAI specialist skills command a premiumThis trend is consistent with PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer, which found that jobs requiring AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all jobs combined. The exponential need for AI-qualified staff has been on an upward trajectory since 2016 – well before the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Moreover, PwC’s analysis of half a billion job ads from 15 countries shows that, on average, AI specialist jobs command up to a 25% premium in pay. While technologists see some of the highest wage premiums, AI skills also pay dividends for professionals such as lawyers, sales and marketing managers, and accountants. This further underlines that AI skills are needed across roles and industries. The top three occupations that have added AI to their skills and aptitudes on LinkedIn are creatives: content writers, graphic designers and marketing managers. Following hot on their heels are entrepreneurs and business professionals, along with the web and software developers you might more naturally expect to find on the list.Roles requiring AI skills will command a wage premium. Image: PwCThe rise of the AI super user Workers clearly understand the role of AI for advancing their career prospects. More than three-quarters of people surveyed for Microsoft and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Index felt that AI skills will be necessary for staying competitive in the job market. They also view AI knowledge as a way to get promoted faster (69%) and broaden their job opportunities (79%). And people are acting on it: attendance of LinkedIn Learning courses on AI for non-technical professionals has increased 160% in the past six months. Have you read?How to build the skills needed for the age of AIWhy we must bridge the skills gap to harness the power of AIThis is the one skill we all need in the age of AIThe research predicts that AI upskilling – whether through formal learning or simply by using AI tools in the workplace – may lead to the rise of ‘AI power users’.Power users are those who are ahead of the curve in terms of their AI use. They use it several times a week at work, benefitting from making their workload more manageable, boosting their creativity or helping them focus on the most important work. It also makes them feel more motivated and enjoy work more.Workers are upskilling to add AI to their repertoire as employers make AI skills a recruitment priority across sectors and roles.  Image: Microsoft, LinkedInHow to become an AI power user? If the research findings are anything to go by, then becoming an AI power user is the way to go to further career progression. So, what are the habits that mark out a power user? According to the 2024 Work Trend Index, it’s some of the following:Experiment with different ways of using AI: power users are more than two-thirds more likely than other survey respondents to do so.Always ask yourself, “How can AI help?”: power users are nearly 50% more likely to pause to explore what AI could contribute before tackling a new task, to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), for example, by researching new prompts (+56%).‘Bookend’ your working day with AI: 9 in 10 power users use AI tools to start their day and get set up for the next day.Redesign your ways of working with AI and save time: power users are much more likely than other respondents to use AI for a wide range of tasks, including catching up on meetings, analyzing information, designing visual content, brainstorming ideas and even interacting with customers.Redesign business processes with AI: power users don’t just stop at reorganizing their own ways of working; they are also 66% more likely to redesign entire business processes and workflows in the organization using AI tools.AI power users are emerging. Image: Microsoft, LinkedInGetting business and education ready for the AI futureWith PwC finding that skillsets for what it terms ‘AI-exposed occupations’ are changing 25% faster than in roles where AI is less relevant, adopting some, if not all, of these habits could dramatically improve people’s future career development.However, the findings also mean that organizations and educational systems must do major work to prepare the current workforce and future generations for an AI-driven world of work. As part of its mission to build more resilient, productive, equitable and human-centric workplaces, the World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance focuses on deploying AI effectively and responsibly. The Education 4.0 framework aims to ensure education and training systems teach AI skills and leverage AI for better learning.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on this topicSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

	A total of 36 percent of U.K. citizens, or 18 million people between the ages of 16 and 75, have used a generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini or Midjourney, according to new research from advisory and consulting firm Deloitte. That is up from 26 percent recorded in 2023, its Digital Consumer Trends 2024 survey of 4,150 U.K. adults aged 16-75 found.

	“Just over a third (36 percent) of generative AI users use it once a week or daily. This is equivalent to 13 percent of all people in the U.K.,” the firm highlighted in the report. “Four percent of all people in the U.K. claim to use generative AI daily (versus 3 percent in 2023). Two in five (41 percent) of generative AI users are extremely infrequent users, at less often than once per month.”

	And 26 percent of respondents only tried it once or twice. “They may have experimented but seen little utility in the technology,” Deloitte highlighted.

	The number of Brits who have used generative AI at work is up 66 percent to seven million from four million last year, according to the research. “Given that many organizations still lack an official stance on use and/or a governance structure, many of these employees may have used GenAI outside of the purview of their management,” Deloitte noted.



	What are the top usage cases at work? Generating ideas (44 percent) and searching (41 percent) are the most common applications. The latter sees people “looking up information” using generative AI. “This is likely concerning given its propensity to ‘hallucinate,’ which is a function of being a probability engine rather than a knowledge model,” Deloitte warned. “Hallucinating” refers to generative AI producing mistakes.

	“A subset of consumers remain underinformed about how generative AI works and its drawbacks,” Deloitte highlighted. “While 25 percent of those who are aware of GenAI think it is always correct, an even greater 36 percent of users think it is always correct.” Concluded the firm: “A robust governance structure and employee training are important to mitigate these risks.”

	Warned Paul Lee, partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Deloitte: “While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology.”

	









	Added Costi Perricos, partner and global generative AI lead at Deloitte: “Whether organizations have supportive or strict policies on the use of generative AI, it is clear that improving business AI fluency is vital.”

AGI has recorded the highest rise; this year, 65% of respondents revealed they use AGI in at least one business function, up from 33% last year.AGI is a subset of AI capable of generating content such as images, text and video in response to prompts, utilizing deep learning from large language models (LLMs). OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first AGI model to burst onto the scene, and since then, the sector has skyrocketed.McKinsey found that businesses are increasingly using AI in multiple business functions, with 50% using it in two functions while 27% are using it in at least three.Businesses prioritize AGI applications in the functions where they can create the most value, the study found. This is often in customer-facing applications where content and data are critical. It found marketing and sales to be the most impacted, with 34% of the respondents reporting AGI use in the sector. Product and service development was second at 23%, with 17% of businesses using it in IT.Critically, AGI is creating value. The sharp rise in the adoption of the technology has sparked questions on whether the vast investment would yield any returns for deployers.According to the study, 53% of businesses that integrated AGI in marketing and sales recorded an increase in revenue—for one in five businesses, the growth was over 6%. Human resources had the lowest revenue increase at 33%.Additionally, technology cuts costs for businesses, with HR being the most impacted—one in six companies using AGI in software engineering slash costs by up to 20%.With the rising adoption of AGI, concerns about job losses are increasing daily. While projections of millions of job losses by companies like Goldman Sachs (NASDAQ: GS) have been debunked, industry bodies and regulators warn that the technology could disrupt employment dynamics globally.One study in Australia found that AGI developers have largely ignored the interests of workers and their employers. The study debunked claims that workers oppose AI, stating, “In fact, they see opportunities for improving many parts of their work, especially around reducing the burden of menial, repetitive tasks.”However, the expertise and experience that these workers can offer in the AI development process has largely been ignored.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data. Check out CoinGeek’s coverage on this emerging tech to learn more why Enterprise blockchain will be the backbone of AI.Watch: AI is for ‘augmenting’ not replacing the workforce width=""562"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">New to blockchain?

See our ethics statement.Creatives are fearful of how Adobe’s adoption of generative AI will impact their privacy and rights over their work. Illustration by Haein Jeong / The VergeA recent notification from Adobe about a terms of service update caused outrage online once many people — forced to accept the new terms for continued access to its apps and services — interpreted it to mean Adobe was permitting itself free rein to access and use their work to train AI models.  Specifically, the notification said Adobe had “clarified that we may access your content through both automated and manual methods” within its TOS, directing users to a section that says “techniques such as machine learning” may be used to analyze content to improve services, software, and user experiences. The update went viral after creatives took Adobe’s vague language to mean that it would use their work to train Firefly — the company’s generative AI model — or access sensitive projects that might be under NDA.

Adobe has now published a blog to address those concerns and assure its users that this isn’t the case. “Our commitments to our customers have not changed,” Adobe said in its statement, affirming that the company doesn’t train Firefly on customer content or assume ownership of a customer’s work. “Firefly generative AI models are trained on a dataset of licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, and public domain content where copyright has expired.”A before and after comparison of the TOS update (which you can see below) shows that very little about the policy has actually changed. The inclusion of “machine learning,” particularly, while vague, isn’t new and has been present in the TOS for years. One explanation for this is that variations of AI technology that pre-date Firefly have long been used in tools like Photoshop’s Content-Aware Fill and Lightroom’s Select Subject. Confusingly, however, the updated language within the TOS has actually been live since February, with Adobe having only recently notified users of the change.Here’s a comparison that displays (in pink) what was actually changed within Adobe’s TOS back on February 17th. Image: AdobeAdobe’s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, acknowledged on X that the wording within the notification is “unclear” and said the company’s legal team was working to address concerns about the vague language within the policy. “Adobe has had something like this in TOS for over a decade,” said Belsky. “But trust and transparency couldn’t be more crucial these days.”Adobe has developed something of an “image” problem as it’s grown over the years, especially among individual creatives who no longer feel the company has their best interests at heart. It’s been criticized for dropping its one-time purchase model in favor of recurring subscriptions and accused of creating a monopoly over the creative software industry — which concerned regulators enough to effectively force the company to abandon its attempt to acquire Figma last year. While similar software is available from other brands like Affinity, Adobe’s is typically considered the “industry standard” and difficult to avoid using in professional environments.RelatedZoom rewrites its policies to make clear that your videos aren’t used to train AI toolsNotably, Adobe has also developed a mountain of generative AI tools and services since introducing its own Firefly model in March 2023, enthusiastically promoting them as a means for people with limited creative experience to quickly produce content at scale. I imagine that sounds very attractive to businesses, but not so much to creative professionals who are anxious about their job security. It’s easy to see why so many feel betrayed by the company, especially when Adobe seemingly struggles to enforce the generative AI policies it introduced to protect them.That breakdown of trust brings us here. While this viral drama surrounding Adobe’s TOS “update” may blow over, hoards of creatives are watching the company like a hawk. Adobe will have to find an effective way to address those trust issues if it wants independent creators, who have come to expect the worst from the company, to see it as the friend it claims to be rather than a foe.Comments12 Comments / 12 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe next next thing in AI and AR | The Vergecast

        If You’re Job Hunting And Using Generative AI, This Is What You Should And Shouldn't Do
    
        AI generated / Worldcrunch
    SPONSORED CONTENTJOBBIOKirstie McDermottJune 06, 2024A new study shows that those using AI more often are seeing greater productivity gains than those who haven’t yet adopted it.ChatGPT, for example, can be used for translations and idea generation as it can draft and edit emails, reports and presentations. It can also assist with managing your calendar by setting reminders, and help to organize tasks to help you stay on top of your schedule and deadlines.It has even added a new function where you can plug in documents and spreadsheets to make yourself yet more efficient.New data from Asana and Anthropic has found that 66% of workers using generative AI report improved productivity, with 88% of those using it every day saying it has made them more productive.3 global roles hiring right nowSoftware Developer, Oracle, SeattleIT Security Manager - R&D (H/F), Atos, ÉchirollesSoftware Engineer, Associate, BlackRock, EdinburghThose who use generative AI for nine or more use cases are twice as likely to report productivity gains compared to those who use AI in only two or fewer use cases.One area that is seeing rapid adoption of generative AI technologies is hiring. Not only did a recent IBM survey of more than 8,500 global IT professionals find that 42% of companies are using AI screening ""to improve recruiting and human resources"", but applicants themselves are also making use of the technology.This makes sense, according to recruitment professional Owen Murray, founder and CEO of urhired.ie. “Sending a generic CV to multiple positions will not work,” he states. “Tailoring your CV for every position is essential to increase your application-to-interview conversion rate.”This is a great use case for generative AI as it can streamline this process. Copy the job description into your tool of choice, and then prompt it to identify keywords. Next, upload your resume, and ask it to edit this based on the keywords for the role.By doing this you’ll instantly produce a more optimized document which will help you get through companies’ screening processes––and hopefully lead to an interview.That’s a definite do, but what else should you be doing, and what should you definitely avoid?Essential dos and don’tsSo while you can definitely use AI tools to help you create individualized resumes and cover letters for each job you apply for, you should make sure that you review carefully before sending. This is because AI-generated content can sometimes contain errors, inaccuracies, or generic statements that may not reflect your unique qualifications and personality.You can also use generative AI as a job hunting assistant. It can locate relevant job opportunities by analyzing job boards, company websites, and social media platforms. It can suggest roles that match your skills, experiences, and career goals too.What you should then avoid is use of AI tools to blanket-apply for a huge range of jobs, simply because it is easy to do. Hiring managers and HR professionals are wise to this now, and will likely send your application into the trash if they think it reads like an AI wrote it.While it may be tempting, avoid using AI to fabricate or exaggerate your skills, experiences, or qualifications. Misrepresenting yourself may lead to an interview, but once you’re in the seat, you won’t have real life examples and case studies to back this up.Another area you can make use of generative AI’s skills is for interview preparation. AI can simulate job interviews, allowing applicants to practice and improve their responses.

It should be the first draft of a first draft that you then shape and mold into your own voice and shows your dedication to the role.""HR business partner Daniel Space, aka DanFromHR, said that in his experience from an employers' side, AI can be used as a tool to help applications, resumes and cover letters, as it ""creates content so much faster and it's far easier to react and adjust something than to create it from scratch"".It can also help people who struggle at articulating their achievements to ""tailor and focus their message,"" he said. But he warned not to ""overuse it or lean on it too much"".While employers are not, in his experience, ""penalizing"" applicants who use AI, they will ""favor candidates that ensure it's personalized to the individual"" rather than copy-pasting a ChatGPT prompt.""The purpose of a resume is to stand out, but if 100 people all used ChatGPT to write a resume to the same job description, you are again just one more qualified person among 100,"" he argued.""The best way to view it as a tool. Use it to brainstorm, use it to give you a starting ground, but make sure you edit, update and personalize it,"" he said.And Justin Marcus, CEO of www.bigfourtalent.com, asked: ""As long as it is honest and not a writing position they are applying for, why penalize someone for using a service that helps them better articulate their background?""He said: ""The better route would be to use AI to help you better articulate sections of your resume at a time, then proof it and make sure it sounds more human.""According to a survey by Statista, approximately 70 percent of those companies surveyed claim to use AI in business operations as of 2024.At the same time, 63 percent of respondents claimed to use it in both internal and external communications, and just under half used it in human resources and training.",Work,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The 7 Red Flags To Look Out For On A Job Ad, According To Business Experts', 'description': ""Applying for jobs requires a tremendous amount of time and effort, so it's crucial to know which openings are worth the investment.

As our attention and resources focus on generative AI, (gen AI) one question that keeps coming up for me is how companies can use gen AI to address a persistent pain point, new hire on-boarding. Nearly every company, regardless of size or industry has some process for new hire on-boarding, but Gallup research finds only 12% of new employees strongly agree their organization does a great job on-boarding new hires. That’s 88% who are feeling let down just days or weeks into their new job.


Designing a compelling new hire on-boarding experience can lead to greater employee engagement and satisfaction. Gallup research finds employees who state they have an exceptional new hire on-boarding experience are 3.3 times as likely to strongly agree their job is as good or better than expected.

The result of a poorly conceived on-boarding experience can lead to employee attrition. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), employee turnover can be as much as 50% in the first four months for hourly workers and 50% in the first 18 months for senior external hires.

PROMOTED
As I think about these research findings, I see an opportunity to re-design new hire orientation to include generative AI, (genAI.) For a growing number of organizations, the new hiring imperative is being literate in using gen AI in one’s job. The 2024 Work Trend Index from Microsoft and LinkedIn finds 77% of leaders say new hires will get greater responsibilities due to their knowledge of how to effectively use gen AI in their job role. In addition, 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate who has gen AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. But given the continuing talent shortage do companies really have this choice?

Designing a new hire on-boarding process which incorporates gen AI provides an opportunity to enhance and personalize the on-boarding process. Employees can not only learn about the company culture and values but also how to activate gen AI in an employee’s workflow, ranging from text to image generation, assistance in creative ideation, and analyzing data. One of the immediate benefits of using gen AI in the on-boarding process is to personalize the on-boarding experience, so new hires see communication that is meaningful to them, whether they are Gen Z, Millennials, Veterans, or Working Moms. AI powered solutions are already happening with LinkedIn’s new AI powered tool where users can assess a fit for a new role in seconds or iSpring’s eLearning solution where AI supports quiz generation. According to iSpring’s recent research, most businesses prefer to do their staff training in-house and this means relying on mentors as subject matter experts. This presents an opportunity for AI to assist HR leaders in creating professional learning materials while saving on instructional design fees in the design process. Leveraging the power of gen AI can also support new hires by personalizing the communication and designing quizzes to identify skill gaps and assess knowledge.

So how can you think about combining your need to re-design your new hire on-boarding experience with including gen AI to enhance this process? My suggestion is the RAPID model developed for training HR team members in AI. This is depicted below:

This framework starts with the business problem an HR team uncovers and then sets out to identify opportunities to address this business problem while also building gen AI literacy.
Recognize Urgency
HR leaders can start by identifying the problem they are solving for and then collecting data on this problem. In the case of re-designing new hire on-boarding, this can range from addressing a need for greater personalization in the on-boarding process to aligning this process to the needs and expectations of employees in key job roles. In addition, with the expansion of gen AI across organizations, this is also an opportunity to embed gen AI literacy training into the on-boarding experience.
Analyze Insights
Assess the results of your data collection. For example, as I wrote in 13 HR Jobs of the Future, ING collected data on the problem of engaging employees in what they called the pre-onboarding process, the time from accepting an offer to starting a new job. This time can stretch from weeks to months. Sander de Bruijn, Head of Global Employee Experience at ING, addressed this problem by re-vamping the pre-onboarding process to incorporate personalized communications for managers to send to new hires during this time, so they felt welcome even before they started their job.
Plan for AI Literacy
Before designing the new hire on-boarding program, your organization should conduct a comprehensive assessment of your AI readiness and the anticipated future AI needs that employees will need training on. This will guide your design process and ensure that using gen AI in this process will be relevant to the needs of your employees. Think of gen AI as a tool to improve the employee experience and not a replacement for your HR team members.
Identify Activation Plan
Embedding gen AI training into your new hire on-boarding program is only the first step. This training should go beyond what is gen AI and how to create prompts, to how to activate gen AI into employee workflows. This can start by showing new hires use cases for how to incorporate gen AI into creating first drafts of documents or using gen AI to practice having crucial conversations in preparation for a performance review.
Deploy New Solution
As you design the new hire on-boarding program, identifying key metrics will be critical to your success. The key metrics to consider can include fewer resignations in the first 6-18 months, greater speed to competence for new hires, greater satisfaction with the job, greater impact on the business goals and reduction in the amount of post on-boarding support needed for new hires. Interestingly, research from iSpring poses an interesting question, how can the re-design of new hire on-boarding favorably impact the employer brand?
While gen AI will help HR leaders with candidate outreach by performing targeted candidate searches and candidate engagement by personalizing relevant content to job seekers, embedding gen AI into the new hire on-boarding process provides HR leaders an opportunity to favorably impact their employer brand. Candidates should know once they accept an offer, they will be experiencing gen AI training starting on their first day of new hire on-boarding. A recent survey of full-time workers finds 98% want some type of training in gen AI funded by their employer.
While Conference Board research finds 56% of workers are using Gen AI at work with one in ten using gen AI daily, only 26% say their employer has a policy on effective use of gen AI with another 23% saying some policy of using gen AI is under development, but has not been approved yet. By embedding gen AI training into new hire on-boarding, companies can also incorporate gen AI policies in the on-boarding experience.
Building gen AI literacy training and showcasing ways to activate this into new hire on boarding is a powerful way workers can not only learn about the vision, values, and culture of the organization, but also build their gen AI skills. By embedding gen AI training in new hire on-boarding employers can use this as a vehicle for increasing attraction of new candidates and improving employee retention.

<em>The journalism industry <a href=""https://theconversation.com/saving-the-news-media-means-moving-beyond-the-benevolence-of-billionaires-222677"">has been under immense economic pressure</a> over the past two decades, so it makes sense that journalists have started experimenting with generative AI to boost their productivity.</em>

An Associated Press survey published in April 2024 asked journalists about the use of generative artificial intelligence in their work. <a href=""https://blog.ap.org/ap-survey-reveals-ais-impact-on-newsrooms"">Nearly 70% of those who responded</a> said they had used these tools to generate text, whether it was composing article drafts, crafting headlines or writing social media posts.

A May 2024 global survey conducted by the public relations firm Cision found the slice to be somewhat smaller – <a href=""https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/journalists-ai-cision-state-of-the-media-report-2024-facebook-tiktok-instagram/"">47% of journalists</a> said they’d used generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard in their work.

But does the adoption of the technology pose any moral questions? After all, this is a business where professional ethics and public trust are especially important – so much so that there are <a href=""https://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu"">fields of study</a> devoted to it.

Over the past few years, my colleagues and I at <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/ethics/"">UMass Boston’s Applied Ethics Center</a> have been researching the ethics of AI.

I think that if journalists are not careful about its deployment, the use of generative AI could undermine the integrity of their work.
<h4>How much time is really saved?</h4>
Let’s start with an obvious concern: AI tools are still unreliable.

Using them to research background for a story will often result in <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html"">confident-sounding nonsense</a>. During a 2023 demo, Google’s chatbot, Bard, famously spit out <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/08/tech/google-ai-bard-demo-error/index.html"">the wrong answer</a> to a question about new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope.

It’s easy to imagine a journalist using the technology for background, only to end up with false information.

Therefore, journalists who use these tools for research will need to fact-check the outputs. The time spent doing that may offset any purported gains in productivity.

But to me, the more interesting questions have to do with using the technology to generate content. A reporter may have a good sense of what they want to compose, <a href=""https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/07/google-wants-you-to-let-its-ai-bot-help-you-write-news-articles/"">so they will ask an AI model to produce a first draft</a>.

This may be efficient, but it also turns reporters from writers into editors, thus fundamentally altering the nature of what they do.

Plus, there’s something to be said for struggling to write a first draft from scratch and figuring out, along the way, whether the original idea that inspired it has merit. That’s what I am doing right now as I write this piece. And I’m sad to report that I discarded quite a few of the original arguments I wanted to make, because as I tried to articulate them, I realised that they didn’t work.

In journalism, as in art, generative AI emphasises – indeed fetishises – <a href=""https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-dall-e-2-and-the-collapse-of-the-creative-process-196461"">the moment in which an idea is conceived</a>. It focuses on the original creative thought and relegates the tedious process of turning that thought into a finished product – whether it’s through outlining, writing or drawing – to a machine.

But the process of writing out a story is inseparable from the ideas that give rise to it. Ideas change and take shape as they are written out. They are not preexisting entities patiently floating around, perfectly formed, simply waiting to be translated into words and sentences.
<h4>AI’s undermining of a special relationship</h4>
To be fair, only a portion of the journalists in both surveys were using generative AI to compose drafts of articles. Instead, , such as writing newsletters, translating text, coming up with headlines or crafting social media posts.

Once journalists see that the AI is quite talented at writing – and it is getting <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/180395/ai-artifical-intelligence-writing-human-creativity"">better and better at it</a> – how many of them will resist the temptation?

The fundamental question here is whether journalism involves anything more than simply conveying information to the public.

Does journalism also entail a kind of relationship between writers and their readers?

I think it does.

When a reader regularly follows the analysis of someone writing about the Middle East or about Silicon Valley, it is because they trust that writer, because they like that writer’s voice, because they have come to appreciate that writer’s thought process.

Now if journalism involves that kind of relationship, does the use of AI undermine it? Would I want to read journalism created by what amounts to an anonymised aggregation of the internet any more than I would want to read a novel created by an AI or listen to music composed by one?
<h4>Undermine integrity</h4>
Or, stated differently, if I read a piece of journalism or a novel or listened to a musical piece, which I thought was created by a human being, only to find out that it was largely generated by an AI, wouldn’t my appreciation or trust of the piece change?

If the practice of journalism is based on having this kind of relationship with the public, the increased use of AI may well undermine the integrity of the practice, particularly at a time when the industry <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/10/24/americans-trust-in-media-plummets-to-historic-low-poll"">is already dealing with trust issues</a>.

Being a journalist is a noble calling that, at its best, <a href=""https://democracyfund.org/idea/how-we-know-journalism-is-good-for-democracy/"">helps sustain democratic institutions</a>. I assume that this nobility still matters to journalists. But most readers probably would not trust AI to uphold the social role that journalism plays.

AI does not care that “<a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-washington-post-introduces-its-new-slogan/"">democracy dies in darkness</a>”; it does not care about speaking truth to power.

Yes, those are cliches. But they are also widely held precepts that sustain the trade. Journalists neglect them at their peril.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

								Labor Department has ‘a leg up’ on artificial intelligence, new CAIO says							

								Though the agency isn’t pursuing a “big-bang approach” when it comes to AI, Mangala Kuppa says DOL is poised to scale those systems quickly.

A shout-out from the White House doesn’t happen to federal agencies every day, but the Department of Labor got a turn in March when it was lauded in a fact sheet for “leading by example” with its work on principles to mitigate artificial intelligence’s potential harms to employees. 
Mangala Kuppa, who took over as DOL’s chief AI officer this week after previously serving as its deputy CAIO, believes the agency has even more to be confident about when it comes to its work on the technology, possessing a “leg up” on scaling AI quickly.
In an interview with FedScoop, Kuppa pointed to DOL’s previous efforts to modernize internal operations and customer-facing services as part of the department’s journey to implement emerging technologies like AI. Having foundational building blocks and existing infrastructure, along with existing AI applications, has made it “easier” for the agency to scale up, she said. 
“It’s not a ‘big bang’ approach,” said Kuppa, who also serves as DOL’s chief technology officer. “Another aspect that we take very seriously in modernizing is [to] take this opportunity to not just update the technology, but also take this opportunity to re-engineer the business process to help the public.”

Kuppa pointed to an internal shared services initiative that designated the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to be a “shared services provider for all Departmental IT services.”  That process, Kuppa said, has allowed the department to keep an inventory of all systems and technologies and understand where the legacy systems or opportunities for improvement might exist.
“Using that methodology, we’ve been looking at all high-risk systems, because maybe the technology is very legacy and outdated,” Kuppa said. “We’ve been using that methodology to start those modernization initiatives.”
By considering the age of the technology, the operations burden, security vulnerabilities, regulation compliance and other parameters, DOL came up with a methodology that scores each mission system to determine if it is a candidate for modernization. The agency then looks at the scores on a consistent basis and revises based on new information that becomes available.
These systems can be major: the DOL’s Employment and Training Administration, for example, which provides labor certifications when a company files for hiring an immigrant workforce, was scored for modernization.
“Being an immigrant, I wasn’t aware DOL had a hand in my immigration journey there,” Kuppa said.

The Technology Modernization Fund has played an “instrumental” role in the department “finding the resources to modernize,” Kuppa said.
She gave the example of using TMF funds to expedite temporary visa applications, which is expected to save 45 days of cycle time for processing labor certification applications.
According to a case study on the TMF site, that project contributed to $1.9 million in annual cost savings, and a key part of the innovation allowed the application forms to auto-populate with the previous year’s information.
“Usually all immigrants eventually start filing for permanent visa applications,” Kuppa said. “Again, you have to repeat the process of labor certification, and so we had two different systems not communicating with each other.”
For Kuppa, modernization is ultimately an exercise in reimagining where new technologies can ultimately be most helpful.

“We have great partnership, we work very closely with our programs and then we have these dialogues every day, in terms of the system’s development lifecycle,” she said. “And that’s how we approach modernization.”

The DOL’s publication of these Principles follows in the footsteps of the EEOC and the OFCCP’s recent guidance on AI in the workplace and mirrors, in significant respects, the letter and spirit of their pronouncements. 
While not “exhaustive,” the Principles” should be considered during the whole lifecycle of AI” from ”design to development, testing, training, deployment and use, oversight, and auditing.”  Although the DOL intends the Principles to apply to all business sectors, the guidance notes that not all Principles will apply to the same extent in every industry or workplace, and thus should be reviewed and customized based on organizational context and input from workers.
While not defined in the Principles, EO 14110 defines artificial intelligence as set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3): “A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.  Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.” 
Good News and Bad News of AI
The DOL notes that implementation of AI in the workplace will create demand for workers to gain new skills and spur training to learn how to use AI in their day-to-day work. In addition, the guidance notes that AI will also continue creating new jobs, including those focused on the development, deployment, and human oversight of AI. 
As the guidance warns, however, AI-augmented work also poses risks to workers, including the loss of autonomy and direction over their work and a potential decline in job quality:  “The risks of AI for workers are greater if it undermines workers' rights, embeds bias and discrimination in decision-making processes, or makes consequential workplace decisions without transparency, human oversight and review.” Moreover, in its final dire prediction, the guidance notes that the use of workplace AI also risks displacing workers from their jobs.
The Principles  
The DOL posits the following Principles to employers to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks of its implementation:

Worker Involvement: Ensure workers, especially from minority groups, are not only informed about the use of AI but have “genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use and oversight of AI systems” used in the workplace. 
 Ethical AI Development: Design and deploy AI systems to safeguard workers. This Principle can be understood to mean that AI systems should not be biased or create algorithmic modeling that may result in disparate treatment of protected individuals or otherwise harm workers.
  AI Governance and Oversight: Establish clear, communicated procedures and oversight for workplace AI.
 Transparent AI Use: Employers must openly communicate their use of AI to employees and applicants for employment. While the DOL does not elaborate on this Principle, employers should provide applicants and employees with notice on employment applications, company websites, and/or employee handbooks of the use of AI. 
 Protecting Workers' Rights: Ensure AI systems respect workers' rights. This may be read in conjunction with rights established under any applicable union or employment contracts as well as applicable law. 
 Empowering Workers with AI: Use AI to empower and enhance job quality for workers.  The AI tool or system should “assist,” “enable” and “complement,” work, rather than replace workers generally or negate human oversight.
 Supporting Workers Impacted by AI: Assist and train workers during AI-related job changes.
 Responsible Worker Data Use: Minimize data collected, used, or created by AI systems. Use of such data should be “only” to support “legitimate business aims” and handled and secured responsibly. 

Takeaways
The Principles are not enforceable regulatory mandates, but are likely to be considered by the DOL in investigatory endeavors in response to an applicant or employee complaint with regard to the development or deployment of AI in the workplace and certainly may come under consideration in negotiated collective bargaining, as both employee and union representatives will take particular note of these Principles as regulatory guideposts.

For more on our Best Places to Work honorees, you can find our list here.Lynzie Skjervheim, HR Director, Turner Construction Co.“Using AI on a job application is a plus. … We are constantly looking for ways to improve our work, and AI is one of the many tools we are experimenting with to achieve this goal. AI writing tools can aid in the creative process, identify grammatical and spelling errors, and ultimately enhance content development efforts. Using AI to aid in job applications is advantageous, provided the applicant is truthful about their qualifications, skills and employment history.”Todd Brown, director of people and culture, United Communications“On the one hand, AI tools can be helpful for streamlining the application process, ensuring resumes are formatted correctly and keywords are optimized. … However, what truly sets applicants apart is their unique voice and genuine enthusiasm. AI-generated content often lacks the personal touch that resonates with our hiring team. We value candidates who take the time to tailor their applications, showcasing their specific skills and experiences relevant to the role.""Sean Buck, senior vice president, JE Dunn Construction“The answer to that question lies in how it was used. If it was used in a way that adds additional context or information in a thoughtful way or shows some creativity on the applicant’s behalf, it is positive. If AI was used to generate information in lieu of taking the time and effort to be thoughtful in how you present yourself, it would be a red flag for us. At the end of the day, we are looking to hire people that are humble, hungry and smart. We have not run across a computer yet that fits that description.”Danielle Vezensky, HR Manager, Mechanical Resource Group“Professionals proficiently using AI to generate natural-sounding and well-organized content is a strength. However, applicants must also support the same level of clarity and context presented in their application with genuine knowledge and competency; if not, that’s a red flag you can’t ignore when hiring. Using AIto boost efficiency and clarity is now the norm, so we must become proficient at using AI asa tool rather than a crutch.”Matt Gerber, chief strategy officer, Provisions Group“Using AI in a job application can be a plus and a minus. On the positive side, if AI is used to enhance a resume or application truthfully, it can effectively communicate a candidate’s capabilities, making it easier for both automated systems and recruiters to understand their strengths. On the downside, the widespread use of AI will complicate the hiring process by creating a flood of overly optimized applications, making it harder for employers to sift through and find genuinely suitable candidates.”Laura Lustig, VP of Human Resources, Currax Pharmaceuticals“This can be a plus or minus, depending on how the applicant deploys the functionality. An applicant who utilizes AI to assist with creating a resume that is professional and showcases the applicant’s relevant experience is using the functionality wisely. Using AI to entirely compose a resume that is inconsistent with their experience or inaccurate is a poor practice. … AI tools need to be used appropriately and responsibly to ensure the outputs are genuine and honest.”Stacy Muth, chief of staff, S3 Recycling Solutions“I wouldn’t say it’d be a minus, but I don’t feel it’d be a plus. Here at S3 we like to get to know the real person we’re considering bringing on — that not only do they meet job requirements, but also that they’d be a good fit culture wise. I feel that AI would take away from that versus getting to know the person themselves.”Rob Lowe, executive managing director, Stream Realty Partners - Nashville“Plus. It’s critical that each member of our team have strong writing and communication skills; however, engaging in AI or other new technologies is an indication of an employee’s awareness and willingness to learn what’s next.” Mary Jo Innis, president & CEO, The R.O.W. Group“Using AI on a job application can be viewed both positively and negatively. On the positive side, it demonstrates that the applicant is tech-savvy and knows how to utilize various resources to enhance their application. However, on the negative side, it does not fully represent the applicant’s true self, and may come across as impersonal.” Vic Alexander, chief manager, KraftCPAs“The best answer is probably ‘both.’Technology is crucial in business, and it changes so fast now. We should use every resource available to do our jobs better and more efficiently. But we also need critical, independent thinkers who can make quick, smart decisions and effectively discuss complex information with clients. We want people on our team who can master all those skills.”Stephanie Richerson, partner and chief people officer, Puryear & Noonan CPAs""Could be both — but an overall plus for using recent technology and being efficient, both of which are imperative in the public accounting industry.""Rebecca Hill, director of operations, The Anderson Group Real Estate Services“Honestly, I understand that it might be the new way of life for everyone to use AI, but it’s a minus for us. We want to know someone’s open and honest statements and background, skills, accomplishments, in their own words.” Jack Brown, chief deputy register of deeds, Davidson County Register of Deeds“It would cut both ways. It shows a technological acuity that any employer would be short-sighted not to value. But it also would trigger immediate questions in our interview process about how the applicant thinks he or she would utilize AI in our office. There would be a fine line between technological savvy and over-reliance on something that would not provide our customers the level of service and results they require.”Kevin Murphy, COO, Vertek Solutions Inc.""It is a plus. As a technology company, we are focused on thinking outside the box, and AI helps us do that. As long as the application is accurate and truthful, I think AI can be a great resource.""Nicole Anderson, director, Employee Engagement; OMNIA Partners“Embracing AI on job applications demonstrates adaptability and forward-thinking, both of which are highly valued in our organization. Omnia Partners is committed to solving challenges in an industry that’s ripe for innovation, making AI implementation a definite plus.”Velaire Woolsey, chief of staff, Event Logistics Inc.“Usage of AI alone would not constitute as a plus or minus to the candidate. However, the way in which it was utilized can be telling of the candidate’s skill set. If information acquired from AI is copied and pasted into the application, it can reveal the candidates lack or originality, inattention to detail and more. Alternatively, if a candidate used it to enhance their message, that can be a positive skill that can be utilized in the workplace to enhance the company as well.”Chad Emmitt, business development manager, Covenant Constructors“It is a plus if his/her application was derived from their own ideas and thoughts and they used AI to make it better. The reason I say that is because No. 1, they care about producing the best work possible. And No. 2, they realize using the latest technology affords people/companies a competitive edge. Conversely, if the applicant relies too heavy on AI they risk losing authenticity and producing an inflated application that could create unrealistic expectations from the potential employer.”",NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2024/06/09/artificial-intelligence-ai-job-application-resume.html'}",Hiring in the age of AI: What our Best Places to Work honorees have to say,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12770104/gettyimages-1203940958*1200xx4334-4334-1342-0.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 1200, 'caption': 'Should applicants use artificial intelligence on their job applications?'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12770104/gettyimages-1203940958*1200xx5779-4334-620-0.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900, 'caption': 'Should applicants use artificial intelligence on their job applications?'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12770104/gettyimages-1203940958*1200xx7018-3948-0-193.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675, 'caption': 'Should applicants use artificial intelligence on their job applications?'}]",2024-06-09T21:27:00-04:00,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/bio/2501/Carol+Smith', 'image': 'http://media.bizj.us/view/img/1932061/smithcarolpinstripemug.jpg', 'name': 'Carol Smith', 'jobTitle': 'Research Director', 'worksFor': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Nashville Business Journal'}, 'description': ""Carol Smith compiles market research on Nashville companies, producing weekly industry lists and related content, as well as the year-end compilation, Book of Lists.

Its existence is not merely an offshoot of modern computing, but a dynamic and continuously evolving domain that stretches the boundaries of how machines interact with and process information.AI is recognized for its ability to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and perception. However, it is not a direct replication of human intellect. Instead, AI creates a unique paradigm where machines operate with a level of autonomy that’s informed by their programming, algorithmic structures, and iterative learning capabilities.The development of AI has been driven by numerous innovations and theoretical advances. It has grown from simple programmed instructions to more sophisticated neural networks that can learn from data inputs. Viewing AI as an entity with semblance to human intelligence is a misnomer; it reflects aspects of human reasoning within the confines of its designed capabilities.In the landscape of technology, AI is a multifaceted phenomenon that defies a singular archetype. Its applications span from rudimentary automation tasks to complex decision-making processes that challenge our conventional understanding of machine interaction. As researchers and developers continue to delve deeper into AI’s potential, it becomes clear that this pioneering technology will remain at the forefront of the digital revolution, blurring the lines between machine efficiency and human-like ingenuity.Important Questions Related to the Evolution of Artificial Intelligence:1. What are the different generations of AI?
AI has evolved through several generations, starting with rule-based systems that do not learn from their environment, to machine learning where algorithms can learn from data, and the current wave of AI, which encompasses deep learning and neural networks that mimic the structure and function of the human brain.2. How has AI impacted the job market?
AI has both displaced and created jobs, automating mundane tasks while generating new roles in AI development, data analysis, and ethical governance. The long-term impact on employment is a subject of extensive debate and research.3. What are the ethical implications of AI?
Concerns include privacy, bias in decision-making, accountability, and the potential for AI-enabled systems to be used in malicious ways. Establishing ethical guidelines and governance structures is an ongoing challenge in the conquest of integrating AI into society effectively and responsibly.4. Can AI surpass human intelligence?
This question revolves around the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) —the hypothetical ability of an AI to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in an autonomous, flexible manner like a human being. Currently, AI is specialized and excels at specific tasks, but AGI remains a theoretical endeavor, sparking diverse opinions among experts.Key Challenges and Controversies:– Data Privacy and Security: As AI systems process vast quantities of data, ensuring the privacy and security of this information is a significant challenge.
– Explainability: AI decision-making processes, especially in complex neural networks, are often opaque, leading to the “black box” problem where it’s difficult to understand how an AI arrived at a particular decision.
– ;Ethical Use: The use of AI in surveillance, warfare, and other sensitive areas raises ethical questions about how these powerful tools should be controlled and by whom.
– Regulation: Finding the balance between nurturing innovation in AI and protecting the public from potential abuses is a considerable regulatory challenge.Advantages and Disadvantages of AI:Advantages:
– Increased Efficiency: AI can operate 24/7 without fatigue, significantly enhancing productivity.
– Enhanced Accuracy: AI systems can surpass human performance in precision tasks, such as medical diagnostics or data analysis.
– Scalability: AI can handle growing amounts of work as data volumes increase, which is vital in the ‘big data’ era.Disadvantages:
– Job Displacement: AI can automate tasks that were previously performed by humans, leading to job losses in certain sectors.
– High Initial Costs: Developing and implementing AI technology can be expensive and resource-intensive.
– Complexity: Designing, maintaining, and improving AI systems requires skilled personnel and can be complex and time-consuming.For further information on the broad topic of artificial intelligence, you might consider visiting the official websites of leading AI research organizations and industry leaders in AI technology:

Tom Brady is endorsing artificial intelligence'' as a method of preparation for his new job, the retired quarterback is revealing. Per BizTech Magazine, the 46-year-old GOAT says he's utilize AI while studying for his new job as an NFL color commentator.FanStreamSports.com""I'm about to start my broadcasting career on Fox, and I’m using AI in the preparation for that so I can better understand the matchups, the plays, and different situations that come up in the game,"" Brady said.There are plenty of ""AI'' jokes to be made in the world of sports journalism regarding some outlets that skim the edges of credibility, but we'll stay above that fray while looking forward to ex-Patriots and Bucs icon Brady making his broadcasting debut in Week 1 when the Dallas Cowboys play at the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Sept. 8.Brady is also seeking TV broadcasting advice - and getting it - from what some might think is an unusual source: The guy he's replacing.""I had a chance to speak with Tom a couple of weeks ago, and he was just kind of picking my brain about the prep and the industry and what to expect and whatnot,"" Olsen said via USA Today.Interesting that Olsen, who's been the lead play-by-play broadcaster for FOX's NFL coverage over the last few years but is now getting bumped by Brady, would be so cooperative.But they do remain on the same team, even though Olsen will move down to the No. 2 FOX team, and relative to Brady's chair, out of the spotlight.Brady On Roast: 'I Wouldn't Do That Again'Read MoreBrady On Roast: 'I Wouldn't Do That Again'Read MoreAnd how will Brady do? Surely Olsen thinks good things, but does add, ""I don’t think there’s any real correlation between being a great player or an average player, and how that correlates to being a great broadcaster or an average broadcaster.""I think we’ve seen examples on both ends of that spectrum. So, we’ll see how it all plays out.”By Mike FisherMike Fisher has covered the NFL since 1983.

What is generative AI?
Generative AI is the use of artificial intelligence that uses large language models and machine learning to not only understand the input it’s given, but create an entirely new output, including (but not limited to) text, images and music. 
For example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT is a generative AI model that can create stories, menus and more, based solely on a user prompt. 
This content, although ‘new’, is actually based on the vast amounts of training data GenAI tools are fed. That’s where some of the controversies come into play, as there isn’t an easy way for creatives (writers, painters, photographers, etc) to object to training AI using their work.

How does generative AI work?
All generative AI models, whether it’s a chatbot, image generator or otherwise, are fed with vast amounts of content, called training data. The model is then programmed with an algorithm which analyses the patterns in its training data in order to understand what the user wants, allowing it to generate solutions.
How can I use generative AI?
One of the reasons why generative AI has become so widely known is its user-friendliness. Instead of being an inaccessible piece of tech, a lot of tools can be free to use and easy to work with, whether that’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot or lesser-known tools like Perplexity. Just head over to the site in question, sign up and start getting creative. 
All of the above focus mainly on answering queries and analysing data, but there’s DALL·E 3 if you want to generate images, Synthesia if you want to create video content and invideo if you want to create entirely AI-generated social media videos – and that’s just scratching the surface of the plethora of GenAI tools available in 2024. 
Once you’ve decided on the GenAI tool you want to use, it’s as simple as telling it what you want in as much detail as possible. The model will then, based on its training data, generate content according to your prompt. Enjoy getting creative!

Every company worth the ground it’s occupying yearns to be an innovative place. Many have extensive, well-planned initiatives, and stage motivational confabs and training sessions to achieve just that. Yet, new data shows no one has really upped their innovation game in recent years. Will artificial intelligence provide a boost, or is it yet just another costly technology to be tacked somewhere onto the process?


It’s still too early to say whether generative AI — often portrayed as a mechanized font of innovation — can deliver on the high expectations people have for it. At this point, only eight percent are implementing at scale, a new report published by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggests. More than half report they are still experimenting with the technology.

There is only a small degree of innovation “readiness” among companies, which BCG defines as a “strong link between business strategy and innovation strategy.” Only 12% have attained this. Innovation activity — the number of projects going through the funnel — has remained steady, “evoking a troubling image: zombie innovation systems just going through the motions.”

PROMOTED
In assessing AI’s long-term potential in super-charging innovation, hope springs eternal for the BCG team, which urges companies to reshape “their innovation systems with gen AI.” The potential benefits of generative AI, which can pull together data and content and deliver logical concepts in a matter of seconds, will be too compelling to ignore.

“It can inspire and challenge teams,” the BCG co-authors write. “It can take critical time out of processes, freeing staff to focus on more value-added activities. And it’s likely to become table stakes for any ambitious innovator, making it an increasingly important dimension of an organization’s innovation readiness.”

While only eight percent have generative AI at work across their enterprises, there is no shortage of excitement over its potential in the near term. It already is among the top three of investment plans for the year ahead, as cited by 89% of executives, the survey also shows. Currently, 86% report that their companies are at least experimenting with gen AI as an innovation tool.

At the same time, no one should depend on generative AI alone to deliver innovation miracles. “Reshaping your innovation function with gen AI is only a first step, and one that, given technological progress, never really ends,” the report’s co-authors caution. Plus, every industry has its different needs and nuances.
Ultimately, the most important point is that generative AI will only deliver competitive advantage and growth when the actual products and services it helps produce hit the ground, they continue. At least 21% of companies in BCG’s research indicated they are getting close, reporting they have implemented generative AI “with impact” in an innovation-related use case.
The top innovators identified by BCG are 1.5 times more likely to have implemented generative AI in one or more applications, and five times more likely to be applying the technology at scale.
They are doing so with a combination of both generative AI and traditional, or predictive, AI. Traditional predictive AI supports analytical decision making and optimization, while generative AI “boosts creativity, developing content, and distilling the essence of vast troves of information.”
The BCG analysts provide guidance on delivering successful AI that have a material impact on the business:


Start off with quick wins. “It’s a great way to start gaining traction, identify champions, and spotlight small-scale applications with greater potential. For instance, companies can use ChatGPT to write first drafts of reports, or take advantage of Zoom’s automated meeting summaries.”
Rethink critical internal functions. Generative AI “becomes a powerful new addition to the business transformation toolbox, freeing staff to work on more value-added activities.”
Build and sell new things. Leverage generative AI to enable “new products, services, and business models—and enhancing the attractiveness of existing ones.”
Test strategic assumptions. Shared strategic assumptions may cover customers, competitors, business economics, competitive advantage, and technology. Generative AI, “lacking emotional bonds and biases, can help by bringing an external perspective, making connections you might have missed that support or undermine your convictions.”
Generate images, UX designs, 3D models, and videos. “GenAI is a huge help in the process of exploring and refining ideas.”
Identify and explore innovation domains. Generative AI “can help innovators connect the dots to identify and develop a richer understanding of the shifting landscape of demand.” Generative AI can “look for patterns in online and social media, strengthening trend analysis capabilities.”
Develop ecosystem insights. Employ generative AI to gain perspectives on the market at large. For example, one company, “eager to identify new and interesting applications of its technology, is using gen AI to rapidly summarize, categorize, and extract key themes from its—and its competitors’—patent citation networks, including automatically generating summaries of the product offerings of the corporate patent owners.”
Employ AI to enhance creativity, generate new product and service ideas. This is an “iterative cycle of ideation, design and prototyping, and testing and validation,” the BCG analysts point out. “It’s where new products, services, and business models are born and perfected. GenAI is a great support for the divergence phase of any focused ideation exercise. By adjusting the ‘temperature,’ it can rapidly complement the inventory of human-generated ideas with a universe of options ranging from more near in to more far out.”


Generative AI promises to unlock some of the innovative potential of many organizations. But it needs to be seen as a tool — not a replacement — that can amplify and guide human-inspired ideas and ventures.

We’re seeing a wave of new generative AI tools that can write text, generate images, create music and more. Some can even write computer code, which makes sense when you think that computer code is just another type of language. From a well-known, generic tool like ChatGPT to specific AI coding tools created for developers, new tools are rapidly emerging that offer code suggestions and even write entire code. And it can all be done based on natural language prompts or by learning from existing code.


Naturally, this is already changing the work that software developers do. But what are the long-term implications of this? Will we even need software developers in the future? Read on to find out.

What Can Generative AI Do?
Generative AI can accelerate and automate the software development process in several ways:

PROMOTED



Gathering requirements: All software development starts by identifying requirements (such as “user wants to do X, Y and Z”). Generative AI can aid this process by generating a list of requirements. It can also be used to review requirements and check that nothing has been missed.
Generating code: Generative AI can turn natural language instructions into functioning code, which essentially turns English (or whatever your native tongue is) into a computer programming language.
Completing code: As coders type, a generative AI tool can suggest code completions, which saves coders time, especially when working on repetitive or mundane tasks. As an added advantage, this can help to reduce human error.
Reviewing code: Generative AI can also be a useful tool when it comes to reviewing software. For example, a generative AI tool can check through existing code and suggest improvements or create alternatives that are more efficient. It can also analyze code according to coding style guidelines to ensure code is consistent.
Fixing bugs: Generative AI can be used to identify and fix bugs in code to create a better end product.
Testing software: Generative AI can carry out many of the testing phases, such as generating test cases, generating test code and analyzing test results.
Predicting how software might fail: Looking ahead, generative AI may also be able to predict how systems and software might fail before the code goes into production—and tell developers how to fix it.


All of which means that generative AI can aid the work of coders, programmers and developers and speed up the software development process. In one example, coders at software company Freshworks have been using ChatGPT to write code—and, in the process, cut the development time from around 10 weeks down to less than a week. According to a GitHub study, developers who used the GitHub Copilot generative AI tool coded up to 55% faster than those who didn’t.

But how good is generative AI at creating computer code? Well, when the Alphabet-owned DeepMind lab pitted its AlphaCode AI model in competition against human coders, AlphaCode’s performance roughly corresponded to “a novice programmer with a few months to a year of training.” It's not bad at all for an AI. Given that generative AI’s capabilities are progressing so fast, we can expect the technology to catch up with more experienced developers in the not-so-distant future.

What Does The Future Look Like For Software Developers?
So does this mean we won’t need human software developers in the future? No, I don’t believe so. But it does mean they will increasingly work alongside AI, just as other professionals will. Almost all jobs will be affected or augmented by AI-driven automation to some extent, and software development is no different.
Admittedly, the work of junior coders could potentially be at risk as more development tasks are automated by AI. However, I see an even bigger application of generative AI than simply automating the work that junior coders would otherwise do. I see generative AI adding enormous value as a copilot or co-coder for even the most experienced programmers—especially when you consider that generative AI can be used to gather requirements and debug codes, make sure that code adheres to certain requirements and write the code itself. That takes some of the more repetitive and mundane tasks off developers’ plates, allowing them to focus on more valuable tasks.
And let’s not forget that, for someone like a higher-level developer or programmer, writing code isn’t the main thing they do all day. In fact, writing code may take up as little as 20% of their time, with the rest spent on gathering requirements, testing, meetings, collaborating with users, overseeing projects and other tasks.
What’s more, even when using generative AI tools to automate or help with programming work, we’ll still need experienced developers to write detailed prompts that get the best out of the AI. (You could argue writing detailed prompts that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do is just another form of programming.)
But the biggest takeaway from this is that rather than simply automating the more tedious aspects of software development and speeding up software development, generative AI will help developers work smarter, tackle more complex problems and come up with more creative solutions. It could therefore prove to be a game-changing tool for programmers.

Specifically, 48% of lawyers in UK firms and 50% of in-house lawyers support this stance. In contrast, 36% of UK firm lawyers and 44% of in-house lawyers believe government regulation is necessary. This preference for government regulation is notably higher than in the US and Canada, where only 26% of lawyers surveyed support government oversight of AI.
Kriti Sharma, Chief Product Officer for Legal Tech at Thomson Reuters, highlighted the potential benefits of generative AI when used responsibly. She stated, ""Generative AI can augment the work of lawyers, improving productivity and efficiency, which can address issues like burnout and enhance access to legal services and justice.""
Despite the enthusiasm for AI, lawyers express significant concerns about its use, particularly regarding inaccuracy and data security. The report identifies the primary barriers to AI adoption among lawyers as:

Potential for inaccurate responses (74%)
Concerns about data security (68%)
Complying with relevant laws and regulations (63%)
Privacy and confidentiality of information entered into AI tools (58%)
Ethical and responsible use of AI tools (50%)
Dependency on technology, potentially reducing critical thinking and creativity (50%)

Sharma acknowledged these concerns, emphasising the importance of trusted legal AI tools and the advantage they provide to firms that adopt them. ""Lawyers are cautious about risking the quality of their work, but those who embrace specialised legal AI tools grounded in trusted content will likely outpace their competitors,"" she said.
Thomson Reuters has recently introduced CoCounsel, a comprehensive AI assistant designed to answer complex legal research questions using trusted legal information while ensuring proprietary data remains secure.
Additional findings from the report show that among lawyers whose firms and departments use generative AI, the technology is primarily utilised for:

Document review (91%)
Legal research (83%)
Document summarisation (74%)

Moreover, 85% of in-house lawyers believe generative AI will enable them to bring more work in-house over the next five years, offering significant cost savings for legal departments.
While the concerns about AI—such as inaccuracy and data security—persist, Sharma notes that these issues are gradually being addressed as AI technology becomes more integrated into law firms and in-house legal departments. She concludes, ""AI won't replace lawyers, but those who leverage AI-powered tools will gain a competitive edge over those who don't.""

OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, sparking a tremendous amount of interest in artificial intelligence. ChatGPT gained so much attention that generative AI (GenAI) became a dominant theme in the tech world in 2023.







Microsoft backed OpenAI at the start of 2023 by pledging a multimillion-dollar, multiyear investment to accelerate OpenAI's development of its AI technology.
Google made its GenAI move in March 2023 with Bard. In February 2024, Google rebranded Bard as Gemini when it debuted an improved version of the AI chatbot.
ChatGPT and Gemini are largely responsible for the considerable buzz around GenAI, which uses data from machine learning models to answer questions and create images, text and videos. OpenAI and Google are continuously improving the large language models (LLMs) behind ChatGPT and Gemini to give them a greater ability to generate human-like text.

GenAI is still rapidly evolving, and models don't always return correct answers. Despite the common occurrence of AI hallucinations -- wrong answers generated by AI -- in both ChatGPT and Gemini, the tools are being adopted by businesses and consumers seeking to automate time-consuming tasks.

What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is the AI-powered chatbot that made GenAI the hot technology of 2023. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, ChatGPT reached 1 million users within five days of its release on Nov. 30, 2022.
Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the model ChatGPT is based on, finds patterns within data sequences. Its AI language model produces responses to user queries and serves as the interface that lets users communicate with the language model. As of May 2024, GPT-4o is an available default in the free version of ChatGPT. Users can still choose to use GPT-3.5, which was the previous default. A more robust access to GPT-4o as well as GPT-4 is available in the paid subscription versions of ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise. GPT-4 was generally considered the most advanced GenAI model when it became available, but Google Gemini Advanced provided it with a formidable rival.
Popular applications for ChatGPT include content generation of emails, social media posts and blogs; text summarization; language translation; code generation; learning and education; building virtual assistants; simulation and training; research assistance; and building games and other entertainment applications.
ChatGPT is multimodal, meaning users can use images and voice to prompt the chatbot. ChatGPT Voice -- available on iOS and Android phones -- lets users hold conversations with ChatGPT, which can respond in one of five AI-generated voices.
ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus are targeted at individual users. The free version of ChatGPT is available through web browsers and mobile devices. Developers can also embed ChatGPT APIs in their software applications for their users to access.
ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per user, per month. The full version of GPT-4o, used in ChatGPT Plus, responds faster than previous versions of GPT; is more accurate; and includes features such as advanced data analysis. GPT-4o can also create more detailed responses and is faster at tasks such as describing photos and writing image captions. And while GPT-3.5 was only trained on data up to January 2022, GPT-4o has been trained on data up to October 2023.
Another advantage of a ChatGPT Plus subscription is that it guarantees ChatGPT access even during peak usage times. Response times for free ChatGPT are limited by bandwidth and availability. ChatGPT Plus also provides integrated access to OpenAI's Dall-E 3 text to image GenAI model.
OpenAI sells ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise to businesses. ChatGPT Team is available for $25 per user, per month billed annually. It includes everything in ChatGPT Plus but allows more messages during a defined time limit. It can also share GPTs with other workers, has a faster response time than ChatGPT Plus and includes an admin console. ChatGPT Enterprise has unlimited high-speed access to GPT-4; more advanced administration, customer support and analytics capabilities; expanded content windows for longer inputs; and has the fastest response time of all the ChatGPT versions. ChatGPT Enterprise pricing varies depending on usage.


What is Google Gemini?
Gemini is Google's GenAI model that was built by the Google DeepMind AI research library. The Gemini AI model powered Google's Bard GenAI tool that launched in March 2023. Google rebranded Bard as Gemini in February 2024, several months after launching Gemini Advanced based on its new Ultra 1.0 LLM foundation. In May 2024, Google first offered users of Gemini Advanced access to the newer Gemini 1.5 Pro model.
Gemini is designed to retrieve information as a simple answer, similar to the way smart assistants like Alexa and Siri work. It uses LLMs to reply to prompts with information it has already learned or can retrieve from other Google services.
Google Gemini is multimodal -- it understands audio, video and computer code as well as text. Google has paused Gemini's image generation feature because of inaccuracies, however. Google's statement disclosing the pause pledged to re-release an improved image generation feature soon.
Gemini's capabilities are integrated into Google's search engine and available in Google Workspace apps such as Docs, Gmail, Sheets, Slides and Meet. Gemini for Google Workspace is the new name for Duet AI for Google Workspace, which was Google's answer to the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant. Google Gemini is available through an app on Android phones and in the Google app on iOS.
Gemini Advanced is part of the Google One AI Premium plan subscription service that costs $19.99 per month in the United States. Google One AI Premium also includes 2 TB of storage.
Gemini Advanced is a more powerful AI version than Gemini Pro, which remains available for free. Gemini Advanced with Gemini Pro 1.5 provides a large context window of 1 million tokens, enabling analysis of larger data sets.
Google suggests Gemini Pro and its AI capabilities is the better choice for development, research and creation tasks, and if you're looking for a free chatbot. It brings AI to simple tasks for personal use. For those willing to pay the subscription fee, Google recommends Gemini Advanced for professional applications, more demanding workflows, enhanced performance and more cutting-edge capabilities. Google Advanced will also include early access to new features.
Gemini Nano, another part of the Google Gemini family, is used in devices such as Google's Pixel 8 Pro smartphones.



A snapshot of the differences between ChatGPT and Gemini.







What are the main differences between Gemini and ChatGPT?
ChatGPT and Google Gemini have become increasingly similar. Both have a free service, a nearly identically priced subscription service, and similar interfaces and use cases. The differences are largely under the hood -- in their language models.
They're also used for many similar functions, and work by users typing in a query to get a response. Both raise privacy concerns about how user data can be used. However, they differ in their training models, data sources, user experiences and how they store data.
Training models
ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. Gemini has three sizes: Gemini Pro for a wide range of tasks, Gemini Ultra for highly complex tasks, and Gemini Nano for mobile devices. Gemini Pro 1.5, which powers the subscription Gemini Advanced version, is faster and more advanced than the model used for the free Gemini service.
Data sources
The main difference between ChatGPT and Gemini is the data sources used to train their LLMs. GPT-4o uses predefined data that goes up to October 2023. Gemini draws on data pulled from the internet in real time. It is tuned to select data chosen from sources that fit specific topics such as coding or the latest scientific research.
User experience
ChatGPT users can log onto the free ChatGPT with any email account. ChatGPT also includes an API that developers can use to integrate OpenAI LLMs into third-party software. It lacks a Save button, but users can copy and paste answers from ChatGPT into another application. It does have an Archive button that can list previous responses in ChatGPT's left-hand pane for quick retrieval.
Because ChatGPT is text-based, it can't include images, videos, charts or links in its answers. It also lacks the ability to search the internet.
Because of OpenAI's close partnership with Microsoft, ChatGPT can be used through Windows apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Also, Microsoft's Copilot AI assistants use the GPT-4 language model.
Gemini Pro's interface gives users a chance to like or dislike a response, opt to modify the size or tone of the response, share or fact-check the response, or export it to Google Docs or Gmail. Gemini also has a ""review other drafts"" option that shows alternate versions of its answer. Gemini also lets users upload images, but its ability to create images is on hold until Google improves that feature.
Data storage and privacy
Both ChatGPT and Google Gemini store user data.
ChatGPT stores all prompts and queries entered. Users can review previous conversations through its archive feature. Although users can delete responses and conversations, the chatbot might continue to use these responses in its LLM for training. This raises privacy concerns when users enter personal data or proprietary information. OpenAI also discloses that ChatGPT gathers geolocation data, network activity, contact details such as email addresses and phone numbers, and device information.
According to OpenAI's privacy policy, it collects any personal information a user provides. This includes account information such as name, contact information, payment card information and transaction history. OpenAI also might disclose geolocation data to third parties such as vendors and service providers, and to law enforcement agencies if required to do so by law.
OpenAI said the user retains ownership rights of input data and owns the output, but it ""may use Content to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies, and keep our Services safe.""
Gemini stores conversations in a user's Google account for 18 months, but users can change the retention period to three months or 36 months in their activity settings. Gemini conversations can also appear in searches, raising privacy concerns.
Google discloses that it collects conversations, location, feedback and usage information. The Google Privacy Policy claims Google uses collected data to develop, provide, maintain and improve services, and to provide personal services such as content and ads. Customers can delete information from their account using My Google Activity, or by deleting Google products or their Google accounts.
Google said it will share information to third parties with user consent and law enforcement when required.


Which chatbot is better?
There is a bit of a GenAI arms race going on now, with OpenAI and Google making updates to their models. Google has been especially aggressive, perhaps because ChatGPT came out first and Gemini must play catch-up. With each new version of the LLMs, Google and OpenAI make significant gains over their previous versions.
Generally, ChatGPT is considered the best option for text-based tasks while Gemini is the best choice for multimedia content. However, there are other considerations, as noted in earlier sections of this article. Users can try the free versions to determine which works better for them.
There have been several in-depth reviews about the chatbots worth noting:

Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and BerriAI benchmarked Gemini Pro against GPT-3 and GPT-4 on 10 diverse language tasks with the goal of providing an impartial in-depth analysis. They found Gemini's strengths included performance on long, complex reasoning chains and translating into non-English languages. On the downside, it struggled with mathematical reasoning -- especially with large numbers -- showed bias on multiple choice questions and aggressive content filtering blocked many responses. In summary, the researchers concluded Gemini Pro did not match GPT-3 and GPT-4, but ""exhibits strengths in handling complexity and reasoning depth.""
Ethan Mollick, an associate professor who studies AI at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, performed what he called ""tasting notes"" of Gemini Advanced vs. GPT-4. Mollick concluded that Gemini Advanced is the first advanced AI model that can compete with GPT-4. He said each has its strengths and weaknesses -- for example, GPT-4 uses code in a more sophisticated way and is better at hard verbal tasks while Gemini is better at explanations and search. But both ""are weird and inconsistent and hallucinate more than you would like.""
Bernard Marr, a futurist and author of Generative AI in Practice, pointed out in a Forbes article that ChatGPT is designed to be more conversational while Gemini processes information and automates tasks more efficiently. Marr's conclusion after using ChatGPT and Gemini is that ChatGPT-4 is the more powerful chat interface but ""Gemini is closing the gap …"".
Neither ChatGPT nor Gemini are perfect, and their developers admit that. Both generate hallucinations and even warn users of that in their responses.
Both of the chatbots include a disclaimer on the bottom of their prompt screens. Gemini's reads: ""Gemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses."" ChatGPT advises: ""ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.""
The Gemini FAQ on Google's website offers this valuable advice that can apply to all AI tools:

Gemini can't replace important people in your life, like family, friends, teachers or doctors.
Gemini can't do your work for you.
Gemini can't make important life decisions for you.
 



Generative AI alternatives
GenAI is a fast-moving technology. Besides the updates to ChatGPT and Google Gemini, other companies are working on AI projects. These include AI21 Labs' Wordtune, Anthropic's Claude, Glean, Jasper, Open Assistant and Writesonic's Chatsonic. China's Baidu search engine uses AI with an application called Ernie Bot. Many productivity applications and SaaS products also incorporate GenAI assistants.


Comparison of ChatGPT vs. Gemini responses
We asked ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Gemini Pro the same requests and prompts to see how their responses would compare. The results are as follows:
Idea generation
Prompt: What are the five hottest IT trends an IT professional should know about?

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's idea generation response to the five hottest IT trends.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's idea generation response to the five hottest IT trends.





Thoughts: ChatGPT's answers were more general while Gemini drilled down into specific areas -- for example, generative AI vs. AI/ML and cybersecurity mesh vs. cyber security. ChatGPT's inability to reference data past January 2022 limits its effectiveness when looking for trending information. Gemini snuck in a few extras under ""Bonus trends.""
Creating content
Prompt: Write a two-paragraph summary explaining cyber-resiliency challenges.

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's content generation response to explain cyber-resiliency challenges.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's content generation response to explain cyber-resiliency challenges.





Thoughts: Both did a good job of explaining and summarizing a complex issue in two paragraphs, but Gemini included more specifics about the challenges and what can be done about them.
Planning
Prompt: What are the best cloud computing conferences to attend?

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's planning response for the best cloud computing conferences to attend.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's planning response for the best cloud computing conferences to attend.





Thoughts: ChatGPT listed more conferences, but its list was a bit dated as several of its conferences have been renamed. Gemini offered greater detail and broke its list into specific areas of expertise.
Developer assistance
Prompt: List 10 frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's response for developer assistance on frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's response for developer assistance on frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.





Thoughts: The lists were similar, although they used different terms in some cases. A nice feature was the code embedded in the responses. We shortened Gemini's response to fit on one page, but its longer version included embedded code.

Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Chat GPT)ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has rapidly become the gold standard for AI-driven chatbots. With its sturdy language processing features, ChatGPT goes a step ahead in delivering interactions that are not only context-aware but strikingly human-like. This is ideal for sectors that want high engagement, such as customer support, e-commerce, and even personalized services.If you run an enterprise, ChatGPT also offers powerful APIs that integrate smoothly with existing systems, further streamlining the entire implementation. It’s designed to handle extensive dialogues and complex queries easily which maintain conversation context over lengthy interactions. This makes it a great choice for businesses who are looking to boost user engagement without sacrificing their quality.During an interaction, it continues to learn from the given prompts and refine the result, eventually generating pretty helpful responses. In fact, enterprises can even customize it to fit their niche better, whether it’s finance, healthcare, or retail, which are often governed by strict compliance and privacy standards. Plus, OpenAI’s firm stand on safety and privacy helps it meet global security regulations, making it a safe choice for sensitive industries. Moreover, ChatGPT can even function in multiple languages which instantly widens its applicability and helps its users to reach a global audience effortlessly.Amid all the AI hype and new chatbots giving tough competition to Open AI’s ChatGPT, the company has decided to take a leap with its latest Chat GPT-4o, free for everyone. This comes in at a time when most AI chatbots are either offering their subscriptions at a cheaper cost or promising better outputs than ChatGPT.However, it is vital to remember that while ChatGPT excels at generating human-like responses, it is still an AI and may not always provide accurate or reliable information. Its responses are generated based on patterns and examples from its training data, so it may occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical answers. We recommend that you always verify the information from reliable sources when needed.2. Midjourney(Image credit: Midjourney)Midjourney is an AI image-generation tool designed specifically for AI experts and creative professionals. It easily turns text descriptions into high-quality visual artworks. It also gives you precise control over the outputs, which results in super personalized outputs. You can even adjust styles, moods, and details to match your specific needs.Thanks to its integration with Discord, using Midjourney is straightforward. This setup lets you generate images directly within the chat interface, which is quite smooth and user-friendly. In fact, whether you’re working alone or in a team, this tool fits seamlessly into your workflow.Additionally, Midjourney's subscription model is flexible and designed to house both occasional and heavy users. It comes with various tiers and offers different levels of access and usage rates. For high-volume professional use, there are options that deliver commercial usage rights and priority processing that help you meet project deadlines without any delays.It further shines bright in delivering high-resolution images as it supports outputs up to 4K. This makes it suitable for high-quality print and digital media. It also lets you specify aspect ratios, which can range from standard squares to wide cinematic formats.For AI experts interested in more granular control, Midjourney includes features like style scaling, which adjusts the influence of the artistic style on the generated image, and fine-tuning options that manipulate color saturation, contrast, and brightness. These features ensure that every image meets and exceeds professional standards.Plus, Midjourney supports batch processing, which means that it generates multiple images at once based on a series of prompts. This is particularly useful for projects requiring a cohesive visual style across numerous pieces or when you need to explore different creative directions quickly.The tool also integrates seamlessly with other software and offers its APIs to developers to incorporate Midjourney into different applications. This makes it an excellent choice for tech-driven projects that require automated image generation.3. Google Gemini(Image credit: Google Gemini)Google Gemini is a powerful AI tool that can handle various tasks, such as long context windows, multimodal understanding (which includes text, images, audio, and video), and sophisticated reasoning abilities. It has three different versions - Ultra, Pro, and Nano - to meet your different needs. The Ultra model is great for high-performance data centers. It also excels in several coding benchmarks, including HumanEval. Similarly, the Pro model also handles complex queries but lacks features offered by the Ultra plan. The Nano model, on the other hand, works on smartphones as well. It provides you with accessibility and makes it your go-to tool.You can also use Gemini to process text, images, audio, and video simultaneously. However, Gemini may fail at times to suffice your needs. That’s because the advanced models need a really good set of skills and familiarity with AI. Additionally, the rise of GPT-4 in areas like chatbots, coding, and content creation kind of puts Gemini in a tough spot in the AI field. Despite facing competition, Google Gemini provides a premium package with attractive features such as 2TB of Google Drive storage, access to Google’s additional AI tools, and more. Google has also committed to integrating Gemini into platforms like Gmail and Docs in the future. This will enhance the user experience for those who are familiar with Google’s workspace.4.

They are designed to interact with users in a conversational manner, often through text-based interfaces like messaging apps and website chat windows.These intelligent software leverage natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user input. They can analyze users’ messages, interpret the intent behind the messages, and generate appropriate human-like responses, allowing for more engaging interactions with users.Types of AI chatbotsThere are two main types of AI chatbots:1. Rule-based chatbots: These chatbots follow predefined rules and patterns to respond to user inputs. They are programmed with specific responses based on keywords or phrases and are limited in their capabilities. They require extensive manual input to cover various user queries and scenarios.2. Machine learning-based chatbots: ML-based chatbots utilize machine learning algorithms to learn from data and improve their responses over time. They are trained on large datasets of conversations and can use techniques such as deep learning to generate more contextually relevant and accurate responses. They have the ability to adapt and handle a wider range of user inputs.1. Anthropic’s Claude (Image credit: Claude AI)Claude AI was founded in 2021 by ex-employees of OpenAI, who played a significant role in advancing OpenAI's GPT-2 and GPT-3 models. It has multiple variants, including Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Haiku. The Opus variant is the most powerful among all and handles highly complex tasks, and offers superior performance and fluency. The Sonnet variant balances intelligence and speed and is ideal for enterprise workloads, while the Haiku variant is optimized for rapid responses and seamless AI interactionsWith the introduction of Claude 3, Anthropic have introduced what they call ""vision capabilities."" This feature lets you analyze various types of visual content like photos, charts, and diagrams in different formats. Plus, Claude 3 models can now handle a 200,000-token context window, which is roughly equal to 150,000 words or a short novel of around 300 pages. Some users even have pre-release access to a one-million-token context window, which is about 700,000 words. This makes it even better for those looking to summarize their long-form text or other related purposes.Additionally, Claude 3 is pretty decent at providing factual answers across various niches, as it shows a strong understanding of complex topics. For advanced customization, Claude offers features like style adaptation, which mimics specific writing styles, and fine-tuning options to adjust parameters such as tone, formality, and target audience​. And, for research and analysis, Claude can summarize complex documents, provide overviews, answer specific research queries, and compare different subjects, making it an excellent tool for researchers and analysts​. Yet, Claude 3 has some room for improvement. For instance, we found that it struggles with advanced mathematics and logic puzzles, which suggests an area where further development is much needed. The model also has difficulty processing impossible scenarios or illogical requests. 2. Jasper AI(Image credit: Jasper AI)Jasper AI is an AI content creation tool that helps marketers, writers, and businesses in creating high-quality and consistent content. It's powered by sophisticated language models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4. Jasper maintains a brand's unique voice throughout different content platforms with its Brand Voice Customization which lets you train Jasper on your dedicated brand’s style guide, product catalogs, and identity.

You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.2. Play.ht(Image credit: Play.ht)Play.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio.

Google Translate(Image credit: Google)Google Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It’s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites. Again, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.Similarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.Although Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.2. Microsoft translatorGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you’ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft’s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time. Microsoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.During our test, we used a feature called ""Live Transcribe"" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.Overall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.4. DeepL(Image credit: DeepL)DeepL is an AI-powered translation service famous for its accurate translations and careful focus on language nuances. It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text. We love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.One of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial. DeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages. For those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.When it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.Best AI voice changers1.  ElevenLabs (Image credit: Elevenlabs)Eleven Labs offers solid features to transform text into natural-sounding speech and to clone voices with great accuracy.

Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications​ Nonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage. For instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots​ . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.2.  Speechify (Image credit: Speechify)Speechify also coverts text to speech, with an extensive library of over 200 unique voices that include various genders, accents, and speaking styles. With Speechify, you can fine-tune specific elements on a word-by-word basis and make precise adjustments to pitch, speed, and tone. It offers a video dubbing tool that automatically translates and dubs audio for videos from YouTube or uploaded files.

Source: Apple.June 10, 2024ShareSave Subscribe to Listen00:0007:26Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.Today, at Apple’s annual developers conference—where new software products are previewed in slick video presentations—the company finally joined the generative-AI race. The company introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will be rolled out to the tech giant’s latest operating systems starting this fall. New generative-AI models will help Apple users write work memos and highly personalized text; create images and emoji; connect and organize photos, calendar events, and emails.The tools supposedly rely on the context of what’s happening on your device: They’ll be able to identify which contacts you are referencing and pull information from a range of apps. Apple offered a quintessentially Apple example in its marketing video: The senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, plays a busy dad who uses Apple Intelligence to figure out whether a last-minute meeting will conflict with his daughter’s play. The tool pulls information from his calendar, scans a PDF his daughter sent him, and looks at the traffic on Apple Maps to figure out if he can make it on time. This, Apple stresses, is not some wonky enterprise-software solution—“This is AI for the rest of us,” Federighi declares.It’s a helpful line, because it articulates how Apple sees itself: not just as a manufacturer of phones and laptops and a prestige movie-and-television studio, but as the central technological force mediating the overscheduled lives of upwardly mobile achievers. Apple Intelligence promises to synthesize all your disparate texts, emails, calendar invites, and photos for you. At one point in the conference keynote, an executive noted that Siri can now do in seconds what used to take a human minutes to accomplish. This is Apple’s pitch distilled: the messy edges of your life, sanded down via Siri and brushed aluminum.

Generative AI is rapidly changing the way people work and live. Through language replication and the generation of written content, images and even music, gen AI is encroaching on domains previously considered ‘uniquely human.’ As the verbal and cognitive capabilities of machines evolve, an existential question has emerged: In gen AI’s shadow, what unique qualities will humans retain?  
More than 50 years ago, Stanley Kubrick’s groundbreaking film 2001: A Space Odyssey gave moviegoers and society at large one of the first glimpses into the future of AI. In the movie, a spacecraft’s onboard computer verbally interacts with its human crewmates, executes all technical aspects of the mission and even plays (and wins) a friendly game of chess with an astronaut. At one point in the story, the computer — HAL 9000 or simply “Hal” — is interviewed remotely by a news reporter back on Earth.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Moments later, when the interview shifts back to the crew, the reporter says he felt that Hal exhibited a sense of pride when he spoke about his own technical flawlessness. When the reporter asks if they think Hal is capable of experiencing emotions, the mission commander is doubtful.
“Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions… but as to whether or not he has real feelings is something that I don’t think anyone can truthfully answer.”
More than a half-century later, the ability to experience feelings and emotions are qualities that — at least, for now — remain uniquely human.
Interestingly, and contrary to Hal’s conversational abilities in a fictional setting, language was not something computers did particularly well. Today, however, gen AI has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks that include large language model (LLM)-driven language translation and sentiment analysis, and chatbots can now understand and respond to questions and commands. In a particularly noteworthy example, AI-enabled a computer to pass the Turing test while simultaneously convincing multiple human judges it was a person and not a machine.
Beyond the purview of technology
As gen AI continues automating human tasks without “feeling” any particular way about doing so, those of us among the living can take stock in our other unique qualities that are incapable of being mimicked by machines. Along with emotions, attributes that remain uniquely human include imagination-based creativity and original thinking, and complex problem solving that requires cognitive flexibility and intuition. It’s also important to note how morality and ethics — which are beyond the purview of a technology that lacks an experience of being a member of society — factor into human decision making.      
The five human senses, and the extensive input the brain processes in relation to them, represent another example of what can be deemed uniquely human. As sight, sound, smell, taste and touch intertwine with an infamously fallible memory to create an embodied experience in humans, it’s difficult to imagine technology replicating the uniquely human experience of this convergence of senses.advertisement
Delving deeper into the incomparable characteristics of the mind, the discovery of mirror neurons represents another human characteristic that technology has yet to reproduce. A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an individual executes a specific motor act or experiences an emotion and when they observe the same or similar act performed or emotion experienced by another individual. First observed in primates, actions driven by mirror neurons can be described in the most simplistic terms as “monkey see, monkey do.”  
According to research published by the National Institute of Health on mirror neurons, “from a functional viewpoint, action execution and observation are closely related processes, and… the ability to interpret the actions of others requires the involvement of our own motor system.” These mirror neurons enhance our experience of empathy, competition and teamwork, to name just a few examples. While an LLM might infer what we are feeling, they do not feel it themselves.
A shift in organizations’ mindset
In tandem with gen AI’s rising trajectory and the thought-provoking existential questions that come with it, humans are grappling with how to manage, control, and regulate AI technologies. Going forward, organizations will need to make choices when delegating tasks to gen AI technology.advertisement
According to research by McKinsey, business leaders need to take a broad view of gen AI’s capabilities and “deeply consider its implications for the organization.” The findings revealed that many global executives shared the following sentiment: “We were behind on automation and digitization, and we finally closed the gap. We don’t want to be left behind again, but we aren’t sure how to think about generative AI.”
Seeking to not repeat missed opportunities of the past, many organizations are approaching gen AI cautiously. Companies that leverage gen AI will need to establish well-defined workforce implementation and utilization strategies to ensure the responsible execution of their adoption roadmap. This will be increasingly critical as new regulations are created to ensure gen AI is used ethically, and standards are established to ensure data privacy and security. In short, organizations with a legitimate stake in gen AI will be held accountable for how they develop and deploy it.
Just because technology can do something…
Traditionally, technology has exerted a heavy hand on what we consider “work,” as 60% of the job titles held by those employed in 2018 did not even exist in 1940. As we look ahead to a world increasingly mediated by AI, it remains to be seen what new endeavors humans will undertake as AI remakes the 9-to-5 landscape. Going forward, governments, corporations and organizations of all types will need to make critical, conscious decisions about what will be outsourced to computers and what roles will remain in the human realm. During this process it’s important to consider this: Just because technology can do something doesn’t necessarily mean it should do it. 
When futurist Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick partnered in the 1960s to write a screenplay that placed AI at the center of its plot, could they have known how prescient their fiction would one day be?

He looks a little young to be asking questions about a job—sort of a cartoon version of Harry Potter, with dark hair and glasses. You can choose other interviewers to speak with instead, representing various genders and races with names like Benjamin, Leslie, and Kristin. Alex, the name given to this AI interviewer, asks about your professional experience, theoretical questions about programming, and then gives out a coding exercise.Alex is an AI interviewer developed by micro1, a US company that describes itself as an AI recruitment engine for engineers. The tech provides an “enjoyable, gamified, and less-biased interview process,” the company’s founder, Ali Ansari, claims in a demo video of the tech.The use of AI tools in job hunting is becoming widespread. Career sites like Indeed and LinkedIn have incorporated generative AI tools for job seekers and recruiters into their platforms. There are interviewer chatbots companies can enable, as well as AI tools to help people practice for job interviews. But the use of AI in evaluating candidates has mixed reviews: Some HR tools have been caught making negative judgements on applicants who have Black-sounding names, giving preference to men, or skipping over candidates with employment gaps on résumés.AI tools in hiring save companies money and time, but the long-term implications for workers have yet to be realized.AdvertisementAnsari tells WIRED that this tool allows companies to “screen candidates in a much more efficient and accurate manner.” Micro1 splits its model into two formats: Companies can employ the software to interview candidates for specific roles, and rather than picking through a sample size of thousands of applicants, can screen endless masses of candidates with the AI interviewer. Or candidates can go through the process independently to be added to a marketplace of engineers. The internal marketplace has a talent pool of vetted engineers—from India, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries far from American tech hubs—who Ansari describes as “untapped but exceptional.” This, he says, may help diversify who gets to work in top tech jobs. “We become the way into Silicon Valley,” Ansari says.Most PopularBusinessHere’s What Happens When You Give People Free MoneyBy Paresh DaveSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyCultureThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right NowBy Angela WatercutterMore than 100,000 people have gone through micro1’s screenings with hopes of being added to its marketplace of engineers, and the company lists a number of tech companies, including DoNotPay (whose CEO has also invested in micro1) among those who have used its system to screen or hire engineers from its marketplace. Ansari says companies are using micro1 to screen as many as 30,000 candidates a month.Asynchronous video interviews have become more common, with companies turning to prerecorded responses in automated systems to handle screening interviews. This task has become more onerous after a series of layoffs in the past two years have whittled down the number of positions available, and recruiters who post open roles on sites like LinkedIn can receive hundreds or thousands of applicants. And generative AI tools have made it easier for those seeking jobs to bulk apply, creating more applications for recruiters and hiring managers to review—some with little relevance to the role. But while AI is becoming more common on the hiring side, too, some recruiters are wary of the biases it may have, and have steered clear of employing the tools in their decisions.Of course there’s still bias with AI tools, Ansari says. “Of course there’s also bias with humans. The goal with the AI system is to make it much less biased than humans.” With AI, Ansari explains, the AI interviewer on micro1 won’t pass or fail a candidate; instead, it places them into categories like inexperienced, mid-level, and senior. Then, Ansari says, it’s on the hiring manager or recruiter to decide if the candidate is a good fit for the role. They can also listen to audio recordings of the responses rather than relying solely on the AI interviewer to interpret them.Zahira Jaser, an associate professor at the University of Sussex Business School, says a lot remains unknown about the impact of AI and asynchronous interviewing—including how the tech affects candidates.

He looks a little young to be asking questions about a job—sort of a cartoon version of Harry Potter, with dark hair and glasses. You can choose other interviewers to speak with instead, representing various genders and races with names like Benjamin, Leslie, and Kristin. Alex, the name given to this AI interviewer, asks about your professional experience, theoretical questions about programming, and then gives out a coding exercise.
Alex is an AI interviewer developed by micro1, a US company that describes itself as an AI recruitment engine for engineers. The tech provides an “enjoyable, gamified, and less-biased interview process,” the company’s founder, Ali Ansari, claims in a demo video of the tech.
The use of AI tools in job hunting is becoming widespread. Career sites like Indeed and LinkedIn have incorporated generative AI tools for job seekers and recruiters into their platforms. There are interviewer chatbots companies can enable, as well as AI tools to help people practice for job interviews. But the use of AI in evaluating candidates has mixed reviews: Some HR tools have been caught making negative judgements on applicants who have Black-sounding names, giving preference to men, or skipping over candidates with employment gaps on résumés.
AI tools in hiring save companies money and time, but the long-term implications for workers have yet to be realized.
Ansari tells WIRED that this tool allows companies to “screen candidates in a much more efficient and accurate manner.” Micro1 splits its model into two formats: Companies can employ the software to interview candidates for specific roles, and rather than picking through a sample size of thousands of applicants, can screen endless masses of candidates with the AI interviewer. Or candidates can go through the process independently to be added to a marketplace of engineers. The internal marketplace has a talent pool of vetted engineers—from India, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries far from American tech hubs—who Ansari describes as “untapped but exceptional.” This, he says, may help diversify who gets to work in top tech jobs. “We become the way into Silicon Valley,” Ansari says.
More than 100,000 people have gone through micro1’s screenings with hopes of being added to its marketplace of engineers, and the company lists a number of tech companies, including DoNotPay (whose CEO has also invested in micro1) among those who have used its system to screen or hire engineers from its marketplace. Ansari says companies are using micro1 to screen as many as 30,000 candidates a month.
Asynchronous video interviews have become more common, with companies turning to prerecorded responses in automated systems to handle screening interviews. This task has become more onerous after a series of layoffs in the past two years have whittled down the number of positions available, and recruiters who post open roles on sites like LinkedIn can receive hundreds or thousands of applicants. And generative AI tools have made it easier for those seeking jobs to bulk apply, creating more applications for recruiters and hiring managers to review—some with little relevance to the role. But while AI is becoming more common on the hiring side, too, some recruiters are wary of the biases it may have, and have steered clear of employing the tools in their decisions.
Of course there’s still bias with AI tools, Ansari says. “Of course there’s also bias with humans. The goal with the AI system is to make it much less biased than humans.” With AI, Ansari explains, the AI interviewer on micro1 won’t pass or fail a candidate; instead, it places them into categories like inexperienced, mid-level, and senior. Then, Ansari says, it’s on the hiring manager or recruiter to decide if the candidate is a good fit for the role. They can also listen to audio recordings of the responses rather than relying solely on the AI interviewer to interpret them.
Zahira Jaser, an associate professor at the University of Sussex Business School, says a lot remains unknown about the impact of AI and asynchronous interviewing—including how the tech affects candidates. Recording oneself can be awkward, and there are no human cues to pick up on from an AI interviewer. After being told to act naturally and put their best foot forward in the already nerve-wracking process of human job interviews throughout their career, people may not know how to show their best self to a chatbot, particularly when they’re up against opaque, built-in biases of AI.
“In the real world, humans are biased. But there are techniques we can use to overcome this human bias,” Jaser says. “In an algorithm-driven bias, this is likely to be very systematic.” For example, some AI hiring tools are trained on profiles of past successful employees, raising concerns that they will repeat past biased hiring practices.
For now, these AI tools don’t have the final say in who gets hired. But they increasingly have sway over which applicants get face time with a real human, and that can have a massive impact on what the workforce looks like going forward.

Is Artificial Intelligence Going to Take Over Agriculture?

Artificial intelligence is everywhere these days. It is being used to create logos, write transcriptions of events and interviews,  and complete the homework assignments of students around the world. At first thought, it might not seem like artificial intelligence (AI, not to be confused with artificial insemination) has much of a place in agriculture. But there are many ways that AI is being used in ag, including in crop production, raising livestock, food production and processing, and more. The next question is, will AI take jobs away from those working in ag?
What is artificial intelligence, and how does it work?
Artificial intelligence algorithms are modeled after the human brain, meaning that they can “learn.” One goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic human cognitive activity. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
At its basis, AI is input provided to a processor, which produces an output. One example of machine learning would be providing an AI system with a photo of corn and telling it that the image is of corn. You can feed your system thousands of images of corn and tell it that the image is of corn. Eventually, the system will be able to tell you with certainty whether an image (different from the ones you have previously shown the AI) is of corn or not. This is an example of one of the uses of AI in agriculture. Some helpful AI tools in agriculture are apps, robots, and drones that can identify weeds. All you need to do is use the camera on your phone to see what type of weed or plant you are looking at. Some of these systems can also recommend how to control that weed and where to go for more information.
AI is also used to create autonomous robots that can drive through fields and identify and control weeds. These robots can also identify diseases and insects, take soil samples, and even spray or mechanically remove weeds that they identify. So far, these robots are still being researched, but they have the potential to replace some of the technology and labor currently used in agriculture. These types of multifunctional AI robots are still a long way out from being usable and affordable for the average farmer.
AI is also being used in livestock production. One example is using a camera on a drone that can be flown over a herd of cattle. AI systems can look at the footage captured by the drone and count and inventory the herd of cattle. This could save farmers time and labor, as they would no longer have to go out and physically count their cattle. AI is also being used to look at thermal images of cattle and recognize bovine respiratory disease at its early stages.
AI also has potential uses in food processing. Currently, work is being done on AI systems that can grade the quality of pork by looking at color and marbling (which is normally done by people). There is also the potential for better food tracking and management on the consumer side.
There’s also a lot of research being done about AI in agriculture. The USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is even funding AI research in many areas of agriculture. Some examples include using machine learning, remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and precision technologies for more informed farm production and management.
There is also research into autonomous robots that could perform labor-intensive jobs like pesticide application and harvesting. There are even nano-based sensing mechanisms and smart sensors being developed that could provide accurate, reliable, and cost-effective detection of pathogens, chemicals, and contaminants in foods, on farms and ranches, and in water and soil. AI also has the potential to help on the business and economics side of ag. Farm managers can use AI to help them make decisions, improve efficiency, and more. AI can also help us understand and develop international trade, ag resource use, consumer behavior, food safety, ag policy, technology development, and more.
Will AI take away jobs in ag?
New technological advances have historically automated and taken away jobs, especially factory positions. You might have heard about how AI has the potential to take over jobs, especially positions like writers, web developers, bookkeepers, judicial clerks, and similar positions. However, many businesses have a hard time finding qualified employees, so this could eliminate some employment pain points for the industry. As of 2022, 19% of American workers held positions in this category of jobs at high risk of being exposed to AI.
AI has the potential to take over jobs in ag, but many of these positions are a long way out from being overtaken by AI. It’s also hard to tell for sure what jobs and when will be taken over by AI. It will also take more new jobs to set up AI systems and complete more research into AI. It’s much more likely that instead of taking over jobs, AI will help agriculture as a whole.
The average age of farm producers has been rising, and in 2017, the average age of a farmer or rancher was 57.5 years old. New technology, including AI, can help aging producers and make their jobs easier. AI can also help ag by increasing efficiency and productivity, increasing sustainability, and helping producers make more informed decisions. AI has the potential to change agriculture, but the heart of ag will always be the people.

AI cons




AI pros








The rise of generative AI needs to be put into context, so I'm going to explain the pros and cons of using AI in art creation. But first, let's reflect… I was born in the 1980s and witnessed the transition from computers as a novelty, to them being in most homes. As a child, I loved to draw and paint. I loved to explore everything you could do with computers and creative work.As I grew up and started doing more serious digital artwork, I would often hear the “it's just pushing a button” comment when I people discussed digital art. I could easily brush that off and explain patiently, that a computer and Photoshop were like an advanced pencil. Just tools where I still did the creative work.Today, I can’t say the same with such high confidence. Today paintings, videos, 3D models and music can all be made with just that… “a push of a button”. So the discourse becomes how can AI and human creativity work?Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping ToolsUndoit’s an insult to human creativity to think that all of our artistic sensibility could be channelled through a single text promptIt’s easy to come to the conclusion, then, that there’s no longer any need for artists, creatives and storytellers. But to me, it’s an insult to human creativity to think that all of our artistic sensibility could be channelled through a single text prompt. Art is intent, meaning, sensitivity and most importantly of all, it’s a reflection of the complexity of a human being. Being able to create a mostly random, beautiful image with the 'push of a button' doesn’t change that.LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqWe’re still nowhere near a point in time where generative AI based on text alone can offer the same sense of control of a traditional workflow. For some projects, that loss of control is not a problem, for others that fine-grained control over any aspect of the process, is what makes or breaks the work. As OLIVER's Rod Sobral argued in his piece on AI in branding, human creativity with AI can succeed, but AI alone fails.Outside of the debate about training data, which requires an article series of its own, what are the core pro’s and cons of generative AI? Let’s start with some cons and end on a more positive note with the pros.Generative AI: the cons01. Results can be frustratingOne of the main issues with generative AI systems today is that they’re great at making images that look good, but quite bad at making the image you had in mind.02. Subscriptions are expensiveA lot of AI services are good at some aspects of image or video generation, and not great at others. If you want a more full-fledged experience, subscription fees add up unless you have the technical courage to install local AI models.03. The training data is full of biasThere have been plenty of examples of how the bias is quite strong and most AI image generative systems. Several companies are trying to make more fair models, with varying success. In many ways it’s a reflection of the bias that already exists on the internet and in society in general.04. The results are inconsistentEverything constantly shifts around, and with most tools it’s impossible to do a “hold that thought” on elements that work, while continuing to iterate on other elements.Generative AI: the pros01. It’s great for brainstorming sessionsIt’s very easy to quickly generate content for moodboards and to brainstorm on ideas. If you supply the ai systems with just a little bit of content outside of a pure text prompt, you can get some truly surprising and inspiring results.02. There are a lot of tools and workflowsChances are there’s an AI tool that fits well for exactly what you’re making. Especially the open source community around Stable Diffusion based systems like Comfy-UI and AnimateDiff are increasing the amount of creative control we have over Gen AI, on a daily basis.03. Enables exploration of 'weird' ideasBy streamlining the art-pipeline in productions 'weirder' ideas can be explored, which would otherwise be too risky for budgetary reasons. AI tools could make productions less rigid. Need to change a main character's hair or relight a sequence? That would be very costly before, but maybe not as much tomorrow.04. AI can be used as an amplifierTools like Magnific AI (as I explain in my article 'Don't fear AI') can take a relatively detailed input and add a final layer of finish to it, effectively working as a sort of 'amplifier' of your artistic intent. This is where I think generative AI is most interesting; much more so than in workflows that revolve around text prompting alone.If you want to explore AI, read Martin's views on why generative AI is too generic as well as our look at Nvidia's approach to AI for video games.

Yet less than a third of companies that employ such workers have a formal AI strategy in place. And “dangerous divides” separate knowledge workers from the leaders to whom they ultimately report. The figures and the alert are from a survey conducted by the work management platform supplier Asana and the AI safety and research startup Anthropic. Researchers from the two received completed responses from around 5,000 knowledge workers in the U.S. and U.K. Noting that more than half of knowledge workers now use gen AI, the report authors observe that organizations move through five stages along the path to full AI integration—skepticism, activation, experimentation, scaling and maturity. Along the way, they suggest, AI-primed operations do well to take five questioning strides—all starting with a “C”—to successfully traverse the five stages. 1. AI Comprehension: How well do your employees understand how to use AI? To reach AI maturity, employee understanding of the technology is crucial, and it varies significantly across stages, the authors write. At stage 1, “AI skepticism,” only 2% are familiar with generative AI basics, 6% have a strong understanding of its capabilities for their work, and 20% use AI weekly at work. More: By stage 5, “AI maturity,” familiarity with generative AI surges to 35%, 53% have a strong grasp of its capabilities, and 93% engage with AI each week.2. AI Concerns: What issues are top-of-mind for employees regarding AI?As workers develop basic AI proficiency in stages 2 and 3—“AI activation” and “AI experimentation”—new fears emerge, Asana and Anthropic point out. Contributors become increasingly concerned about others’ perceptions of their new AI use, worrying that relying on AI might be seen as taking shortcuts or producing inauthentic work. More: Data shows 29% of workers worry about being perceived as lazy and 25% feel like frauds for relying on AI to complete tasks. 3. AI Collaboration: How do employees work together with AI? Workers who see AI as a teammate are 33% more likely to report productivity gains from using AI at work, compared to those who consider it a tool. The authors further note that, as workers use AI more frequently, they begin to recognize its potential for collaboration and its capacity to assume more complex roles within their workflows. More: Workers who interact with AI on a daily basis are significantly more likely to prefer AI to act like a teammate (22%) compared to those who use it monthly (16%).4. AI Context: What AI policies, guidelines and principles frame the organization’s outlook on AI? At stage 1 (AI skepticism), only 2% of employees report that their organizations have defined AI principles, compared to 34% at stage 5 (AI maturity). By stage 5, organizations not only recognize that well-defined AI policies and principles are crucial for regulatory compliance, but they also view them as strategic assets that can differentiate them in the market. These policies and principles provide a clear framework for employees to follow when using AI, ensuring ethical, consistent and responsible usage across the organization. 5. AI Calibration: How is AI effectiveness and value measured in your organization?To effectively calibrate AI, organizations must engage their workforce in the evaluation process, the authors state. At stage 1 (AI skepticism), only 17% of workers say their organizations actively collect employee feedback on AI tools, which may contribute to the modest productivity improvements observed at this stage.By contrast, at stage 5 (AI maturity), this practice becomes well-established, with 91% of workers reporting that their organizations actively incorporate employee feedback into the AI calibration process.Download the full report.  Related reading:So much healthcare data, so many missed opportunities 10 things you may have suspected about AI but didn’t know for sure till now Submitted for consideration by all healthcare AI stakeholders: 10 principles, 6 commitments, 1 direction Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

Generative AI has the potential to transform every industry and line of business, revolutionizing sectors and enabling companies to unlock new opportunities. To ensure your organization maintains its competitive edge and keeps pace with innovation, mid-to-senior level leaders need to build the knowledge and skills to understand and maximize the full potential of generative AI.
The new learning program, Unlocking Generative AI Opportunities with AWS, is a six-week learning experience developed in collaboration with the Udemy Business Leadership Academy. It is uniquely designed to equip leaders across all industries with the generative AI knowledge and change management strategies they need to develop talent successfully and drive the digital transformation within their organizations.
Throughout the experience, leaders will build the following key skills:

Generative AI technology: Organizations need tech-savvy leaders proficient in generative AI tools. This program provides access to PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock playground, where participants engage in practical exercises in prompt engineering and capability exploration to help them learn how to reimagine businesses, boost productivity, redefine customer experiences, and create new business models.
Change management: Leaders use change management skills to foster innovation and create a thriving organizational climate. Participants learn innovation concepts, engage in an innovation tournament, and generate actionable proposals for efficiency and performance improvements through generative AI projects.
Communication and collaboration: Effective communication and collaboration are the keys to inspirational leadership, building trust and confidence while enhancing decision-making and driving innovation. The program guides leaders in developing communication strategies to articulate visions, provide clear directions, and foster open dialogues.


Collaborative learning with other leaders
The program connects leaders together to solve complex problems, generate and spread ideas, coach and learn from each other, and capture knowledge within the organization. Learners connect with their peers and certified expert moderators who answer questions, nudge people along, and facilitate the cohort learning experience. To help develop leadership teams at scale, this cohort program incorporates self-paced learning modules, microlearning, hands-on practice, and live, virtual events. Participants in the cohort will present and prioritize ideas, address AI misconceptions, design strategies, and learn skills to help inspire their teams with a forward-looking vision. Ultimately, progressing from a foundational understanding of generative AI to confident application, and enthusiasm for the possibilities that generative AI can help create for organizations of all sizes.
Hands-on with Amazon Bedrock and PartyRock
Early in the program, we’ll introduce foundation models, which are vast, complex networks trained on data. Amazon Bedrock is a catalyst for innovation with generative AI and is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications using foundation models. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies: AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon. Through a single API, Amazon Bedrock grants access to a broad set of capabilities essential for building responsible generative AI applications with security, and privacy in mind. Throughout this cohort, learners explore how Amazon Bedrock and generative AI are driving business transformation, including process automation, enhanced customer experiences, and operational efficiency. Hands-on practice is integrated throughout the learning experience, enabling you to actively build and experiment with generative AI applications. You’ll engage with PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock Playground- an intuitive platform where you can create and experiment with generative AI applications in just a few clicks.
Real-world use cases
After learning about Amazon Bedrock, you’ll then hear stories of how real teams are using generative AI to work more effectively. These stories will exemplify generative AI’s influence beyond IT with specific use cases from marketing, customer service, sales, and operations teams. With any new technology and innovation, you must be aware of how to promote the safe and responsible development of AI as a force for good. You’ll hear from the experts and discuss how others have dealt with ethical concerns that will arise as businesses begin to use generative AI. With the core dimensions of responsible AI outlined (fairness, explainability, privacy and security, robustness, and governance), you’ll have a framework to follow as generative AI gets integrated across your business.
Prompt engineering
After learning generative AI and its real-world applications, it’s time to transition to some specific uses for the technology. You’ll learn how teams interface with generative AI services and how prompt engineering comes into play. Prompt engineering is a key skill to learn how to refine your prompts, helping you improve the quality and relevance of your outputs. Imagine the freedom and opportunity of effectively communicating with AI, where every instruction is met with precise and tailored results. That’s the basis of prompt engineering. You’ll learn the key elements of an effective prompt and how adjusting the prompt’s elements can make AI’s responses more relevant and actionable.
Impact of generative AI across industries
Amazon has been a leader in AI for over 25 years, continuously introducing AI capabilities that help innovate for customers. In this cohort, you’ll also learn the most recent ways Amazon is leveraging generative AI to help organizations serve their customers. In healthcare, generative AI is making significant strides in personalizing patient care. In the finance sector, generative AI is revolutionizing fraud detection by analyzing transaction patterns to identify anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. In the retail sector, generative AI is changing the game in pricing strategies and enhancing the online shopping experience. The impact of generative AI across industries is nothing short of revolutionary.
Introducing generative AI in your organization
As the cohort progresses, you’ll get concrete guidance on how to get started and accelerate your team and your organization’s use of generative AI. Change is hard and it takes a thoughtful approach to introduce, and get your employees comfortable, with this emerging technology. You’ll understand how generative AI must start at the team-level, helping to cement and drive adoption from all parts of your organization. The experts at AWS and Udemy will help you plan your first generative AI project and then outline a path to expand generative AI’s use.
Identifying opportunities for innovation
Next, you will embark on a journey to unlock the secrets of building an innovation pipeline. First, you will explore the interplay between quantity, quality, and variety of ideas, unveiling their roles in driving a thriving innovation ecosystem. Next, you will learn to cast a wide net, exploring all sources to uncover innovation opportunities. Additionally, you will acquire techniques to generate fresh ideas and maximize the power of others’ innovations. Finally, you will gain the skills to identify and submit innovation opportunities into a cohort-based innovation tournament, fostering collaboration and synergy among innovators.
Communicating to inspire change
Did you know that a staggering 70% of change initiatives within organizations fail (Source: the McKinsey Group)? We’ll dive into this aspect of your leadership and arm you with strategies to beat the odds. You’ll master the art of crafting a compelling vision for the future that resonates deeply with you and your workforce. Additionally, you’ll acquire the skills of trustworthy leadership communication, empowering you to motivate, inspire, and guide teams towards achieving breakthrough changes. By the end, you’ll have the knowledge and tools to navigate the ever-changing landscape of organizational transformation.
Putting it all together
You’ll conclude the cohort with a collaborative team event, working together with colleagues to learn how generative AI tools like PartyRock can help you think through problems, optimize processes, and be a catalyst for innovation across your business. Through all the exercises, you’ll build confidence to use generative AI to augment and enhance your work, and the work of your team, and ignite the generative AI-powered era within your organization.
Now’s the time for you and your team to learn the what, why, and how behind generative AI – and how AWS can help. Sign up and get your team on the way to unlocking generative AI opportunities with AWS.

The change, announced via a new blog post, comes after a week of backlash from users who feared that an update to Adobe’s terms of service would allow their work to be used for AI training.The new terms of service are expected to roll out on June 18th and aim to better clarify what Adobe is permitted to do with its customers’ work, according to Adobe’s president of digital media, David Wadhwani.“We have never trained generative AI on our customer’s content, we have never taken ownership of a customer’s work, and we have never allowed access to customer content beyond what’s legally required,” Wadhwani said to The Verge.Adobe faced widespread scrutiny from creatives over the last week after its customers were alerted to language in its terms of service update that discussed AI. Customers interpreted Adobe’s vague language to mean the company was allowing itself to freely access and use customers’ work to train Adobe’s generative AI models. That wasn’t the case — and Adobe’s policies around training weren’t changing — but Adobe’s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, acknowledged that the wording was “unclear” and that “trust and transparency couldn’t be more crucial these days.”“In retrospect, we should have modernized and clarified the terms of service sooner”Wadhwani says that the language used within Adobe’s TOS was never intended to permit AI training on customers’ work. “In retrospect, we should have modernized and clarified the terms of service sooner,” Wadhwani says. “And we should have more proactively narrowed the terms to match what we actually do, and better explained what our legal requirements are.”A chunk of the creative community has long-standing beef with Adobe over its alleged industry monopoly, its subscription-based pricing models, and its use of generative AI. The company trained its own Firefly AI model on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content to avoid some of the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI, but several artists have found images that reference their work on Adobe’s stock platform — making it hard to trust the protections in place.“We feel very, very good about the process,” Wadhwani said in regards to content moderation surrounding Adobe stock and Firefly training data but acknowledged it’s “never going to be perfect.” Wadhwani says that Adobe can remove content that violates its policies from Firefly’s training data and that customers can opt out of automated systems designed to improve the company’s service.Adobe said in its blog post that it recognizes “trust must be earned” and is taking on feedback to discuss the new changes. Greater transparency is a welcome change, but it’s likely going to take some time to convince scorned creatives that it doesn’t hold any ill intent. “We are determined to be a trusted partner for creators in the era ahead. We will work tirelessly to make it so.”Comments17 Comments / 17 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

“We feel very, very good about the process,” Wadhwani said in regards to content moderation surrounding Adobe stock and Firefly training data but acknowledged it’s “never going to be perfect.” Wadhwani says that Adobe can remove content that violates its policies from Firefly’s training data and that customers can opt out of automated systems designed to improve the company’s service.

Adobe said in its blog post that it recognizes “trust must be earned” and is taking on feedback to discuss the new changes. Greater transparency is a welcome change, but it’s likely going to take some time to convince scorned creatives that it doesn’t hold any ill intent. “We are determined to be a trusted partner for creators in the era ahead. We will work tirelessly to make it so.”

For anyone involved in software development, the rise of generative AI tools raises an uncomfortable question: “Will robots take my job?” As AI changes the coding landscape, it’s inevitable that tech professionals will have to consider how they can evolve with it. 
These generative AI tools are becoming much better at everything from writing basic code snippets to identifying bugs. At first glance, that might seem like a career-ender for junior developers—but even the most coding-intensive job requires other skills, many of which aren’t replicable by a machine.
First, it’s important to note what AI does well in terms of coding:

Easing repetitive coding tasks by generating boilerplate code.
Reviewing code for obvious bugs.
Code optimization and efficiencies.

This is all front-line stuff; as any tech pro will tell you, generative AI can’t build an entire, complex app from scratch, or figure out how a project fits into a company’s overall portfolio. Developers and engineers who use generative AI to create code still need to tweak that output to fit their specific needs; AI also can’t catch every error and efficiency as well as a human who can see all a project’s particular needs and nuances. 
Adapting to the AI Revolution
For any developer or engineer who wants to further “future proof” themselves against AI, consider the following: 

Don’t run away from AI: For better or worse, these tools are here to stay, so you better learn how to leverage them. Take the time to explore AI-powered code completion. If you’re knowledgeable about how AI works, you may even attract attention from employers who want employees who’ve mastered AI code generation. 
Problem-solving is always key: AI excels at automating tasks, but it lacks the human ability to conceptualize and solve complex problems. Hone your analytical skills and become an expert in problem-solving, and you’ll continue to attract love from recruiters and hiring managers. 
Soft Skills never go out of style: Communication and teamwork are becoming even more critical as development teams become more distributed and leverage AI tools. Develop your ability to collaborate effectively, explain technical concepts clearly, and work seamlessly with designers, product managers, and other stakeholders—you’ll boost your career longevity in the process. 
Creativity! Use the time freed up by AI to focus on the big picture. Think strategically about new features, propose solutions to long-standing problems, and become a driving force for innovation within your team.

Remember, you ignore AI at your peril: PwC recently analyzed more than half a billion job ads from 15 countries to determine how AI is impacting the current global workforce, and found that those who choose to specialize in AI can enjoy wage premiums of up to 25 percent on average. “Today, there are seven times as many postings for specialist AI jobs as there were in 2012. In contrast, postings for all jobs have grown more slowly, doubling since 2012,” the report added. This is one genie that’s not going back in the bottle.

You’re putting yourself in front of people that you would really love to get a job with and hoping that they think you tick all of their boxes... without even knowing what those boxes are.Ultimately, though, the job interview is just as much about you finding out if the job and workplace is a good fit for you and that’s why, towards the end of the interview, you’re asked if you have any questions for the team.If that question often throws you or you don’t know what to ask, Christiano Winckler at Somebody Digital revealed his six best questions for that crucial final impression.These will ensure that you understand company culture, any potential progression and if it’s a good fit for you.The best questions to ask interviewers at a job interview“What can I expect during my first week?”While this may feel very presumptuous, it’s a great question to ask to understand just how organised a company is.Winckler said:  “If the employer hints that it’s unlikely that time will be given to make introductions, show you around, or take you through the workplace roster, it can leave a new team member feeling stranded.“It can also indicate that employees experience heavy workloads that don’t allow them to partake in additional tasks, or even that progression in the workplace is slim as employees don’t tend to pay attention to each other.”“What’s the best part of working here?”This is a great one to really get a feel for how the interviewer currently feels in their role as, outside of perks and progression opportunities, this question gets to the heart of the day-to-day in the job.Winckler said: “If the interviewer struggles to state a handful of perks, it’s likely to reveal how they really feel about their place of work. It may also indicate a negative working environment, where managers are reluctant to celebrate and reward hard work and success.”He added: “The best bit of a workplace is all relative as what is considered a perk to one person may be a norm to another.“When the interviewer reveals what they consider workplace plus, it gives you the opportunity to determine if for you, that it’s simply the norm.”“Do you socialise as a team?”According to Winckler, this question is a great way to get a feel for the culture.He said: ” The question gives the interviewer the opportunity to divulge if after work drinks are the norm, and if non-attendance is taboo.“For some, a social workplace is a must, however for others it can serve as a red flag and even a sign of a toxic environment.  ”“What could I do in the role to surpass your expectations?”Job ads could conceal the real crux of the position if the duties presented are vague.Questioning ways in which to surpass the organisation’s expectations works two-fold.It creates the opportunity to determine if what is required of the role is unrealistic, or something that you will not be able to fulfil.The answer may confirm that the role is what you are seeking and give you confidence that the workplace will enable you to progress in your career“How do you recognise success?”Winckler points out that recognising success is often synonymous with promotion and many employees resign if they feel that management doesn’t recognise their achievements.He said: “If the interviewer struggles with examples on how they have previously awarded a colleague’s achievements, then this may indicate that the chances of a promotion are slim.”“How do you ensure that remote workers feel part of a team?”Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many people now work from home full-time or hybrid between home and the office.Winckler said: “It is more important than ever for employees to feel a part of a team. If collaborating with colleagues is vital for you to succeed, it’s important that you establish if the workplace culture allows you to connect with your colleagues.”Related...People Are Sharing What It's Like To Job-Hunt Over 50 — And It's HarrowingPeople Revealed What Drove Them Out Of Their Toxic WorkplacesThis Is What It's Like To Be Autistic In The Workplace",NewsArticle,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ask-6-unconventional-questions-during-060020374.html,Ask These 6 Unconventional Questions During A Job Interview To Really Learn About The Company,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1200, 'height': 600, 'url': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_uk_744/1636b7fd5e94d2391760f6fc9822663b'}",2024-06-08T06:00:20.000Z,2024-06-08T06:00:20.000Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sarah-Louise Kelly', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Yahoo News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_news_en-US_h_p_news_2.png', 'width': 310, 'height': 50}, 'url': 'https://sg.news.yahoo.com/'}",,,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_uk_744/1636b7fd5e94d2391760f6fc9822663b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sarah-Louise Kelly', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'HuffPost UK', 'url': 'http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 396, 'height': 100, 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/709278b0-35a7-11eb-bbe0-e355079cf0b3'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They told me that although being a professional artist had always been tough, lately things had gotten much worse.A few weeks ago, they were contacted by a client hoping to commission a drawing. The artist jumped at the opportunity and spent several weeks putting together samples. When they sent the samples to the client, the reply they got was both disappointing and disturbing. They were told the client had used the Dall-E AI program and were able to generate an image that worked perfectly for their purposes. The artist's services were no longer needed.That sort of email isn't something an artist could have expected a decade ago, but it's a story that's no longer rare. Increasingly, the creative work of artists is being replaced by AI. It's a concern for the future of art and for the future of artists, and I think we've finally reached a turning point.To paraphrase Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, computer engineers have been so preoccupied with whether they can create AI art, that they haven't stopped to ask whether they should. The cat is out of the bag now. AI art is all around us, and this trend will very likely continue. This makes it pressing to ask important ethical questions. Is AI art good for society? What will its effect be on artists? And how might we push back?One effect of AI art is clear. For the artist I met at the bus stop, it meant the loss of a commission. That sort of business loss, multiplied many times over and coupled with other new threats (such as the shift to payment via ""exposure""), has devastating effect. For many artists this movement will mean the loss of their ability to keep themselves afloat with their art. Many will increasingly have to rely on day jobs&mdash;with the hope that those jobs will afford them enough time to make art&mdash;while others will simply have to leave the profession.Consider New York-based company Monumental Labs, founded in 2022. Monumental Labs promises to create, utilizing AI, works of stone art in mere hours that previously would have taken months and to produce those works at 85 percent less than the ""normal"" cost&mdash;that is, 85 percent less than the cost to pay a human artist. On its website, Monumental Labs declares that it is unleashing a stone art ""renaissance.""Who will benefit from such a renaissance? Companies that rely on AI, if successful in their ventures, will effectively replace many human artists. A statue in a public square that could have been created by a human sculptor for a price that helps sustain their craft and support their family will now be made on the cheap and much faster by AI. This shift is a redistribution of not just artistic labor but also artistic wealth&mdash;from the hands and mouths of artists to the hands and mouths of tech CEOs. A modern-day version of John Henry vs. the machine.If we care about keeping human artists employed and producing great works of art, something must be done.One thing we might do is ban at least some AI art. This move will likely be resisted, however, especially by businesses hoping to profit from AI and by clients hoping to cut costs. It also seems like an option that will be difficult to enforce. But it still might be worth a shot.Another option is to support human artists through things like public grants, in effect subsidizing artists much like we already subsidize many businesses. Artist grants already exist and have good results, but they're rather difficult to obtain. We'd need to drastically increase their availability. Yet the instability of the political world suggests this option might not be so insulated from things like funding cuts or&mdash;perhaps more troubling&mdash;censorship. If conservatives take control of government again, it's conceivable they'd only approve grants for works in line with their values. That's a problem for maintaining the full range of artistic creativity and turns surviving as an artist into something that depends on one's politics.Another option is the free market. Television and streaming services are less influenced by government and depend primarily on advertising for their existence. And yet, many works on television and streaming services still face undue pressure from advertisers. It's also not hard to imagine a company like Netflix moving to produce AI-generated content if doing so would cut costs.The best tool we have left, it seems, is our ability to make individual choices. When a government or private client chooses to pay for a work of art created by a human being rather than by AI, they in effect choose to support real artists and not just leave them out to dry&mdash;they choose to help promote real artists and not a tech company that seems bent on replacing them. This is the old story of voting with your dollar. It's a move available to all of us and across a wide range of artistic media. We can choose to pay for a movie created by humans, or a movie created by AI; a song created by a human, or song created by AI. We can help keep human artists alive and creating their works for future generations while simultaneously choosing to withhold support from those who seek their replacement.Human-made art holds important values, and human artists are people like you and me&mdash;they deserve to eat and be able to pursue their passions. If we care about human artists, we need to accept that AI art is a real problem, and we need to make an effort to address it.Shawn Simpson is a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.",Opinion,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'AI-Driven Deep Fakes Are Here To Stay', 'description': ""Instead of detecting what is fake, news organizations should focus on what's real, according to cybersecurity expert Louis Steinberg of CTM Insights."", 'thumbnailUrl': ['https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2362962/louis-steinberg-interview.png?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;q=88&amp;f=aa05f00a64dc5f89cbb4a718f8349868'], 'uploadDate': '2024-03-15T14:04:56-04:00', 'duration': 'PT9M2S', 'contentUrl': 'https://video.newsweek.com/transcoder/480p/2918/louis-steinberg-interview-1710524105.m3u8'}]",,,,,,,,,,,Artificial Intelligence Threatens Disaster for Artists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its voice capabilities are improving daily, OpenAI recently put its voice cloning on hold. Using just a 15-second clip of your voice, it can produce results that are indistinguishable from the real thing by analysis technology. While this opens up a world of opportunities, it is also extremely dangerous in a year where dozens of countries around the world will head to the polls for elections.It’s also worth noting that generative AI is still largely general-purpose in nature. It won’t be long, however, before more specialised tools become widely available; enhancing productivity levels and effectiveness across industries. In the customer experience (CX) space, for example, the coupling of generative AI with conversation process and orchestration tools is enabling the automation of high volumes of rule-bound sales, support and service conversations – all at the level of a human expert.Given these rapid advancements, it’s baffling how slow even major players in the contact centre space have been to incorporate generative AI tools. What makes this even more concerning is that contact centres are among the businesses that face the biggest threat of disruption from these technological advances.Virtual agentsGenerative AI, when blended into an intelligent automation ecosystem, allows human agents to have dramatically improved and more effective conversations. Agents can be guided through every conversation without having to know all the details or rules. Resulting actions, such as email scripts and call summaries, can also be done by AI. This reduces training and ramp-up times, improves first call resolution and allows agents to handle more calls without all the post-call work.More significantly, however, is the emergence of generative AI-powered virtual agents. These “conversation experts” can engage directly with customers via chat channels, email, web, app and phone. Unlike chatbots, they can have conversations that stick to compliance guardrails yet adapt dynamically to customer context and change in direction. As a result, they can now resolve huge volumes of customer queries without relying on a human in the loop.New opportunitiesWhile virtual agents are sure to take over the processing of most rule-bound engagements, there is still an important role for humans in the growing CX space. Since they are freed from largely transactional roles, human agents have more time to focus on the calls where empathy, humour and emotional intelligence are critical.From a customer perspective, having real time access to a service expert is highly appealing. Rather than waiting in a call queue, they can instantly be put through to a virtual agent. This can be very helpful when call volumes spike or no human agents are available.Imagine calling a hotel you have booked in a different time zone, without realising that it is 1am, to ask what time breakfast is. Based on your booking, a virtual AI agent can respond that your booking does not have breakfast attached. It would also notice you have a small child on your booking, but have not requested a cot. It could book that cot and your breakfast, without anyone in the hotel having to stay up to answer your call.For many organisations, the speed at which these technologies are evolving makes knowing where to start and how to make it work feel a little daunting. They may lack the capital or buy-in to hire the skills needed to fully embrace these new technologies. For these companies, partnering with a specialist that removes the learning curve and speeds up the time to impact is appealing. These “digital business process outsourcings” can effectively build and manage your virtual agent for you - ensuring your customers can immediately speak to a capable expert via the channel of their choice, at any time.A wait-and-see approach to generative AI and virtual agents may feel safer, but the speed at which things are moving could simply heighten the pain of the inevitable disruption.This technology is not going away. It is not a fad and its impact will be felt much quicker than many expect.• Falkenberg is co-CEO of CLEVVARelated Topics:job advicecareer advicemzansi jobsdream jobsmartsmart worksopportunitiesjob interviewjob alerttechnologyartificial intelligencechatgptYou may likeEssential tips to safeguard yourself from financial scamsBy Staff ReporterInitiative to provide multilingual books to ECD centres to tackle the literacy crisis in SABy Anita NkonkiGauteng health welcomes postponement of Cancer Alliance court caseBy Siyabonga SitholeRead nextJoburg GLU partners want the mayor outBy Sipho Jack",NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/contact-centres-must-embrace-generative-ai-or-risk-being-left-behind-a7bbd9bc-50b2-48b4-b2fa-0d53ce3e0cdf'}",Contact centres must embrace generative AI or risk being left behind,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/4d3980f44e466e64a6fc5e4d3ec5765f8de47fab/2000', 'width': 2000, 'height': 1333}]",2024-06-06T10:40:41.000Z,2024-06-06T10:42:57.000Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Smart Works', 'url': 'https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/contact-centres-must-embrace-generative-ai-or-risk-being-left-behind-a7bbd9bc-50b2-48b4-b2fa-0d53ce3e0cdf'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'IOL | News that Connects South Africans', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.iol.co.za/logo.jpg', 'width': '60', 'height': '60'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Short




LLMs or large language models are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can understand and generate human language, based on probability.
LLMs are built on transformer-based neural networks and trained on a large corpus of textual data including books, articles, websites, and more.
The larger the LLM model, the more capabilities it exhibits. It can generate code, deduce patterns, and understand complex reasoning questions.
 



After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, the world has witnessed new technological advancements, and it seems there is no end to this ever-expanding development. AI Chatbots have been released by Google, Microsoft, Meta, Anthropic, and a score of other companies. All of the chatbots are powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). But what exactly is a large language model and how does it work? To learn about LLMs, follow our explainer below.

A Basic Definition of LLM
An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is trained on a large dataset of texts. It’s designed to understand and generate human language based on principles of probability. It’s essentially a deep-learning algorithm. An LLM can generate essays, poems, articles, and letters; generate code; translate texts from one language to another, summarize texts, and more.

The larger the training dataset, the better the LLM’s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Generally, AI researchers contend that LLMs with 2 billion or more parameters are “large” language models. If you are wondering what is a parameter, it’s the number of variables on which the model is trained. The larger the parameter size, the larger will be the model, and will have more capabilities.



To give you an example, when OpenAI released the GPT-2 LLM in 2019, it was trained on 1.5 billion parameters. Later in 2020, GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters, over 116x larger model. And the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model has 1.76 trillion parameters.



As you can see, over time, the parameter size is getting larger, bringing advanced and more complex capabilities to large language models.

How LLMs Work: The Training Process
In simple terms, LLMs learn to predict the next word in a sentence. This learning process is called pre-training where the model is trained on a large corpus of text including books, articles, news, extensive textual data from websites, Wikipedia, and more.



In this pre-training process, a model learns how a language works, its grammar, syntax, facts about the world, reasoning abilities, patterns, and more. Once the pre-training is done, a model goes through the fine-tuning process. As you can deduce, fine-tuning is done on specific datasets. 



For example, if you want the LLM to be good at coding, you fine-tune it on extensive coding datasets. Similarly, if you want the model to be good at creative writing, you train the LLM on a large corpus of literature material, poems, etc.

What is the Transformer Architecture for LLMs?
Almost all modern LLMs are built on the transformer architecture, but what is it exactly? Let’s briefly go through the history of LLMs. In the pre-transformer era, there were several neural network architectures like RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and more.



However, in 2017, researchers from the Google Brain team released a seminal paper called “Attention is All You Need” (Vaswani, et al). This paper introduced the Transformer architecture which has now become the foundation of all LLMs dealing with natural language processing tasks. The core idea of the transformer architecture is self-attention.

It can process all words in a sentence parallelly, understanding the context and relationship between words. It also leads to efficient training as it unlocks parallelism. After the paper was released, Google released the first transformer-based LLM called BERT in 2018. Later, OpenAI joined in and released its first GPT-1 model on the same architecture.

Applications of LLMs
We already know that LLMs now power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and more. It can perform NLP tasks including text generation, translation, summarization, code generation, writing stories, poems, etc. LLMs are also being used for conversational assistants.




Recently, OpenAI demoed its GPT-4o model which is remarkable at engaging in conversations. Apart from that, LLMs are already being tested for creating AI agents that can perform tasks for you. Both OpenAI and Google are working to bring AI agents in the near future. 



Overall, LLMs are being widely deployed as customer chatbots and used for content generation as well. While large language models are on the rise, ML researchers believe that another breakthrough is required to achieve AGI — an AI system more intelligent than humans.



We have not seen such breakthrough developments in the Generative AI era yet, however, some researchers believe that training a much larger LLM could lead to some level of consciousness in AI models.

Apple had been among the tech giants most conspicuously absent from — or at least, low-key about — the generative AI craze, at least until today.
At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC 2024) in Cupertino, California, the company unveiled its biggest push into generative AI so far: a new service called Apple Intelligence, which will offer a variety of features across Apple devices including Mac computers, iPhones, and iPads.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



The service is not an app per se, rather, it is a set of features embedded within other popular apps, from web browser Safari (where you can summarize articles) to Mail (where it can rewrite and suggest grammar improvements) to Photos (auto generate photo albums on specific subjects and topics set to music based on a text prompt) to Messages (where it can create custom AI generated emoji and photos of your contacts, as well as event and group photos).
As with nearly all new Apple announcements of the company’s storied history, the Apple Intelligence announcement was watched by a large audience of tech workers and journalists, as well as creatives, and some notable entrepreneurs and executives from rival firms. 
It also inspired a wide range of responses, from some interpreting the announcement as underwhelming or undermining of Apple’s reputation as a company where minimalistic and clean designs are prioritized, while others viewed it as one of, if not the best examples of generative AI done right. Here are some of the most interesting reactions I saw:
High praise from former rivals
Steven Sinofsky, the former president of the Windows Division at Microsoft and current board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, called Apple Intelligence “really excellent work.”



He also said he thought the idea of weaving Apple Intelligence through its various Apple-branded apps was “exactly right and even more so when combined with privacy/on device.”



And, as if that wasn’t enough of a favorable review, Sinofsky also took the opportunity to ding Google and his own former employer Microsoft in comparison to Apple’s approach:


advertisement
Similarly, Andrej Karpathy, an esteemed researcher who was previously director of artificial intelligence and Autopilot Vision at Tesla (where he competed with Apple’s abandoned self-driving car project) and a co-founder of OpenAI, said in a post on X that he found Apple Intelligence “super exciting.”



Double standard?
Bilawal Sidhu, host of the TED Talks AI Show and a former Google Maps AR/VR engineer, wrote a lengthy post on X comparing how Apple Intelligence leverages personal data on the device in which it operates, as well as virtual private clouds, to serve up AI responses — a tack that he saw as similar to Microsoft’s new Recall feature for Windows Copilot + PCs that faced intense backlash from some users and researchers for possible data security risks. Microsoft Recall was, as of last week, disabled by default and now must be turned on by the user during setup. advertisement



AI images and Genmoji: love/hate?
One of the most immediately obvious use cases for Apple Intelligence for regular users is in its ability to create custom imagery and emoji based on their text prompts within Messages and other apps. 
Open source software developer and AI influencer Simon Willison took to his blog to commend Apple’s approach toward AI image generation, writing:
“This feels like a clever way to address some of the ethical objections people have to this specific category of AI tool:

If you can’t create photorealistic images, you can’t generate deepfakes or offensive photos of people
By having obvious visual styles you ensure that AI generated images are instantly recognizable as such, without watermarks or similar
Avoiding the ability to clone specific artist’s styles further helps sidestep ethical issues about plagiarism and copyright infringement

The social implications of this are interesting too. Will people be more likely to share AI-generated images if there are no awkward questions or doubts about how they were created, and will that help it more become socially acceptable to use them?“
Others criticized the look and feel of the cartoonish AI generated images in Messages:




if anyone ever sends me one of these it's an instant block pic.twitter.com/eP7neZqf4f— → (@R3H8T) June 10, 2024




A third-party app killer
Various users pointed out that by integrating a number of AI features across its native apps, Apple was essentially killing third-party AI-powered apps and services that sought to offer similar functionality prior to the news today and the absence of Apple Intelligence.









Questions about training data
Other users on X, including some visual artists and tech workers opposed to the practices of generative AI model providers training without express consent on vast swaths of artwork and creative work posted to the web, questioned exactly how Apple had trained its underlying Apple Intelligence AI models — the company mentioned both language and diffusion models in its keynote announcement — and on what specific data.






One Apple executive present at WWDC told Axios’s Ina Fried that the models were trained on “data from the public web” combined with licensed, or paid, data.



AI is a feature not a product?
Apple’s choice to weave the Apple Intelligence service throughout its apps also had The Information founder and CEO Jessica Lessin musing that the approach was likely to be seen as influential.



Clearly, a wide range of reactions and they’re still rolling in. What do you think about Apple Intelligence so far?

IBM Study: Banking and Financial Markets CEOs are Betting on Generative AI to Stay Competitive, Yet Workforce and Culture Challenges Persist

By Technology For You -   June 7, 2024 






Share
FacebookLinkedinTwitterWhatsAppPinterestTelegram




Two-thirds (66%) of banking and financial markets CEOs surveyed said that the potential productivity gains from AI and automation are so great that they must accept the risks to stay competitive.
65% of financial institution leaders say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself and 60% recognize they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.
Half (50%) of financial services CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI-related roles that did not exist last year and 53% indicate they are struggling to fill key technology positions.


New findings from the IBM Institute for Business Value revealed that banking and financial markets (BFM) CEOs are facing workforce and culture and challenges as they act quickly to implement and scale generative AI across their organizations.
The findings are part of an annual global cross-industry study that surveyed more than 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries, which included 297 BFM CEOs representing retail, corporate, commercial and investment banks and financial markets.
The survey found that generative AI is perceived as the key to unlocking competitiveness. 57% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that gaining a competitive advantage in the sector will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
The findings also revealed that CEOs are navigating complex issues around culture in the era of AI. 59% of surveyed BFM CEOs stated that cultural change within a business is more important than overcoming technical challenges when becoming a data-driven business, with 65% also believing success with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself.
Despite this, 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some employees might find comfortable. Yet 43% acknowledged that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
Skills also proved to be an area of focus for the CEOs. While 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. In addition, 50% of these CEOs said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist this time last year due to generative AI, showing the rapid shift occurring in the workforce.
“Our research reflects the tremendous pressure CEOs are under to keep their competitive edge. Alongside profitability and productivity, getting the right skills remains a persistent challenge, with CEOs now hiring for roles that did not exist until recently,” said Shanker Ramamurthy, Global Managing Partner Banking & Financial Markets, IBM Consulting. “Workforce needs are shifting rapidly in the financial services sector and CEOs must ensure that upskilling programs are prioritized as an important element of any financial institution’s enterprise strategy for scaling generative AI.”
In addition, 66% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive, with 67% saying they would risk more than their competitor to maintain competitive edge.
However, BFM CEOs recognized that trust cannot be sacrificed for innovation. 64% of surveyed BFM CEOs agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product or service, and 83% acknowledged that transparency around adopting new technologies was critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.
“CEOs in the banking and financial markets sector are keenly aware of the competitive benefits that generative AI will bring and are eager to move quickly,” said John Duigenan, Distinguished Engineer & General Manager, Global Financial Services Industry at IBM. “In their enthusiasm to embrace the benefits of this potent new technology, it’s critical that financial services leaders ensure their institutions are taking steps to engineer trustworthy AI designed to reduce risk and win the confidence of their customers, employees and regulators.”
Key Study Findings
BFM CEOs are hedging their bets on generative AI to stay competitive and are willing to take risks to achieve this.

57% of respondents believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
Two-thirds (66%) of those surveyed agreed that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive and 67% said they would take more risk than their competitors to maintain a competitive advantage.
However, customer trust was not a sacrifice CEOs are willing to make. 64% surveyed agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product, and 83% acknowledged transparency in adopting new technologies is critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.

The workforce is shifting rapidly.

50% of CEOs surveyed said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist last year due to the rise of generative AI.
Yet, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles.
60% of respondents said their current team has the knowledge and skills to incorporate new technologies like AI.
Only 40% of respondents have assessed the potential impact of generative AI on their workforce.
Surveyed CEOs say 34% of their workforce will require retraining and reskilling over the next three years – up from just 7% in 2021.

Financial institution leaders recognize it takes a cultural shift to scale AI successfully but face collaboration and adoption challenges within their organizations.

64% of CEOs surveyed say their organization’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet half (50%) say competition among their C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration.
59% agree that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven business than overcoming technical challenges.
65% of BFM CEOs say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself.
At the same time, 43% acknowledge that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
60% of surveyed CEOs say they push for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.
64% of surveyed BFM CEOs say to win the future, they must rewrite their organizational playbook.
72% plan to maintain or accelerate their organization’s pace of transformational change in
2024.

Productivity is a top priority but focusing on short-term targets may hinder long-term progress.

BFM CEOs ranked tech modernization as their highest priority for the next three years.
Productivity, profitability, and scalability were identified as the biggest challenges facing BFM CEOs over the next three years, with 46% agreeing that generative AI will be one of the most useful tools in helping them overcome these challenges.
However, BFM CEOs identified the focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.

<p>Generative AI is a hotly debated topic these days. It involves computers that collect data from global sources to create text, movies, and images. The core of this discussion is comprised of numerous questions. Can production businesses use it as a means of making cost savings? Is the merchandise genuinely subpar? And, given the debate, why do CEOs appear so intent on using it? Producer Chris Miller recently answered the latter, which has been a major topic of controversy. In particular, he declared that ""Beyond the Spider-Verse"" will not use any generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue came into sharper focus after IndieWire reported on May 30 that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra informed investors of the studio's interest in producing films and television content more efficiently using AI. This statement naturally raised concerns, especially regarding movies like the third installment of the Spider-Verse series. These films are known for their stunning visuals, which are painstakingly crafted. The prospect of Sony using generative AI for the sake of efficiency worried many fans and industry professionals alike. In response to these concerns, Chris Miller made a clear stance on Twitter: ""There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.""</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's essential to recognize that while the Spider-Verse movies have utilized AI programs, they have not employed generative AI. Instead, they have integrated ethical and smart-use machine learning techniques to eliminate repetitive tasks and assist artists in adhering more accurately to 3D geometry. According to effects supervisor Pav Grochola, the team decided to use machine learning to enhance artists' productivity by providing an initial predicted result that would give them a reasonable first pass at creating ink lines on the characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This distinction between ethical machine learning and generative AI is crucial. Machine learning, when used responsibly, can significantly aid artists by speeding up mundane tasks, allowing them to focus more on the creative aspects of their work. In contrast, generative AI often raises ethical concerns because it can undermine the efforts of numerous real humans and relies on the work of others without proper attribution or compensation. This difference is not just technical but ethical, affecting how content is produced and valued in the creative industries.</p>

<p>The concerns surrounding generative AI are not unfounded. Many fear that its use in film and TV could lead to a decline in the quality of content, as the unique touch of human creativity might be lost. Additionally, there are valid worries about the potential for job losses among artists and creators whose work could be replaced by AI-generated content. Despite these issues, some industry leaders see generative AI as a tool for achieving greater efficiency and cost savings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, as Chris Miller and others argue, the true value of films like those in the Spider-Verse series lies in their ability to push the boundaries of visual storytelling and create something genuinely new and original. By relying on generative AI, there is a risk of producing content that feels generic and uninspired, lacking the distinctiveness that human creativity brings. The debate over AI in the creative industries is far from over. Machine learning, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool to help artists achieve their goals more quickly and efficiently. But generative AI, with its potential to devalue human effort and creativity, remains a contentious issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now, it seems that at least some creators, like those behind the Spider-Verse films, are committed to preserving the integrity and uniqueness of their work by steering clear of generative AI. This commitment is evident in the Spider-Verse team's approach to using technology. They leverage AI for repetitive tasks, not for creative ones. This approach helps maintain the human touch in their films, ensuring that each project retains its artistic integrity and originality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The broader industry is watching these developments closely. As AI technology continues to evolve, the line between helpful tools and unethical shortcuts will be scrutinized. The ongoing discussion about AI in film and TV will likely influence other creative sectors as well, from music and literature to graphic design and beyond. The core of the debate is not just about efficiency or cost but about the essence of creativity itself. How do we balance technological advancements with the irreplaceable value of human creativity?</p>

<p>Kyle Anderson, the Senior Editor for Nerdist, and host of the weekly pop culture deep-dive podcast Laser Focus, has weighed in on this debate. Through his reviews and commentary, he highlights the ongoing tension between the technological advancements that can aid production and the need to maintain the human element that makes creative works truly special. This discussion is likely to continue as the industry grapples with finding the right balance between innovation and preserving the artistry that defines great filmmaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the direction AI will take in the creative industries is unclear, the Spider-Verse film series' creators have set the standard. It's an appeal to respect human ingenuity and see technology as an aid rather than a substitute. The industry needs to tread carefully in these waters, making sure that even as we adopt new technologies, we don't lose sight of the fundamental elements that contribute to the human resonance of creative works. The future of all creative expression, including film and television, will be determined by this equilibrium.</p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Employment Discrimination Laws Proposed in Six States: What Employers Need to Know (US)
By Gabrielle Martin on June 11, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, California, Colorado, Discrimination, Hiring, Illinois, State Law Updates, Washington



We recently wrote about Colorado’s historic law aimed at protecting, among others, employees and employment applicants from harm arising out of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Although Colorado is the first state to pass legislation addressing AI-based discrimination, similar bills have been proposed in at least six other states as well as at the federal level, with a recent Executive Order discussing a wide range of issues arising from the private-sector use of AI systems, including discrimination in the employment context. All US employers should take note of this trend and prepare for the possibility of new compliance obligations resulting from employer use of AI systems.
States with proposed legislation addressing algorithmic discrimination

In 2024, legislators in California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, and Washington proposed bills aimed at regulating the use of AI systems to make, or to assist an employer in making, employment decisions. More specifically, these bills seek to mitigate the risk of algorithmic discrimination arising from an employer’s use of an AI system.
 “Algorithmic discrimination” means any condition in which the use of an AI system results in differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual on the basis of protected characteristics (e.g., age, color, ethnicity, disability, national origin, race, religion, veteran status, and sex).
Each of the proposed bills would impose similar obligations onto employers that use an AI system or an automated decision tool (ADT) in making employment-related decisions. ADT means a system that uses AI and has been specifically developed to make, or contribute to making, consequential decisions, including employment decisions.
In general, these proposed bills impose a duty of reasonable care on employers to mitigate and assess the risk of algorithmic discrimination arising from their use of AI systems. There are significant affirmative reporting requirements, including direct notifications to individuals who are the subject of a decision made by an AI system. In some cases, the bills also provide individuals with the chance to correct data input into the AI system and appeal adverse consequential decisions, which may require human review. The specifics of each state’s proposed bill are discussed further below.
California: AB 2930

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 25 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2026.

Georgia: H.B. 890

The bill would (i) expand existing anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination resulting from the use of or reliance upon AI or ADTs, and (ii) preclude employers from relying upon the use of AI or ADTs as a defense to an allegation of discrimination.
The proposed bill does not provide an effective date.

Hawaii: H.B. 1607

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
The proposed bill does not provide an effective date.

Illinois: H.B. 5322

The Illinois Commercial Algorithmic Impact Assessments Act would require annual impact assessments by employers that use AI systems.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2026.

Washington: H.B. 1951

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2025.

In California and Washington, legislation aimed at addressing algorithmic discrimination previously failed in 2023. However, in both states, the currently-proposed bills now carry the support of several large, influential technology-based employers.
What federal regulations addressing algorithmic discrimination could contain

No federal legislation addressing AI-based discrimination in employment has been proposed at this time. That said, however, the President’s recent Executive Order indicates that issues arising from the use of AI systems also are being considered at the federal level. When Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (“CAIA”) into law, he expressed his opinion that “the important work of protecting consumers from discrimination” arising from the use of AI systems “is better considered and applied by the federal government[.]”[1] Governor Polis also suggested that there is a chance that the federal government preempts CAIA “with a needed cohesive federal approach.”[2]
In his Executive Order, President Biden directs the federal government to “enforce existing consumer protection laws and principles and enact appropriate safeguards against…unintended bias, discrimination…and other harms from AI.” In addition, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division was required to meet with the head of the federal government’s civil rights office to discuss comprehensive use of their respective authorities to prevent and address algorithmic discrimination in the use of AI systems.
Should the federal government pass regulations on employers’ use of AI systems, the requirements will likely mirror legislation addressing the same issue at a state level. Thus, federal regulation could impose on employers affirmative reporting requirements related to the use of an AI system and a duty of reasonable care to mitigate the risk of algorithmic discrimination when using AI systems to make employment decisions.
What all US employers need to know

Although state legislatures and the federal government only recently began to tackle issues arising from the use of AI, including by employers to make employment related decisions, the sheer number of proposals addressing the issue suggests that the trend towards regulation of AI systems will continue moving forward and moving fast. Beyond the scope of this blog, legislators across the nation have also proposed various bills addressing other issues arising from the use of AI, such as pornographic deepfakes and the use of AI chat bots.
Colorado still is the only US jurisdiction that currently regulates an employer’s use of AI systems. However, employers outside of Colorado should take note of how regulation at the federal level and at the state level could impact their use of an AI system or ADTs.
Our team will continue to monitor these and other state employment law developments. If you have questions or need guidance on your use of an AI system, please contact your Squire Patton Boggs lawyer.

Unlike “traditional” AI that relies on predetermined rules and patterns, generative AI is able to produce novel content – like text, video, images, and music. In a way, unlike old AI, generative AI can think outside the box. Its implications are profound and sprawling, with the potential to reshape virtually every branch of society. 
Conversations about AI often turn on whether it will be a net positive or negative for society, but our new research as part of an international team suggests that acknowledging AI’s apparent paradoxes can help us develop a clearer picture about its risks and potential benefits. We focused on four major areas of society: information, work, education and healthcare.
Work
Digital technologies have a history of skewed benefits. More educated workers benefit while less-educated workers are displaced through automation – a trend known as “skill-biased technological change”. By contrast, generative AI promises to enhance rather than replace human capabilities, potentially reversing this adverse trend. Studies have shown that AI tools like chat assistants and programming aids can significantly boost productivity and job satisfaction, especially for less-skilled workers.
Nonetheless, uneven access to AI technologies could worsen existing inequalities as those lacking necessary digital infrastructure or skills get left behind. For example, generative AI is unlikely to have much direct impact on the global south in the near future, due to insufficient investment in the prerequisite digital infrastructure and skills. 
School
Generative AI can enhance personal support and adaptability in learning. Chatbot tutors, for instance, are set to transform educational settings by providing real-time, personalised instruction and support. This technology can realise the dream of dynamic, skill-adaptive teaching methods that directly respond to student needs without constant teacher intervention.

Yet, it must be carefully implemented to avoid perpetuating or introducing biases, not only in terms of the information that is fed into AIs but also how they are used. For instance, a study revealed that female students report using ChatGPT less frequently than their male counterparts. This disparity in technology usage could not only have immediate effects on academic achievement, but also contribute to a future gender gap in the workforce.
Healthcare
Generative AI could help doctors make better choices. But it could also drive them to make worse ones. 
Generative AI could augment human capacities in the practice of medicine by guiding practitioners during diagnosis, screening, prognosis and triaging. It could reduce workloads, thereby making medical care more accessible and affordable. One study found that the integration of human and AI judgment led to superior performance compared to either alone, showing just how well humans and AI can work together.
That said, the diagnostic performance of some expert physicians may not be improved by AI. Another study focusing on radiology found that AI can in fact cause incorrect diagnoses in situations that otherwise would have been correctly assessed. This highlights the need for balanced integration that supplements rather than replaces humans.
Disinformation
Will generative AI exacerbate the spread of misinformation or reduce it? Generative AI promises personalised online content, potentially enhancing and customising a user experience. It can also broaden access to content – for instance, via instant language translations or by making it easier for people with disabilities to access content.
However, it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for “surveillance capitalism”. AI may collect massive amounts of personal data that can then be exploited for corporate gain, including by leveraging people’s biases or vulnerabilities.
We’re already seeing the spread of misinformation through advanced and personalised “deepfakes”, and we may soon see AI being used to micro-target voters with persuasive fake content that could significantly affect elections.
Yet, there is also hope that AI can help with these problems. One study found that entering into a dialogue with generative AI significantly reduces conspiracy beliefs among conspiracy believers. The AI appears to be able to answer conspiracy believers’ complex questions about potential conspiracies in a way that no human can.
How should governments respond?
When we looked at how the EU, UK and US were attempting to build regulatory frameworks around these issues, our main observation was that they are falling into the trap of overlooking the potential for AI to aggravate socioeconomic inequalities. 
Policy-making should balance AI innovation with social equity and consumer protection. Future regulatory improvements should include equitable tax structures, empowering workers, controlling consumer information, supporting human-complementary AI research, and implementing robust measures against AI-generated misinformation. 
We find ourselves at a critical historical crossroads, where today’s decisions will have global consequences for generations to come. It’s an exciting yet daunting moment to be alive, charged with heavy responsibilities. Each of us plays a crucial role as architects of the future. We can all contribute to driving the course towards the positive use of what could be humanity’s greatest innovation, or its worst.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Learning Management Systems (LMS) marks a significant shift towards more personalised and efficient workplace learning. This trend holds the potential to reshape employee training and revolutionise how learners interact with their learning materials. By leveraging AI, training becomes more accessible and adaptable to individual needs.
 
Introduction to AI in Learning Management Systems
 
At its core, AI in LMS uses machine learning and natural language processing to automate and enhance various aspects of the learning process. From creating personalised learning paths to providing actionable insights into learner performance, AI is setting a new standard for what technology can achieve in workplace learning. 
Using an AI-powered learning platform, L&D teams can gain a deeper understanding of learning outcomes, provide real-time feedback, and even predict potential learning roadblocks. This not only improves the overall learning experience but also helps ensure that no learner gets left behind.
 
Personalised Learning Paths
 
One of the most significant advantages of AI integration is the ability to create personalised learning experiences. AI algorithms analyse a learner’s performance, preferences, and learning pace to tailor the course content accordingly. This means that each learner can have a unique learning path that adapts to their strengths and addresses their weaknesses, making learning more effective and enjoyable.
 
Automated Administrative Tasks
 
AI also streamlines administrative duties, such as grading assignments and managing schedules, freeing educators to focus more on training and less on paperwork. This automation not only reduces the workload for L&D teams but also minimises human error, ensuring a smoother operation of learning programmes.

Data-Driven Insights for Performance Improvement
 
AI-powered LMS platforms can collect and analyse vast amounts of data on learner engagement, performance, and feedback. These insights allow trainers to adjust their materials, provide targeted support to learners who may be struggling, and ensure that all employees can achieve their full potential.
 
Benefits of AI in Learning Environments
 
Increased Engagement and Interaction
 
With AI, learning becomes more interactive and engaging. Through gamified learning, virtual simulations, and interactive content, learners are more likely to stay motivated and invested in their skills improvement journey.
 
Training Scalability
 
As businesses grow, AI enables organisations to scale their workplace training without compromising the quality of learning. Whether it’s adding more learners to a course or providing a wide range of courses tailored to different skill levels and interests, AI makes it possible by efficiently managing and analysing large volumes of learner data and feedback.
 
Enhanced Accessibility for Diverse Learners
 
AI-powered LMSs also promote inclusivity by providing learning solutions that cater to a wide range of learning abilities. From text-to-speech functions for visually impaired learners to language translation services for non-native speakers, training professionals ensure that courses are accessible to everyone.
 
Challenges and Ethical Considerations
 
While the benefits are numerous, integrating AI into LMS is not without its challenges. Data privacy and security are major concerns, as businesses must safeguard sensitive learner information. Additionally, maintaining the human element in training is crucial. While AI can enhance the learning experience, it cannot replace the empathy, intuition, and personal touch that human instructors bring to the learning process.
By personalising the learning experience, automating administrative tasks, and providing data-driven insights, AI has the potential to make workplace learning more effective, engaging, and inclusive. However, it’s essential to approach this integration with a mindful consideration of its challenges and ethical implications.

Crafting the Future: The Center for Sustainable Development Leads Global AI Initiative to Empower Local and Global Talent, and Build Tomorrow’s AI-Enhanced Workforce.













Overview/Summary
In the next decade, the landscape of various professions is expected to undergo radical transformation due to the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, a new collaboration between Columbia University and Future Investment Initiative Institute was formed to bring together key stakeholders, spanning the private, public sectors, government, civil society and educational institutions. The Collaboration’s goal is to envision the evolution of each profession by 2050, considering the current and anticipated capabilities of AI. Several Task Forces have been created to look into specific key topics, such as Education, Health or Ethics. Through the work of these Task Forces, the project will develop tailored curricula for universities (starting with Columbia University), ensuring that students today are equipped with skills relevant to the evolving job market. The emphasis is on preventing the emergence of workers in 2024/2025 who could become obsolete by 2030, necessitating significant retraining. 
The FII PRIORITY Compass finds that 40% of the world’s population perceive Generative AI as a threat to society with strong potential for job destruction, and that less than half of the Global North feels prepared for the digital age. One key component of this project is to use the network of Columbia Global Centers to work with LMIC universities to work towards preventing a divide between High Incomes Countries (HICs) and Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs). In January 2024, the IMF reported that 40% of jobs in emerging markets could experience a negative impact from AI because of a digital divide (between the Global North and Global South) brought about by AI, and our initiative will aim to prevent this.
Objectives of the Initiative
As AI has become the fastest growing topic of interest since 2023, several groups worldwide are interested in the impact of AI on the Future of Work.
The partnership between FII Institute and Columbia University has the following objectives:
Identify Potential Impacts: Members of the Initiative have created several Task Forces and will discuss and identify the potential impacts of AI on various aspects of the Future of Work, including skill shifts, poverty and inequalities, impact on Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs) among many others. The Initiative will aim to understand the opportunities and challenges that AI presents for different stakeholders, and the critical role played by a university such as Columbia.
	 
Share Knowledge and Insights: The Initiative will facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange of insights among stakeholders from all regions of the world about current trends, research findings, and best practices related to AI and the Future of Work.
	 
Discuss Policy and Regulatory Considerations: Engage stakeholders, in the various specific Task Forces, in a discussion about the policy and regulatory considerations necessary to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks and challenges.
	 
Foster Collaboration and Partnerships: The Initiative, which benefits from the expertise of colleagues and collaborators from every continent, will foster collaboration and partnerships among stakeholders to address common goals and challenges related to AI and the Future of Work. Through the Task Force and general meetings, the Initiative will encourage dialogue and networking opportunities to facilitate the exchange of ideas, resources, and opportunities for collaboration on research projects, pilot initiatives, and policy advocacy efforts.
Task Forces
Macroeconomics, Poverty and inequity: Delve into the macroeconomic implications of AI adoption and its effects on workforce development strategies. Explore innovative approaches to tackle challenges and capitalize on opportunities presented by AI in the swiftly evolving job market.
	 
Application of AI in Healthcare: Explore cutting-edge applications of AI in healthcare, elucidating how AI technologies are transforming patient care, medical research and opportunities for healthcare workers and patients in Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs)
	 
Application of AI in Education: With the opportunity to provide personalized learning experiences and improve teachers and professors’ pedagogy, applications of AI in Education could revolutionize the field. But are there redlines to define when it comes to how and what AI will teach to our children?
	 
Ethics: Explore all the ethical questions, opportunities and challenges raised by the integration of Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Work, society and Research, ensuring that tools developed are for the benefit of mankind and the planet.
	 
A fifth Task Force will convene all members from EDMEs from the other Task Forces to strategically think about linkages with their countries and universities.
AI and Future of Work in EDMEs: Create an environment of dialogue and exchange with universities in Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs), and strategize on effective dissemination of information concerning AI and the Future of Work in LMICs, ensuring equitable access to knowledge and opportunities for all.

92% of knowledge workers in Indonesia already use generative AI at work, surpassing global (75%) and Asia Pacific (83%) averages. 


92% of Indonesian business leaders stress the importance of AI adoption to stay competitive, yet 48% worry their organizational leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement it. 


Leaders must channel AI experimentation into business transformation. 

Jakarta, 11 June 2024 – Today, Microsoft and LinkedIn released data specific to Indonesia from the global 2024 Work Trend Index, focusing on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. The findings reveal a high percentage of knowledge workers in Indonesia using generative AI and a strong belief among business leaders in the necessity of AI adoption for maintaining competitiveness, both surpassing regional and global figures. This underscores Indonesia’s enthusiasm for leveraging AI to drive business impact and suggests the potential emergence of a new, AI-driven workplace culture in the country. 
“We are in an era where AI is transforming our ability to create and innovate at an unprecedented pace. Indonesia’s swift adaptation and growth in this era signal that we are on the right path to realizing our digital economic potential and creating greater positive impacts for society at large. The key now is to channel this enthusiasm into tangible AI business transformations by doing three things: identifying business problems and integrating AI into solutions, adopting a top-down and bottom-up approach, and prioritizing AI skills training for everyone,” said Dharma Simorangkir, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia.

This report, titled “AI at Work is Here. Now Comes the Hard Part,” is based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, including Indonesia, labor and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and research with Fortune 500 customers. 
In tandem with the report, Microsoft announced new capabilities in Copilot for Microsoft 365, while LinkedIn introduced over 50 free learning courses for LinkedIn Premium members to empower professionals at all levels to enhance their AI skills. 
“As AI brings transformative changes to the workplace, companies need new guidelines for recruiting talent,” said Rohit Kalsy, Indonesia Country Lead, LinkedIn. “With the rapidly evolving workforce ecosystem, leaders who prioritize flexibility and invest in developing AI-ready skills will gain a competitive edge. In Indonesia, 69% of business leaders say they won’t hire someone without AI skills. This highlights the urgency for professionals to focus on AI skill enhancement through training. Meanwhile, data also reveals a 65% increase in number of learning hours to study top 100 AI/generative AI courses between 2022 – 2023 on LinkedIn Learning. The participant record for those joining top LinkedIn courses on AI since January 2023 are held by Southeast Asia, Australia, and India.

The 2024 Work Trend Index highlights three key insights for leaders and professionals in Indonesia about AI’s impact on work and the labor market in the year ahead: 
Employees want AI at work – and won’t wait for companies to catch up 

As many as 92% of knowledge workers in Indonesia are already using generative AI at work. This figure is higher than the global (75%) and Asia Pacific (83%) average. 


Around 92% of leaders in Indonesia believe in the need to adopt AI to stay competitive, higher than the global (79%) and Asia Pacific (84%) averages. However, 48% worry that their organization’s leadership lacks a vision and plan for implementing AI within the company, lower than the global (60%) and Asia Pacific (61%) averages. 


As a result, 76% of employees in Indonesia are bringing their own AI tools or solutions to work (Bring Your Own AI/BYOAI)- missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale and putting company data at risk. Therefore, the task for company leaders in the near future is to consider how to implement AI on a large scale in the company while maximizing return on investment (ROI).

For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling 

As many as 69% of leaders in Indonesia say they will not hire someone without AI skills. Additionally, 76% of leaders say they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. 


Learning from global data, many professionals are taking the initiative to skill up on their own. There has been a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude. 


AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth. Hence, the impact of AI is undeniable: organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, while professionals who skill up will have the edge. 

The rise of the AI Power Users – and what they reveal about the future of work 

Four types of AI users emerged in this research — from skeptics who rarely use AI, to novices and explorers who are somewhat familiar with and frequently use AI, to power users who use it extensively. 


AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways: 93% of power users in Indonesia use it to start their workday and 94% use it to prepare for the next day (higher than the global average of 85% and Asia Pacific at 88%). 


As many as 73% of power users in Indonesia are also more inclined to experiment with AI, higher than the global average (68%) and Asia Pacific (51%). 

In Indonesia, various organizations across scales and industries have integrated generative AI tools like Copilot for Microsoft 365 into their daily workflows to boost productivity. These include Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson (Indosat or IOH). Copilot for Microsoft 365 has become part of the productivity enhancements for Indosat employees in managing their work. The integration of Copilot for Microsoft 365 capabilities has been carried out across various functions at Indosat, from digital, Human Resource, Business-to-Business, to Network. This is a testatement to Indosat’s commitment to transforming from a telecommunications company to an AI Native TechCo and revolutionizing the digital landscape in Indonesia. 
Enriching Work Experience with New Features in Copilot for Microsoft 365 
Understanding the benefits of generative AI in the workplace, Microsoft also announced innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 to help people create more with AI: 

A new auto-complete feature is coming to the prompt box. Copilot will now help people who have the start of a prompt by offering to complete it, suggesting a more a detailed prompt based on what is being typed, to deliver a stronger result. 


A new rewrite feature in Copilot will help users who know what they want but may not have the right words to describe it, transforming basic prompts into richer ones with the click of a button. 


Catch Up is a new chat interface that surfaces personal insights based on recent activities and provides responsive recommendations. 


New capabilities in Copilot Lab will enable people to create, publish, and manage prompts tailored to them, and to their specific teams, roles, and functions.

More than four in 10 workers in a massive, global survey said they’re threatened by the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in their workplace.
Responses to an ADP survey from nearly 35,000 workers in 18 countries explored new challenges and technologies reshaping the labor market. Among the top concerns:  AI, with 42% citing it as a job threat.
Data and an evaluation of the results by ADP focused on how workers’ priorities, expectations and feelings have shifted, including their sense of job security and how the implementation of AI in the workplace impacts that shift. The details are included in ADP’s recently released “People At Work 2024: A Global Workforce View” annual report.
 
 
 













 
 

Eighty-five percent of workers believe AI will impact their job in the next two to three years, ADP’s survey found. Among workers who say AI will help them every day, 70% say they have the skills they need to advance their career to the next level within three years. Of those who say AI will replace most of their existing functions, only 45% think they have the skills they need.

Workers in some ways have remained constant in their priorities; they still put great value on financial compensation and job security, for example. In other ways, however, they feel under siege from technology, stress, and changing workplace norms.  ADP’s report this year focused on a “Great Transition” from a “troubled, pandemic-driven economy to a post-pandemic world.”
Overall, people feel better about their job security than they did a year ago, but they’re now worried by the increasing presence of AI.
 
 
 













 
 

The survey results are backed by financial services market predictions that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. According to a 2023 report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, two-thirds of all jobs could be partially automated by AI. “If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,” Goldman reported. “And… generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.”
In the US, office and administrative support jobs face the highest risks, with 46% of those jobs facing automation by AI, according to Goldman Sachs. That figure is 44% for legal work and 37% for tasks within architecture and engineering.
“The good news is that worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth,” Goldman Sachs noted. “The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that raises economic growth substantially, although the timing of such a boom is hard to predict.”
 
 
 













 
 

Goldman Sachs
Goldman’s report suggested genAI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by just under 1.5% over a 10-year period after widespread adoption, although the boost could be much smaller or larger depending on the difficulty level of tasks AI will be able to perform and how many jobs are automated.
Of the ADP survey respondents, 17% said AI has the power to make their work easier and were less likely to feel insecure about losing their jobs. And 43% think having AI on the job will be a good thing. 
While most (60%) agree they have the skills needed to advance their career in the next three years, less than half (47%) feel their employer invests in the skills they need to grow professionally. As workers grow less confident in their employers’ willingness or ability to invest in them, however, they grow more concerned about AI muscling in on their jobs. Workers who most fear AI have the least confidence (45%) that they have the skills they’ll need.
 
 
 













 
 

A widening IT skills shortage is dogging organizations in all industries and across all regions, IDC research shows. But far from eliminating most jobs, AI is expected to boost the productivity of the existing workforce and help to create new roles.
IDC
“For all the concern about job loss…, many AI-based changes to work have led to new job opportunities, including enabling workers to focus on more engaging and innovative tasks,” IDC’ said. “AI use cases are creating new opportunities for content creation, education, entertainment, and content generation, provoking a shift in thinking about the role of AI on jobs and roles.
IDC data indicates that 32% of business and IT leaders now expect advancing AI constructs such as genAI to save time and improve productivity. For example, genAI tools support greater access to diverse knowledge resources by enabling employees to conversationally access them using natural language queries.
 
 
 













 
 

“GenAI and skills are increasingly tightly related: Organizations spanning all industries and geographies face a widening shortage of all IT tech skills, regardless of those skills relating to security, cloud, IT service management, or AI itself,” IDC said. “GenAI tools used in conjunction with or inside of tech training platforms can and do accelerate training.”
Nearly two-thirds (62%) of about 1,100 IT leaders surveyed earlier this year told IDC that a lack of skills has resulted in missed revenue growth objectives — and more than 60% say it has led to quality problems and a loss of customer satisfaction. IDC predicts that by 2026, more than 90% of organizations worldwide will feel similar pain, amounting to some $5.5 trillion in losses caused by product delays, impaired competitiveness, and loss of business.
“There is no escaping it: The time to plan for AI skills and roles is now. …The question is not whether enterprises must skill up employees for the age of AI, but when and how they will do it,” IDC wrote in its report.
 
 
 













 
 

At the same time, many organizations are still asking whether the rapidly evolving technology will profoundly change jobs and skills development at a fundamental level. “Automation has long impacted human activities, most notably during the industrial era when machines rapidly replaced the manual work of humans,” IDC said.
The impact of AI and genAI varies by profession and industry, with creative and engagement-based skill sets and work being affected first. Marketers, customer support teams, web designers, professional services groups, healthcare roles, and many other positions are already seeing changes in their work practices from AI.
The same IDC data shows that 29% of business and IT leaders expect AI and genAI to enable faster decision timing for back-office centers of leadership like HR, operations, and finance. As compared to two years ago, businesses are changing their narratives around AI enablement to see what it can do for the business and its workforce rather than worrying about what uncontrollable challenges it could pose.

Abstract

Objectives – To understand how many undergraduate and graduate students use generative AI as part of their academic work, how often they use it, and for what tasks they use it. We also sought to identify how trustworthy students find generative AI and how they would feel about a locally maintained generative AI tool. Finally, we explored student interest in trainings related to using generative AI in academic work.  This survey will help librarians better understand the rate at which generative AI is being adopted by university students and the need for librarians to incorporate generative AI into their work.
Methods – A team of three library staff members and one student intern created, executed, and analyzed a survey of 360 undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard University. The survey was distributed via email lists and at cafes and libraries throughout campus. Data were collected and analyzed using Qualtrics.
Results – We found that nearly 65% of respondents have used or plan to use generative AI chatbots for academic work, even though most respondents (65%) do not find their outputs trustworthy enough for academic work. The findings show that students actively use these tools but desire guidance around effectively using them.
Conclusion – This research shows students are engaging with generative AI for academic work but do not fully trust the information that it produces. Librarians must be at the forefront of understanding the significant impact this technology will have on information-seeking behaviors and research habits. To effectively support students, librarians must know how to use these tools to advise students on how to critically evaluate AI output and effectively incorporate it into their research.

This fresh area pledges to upheave the way we associate ourselves with technology thus resulting in people being equipped with all types of work whose existence has not been identified. .At this point where technology picking and job consuming is at a critical point, it is mandatory for us to investigate forthcoming jobs for generations..This article probes into the impact of the AI workforce and its impact on job markets. This comprises the skills required for future employment and the stages individuals and teams can look to align with this digital development..AI Job Automation.Automation through artificial intelligence is now becoming a new frontier of employment. It promises an unprecedented revolution in how we deal with technology, the facts necessary for a world that does not exist yet, and the ways of preparing for AI future jobs that do not exist. .At present, we stand in front of an important crossroads in technology alphabetization and AI job automation. Thus, there is no doubt that an attempt should be made to splice the kinds of careers that will be available to all individuals in society in the future.. What does this all point to in the life of the common citizen? What changes and solutions can you employ today that will prepare your children for a world where they may never find a conventional job? What steps or measures can be taken to develop your personal or team competence in such a way that can align with this age of digital evolution? Before getting into the questions, they are all important to know. .Hence, let’s explore how artificial intelligence is shifting society and how one might better position oneself for success, much less survival, in the economy of tomorrow..The New Generation of AI Workforce is constantly increasing pressure for efficiency and productivity at the workplace. This means companies are increasingly leaning towards using artificial intelligence in order to handle jobs that used to be done by people. For instance, in relation to Watson by IBM, this is a machine that can be employed to perform functions like data processing or providing solutions. .Even with the drastic release of 900 customer support job positions over at Discovery Communications, this was made possible through the capabilities of Watson in daily operations..Today, it’s clear that advanced AI technology is going to revolutionize our existence in ways that were absolutely unthinkable only a few decades ago. According to the forecasters, AI will cause major changes in our technological application, the importance of different skills in the future, and proper approaches to the preparation of jobs with no idea conceived at the time. .If these predictions are accurate, then we are at a crossroads in humanity where the majority of the workforce will be replaced by these intelligent and enhancing robots, i.e., the AI workforce. This also means that professionals in these areas should begin weighing what kind of work they might find in the coming years..The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence and Transition of Employment.AI is a buzzword that has brought significant changes to our workplace. Talking about the increasing proportion of positions that can be robotized, it might be interesting to turn to the tendencies of employment and new professions' appearance. .Which implication does this bear for you? How do you prepare them to take a course that will have little hope in the traditional labor market upon its completion? Also, how can you build better or grow the team to be ready for this shift happening in the digital age?.These are, of course, questions worthy of consideration. Here is how artificial intelligence is going to change our lives, and it wants to provide some insights on how one can prepare not just for a job but for more value in the economy of the future..We are now at an interesting moment in the evolution of the human race – that the main activities of human labor are mechanized. Artificial intelligence can be defined as an emerging technology system that is capable of influencing the way we lead our lives, the nature of the jobs we do, and how human beings interact with machines. .AI is one of the most formidable issues in the modern world. It could change the way we perceive technological advancement, delineate employment skill gaps, and define the overall AI workforce prospects. This means understanding the ways companies are going to continue to change the manner in which they work.This post is the first one in the given series, and it will be devoted to how AI will influence the economy. Scholars and the general public often think that AI entails job loss rather than creating new opportunities. However, there are many such roles in many different areas that do not exist because no one has yet created them. These positions can be created by information technology, automation, and artificial intelligence in the future.For example, CognitionX deals with cognitive computing for export tax preparation firms, including Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, which manages over 4 million tax returns yearly. This service helps Jackson Hewitt employees to stay focused on the more important work, such as data analysis, audit appraisal, audacity on legislative amendments, and offering relevant recommendations on the new laws..It also has the capacity to produce more jobs than harm by releasing human work from repetitive chores, which means people can work on higher levels of productivity, like decision-making. .That is why AI is estimated to increase productivity while at the same time creating new occupations where people will work with these machines rather than being replaced by them if only we have the right to reconstruct human capital. .Thus, AI is expected to enhance efficiency but also open new positions where humans will manage these technologies rather than become replaced by them if only we have the necessary skill set..New employment opportunities.Since the subject of discussion is artificial intelligence, there will likely be a drastic change in the requisite AI skills in the job market. This change is brought by the fact that AI tends to give many employees new roles or tasks that do not exist in the previous organizational structure. .To illustrate the above, it is still unattainable to train the newly developed artificial intelligence to negotiate on your behalf or to be a practicing physician. Thus, the so-called employment opportunities mentioned above may well be displaced by robots. However, with it, there would be a newly created employment increase as well..Which careers are secure?.Artificial intelligence is growing. As it becomes more pervasive and developed by artificial intelligence, the question is: What careers are safe? The truth is that all professions may not be left out of the AI ravage. .However, there are some careers that offer some form of security. You probably won’t end up jobless if your occupation is not easy to computerize. Careers requiring decision-making capabilities, creativity, and emotional intelligence will still be there amidst the increased presence of AI up to a certain extent..For example, consider a creative writer working for a company. Even though there is some experimental software is already in existence, they can still maintain their positions as writers since writing has not been entirely automated. Similarly, pharmacists and doctors are professions that demand emotional intelligence, implying that they will be able to retain their jobs more easily than others..Conclusion.In conclusion, Artificial intelligence is set to change the roles played in jobs and give them new meaning. While some traditional roles may be done by machines, this also comes with chances of doing more work and different jobs. .People wanting to succeed must equip themselves with the qualifications required for such an eventuality by gaining relevant skills and accepting new technologies. We can guarantee a successful shift to tomorrow's AI-driven economy by starting to work today, where cooperation with smart devices would be common and not rare..FAQs.1. What skills are essential for the AI-driven future job market?.Understanding AI basics, data literacy, and adaptability are key skills for future jobs..2. &nbsp;How can educational institutions prepare students for future AI jobs?.Incorporating AI and technology-focused curriculums can help students with relevant skills..3. &nbsp;What are the ethical considerations of AI in the workforce?.Addressing bias, privacy, and job displacement are crucial ethical aspects to consider..4.

N.C. PSI Platform Director for Resilient Agriculture Chris Reberg-Horton and Esleyther Henriquez, field team leader for NC State's precision sustainable agriculture lab, with BenchBot 3.0, which will take hundreds of thousands of plant photos for what will be the world's largest agricultural image repository.



At NC State University, the N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative is leading efforts aimed at helping producers put artificial intelligence to work for increased yields, efficiency and sustainability.
Two new tools will propel its work in AI for agriculture forward: A robot named BenchBot 3.0 has taken its place on an empty field adjacent to the Plant Sciences Building on NC State’s Centennial Campus. It’s just one of the data-gathering devices that will be tied into the power of N.C. PSI’s newly acquired supercomputer, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200, to create AI for agricultural applications.
One of the Grace Hopper’s first tasks will be to begin making sense of the half million plant photos that BenchBot will take as it passes repeatedly over 500 pots of different plant species.
The Grace Hopper … gives us the capability to train even larger-scale models to become more accurate and more predictive in nature and come up with solutions to more complicated challenges.
Those photos, along with ones taken by earlier versions of the BenchBot, will help feed what N.C. PSI Platform Director for Resilient Agriculture Chris Reberg-Horton says will be the world’s largest open-source agricultural image repository.
Reberg-Horton and his colleagues in the Precision Sustainable Agriculture network will use the collected photos to develop software and tools that can help farmers make all kinds of decisions about their crops: when and where to harvest, spray for weeds or insects, fertilize and more.
Getting from photos to those applications will take powerful AI, and the NVIDIA Grace Hopper, with its ability to handle five terabytes of data per second, is just the right tool, says Jevon Smith, N.C. PSI’s research computing manager.
The most powerful computer of its kind on NC State’s campus, the machine enables teams working on interdisciplinary plant sciences research to take on large datasets, like the image repository, to make more complex models and come up with solutions faster than ever.
Step One: Telling Apples From Oranges
Getting computers to recognize plants, weeds and other stressors is the first step toward getting machines to detect problems or map performance, says Reberg-Horton, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation/W.K. Kellogg Distinguished Professor in Sustainable Community-Based Food Systems in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences.
He likens what he and his colleagues are doing to build the image repository and create grower decision tools to what car companies have done to make self-driving cars a reality.
In a lot of economic sectors, we have literally millions of images labeled so that we can train computers on tasks like driving around a city. We don’t have that in agriculture.
“If you’ve got a company that is trying out some new technology for self-driving cars, the first thing they have got to do is to train computers to understand and recognize the things a car sees, and so if you’ve ever done the CAPTCHA stuff — identify the bicycles, identify the pedestrians — you’re basically helping train AI because you’re labeling images so that computers can learn to recognize, ‘That’s a person. Don’t hit the gas now,’” he says.
And it’s not just self-driving cars that use such image-based AI.
“In a lot of economic sectors, we have literally millions of images labeled so that we can train computers on tasks like driving around a city,” he says. “We don’t have that in agriculture.”
Mark Funderburk, a hardware design engineer in the precision sustainable agriculture lab, guided efforts to build the BenchBot’s hardware.
The agricultural image repository is designed to help technology developers fill that gap. Ag technology companies large and small will have access, as will anyone who uses the internet.
Already, with earlier versions of the BenchBot, Reberg-Horton says the team “has tackled about 30 of the most common weed species in North America. For cash crops, we have imaged corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat, rye, barley and oats.”
“In theory we can do about 1,000 plant pots per day, but we will test logistics slowly before going that big,” Reberg-Horton adds. “This summer will be just weeds. From October to March, we will image winter cover crop species.”
Meanwhile, two other BenchBots are being deployed to add images from different locations. One is at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, while a  third will be deployed soon at College Station, home of Texas A&M University.
Achieving Precision Agriculture’s Promises
The images the BenchBots collect will help overcome a bottleneck in fully realizing the concept of precision farming, Reberg-Horton notes.
In precision farming, producers deliver exactly what a plant needs, precisely when and where and in what amounts it’s needed. For example, rather than spraying an entire field for insects, which would be expensive, they could spray just the areas where they are a problem. That would protect crops, limit chemical use and safeguard the environment from excess application.
Applications in the agriculture sector include increasing yields, reducing waste, helping reduce carbon emissions, and more.
Thanks to information technology, the concept of precision farming, forged in the 1980s, has taken off since the 2000s.
Smith says that while AI has become controversial, its rapid development is pushing precision farming technology ahead faster than ever.
“You can’t turn on the TV without hearing two letters — AI,” Smith says. “There are so many bad stories about AI out there, but the applications in the agriculture sector include increasing yields, reducing waste, helping reduce carbon emissions, and more. It can be used for great good.”
And it already is.
There are self-driving tractors and combines, and some are equipped with variable rate equipment that can sense where to apply chemicals and where to plant seeds — and do those tasks. Artificial intelligence is also used in farming for water management, crop rotation, harvest timing, optimal planting and more.
“We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades,” Reberg-Horton says. “It’s really been aspirational for the most part because we have to have lots of knowledge about a field to be able to manage each piece of the field optimally. The smart equipment is available now to apply most of our inputs variably. But we have been stuck on creating enough intelligence to tell that equipment what to do.
“Computer vision is the technology that can do it, and we will start seeing cameras on all of our agricultural machinery.”
What’s Happening With AI at the N.C. PSI
The N.C. PSI has made significant headway in applying AI in agriculture. For example, to allow growers to know precisely when to plant soybeans and how to manage soybeans in counties across the state, Rachel Vann — has worked alongside computer engineering experts to lead a team developing an AI-powered web application that will be released this fall. Vann is an NC State Extension soybean specialist, assistant professor in the Department of crop and Soil Sciences and N.C. PSI platform director for extension outreach and engagement.
Her colleague, Cranos Williams — N.C. PSI’s platform director for data analytics and Goodnight Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Analytics in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering — is among the leaders of N.C. PSI’s Sweet-APPS team. The team is working to reduce labor in the post-harvest handling of sweetpotatoes by helping producers use sensors and machines to sort and grade the vegetables by size, shape and other characteristics.
And to increase soybean resilience to climate change, N.C. PSI’s Ross Sozzani, professor in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and platform director for plant improvement, is working with U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist Anna Locke, as well as colleagues at the VIB, a life sciences institute in Belgium. The team is marrying machine learning, crop physiology and phosphoproteomics to evaluate the plant’s temperature stress regulators and develop a test to rapidly screen soybean genetics for temperature tolerance. The data they generate will allow the breeders to identify temperature-tolerant soybean varieties more efficiently.
More Tools From Reberg-Horton
Meanwhile, crop scientist Reberg-Horton is making progress with several AI-powered tools, some that rely on images in the repository he’s helping build. One tool uses cameras and AI-trained software to allow growers to map where they have herbicide-resistant weeds, such as the notoriously noxious palmer amaranth.
He calls the weed “sticky” because it tends to come back to the same area where it’s grown the previous year. Having a map of where palmer amaranth grew one year would help the farmer know where to use pesticides or rotate crops in the following year.
“It may sound trivial, but you’ve got to remember that the farmers that I deal with — big row crop farmers — might have 5,000 acres spread over multiple counties,” he says. “Given the growth that’s occurred in the size of farms, thinking they know where everything is at and where the bad spots are is just not true anymore.”
We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades. … The AI revolution has been a missing piece.
Another tool Reberg-Horton’s working on is designed for those who grow cover crops, which are planted in the off-season on land where cash crops are grown. They help manage soil quality, fertility, erosion and pests such as weeds and insects. Because cover crops have environmental benefits, the federal government offers incentives for planting them.
“Increasingly the Natural Resources Conservation Service is encouraging mixtures of species. So you might have a legume and a grass in a mix. Sometimes we even see complicated mixes where you might have five or six species,” he says.
“Applying the right amount of the fertilizer nitrogen onto crops like corn is already tricky because soils are not uniform across a field,” he explains. “Cover crop mixtures can amplify that variation because legumes in the mix will supply nitrogen to the corn, while other cover crops in the mix will not. We have to map the growth of each species to account for that. In essence, we are asking AI to recognize plant species.”
Using that information to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer saves money for farmers and reduces the environmental impact: Nitrates are lead contaminants of groundwater, where they can cause drinking water problems, and can run into surface water, where they can cause algal blooms. 
Putting More Power in the Interdisciplinary Mix
In supporting the development of smart tools for agriculture, the Grace Hopper will give the N.C. PSI an advantage. The computer is named for a computer programming pioneer who began her U.S. Navy career during World War II.
To secure and deploy the Grace Hopper, N.C. PSI has partnered with Cambridge Computing, an NVIDIA reseller that specializes in consulting with universities and research institutions. N.C. PSI secured one of 50 university seed grants to get the supercomputer.
Jevon Smith with the Grace Hopper supercomputer in the Plant Sciences Building at NC State.
“We already have two machine learning systems, and the Grace Hopper is a new tool on a level we haven’t had before,” Smith says. “It gives us the capability to train even larger-scale models to become more accurate and more predictive in nature and come up with solutions to more complicated challenges.”
One of the top challenges has meaning for farmers and consumers alike. “Growers are faced with needing to meet a growing population’s need for more food at the same time that climate change is altering growing conditions,” Smith says.
U.S. farmers are also facing serious labor shortages. While one of the fears surrounding AI is that it’ll take away jobs, supporters say it may hold promise for easing agricultural worker shortages, especially with the labor-intensive crops that North Carolina is known for — sweetpotatoes and tobacco, for starters.
As Reberg-Horton notes, “We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades. We know what we want, but it’s hard to get there. The AI revolution has been a missing piece that’ll help us get there.”

With the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace, Spokeo wanted to understand how professionals feel about utilizing this technology. Are they using AI in their current role? Do they think it will impact their industry? And do they have any concerns about it?Surveying 1,027 respondents active in the workplace uncovered a range of perceptions – both positive and negative – about AI at work.Key Findings74.8% are concerned AI will impact their industry18-24 year olds were least concerned about AI's impact on the industry (66%) and over 65's were most concerned (80.8%)78.1% believe AI could reduce some of the stresses of the job, either now or in the future  Industries thought to be positively impacted by AI: Technology, Agriculture, and Manufacturing66.6% believe AI could do their job 76.7% think AI will reduce the number of working days in the week for the average American74.8% are concerned AI will impact their industryThree quarters of survey participants (74.8%) had concerns about AI impacting their industry. This attitude was broadly consistent across genders and ages. Female respondents were slightly less concerned AI would impact their industry negatively compared to male respondents (72.5% compared with 76.6%).                                                        Spokeo                                                                                                                                                                        Spokeo   AI concerns increase with ageThe age groups which were least and most fearful of AI's impact on their industry were also the oldest and youngest age brackets in the study: with 66% of 18-24 year olds showing concern rising to 80.8% of over 65s.

Spokeo                                                                                                                                                                        Spokeo   Can AI be a stress reliever?However, more than three quarters (78.1%) of Americans also believe that AI could make their job less stressful, either now or in the future. The majority of Americans, 79.1% of respondents, thought employers should offer training for utilizing ChatGPT and AI tools within their roles – indicating a desire to not get left behind and to take proper advantage of the new tools.Other benefits of AI include increased productivity, cited by 40.2% of respondents. Only 7.7% of those surveyed felt the new technology was of no benefit at all.                                                        Spokeo                                                                                                                                                                        Spokeo   Industries that respondents thought will be most impacted most by AIThe industries that respondents thought will be most positively impacted are Technology (51.3%), Agriculture (50.6%), and Manufacturing (46.8%).It is interesting to note that a similar percentage of Americans felt industries would either be negatively affected by AI or not affected at all. The industries that Americans felt could be most negatively impacted by AI are Financial activities and insurance (41.4%), Professional and business services (40.2%) and Leisure and hospitality (38.4%).                                                        Spokeo                                                                                                                                                                        Spokeo   66.6% believe AI could do their jobSurprisingly, two thirds of professionals (66.6%) believed AI could currently do their job, possibly overestimating AI's ability to perform a wide range of human tasks.However, Americans were still confident they could outperform AI in their role, in all skills except data analysis (63.2% thought AI is better) and time management (52.5%).76.7% think AI will reduce the number of working days in the week for the average AmericanIn early October Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, made headlines with his prediction that AI will eventually cut down the work week to three and a half days. The majority of Americans seem to agree. In fact, three quarters of respondents (76.7%) believed that AI could help them work fewer days in the future.Despite some concerns about the impact of AI on their industry, 62.8% of people said they would be for AI if they could receive the same income and the technology could reduce the number of working days in the week.Additionally, people think AI could help not only reduce the amount of work they do, but it could also reduce the stress of their existing job and workload. 78.1% of respondents felt AI could reduce their work-related stress overall, concluding an overwhelming majority who do also see numerous personal benefits to incorporating AI in its current form and as it continues to improve.Overall, the study suggests that although Americans are wary of the potential consequences of AI technology, with the right training by employers, most people also see the potential benefits that the technology may reap in the workplace – both professionally and for their own personal well-being.MethodologyUsing Amazon's survey platform, Spokeo surveyed 1,097 Americans in October 2023 about topics relating to AI and its impact on their industry.The breakdown of the people surveyed was as follows:Age ranges:18-24 – 4.58%25-34 – 32.6%35-44 – 44.1%45-54 – 11.7%55-64 – 4.5%65+ – 2.5%Gender:Female – 50.6%Male – 47.5%Non-binary – 1.7%Prefer not to say – 0.2%This story was produced by Spokeo and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media.© Stacker Media, LLC.This story was originally published June 11, 2024, 10:30 AM.",NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article289188759.html'}",AI at work: The impact of artificial intelligence in the workplace,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fn60zm/picture289188594/alternates/FREE_1140/93e74325-3296-45d7-9807-78f2cb9b82d1,2024-06-11T10:30:00-05:00,2024-06-11T14:45:01-05:00,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jean Lin '}]","{'name': 'Kansas City Star', '@type': 'Organization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.kansascity.com/wps/build/images/kansascity/logo-lg.png'}}",,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article289188759.html,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fn60zm/picture289188594/alternates/FREE_1140/93e74325-3296-45d7-9807-78f2cb9b82d1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywalled'}",False,"['Stacker', 'Jean Lin']",,,Business,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'kansascity', 'productID': 'kansascity.com:AllKCM-5012'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.spokeo.com/compass/ai-in-the-workplace/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Copy.ai
Best for Beating Writer’s Block
Copy.ai is an artificial intelligence writing tool designed to help marketers, business owners, and copywriters create various forms of content, including website copy, sales landing pages, email, and social media and blog posts. A boon to content marketers, Copy.ai can automatically conduct SEO research and produce content briefs for writers, streamlining the production process and giving writers guidance.
Another distinctive feature is the thought leadership tool, which automatically turns raw transcripts from interviews with experts into a variety of content assets, including blog posts, social media posts, and newsletters. This dramatically reduces the time it takes to manage content repurposing. The AI writing tool also lets you easily generate copy that aligns with your organization’s persona.
Copy.ai’s in-platform AI chatbot acts as a writing assistant to help beat writer’s block by aiding with brainstorming. For example, I asked it to give me 10 Instagram post ideas for fashion week—it delivered 10 useable ideas I could use as the basis for my social posts. These features enable your team to create and distribute more high-quality content at a lower cost than before.

Rytr
Best for Copywriters
Rytr is an AI-powered writing tool capable of producing copywriting content on various topics. It’s one of the best AI writing tools for commercial copywriting jobs, where copywriters can use it to automate the creation of post and caption ideas, paragraph content, SEO meta titles, emails, call to actions, replies, and other less complex copywriting assets.
The platform also supports more than 40 other use cases, including generating blog ideas and creating job descriptions. In addition, paid users can create their own use cases by training Rytr for their specific needs.
I tested Rytr out for copywriting and asked it to write me a call-to-action for “A knee pad that protects middle-aged gardeners from hurting themselves.” In response to my prompt, it provided the following two variants:

“Safeguard your knees, garden with ease.”
“Safeguard your knees, garden in comfort.”

When I changed the tone from “convincing” to “humorous,” it generated two more options that were not useable out-of-the-box but were still useful for ideation:

“Kneel with confidence, gardenlords!”
“Unleash your inner knee-jerk green thumb!”

Overall, Rytr its a useful AI writing tool for copywriters who want to streamline their writing process and come up with more ideas for a variety of content types.

QuillBot
Best for Paraphrasing
QuillBot is an AI-powered writing assistant that, unlike most AI writing tools, focuses on helping you paraphrase and summarize texts. This makes it great for content marketers who often have to write repetitive copy with slight variations across their different content assets or even within the same blog post. For example, instead of writing “automate your administrative accounting tasks” five times, they could use QuillBot to spin that into five different variations.
It also functions as a citation generation tool, making it somewhat useful for academics—but it may not be the best tool for writing essays and research papers, as its output doesn’t consistently pass AI detection tools.
One of QuillBot’s standout features is the ability to choose from nine modes of paraphrased output. You can select from natural, academic, simple, creative, shortened, expanded, and more. As an example, when I prompted it with “The shift to agriculture took thousands of years” in academic mode, the output read, “The transition to an agrarian society spanned several millennia.”
Overall, I found the tool helpful for the outwardly simple but cognitively-taxing task of coming up with new ways to express your ideas in writing.

Frase.io
Best for SEO Teams and Content Managers
Frase.io is an AI writing tool designed to help you generate content, provide suggestions for better writing, and optimize articles for SEO.

Frase’s keyword optimization feature will identify important keywords while you write, make suggestions about how frequently to use them, and track how often they are used in the copy. In addition to keyword tips, it also tells you the ideal number of headings, words, links, and images your articles should have to outrank the competition.
Many of the SEO managers I’ve worked with have used Frase, and I’ve found it especially helpful for optimizing articles for SEO. Watching the SEO “topic score” go up as I make edits is motivating and lets me know I’m on the right track.

Anyword
Best for Copywriting Performance Analysis
Anyword is an AI writing tool that uses machine learning algorithms to generate content and analyze the performance of your copy across various channels. What distinguishes the tool is its Copy Intelligence functionality, which analyzes all of your previously published content to determine which messaging works best on your website, ads, socials, and email channels while clueing you into opportunities to improve your copy.
Its Target Audience feature lets copywriters and marketers define their ideal readers down to their key problems and desires. The AI writing tool will then take this into account when creating and analyzing content.
I found Anyword’s templates extremely helpful for prompting the AI writer to create content that fit my needs. In addition, its self-guided wizards walked me through the information I needed to provide the tool for it to write a blog post or ad campaign for my needs.

Grammarly can be used as a browser extension, a desktop application, or a mobile app. It’s free to use with limited features, or is available with additional functionalities as a premium subscription.
I’ve found Grammarly’s free version to be extremely useful as an AI editing tool. When I use it to run a final grammar and spelling check on a finished article, it inevitably catches mistakes and offers solutions to fix them. I also use it when writing emails to get the tone right. For example, when emailing a new client, I like to make sure the tone is confident and upbeat—Grammarly’s tone detector helps me achieve that goal.

Hemingway Editor
Best for Content Readability Measurement
Named after a writer known for his concise and simple prose, Hemingway Editor is a writing tool that helps you enhance the clarity, grammar, and readability of your written work. It analyzes text and provides various readability suggestions while highlighting lengthy, complex sentences, excessive adverbs, passive voice, and hard-to-read phrases.
It also assigns a readability score based on the grade level required to understand the text. If the score is too high, content writers can tweak the highlighted sentences to lower the grade level. It is available both as a web-based application and as a desktop app.
I’ve used Hemingway in various capacities and I find that it does its main job of measuring content readability extremely well. Its passive voice detector is my favorite part of the tool.
That said, one of the risks of using an AI editing tool like Hemingway is that, if you follow its suggestions without thinking, you may edit all the rhythm, flow, and personality out of your writing, leaving you with text that’s plain, lifeless, and stilted and suited for a grade level well below your target. Overall, though, I’ve found it a useful tool for making sure blog content is clear and easy to understand while streamlining the editing process.

AI Writer
Best for High-Output Bloggers
AI Writer is designed to generate full-length articles in minutes, making it great for high-output bloggers, affiliate marketers, and other people who need articles fast. The platform lets you tailor the AI’s writing to your specific needs by selecting from a long list of recommended keywords for your topic or by manually inputting your chosen keywords. It also suggests sub-topics for your article and helps you structure your content with headings. The tool even cites its sources, displaying journalistic responsibility.
Significantly, it helps you choose topics about which to write. While exploring the platform, I found its topic generator helpful for coming up with article topics using a seed keyword—after prompting with “cold calling,” for example, I received a long list of article keywords and their associated traffic. I then selected Research and Write, a one-click article feature for Cold Calling Leads, and within minutes, I had a basis for a new 600-word article on the topic.
Compared to other AI writing tools, AI Writer’s blog content creation was incredibly quick. However, a note on quality—although AI Writer’s articles are typically well-written, SEO-friendly, and factually correct, they could benefit from a writer’s touch. When I took another pass to add personality, anecdotes, actionable insights, and personal experiences to the copy, it became more appealing to readers and search engines.

We don\'t have to foresee all of the possible people that you could have killed in the NPC[\'s lines], but they could be talking about that, right?\r\n\r\nAnd say if it\'s like multiple people, they could say, ""Oh my god!"" and it\'s like, literally a serial killer.

So you can compliment what\'s there already. So that\'s the thing that we should be exploring because how we\'ll make better RPGs. So what I think is, in the future, I don\'t buy the full NPC being generated, but most likely everything will feel the same. \r\n\r\nSo I buy more that there\'s going to be something that\'s crafted, and then you\'ll have AI that plugs into it to augment it. And it should be done in such a way that it\'s invisible, so you don\'t know that it\'s shifting around. So I think that\'s the thing of the future. At least the short to midterm future.

The use of artificial intelligence in the development process of games is a possibility that we might see soon, as a lot of time and effort goes into making a game, and studios are more than willing to share some of their load with AI.

NPC face presets, Baldur’s Gate 3 | @LoonyLupus via Reddit | Larian Studios
The use of generative AI would be most helpful with one-liner NPCs, as a lot of time and energy goes into specifically going through each character, which usually bottlenecks the development process. Larian Studios faced a similar roadblock during the making of Baldur’s Gate 3. This made Swen Vincke, the founder and director of Larian Studios, more open to the idea of working with AI in the future.
Swen Vincke shares his thoughts on the future of AI
Vincke has a grounded approach toward the use of AI in the video game industry, but he sure is open-minded about finding the right balance between human effort and AI for a collaboration to take place between the two without making AI the boss.

The visionary outlook of Vincke
When asked about all the things he would like to do with AI in the future, Vincke said:
 Where I see use it for is – but this is really not there yet – is to augment the reactivity and dialogues. So you would, for instance, have writers and a scripter and cinematic designer, and everybody that goes with it, you would have them make their entire scene, and then you would augment some reactivity into it, to things that you’ve done before.
 So it is about, for instance, let’s say it’s a guard talking about a murderer that is free in the city. We don’t have to foresee all of the possible people that you could have killed in the NPC[‘s lines], but they could be talking about that, right?
And say if it’s like multiple people, they could say, “Oh my god!” and it’s like, literally a serial killer. And then if you arrive there as a player, that would feel good, right? But you would still lace that into your overall web.

In another interview with IGN, addressing the same question, he answered:

I think you can have reactive games and that’s where it can have a place. So you can compliment what’s there already. So that’s the thing that we should be exploring because how we’ll make better RPGs. So what I think is, in the future, I don’t buy the full NPC being generated, but most likely everything will feel the same. 
So I buy more that there’s going to be something that’s crafted, and then you’ll have AI that plugs into it to augment it. And it should be done in such a way that it’s invisible, so you don’t know that it’s shifting around. So I think that’s the thing of the future. At least the short to midterm future. Long term, I don’t know.
What the future holds for AI in the video game industry is still not completely transparent, but some visionaries like Vincke already have plans to use it to their advantage without hindering the purity and creativity of making a game.

AI, if used as an efficient tool to work over already-established things and labor-intensive tasks, can do wonders for the industry by helping developers work more smoothly and freely, which can sow the groundwork for more creativity to flourish.

Distinguished speakers: (From left) Bigar, Lian, Yap, Danze and Brewer after providing insights on the impact of AI on the job market. They were speaking at an event organised by Star Media Group.





PETALING JAYA: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to replace or make some jobs obsolete, but it could also mean new job opportunities in other areas. Speakers in a forum organised by Star Media Group Bhd’s Leaders Council Power Breakfast yesterday said that there were pertinent concerns among the incoming workforce, who are mostly students now, about potential job losses from the wider adoption of generative AI, which is a much more advanced form of AI.The forum was titled “Shaping the Digital Future of Malaysia”. Fabian Bigar, chief executive officer of MyDigital Corp, a government agency under the Digital Ministry, said the advent of generative AI is similar to another industrial revolution which is likely to shake up the job market. The present sentiment towards AI appears to be more pessimistic with regards to potential job losses but Fabian noted there could be upside opportunities from this development. This was also echoed by other panelists at the forum.

 “AI has been there a long time, but the development of generative AI feels like there is a revolution, as within a short span of time things have been transformed. “There is a change in how we interact with the rest of the world or machines and it can generate new things,” Bigar said. “In the past AI needed to be trained and programmed to do specific tasks. Right now, with generative AI, it can come out with new things by itself. It is self-learning and is able to create new things. That’s why it’s important to fact-check as the system can ‘hallucinate’, but if it is fed with enough accurate information it can actually give a reliable output,” he added.

 Bigar cited previous technological developments, such as when automobiles became more widespread, which meant makers of horse-drawn carriages became obsolete. However, it also led to a new types of jobs such as mechanics and engineers. “Generative AI could mean the displacement of menial or repetitive jobs that can be done by the technology. But then to maintain these systems still requires human intervention and judgement. IBM Asean’s general manager and group technology leader Catherine Lian said that generative AI had already replaced jobs related to expense claims within the group. “IBM has got about 450,000 employees globally. Jobs related to processing claims for things like travel expenses have been repurposed. We have taken away 5,000 such jobs worldwide as there is a 100% replacement here by generative AI at IBM. “The jobs have been lost but the people have been repurposed to other roles such as marketing and human resources. A repetitive task is a 100% replaceable by generative AI,” Lian said. Meanwhile, Siemens Malaysia’s president and chief executive officer Tindaro Danze said it is quite likely jobs in computer programming or coding would become obsolete within the next ten years. “In 10 years from now, any person can programme a machine and coding is going to be obsolete,” Danze said. Generative AI could also change the way education is carried out eventually, said MyDigital’s Bigar. “The schooling experience may be a little bit different, I don’t think it will be about knowledge any more, but rather about asking the right questions,” he added. Pos Malaysia Bhd’s group chief executive Charles Brewer said he sees generative AI as an exciting development that’s anticipated to change many different parts of its business. “Generative AI is a huge opportunity and super exciting. We know of 642 use cases where it would add significant value to our employees, customers and business. On the flipside, we have to think of the jobs that would no longer exist, and we would need to reskill these people and create new business units,” Brewer told StarBiz. Danze said the situation in the job market and the impact of generative AI is still playing out, and is difficult to predict what new jobs or industries would come about. “Ten years ago, no one would’ve thought that ride hailing would be such a huge job market. As the application of new technologies increases, the opportunities of new jobs will increase at the same pace,” he said. Melissa Yap, chief of staff for Deloitte’s SEA Consulting Office, was the moderator of the event. The Leaders Council Power Breakfast is a satellite event to kick off the Leaders Council Summit.

Jobs requiring AI skills are still 'extremely rare' in Australia, according to SEEK data. Image: Shutterstock







An analysis by a federal assistant minister and an economist has found the number of advertisements for jobs involving artificial intelligence skills have dropped in Australia since 2021, and such roles remained “extremely rare”.
Compiled by economist Matt Cowgill and the assistant minister for competition, charities, treasury and employment, Andrew Leigh, the analysis uses Australian data collected by job site SEEK.
It found AI jobs made up “a tiny share of all advertised positions” in Australia, accounting for only 0.17 per cent of job postings, or 1 in every 588 advertised roles.
The pair also found that while workers in roles involving AI skills were generally paid more, there was some evidence that their wage premium had dropped over the past seven years.
The findings were delivered in a speech by Leigh to the Bureau of Statistics and Reserve Bank’s joint conference Human Capital in Sydney on Tuesday.
The report comes after AI experts criticised the level of AI investment in the federal government’s latest budget, which pledged $39.9 million over five years for the development of AI policies and capabilities.

AI jobs decline
Leigh and Cowgill’s analysis found that while ads for jobs in Australia involving AI skills increased as a share of overall job postings between 2017 and 2022, they have since declined.
However, the report also found demand for AI skills in Australia had still “clearly grown substantially, approximately tripling since 2017”. 
Only 0.06 per cent of advertisements in 2017 were for AI jobs — a figure which peaked at 0.2 per cent in 2021, before falling to 0.17 per cent in early 2024.
Similarly, job ads containing the phrase “artificial intelligence” have also dropped, with around 1 in 1,000 advertised roles containing that phrase in 2024.
“The share of job advertisements that mention ‘artificial intelligence’ rose six-fold from 2017 to 2022, but fell by one-third from 2022 to 2024,” the report said.
Source: Andrew Leigh and Matt Cowgill's 'Artificial Intelligence at Work: Changing Demand for AI Skills in Job Advertisements'

In a statement to Information Age, Leigh said while many Australians were using AI in their everyday lives, AI specialists were ""thin on the ground"".
“The drop in AI jobs from 2022 to 2024 likely reflected the general downturn in hiring in the IT sector,” he said.
“Interestingly, AI jobs held up better than general coding jobs over this period.
“The government’s AI strategy is focused on ensuring that we maximise the productivity benefits from AI, both as producers and consumers of the technology.”
Leigh and Cowgill admitted that ads for AI jobs which did not explicitly mention AI-related skills in the text of the job advertisement would not be considered AI jobs by their analysis.
They also were not trying to identify roles made redundant by the emergence of AI.
Half of the 1,000 Australians surveyed for market research company Ipsos’ latest AI Monitor report said they believed AI was “somewhat"" or “very” likely to change how they did their current job in the next five years.

Only 26 per cent of Australians said they felt it was “somewhat” or “very” likely that AI would completely replace their job in the next five years.
Australia’s largest telecommunications company, Telstra, announced in May that it would cut 2,800 employees this year amid an AI-driven “reset” of its enterprise arm.
Higher wages for AI jobs 
Leigh and Cowgill's analysis found AI jobs have received higher wages than non-AI jobs for years, but things were beginning to balance out.
In the 12 months to March 2024, they found the average advertised salary for an AI job was $121,275 — 31 per cent higher than the average for non-AI jobs.
However, the authors also found AI jobs were ""over-represented in occupations that tend to pay well regardless of whether AI skills are mentioned in the job ad”.
After altering their calculations to account for this, they estimated the pay premium for AI jobs was 11 per cent in 2017.
""Over the ensuing years, the pay gap between AI jobs and other jobs in the same state and occupational category steadily fell,” they said.
“In 2023 and 2024, the final years of our sample, the pay premium for AI jobs was just 4 per cent.
“Averaged across the entire period 2017 to 2024 (and controlling for state, time and occupation fixed effects), the pay premium for AI jobs was 6 per cent.”

Source: Andrew Leigh and Matt Cowgill's 'Artificial Intelligence at Work: Changing Demand for AI Skills in Job Advertisements'
In the 12 months to April 2024, AI jobs were found to be most prevalent in science, technology and research roles, with the largest share (6.3 per cent) among mathematical science professionals, which includes data scientists.
The retail, real estate, community services and construction industries were found to have the lowest prevalence of AI jobs.
“Some may be surprised to learn that ‘Nurse educators and researchers’, ‘Music professionals’ and ‘Social professionals’ are among the top ten occupations for their share of AI jobs,” the report added.

FacebookTwitterLinkedinWhatsAppEmail






Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative force that is reshaping societies worldwide. AI has the potential to disrupt industries, create new job categories, and alter work, with countries leading in AI innovation potentially gaining economic advantages.
Ad powered by advergic.com
The race for AI dominance in geopolitics raises concerns about arms races, technological espionage, and power imbalances. AI integration into military systems raises ethical and strategic questions about autonomous weapons and cyber warfare. Ethical considerations include privacy, bias, accountability, and human rights impact.
Robust governance frameworks are needed to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. AI can transform various aspects of society, but there are concerns about job displacement, inequality, and social cohesion. The rise of AI presents both opportunities and challenges for policymakers, businesses, and societies, necessitating effective governance and collaboration to harness its benefits while mitigating its risks.
With a growing youth population, Pakistan is at the precipice of a transformative era driven by technological advancements. AI represents the emulation of human intelligence processes by machines, encompassing technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Its applications are far-reaching, altering the way we live, work, and interact.
The AI age is also transforming the employment model in Pakistan, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the youth. As AI disrupts traditional job roles, individuals must adapt to new skill-sets that require creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives are crucial to equip the youth with the competencies demanded by the AI-driven economy. Access to AI education and training programmes provides young individuals with the tools and skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
AI holds the potential to drive innovation and entrepreneurship among Pakistani youth. With the rise of AI-powered startups and initiatives, young innovators are harnessing the technology to address pressing societal challenges and create meaningful solutions. However, the proliferation of AI raises concerns and challenges for Pakistan’s youth. The rapid pace of technological advancement risks exacerbating existing inequalities, particularly in terms of access and opportunity. Disparities in digital literacy and infrastructure may widen the gap between urban and rural youth, hindering inclusive development and socioeconomic progress. Ethical considerations surrounding AI loom large, necessitating careful deliberation and regulation to ensure responsible and equitable deployment. By grappling with these ethical dilemmas and navigating the ethical dimensions of AI, Pakistani youth can chart a path towards inclusive and sustainable development in the 21st century.


International collaboration should be encouraged to share best practices and resources in AI development and implementation. Public awareness should be raised about the benefits and risks of AI, and lifelong learning and professional development should be encouraged. By following this roadmap, Pakistan can position itself to capitalize on AI opportunities and become a leader in the new world order of technology.

The integration of AI may initially lead to job displacement, but proactive measures can mitigate these effects by fostering an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. AI-driven efficiencies can enhance productivity, potentially offsetting job losses with new opportunities in emerging sectors such as data analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Emerging job opportunities emerge as AI permeates various industries, demanding specialized skill-sets. Data scientists, AI engineers, cybersecurity specialists, and digital transformation experts are among the roles in high demand. Encouraging STEM education equips youth with the skills needed to thrive in these domains.
The private sector plays a pivotal role in driving AI adoption and fostering youth employment by investing in research and development, facilitating industry-relevant training programs, internships, and mentorship initiatives. The government’s responsibility is to craft policies that facilitate a smooth transition to the AI-driven economy, promoting digital literacy, vocational training, and entrepreneurship. Universities serve as incubators of talent, preparing the youth for the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. Curricula should be updated to incorporate AI-related subjects, providing students with practical skills and hands-on experience. Partnerships with industry enable universities to offer internships, co-op programs, and industry projects, ensuring graduates are equipped with the skills sought after by employers.
Parents and society play a crucial role in shaping the aspirations and career choices of the youth. Encouraging a culture of lifelong learning and embracing change fosters resilience and adaptability, while destigmatizing vocational education and non-traditional career paths promotes diversity in the workforce. Meanwhile, the broader community has a crucial role in influencing the career choices and ambitions of young individuals, fostering a mindset of continuous learning and embracing diverse career paths. Destigmatizing vocational education and promoting diverse career options ensure inclusivity and provide opportunities for all segments of society. Collaboration among stakeholders is vital as Pakistan navigates the AI revolution.
By embracing innovation, investing in human capital, and fostering an inclusive ecosystem, Pakistan can harness AI’s transformative potential for sustainable economic growth and societal development. Government support should be allocated for AI research and development, with centres of excellence and grants for universities and research institutions. Industry collaboration should be encouraged, with internship programs, apprenticeships, and partnerships with tech companies. To promote entrepreneurship, a conducive environment should be created, offering incentives like tax breaks, grants, and incubation centres.
A robust digital infrastructure should be built, including high-speed internet connectivity and data centres. Skills development should be implemented, with training programmes and workshops to upskill the workforce in AI technologies. A clear regulatory framework should be developed, addressing ethical and privacy concerns while fostering innovation.
International collaboration should be encouraged to share best practices and resources in AI development and implementation. Public awareness should be raised about the benefits and risks of AI, and lifelong learning and professional development should be encouraged. By following this roadmap, Pakistan can position itself to capitalize on AI opportunities and become a leader in the new world order of technology.

The glare of attention on generative AI threatens to overshadow advanced analytics. Companies pouring resources into much-hyped large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT risk neglecting advanced analytics and their proven value for improving business decisions and processes, such as predicting the next best offer for each customer or optimizing supply chains.
The consequences for resource allocation and value creation are significant. Data and analytics teams that our team works with are reporting that generative AI initiatives, often pushed by senior leaders afraid of missing out on the next big thing, are siphoning funds from their budgets. This reallocation could undermine projects aimed at delivering value across the organization, even as most enterprises are still seeking convincing business cases for the use of LLMs.

However, advanced analytics and LLMs have vastly different capabilities, and leaders should not think in terms of choosing one over the other. These technologies can work in concert, combining, for example, the reliable predictive power of machine learning-based advanced analytics with the natural language capabilities of LLMs.
Considering these complementary capabilities, we see opportunities for generative AI to tackle challenges in the development and deployment phases of advanced analytics — for both predictive and prescriptive applications. LLMs can be particularly useful in helping users incorporate unstructured data sources into analyses, translate business problems into analytical models, and understand and explain models’ results.
In this article, we’ll describe some experiments we have conducted with LLMs to boost advanced analytics use cases. We’ll also provide guidance on monitoring and verifying that output, which remains a best practice when working with LLMs, given that they are known to sometimes produce unreliable or incorrect results.
Applying LLMs in Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics lies at the heart of processes that are increasingly data-driven for many companies. It’s rare to find a marketing department that isn’t discussing shifts in customer churn predictions and how to react, or commercial teams that aren’t considering how to boost next month’s sales in response to a dip that’s been forecast by predictive analytics. We see opportunities to expand the impact of such approaches by tapping LLMs in the following ways to increase the variety of data used to train and execute models or better communicate with business stakeholders who use predictive analytics outputs in decision-making.
Incorporating complex data types.

Probably none: the advantages of AI are too great to deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits AI models offer to organizations are undeniable, especially for optimizing critical operations and outputs. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; also comes with risk. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;IBM Institute for Business Value&lt;/a&gt;, 96% of executives say adopting generative AI makes a security breach likely in their organization within the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CISA Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://securityintelligence.com/articles/are-we-doomed-to-make-the-same-security-mistakes-with-ai/&quot;&gt;Jen Easterly&lt;/a&gt; said, “We don’t have a cyber problem, we have a technology and culture problem. Because at the end of the day, we have allowed speed to market and features to really put safety and security in the backseat.” And no place in technology reveals the obsession with speed to market more than generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI training sets ingest massive amounts of valuable and sensitive data, which makes AI models a juicy attack target. Organizations cannot afford to bring unsecured AI into their environments, but they can’t do without the technology either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap between the need for AI and its inherent risks, it’s imperative to establish a solid framework to direct AI security and model use. To help meet this need, IBM recently announced its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-framework-for-securing-generative-ai/&quot;&gt;Framework for Securing Generative AI&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see how a well-developed framework can help you establish solid AI cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Securing the AI pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generative AI framework should be designed to help customers, partners and organizations to understand the likeliest attacks on AI. From there, defensive approaches can be prioritized to quickly secure generative AI initiatives.&lt;img alt=&quot;A chart of the AI pipeline, focusing on data security.&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; src=&quot;https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1mNjk0ZTIzYWY0MjIxMWVlYjJiOGFhYTM1YTIwZjI2NA==&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securing the AI pipeline involves five areas of action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the data: How data is collected and handled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the model: AI model development and training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the usage: AI model inference and live use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing AI model infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing sound AI governance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s see how each area is oriented to address AI security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[button link=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity&quot; color=&quot;orange1&quot; size=&quot;large&quot;]Learn more about AI cybersecurity[/button]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Secure the AI data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry AI models consume massive amounts of data, which data scientists, engineers and developers will access for development purposes. However, developers might not have security high on their list of priorities. If mishandled, your sensitive data and critical intellectual property (IP) could end up exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AI model attacks, exfiltration of underlying data sets is likely to be one of the most common attack scenarios. Therefore, security fundamentals are the first line of defense to protect these data sets. AI security fundamentals include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/data-security&quot;&gt;Data discovery and classification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data encryption at rest and in transit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/verify?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074603995207&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAmZGrBhAnEiwAo9qHiTE5RWkmbwf2L1tP4Ol0mhnD5NYxistXMTIX4Z6v2ffn3g-8Nrag6RoCy8UQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;&gt;Identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; (IAM) to help ensure that no single entity has unrestricted access to the AI model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building in security through security awareness for data scientists, researchers and developers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Secure the AI model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When developing AI applications, data scientists frequently use pre-existing, freely available machine learning (ML) models sourced from online repositories. However, like any open-source library, security is frequently not built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every organization must consider the AI security risks versus the benefits of accelerated model development. However, without proper AI model security, the downside risk can be significant. Remember, hackers have access to online repositories as well, and backdoors or malware can be injected into open-source models. Any organization that downloads an infected model is wide open to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, API-enabled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;large language models (LLMs)&lt;/a&gt; present a similar risk. Hackers can target API interfaces to access and exploit data being transported across the APIs. And LLM agents or plug-ins with excessive permissions further increase the risk for compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure AI models, organizations should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuously scan for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/services/vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;vulnerabilities, malware and corruption&lt;/a&gt; across the AI/ML pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover and harden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/qradar&quot;&gt;API and plug-in integrations&lt;/a&gt; to third-party models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity&quot;&gt;Configure policies, controls and RBAC&lt;/a&gt; around ML models, artifacts and data sets so that no one person or thing has access to all the data or all of the model functions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Secure the AI usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI models first became widely available, waves of users rushed to test the platforms. It wasn’t long before hackers were able to trick the models into ignoring guardrails and generate biased, false or even dangerous responses. All this can lead to reputational damage and increase the risk of costly legal headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attackers can also attempt to analyze input/output pairs and train a surrogate model to mimic the behavior of your organization’s AI model. This means the enterprise can lose its competitive edge. Finally, AI models are also vulnerable to denial of service attacks, where attackers overwhelm the LLM with inputs that degrade the quality of service and ramp up resource use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best practices for AI model usage security include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring for prompt injections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring for outputs containing sensitive data or inappropriate content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detecting and responding to data poisoning, model evasion and model extraction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploying &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulse2.com/hiddenlayer-50-million-in-funding/&quot;&gt;machine learning detection and response (MLDR),&lt;/a&gt; which can be integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/qradar&quot;&gt;security operations solutions&lt;/a&gt;, such as IBM Security® QRadar®, enabling the ability to deny access and quarantine or disconnect compromised models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Secure the infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secure infrastructure must underpin any solid AI cybersecurity strategy. Strengthening network security, refining access control, implementing robust data encryption and deploying vigilant intrusion detection and prevention systems around AI environments are all critical for securing infrastructure that supports AI. Additionally, allocating resources towards innovative security solutions tailored for safeguarding AI assets should be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Establish AI governance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance&quot;&gt;Artificial intelligence governance&lt;/a&gt; entails the guardrails that ensure AI tools and systems are and remain safe and ethical. It establishes the frameworks, rules and standards that direct AI research, development and application to ensure safety, fairness and respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is an industry leader in AI governance, as shown by its presentation of the IBM Framework for Securing Generative AI. As entities continue to give AI more business process and decision-making responsibility, AI model behavior must be kept in check, monitoring for fairness, bias and drift over time. Whether induced or not, a model that diverges from what it was originally designed to do can introduce significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oil and gas industry hops on generative AI bandwagon

New York (AFP) –             Away from the Microsoft and Googles of the world, a century-old industry -- oil and gas -- is hoping that generative artificial intelligence will make producing petroleum more efficient and easier on its workforce.

Long before the current craze surrounding generative AI (Gen AI), the energy sector employed traditional artificial intelligence through its use of data to identify oil and gas deposits.But the industry sees even greater potential to save money, reduce accidents and lower greenhouse gases through Gen AI, which exponentially increases and diversifies the data that can be analyzed.The new AI programs can also be employed broadly in the workforce instead of being limited to programmers and data analysts, as has been the case with traditional AI.""Extracting this data from the copious amounts of data generated by drilling activities has historically posed a significant challenge for industry leaders,"" recently wrote Tim Hafke, content marketing specialist with AlphaSense. ""That's where Gen AI comes in.""In recent years the downstream industry, which includes refineries that process crude oil into gasoline, has increasingly relied on so-called digital twins -- computer-modeled replicas of actual facilities. They allow companies to run simulations to assess operational issues in real-life facilities, mitigate potential hazards and do predictive maintenance (PdM).PdM uses historical and current data to project future performance and determine when parts should be taken down for maintenance or replaced.Microsoft vice president Matthew Kerner sees this as an entry point to generative AI, a way ""to explain why the predictive model is making that prediction"" and provide context to better address the situation, he explained during a panel discussion at energy conference CERAWeek.""Gen AI is useful as a bolt on to some other more predictive AI systems,"" Kerner said.Next-generation chatbots similar to the world-famous ChatGPT can also be of help for employees on the ground, said Rob McGreevy, of industry software company Aveva, during the panel.The data-filled chatbot could allow oil field or refinery workers encountering a problem to measure atmospheric conditions like humidity and operational performance like wellhead pressure to quickly diagnose the issue, McGreevy said.Getting a detailed report in seconds allows for a quick fix -- saving time and money in the process.'Less risk'During refinery maintenance, ""you're putting people in dangerous situations to do work. If you can do those turnarounds faster, you're exposing yourself to less risk,"" said Matthew Babin, head of energy and natural resources at software company Palantir Technologies.Gen AI can provide ""context to people who are in the process of making a decision, even if it's outside their area of expertise,"" Babin said.""So if I'm a reservoir engineer, I don't have to know about maintenance, but I do have to know about maintenance when I'm looking at how that resource is going to perform and what that costs my organization,"" Babin added.Petroleum installations are regularly checked or taken offline for upkeep. A Gen AI interface provides ""access to a maintenance manual, so you can look at how maintenance for that piece of kit should be done,"" all laid out in plain English, thanks to a chatbot, McGreevy said.Such a system could also facilitate the repair work itself, taking the guesswork out of such decisions.For example, the technology would allow a company to use a computer model of a facility to determine if there is enough room to use a ladder or install scaffolding, McGreevey said.McGreevy said it could also help new employees: ""I think we can shorten dramatically the time it takes for people coming on board to be proficient to safely operate these facilities at scale.""Greater efficiencies linked to Gen AI also create a chance to reduce an oil facility's carbon footprint. But running the technology also requires huge amounts of electricity, mainly in data centers.

Large language models like those that power ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on tasks like drafting legal briefs, analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews, or translating documents into different languages.These machine-learning models typically use only natural language to process information and answer queries, which can make it difficult for them to perform tasks that require numerical or symbolic reasoning.For instance, a large language model might be able to memorize and recite a list of recent U.S. presidents and their birthdays, but that same model could fail if asked the question “Which U.S. presidents elected after 1950 were born on a Wednesday?” (The answer is Jimmy Carter.)Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have proposed a new technique that enables large language models to solve natural language, math and data analysis, and symbolic reasoning tasks by generating programs.Their approach, called natural language embedded programs (NLEPs), involves prompting a language model to create and execute a Python program to solve a user’s query, and then output the solution as natural language.They found that NLEPs enabled large language models to achieve higher accuracy on a wide range of reasoning tasks. The approach is also generalizable, which means one NLEP prompt can be reused for multiple tasks.NLEPs also improve transparency, since a user could check the program to see exactly how the model reasoned about the query and fix the program if the model gave a wrong answer.“We want AI to perform complex reasoning in a way that is transparent and trustworthy. There is still a long way to go, but we have shown that combining the capabilities of programming and natural language in large language models is a very good potential first step toward a future where people can fully understand and trust what is going on inside their AI model,” says Hongyin Luo PhD ’22, an MIT postdoc and co-lead author of a paper on NLEPs.Luo is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Tianhua Zhang, a graduate student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong; and Jiaxin Ge, an undergraduate at Peking University; Yoon Kim, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); senior author James Glass, senior research scientist and head of the Spoken Language Systems Group in CSAIL; and others. The research will be presented at the Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.Problem-solving with programsMany popular large language models work by predicting the next word, or token, given some natural language input. While models like GPT-4 can be used to write programs, they embed those programs within natural language, which can lead to errors in the program reasoning or results.With NLEPs, the MIT researchers took the opposite approach. They prompt the model to generate a step-by-step program entirely in Python code, and then embed the necessary natural language inside the program.An NLEP is a problem-solving template with four steps. First, the model calls the necessary packages, or functions, it will need to solve the task. Step two involves importing natural language representations of the knowledge the task requires (like a list of U.S. presidents’ birthdays). For step three, the model implements a function that calculates the answer. And for the final step, the model outputs the result as a line of natural language with an automatic data visualization, if needed.“It is like a digital calculator that always gives you the correct computation result as long as the program is correct,” Luo says.The user can easily investigate the program and fix any errors in the code directly rather than needing to rerun the entire model to troubleshoot.The approach also offers greater efficiency than some other methods. If a user has many similar questions, they can generate one core program and then replace certain variables without needing to run the model repeatedly.To prompt the model to generate an NLEP, the researchers give it an overall instruction to write a Python program, provide two NLEP examples (one with math and one with natural language), and one test question.“Usually, when people do this kind of few-shot prompting, they still have to design prompts for every task. We found that we can have one prompt for many tasks because it is not a prompt that teaches LLMs to solve one problem, but a prompt that teaches LLMs to solve many problems by writing a program,” says Luo.“Having language models reason with code unlocks many opportunities for tool use, output validation, more structured understanding into model's capabilities and way of thinking, and more,” says Leonid Karlinsky, principal scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.“No magic here”NLEPs achieved greater than 90 percent accuracy when prompting GPT-4 to solve a range of symbolic reasoning tasks, like tracking shuffled objects or playing a game of 24, as well as instruction-following and text classification tasks. The researchers found that NLEPs even exhibited 30 percent greater accuracy than task-specific prompting methods. The method also showed improvements over open-source LLMs. Along with boosting the accuracy of large language models, NLEPs could also improve data privacy. Since NLEP programs are run locally, sensitive user data do not need to be sent to a company like OpenAI or Google to be processed by a model.In addition, NLEPs can enable small language models to perform better without the need to retrain a model for a certain task, which can be a costly process.“There is no magic here. We do not have a more expensive or fancy language model. All we do is use program generation instead of natural language generation, and we can make it perform significantly better,” Luo says.However, an NLEP relies on the program generation capability of the model, so the technique does not work as well for smaller models which have been trained on limited datasets. In the future, the researchers plan to study methods that could make smaller language models generate more effective NLEPs. In addition, they want to investigate the impact of prompt variations on NLEPs to enhance the robustness of the model’s reasoning processes.This research was supported, in part, by the Center for Perceptual and Interactive Intelligence of Hong Kong.

Apple is bringing generative AI to Siri and throughout iOS 18, iPad OS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the company announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10.
As was rumored, Apple partnered with OpenAI to link ChatGPT to iOS, iPadOS and macOS. However, Apple Intelligence will be an independent generative AI service hosted on its own servers.
Adding generative capabilities to Siri has the advantage of familiarity, and partnering with OpenAI means Apple won’t have to do all of the work itself. Apple is betting on generative AI being a seamless addition to the way the Apple ecosystem may already organize a consumer’s or professional’s life.
Apple Intelligence will be available in beta this fall in iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. It will work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and some other current iPad and Mac devices with M1 or newer chips. ChatGPT assistance for Apple Intelligence will follow later in 2024.
 

 
What is Apple Intelligence?
Apple Intelligence is a suite of generative AI capabilities integrated into the next generation of Apple devices. During the AI reveal at WWDC, Apple put the emphasis on “personal intelligence” and privacy. Most of the generative AI processes used for Apple Intelligence will be performed on-device on the A17 or M-series chips and in a proprietary cloud.

Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software engineering, emphasized personal context in the WWDC keynote.
“We’re tremendously excited about the power of generative models … But these tools know very little about you and your needs,” he said.
In response, Apple Intelligence on iOS 18, iPad 18 and macOS Sequoia will use AI for “personal context” to make day-to-day tasks faster. The iPhone can prioritize and summarize notifications with the “priority notifications” feature, selecting the most important ones first.
SEE: Concerns about ultra-powerful artificial intelligence lead some within Silicon Valley to seek a ‘Right to Warn’ for AI project whistleblowers. 
What else does understanding personal context mean? Apple Intelligence can determine what data you think is most relevant and reference related content. For example, if your meeting is rescheduled, you can check whether the new time will prevent you from getting to your daughter’s school event. Answering this question requires Apple Intelligence to search and reason across your personal and work calendars, email and Apple Maps.
New writing tools with generative AI will be available in Mail, Notes, Pages, Keynote and third party apps. Apple Intelligence can write and summarize emails, too.
Apple Intelligence can take action between apps to carry out tasks on your behalf. For example, you can ask it to take action based on natural questions like “Play the podcast that my wife sent the other day.”
Apple Intelligence lets consumers create custom emojis easily in apps like Messages. Notes, Pages, Keynote and Freeform will all gain generative AI images. Apple intelligence is able to identify and recreate pictures of people in your photo library,” such as creating an image of them for their birthday.
What generative AI models does Apple Intelligence run on?
Apple Intelligence runs on multiple proprietary models, which are trained on the AXLearn framework. On June 10, Apple researchers detailed two of them: a large language model with about 3 billion parameters and the server-based language model used in Private Cloud Compute.
Private Cloud Compute
Sometimes, Apple’s AI processes will need to be performed on external servers. To hopefully prevent privacy and security problems around this, Apple will run these processes on Private Cloud Compute, a home for Apple Intelligence that are still thoroughly within the Apple ecosystem and use Apple’s own Swift programming language. Even Apple can’t see that data, the company claims.
“You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone’s AI cloud,” said Federighi.
Siri will respond to natural language
Apple Intelligence enables Siri to:

Understand more natural-sounding questions and speech patterns, including understanding pauses or corrections.
Remember previous conversations and references.
Answer questions about Apple devices.
Take actions inside apps on your behalf.

You can now type to talk to Siri, double tapping the bottom of the screen to make natural-language requests.
Apple didn’t show flashy demos like OpenAI and Google did, but they may be betting on more consumers finding uses for generative AI through what they already do with Siri.
Enhancements to Siri with Apple Intelligence will roll out over the course of the next year. Developers will be able to define how Siri with Apple Intelligence will be able to interact with their apps.
ChatGPT will be integrated with Siri
In addition to Apple Intelligence, Apple is partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT and GPT-4o to Siri, which will be used when referencing current information or gathering information that isn’t on your devices.
Siri will ask for permission to reach out to ChatGPT. You can do this for free or connect to your personal ChatGPT subscription. This integration is coming later this year. Plus, Apple plans to add support for other AI models.
Where Apple’s AI fits in to the competition
Apple has seemingly chosen to stay out of the generative AI chatbot race for the last few years, although it published research on running large language models on mobile devices in December 2023. The relatively late entry means Apple has had time to watch the rest of the industry try to find practical use cases for generative AI. It’s also seen Microsoft switch its Recall AI feature from default to opt-in after security concerns.
Will Apple face the same backlash and security digging as Microsoft’s Recall? And is Apple’s ecosystem so powerful that its email summarization and other Apple Intelligence capabilities will prove as game-changing as AI companies predict generative AI content to be? Is Apple playing it safe when it comes to AI? It’s too early to say, but time will tell whether Apple Intelligence might be opt-in — or transformative — going forward.

Artificial Intelligence, Recruitment & Hiring 
AI hype tapers off? Only one in 588 job ads demand AI skills

Demand for employees with generative artificial intelligence skills peaked the year ChatGPT was launched and has tapered off in the past two years, amid hype and concern over the impact of the technology.
Fresh analysis by jobs platform Seek in collaboration with Federal Assistant Minister for Employment Andrew Leigh, found AI jobs made up a sliver of total open roles and typically attracted higher salaries.
To be detailed in a speech by Dr Leigh on Tuesday, the findings follow growing anxiety among creative professions, such as voice artists, about work theft and job losses driven by AI.
Generative AI creates text, images or other media by drawing from massive pools of data and its uses are varied, from being put to use by financial institutions to detect fraud to carers to tailor bedtime stories to their audiences.
ChatGPT, launched in 2022 and owned by OpenAI, is a “large language model” program with an interactive chatbot that creates the media output based on instructions from the user.
Yet as heard by a Senate inquiry into the matter, the technology poses challenges as well as opportunities.
In the federal budget, $39.9 million was committed to developing AI policies and restrictions over the next five years.
Dr Leigh will say there is “considerable interest” in how the technology will shift dynamics in the jobs market, including its potential to save workers time and make them more productive.
Higher demand for skills needed to work with AI models is also an expected consequence of the technology’s spread, the assistant minister will say.
Demand for AI skills had tripled since 2017 but jobs remain “extremely rare”, Dr Leigh will tell the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Reserve Bank of Australia joint conference on human capital in Sydney.
One in every 588 open roles on Seek met the definition of an AI job — which included mentions of technical keywords — with those numbers shrinking as a proportion of total jobs between 2022 and 2024.
Similar patterns were found when isolating job ads that simply mentioned “artificial intelligence” in the post.
Unsurprisingly, AI jobs were most prevalent in science, technology and research roles, making up 6.3% of all mathematical science professional ads.
But hiring in the sector has been sluggish overall, as economic uncertainty takes a toll.



In April, information and communication technology job ads were down 33.4% compared to the year before, a bigger fall than any other sector based on separate Seek data.

But there are two nagging realities that make it tough to trust AI features that Apple executives described in a prerecorded video — and, notably, did not demonstrate live or allow many journalists to try.First, other companies, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft, have bragged about similarly useful AI features that have not worked nearly as well as they promised. Second, Apple has a rocky track record in AI, including having foisted on you the dimwitted Siri for more than a decade.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf 2023 was the year when AI mania went into hyperdrive, 2024 must be the “prove it” year.💻Follow TechnologyFollowToo many companies have promised magically useful AI that instead has often been rushed, barely functional, not very useful, insecure or error-prone, including Google’s new AI-powered search that suggested people eat glue.

Most people won’t get their hands on the Apple AI features until September or later, and you might need to buy a new iPhone to use them.What Apple’s AI demonstration showed (and didn’t)Apple discussed what are essentially two tiers of AI coming to some newer iPhones, Macs and iPads: the company’s own AI and that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which will step in for tasks that Siri or Apple’s apps can’t handle.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSkip to end of carouselShira Ovide(Patrick Dias for The Washington Post)Tech Friend writer Shira Ovide gives you advice and context to make technology work for you.

(Apple’s own AI may not be capable of this task yet, or Apple didn’t want to risk its AI botching a children’s story.)Apple also lowered the bar for itself by not promising an all-capable AI assistant that would let you skip the steps in planning your vacation or a grocery order.No company’s AI can do that, even the AI assistants from Microsoft, Google and OpenAI that say they’re all-capable. (AI can’t even peer into all the places you have relevant information, including a Gmail message, an Excel spreadsheet and a travel invoice in Expedia.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementInstead, Apple said its AI will make what you already do with its apps — and, later, potentially other companies’ apps — smarter and easier.Several of the features Apple showed — including AI writing helpers and AI for editing objects out of photos — are now standard features from Google, Microsoft or Samsung.Even with the lower bar, it’s not clear whether Apple can make solid and flawless AI. This is the company that made Siri; the clunky iTunes program, which even a top executive made fun of; unsuccessful driverless-car software; and auto-correct that thinks you’re typing “duck.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment.The pattern of overpromising and underdeliveringSo much AI promises magic and instead is wildly flawed or useful mostly for a small number of tasks.Story continues below advertisementI don’t blame any of you who aren’t regular users of the new forms of AI — and that’s most people. Only about 7 percent of Americans are using ChatGPT daily, according to a recent survey conducted for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.AdvertisementOpenAI announced a chattier version of its chatbot in May, but it didn’t have most of the features the company discussed. Google this year scaled back both its AI image generator and the AI-powered search results after high-profile flubs. Meta AI is kind of dumb. Amazon showed an error-prone AI-upgraded Alexa last year, and it hasn’t been released yet. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Those goofs aren’t Apple’s fault, and the company is usually wary of releasing products before they’re polished.But the backdrop for Apple’s AI glow-up is that it and other companies are under so much pressure to show off their AI expertise to investors, employees and business partners. It’s hard to know if any AI is really made for you or if it’s mostly for corporate self-interest.Share251 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Microsoft Canada President Chris Barry projects that generative AI will boost Canada’s labour productivity by around eight percent by the end of the decade, as reported by BNN Bloomberg.




A recent report by Microsoft, conducted with Accenture, predicts that generative AI could add $187bn to the Canadian economy by 2030. The report estimates that AI will contribute up to $180bn in annual productivity gains and another $7bn from new AI products and services. 




Barry, in an interview with BNN Bloomberg, explained that the study examined various industries, job types, and functions. It found that AI could augment or fully automate approximately 30 percent of these roles.




With a projected 40 percent adoption rate of AI, the Canadian economy could see a significant economic impact, enhancing labour productivity. 









Innovation in Canada
A study by Boston Consulting Group revealed that 57 percent of Canadian executives prioritize innovation, a figure lower than the global average of 83 percent. The study also indicated that 48 percent of executives attributed Canada’s slower pace of innovation to a risk-averse culture.




Despite this, 81 percent of Canadian executives are experimenting with generative AI for innovation, research and development, or product development. However, only 10 percent have implemented the technology at scale. 




AI and the Workforce
Addressing concerns about AI replacing jobs, Barry anticipates that AI will primarily augment the workforce in Canada.




He believes AI will make people more effective by automating menial or task-oriented parts of jobs, allowing workers to focus on higher-order tasks that benefit their organizations and increase their job satisfaction. Barry acknowledges that some job elements may change or be eliminated due to AI.

Generative AI can be a powerful tool for progress and positive change, we know. But what of Africa? This was the question Microsoft sought to ask with the aid of a few brilliant minds on the continent. The African context presents unique opportunities and challenges when we consider the potential of generative AI to transform work.
“We see a significant role for generative AI to not only transform work environments but also foster opportunities for the youth to create jobs, innovate and help drive economic growth and stability across the continent,” says Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer, Microsoft Africa.
The continent, it turns out, offers an unprecedented chance to influence the future of work in these early days as large language learning models (LLMs) are still evolving, and the environment for applications is still new. These are the findings of the AI and the Future of Work in Africa whitepaper produced by Microsoft and a collective of industry experts from across the continent.

According to the whitepaper, many expect GenAI to drastically change knowledge worker jobs, especially regarding the type of work done, the skills required, and the outputs produced. McKinsey research shows that GenAI could enable labour productivity growth of up to 0.6 per cent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and the redeployment of worker time into other activities.
“Generative AI has significant potential to advance human capabilities,” says Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa. “As more people across Africa access GenAI tools through their internet-enabled devices and more affordable data, the barriers to access are being reduced and opportunities for skilling can increase. But it is not only information workers that stand to benefit from GenAI.”
The Beauty Of Numbers 
Nearly one billion people in Africa are currently under the age of 35. With the continent projected to be home to almost half of the world’s youth population by the turn of the century, it will in effect make up half of the potential global workforce of the future. Currently, up to 12 million young Africans enter the labour market annually. A report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) states more than 20 per cent are neither in employment, education nor training.

The promise of GenAI to transform industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and services must be balanced by equipping the youth with the skills needed for an AI-disrupted labour market to ensure that they are not left behind in this technological shift.
It is therefore important to build skills across the spectrum, from how to deploy and use GenAI tools effectively at work, to how to build appropriate and innovative applications and technologies on top of these models, to the post-graduate skills of research and innovation in machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and systems to name a few.
“Investing in this range of skills gives Africans the best opportunity to create dignified, appropriate jobs, to adapt AI sensitively to indigenous knowledge, to create new value chains, and better AI systems which might reflect, for example, human-centred and community values. Such systems would add value globally and could counter typical tech-centric models of automation and deskilling,” adds O’Neill.

With culturally and linguistically sensitive design, GenAI can become more tailored to individual workers, learning from interactions and becoming a personalised tool that respects privacy and enhances each worker’s unique skills. It can serve as a guide to foster inclusivity and showcase the diverse skills and abilities of African workers. GenAI can also be appropriated as a community-focused tool that supports collaborative work and communal development.
In Comes The Tech 
The technology can assist in decision-making, risk assessment, and data analysis, empowering entrepreneurs in their ventures. For the informal sector, tailored GenAI tools will elevate the capabilities of entrepreneurs, providing customised assistance for their unique needs.
The whitepaper discloses that to ensure a beneficial outcome with GenAI, it is imperative to involve proactive governance, inclusive design, investment in education, and a commitment to regulatory and ethical standards. This, it observes, is a collective responsibility, requiring engagement from policymakers, technologists, and citizens alike.
“Technology alone cannot solve the challenges that our youthful continent faces. We need to create policies and practices to ensure that GenAI, and AI in general, is deployed responsibly with AI-related labour being valued and dignified. It requires the macro-economic, labour, and regulatory markets to adapt and be capable of supporting positive change,” adds Bhat.
The AI revolution in Africa is no longer just a possibility; it is already underway. To learn more, visit AI and the future of work in Africa to download the whitepaper.

As generative AI steamrolls through the art world, science-related art faces some unique conundrums. One of them concerns paleoart, the accurate-as-possible depiction of extinct life forms, based on as much information as we have — often not a lot. Essentially, it’s art because it requires a good deal of judgment and interpretation. But it is also science because, when representing science findings to the public, maximum possible accuracy is a duty. A pterosaur sprouting a third foot from its wing hardly meets the standard.
But that’s an obvious type of generative AI goof. How would lay people who follow paleontology know about less obvious departures from accuracy? That’s a problem, as Isaac Schultz notes an article in Gizmodo earlier this week:

Depending on the prompts they are given, AI image generators are not currently capable of intaking this complex and varied information and producing an image from it with the same fidelity and attention to detail as a human artist. 
Isaac Schultz, “Paleontologists Are Fuming Over AI Depictions of Prehistoric Animals,” Gizmodo, June 10, 2024



As the work of paleoartist and scientific illustrator Gabriel Ugueto illustrates in the video above, when the artist must decide how best to portray the subject, it’s a delicate balance between all-important accuracy and the human touch.
Generative AI as copyright theft
Another issue, of course, is copyright. Generative AI mops up everything available, including copyrighted works.

“Image generative AI is an algorithm for copyright theft,” said Per Ahlberg, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, in a video call with Gizmodo. “What’s even worse is that you can then use this to start driving the people whose work you have stolen and incorporated into your learning algorithm out of business, and this is a major problem because we need to paleoartists—real ones.” 
Schultz, “AI Depictions of Prehistoric Animals”
The paleoartists’ dilemma is one element of the larger, general problem of how to compensate original creators, whether artists or writers, when their work is melded and repurposed in AI-generated output. While new tools that poison an attempted AI image might work for artists, some see the problem as better addressed by new instruments for compensation for creators.
Some paleoartists have taken to X to discuss the problem at #paleoagainstai:

I wasn’t expecting that from this decomposing T. rex model. Pure ridiculousness. 
[In the link below, the decomposed T. rex remains morph into a domestic cat:]
https://x.com/i/status/1759601542028505597Many of my friends & colleagues are artists who dedicate their lives to bringing ancient creatures back to life. It takes skill, passion, & creativity to create something special. #PaleoAgainstAI pic.twitter.com/OdQXyx7HDx— Dr Dean Lomax (@Dean_R_Lomax) February 19, 2024

It’s a challenge the art world must address

Geologist Henry De la Beche‘s 1830 watercolor painting Duria Antiquior – A more Ancient Dorset, based on fossils found by Mary Anning/Public Domain
It’s no surprise that paleoart became a fixture of science reporting back in the nineteenth century. It would be difficult for most laypeople to take much interest in prehistoric life without visual depiction. Would the tyrannosaur have become a cultural icon, instantly recognizable, if we had to rely only on written descriptions for accuracy? Hardly.
Moving with the times includes finding new ways to compensate the creativity that computational systems such as generative AI depend on.
You may also wish to read: Artists strike back!: New tool “poisons” images pirated by AI. Nightshade, developed by University of Chicago computer science prof Ben Zhao, makes the AI generator keep giving you a cat when you ask for a dog. Overall, Nightshade may prove more useful than lawsuits to artists. It is embedded in pixels, visible only to AI, not to humans.
andGenerative AI is creating a copyright crisis for artists. How does an artist assert copyright when her image was only one of many used to create a new image? How does she make a living if she can’t? AI companies could be required to record images’ origin and compensate copyright holders. But as Robert J. Marks notes, end users might then have to pay.

  Future Skills OrganisationNew report indicates VET qualifications in marketing and communications, conveyancing and insurance broking may be most impactedA new report by the Future Skills Organisation (FSO) and Mandala Partners proposes an approach to help identify the finance, technology and business Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualifications most likely to be impacted by generative artificial intelligence (AI).Released today, the ‘Building an AI-Enabled Workforce: Priority Framework’ report suggests that qualifications in marketing and communications, conveyancing, and insurance broking are highly exposed to the impact of generative AI.CEO of the Future Skills Organisation Patrick Kidd OBE OAM said, “As the Jobs and Skills Council for Australia’s finance, technology, and business sectors, we are keen to understand how the training system needs to respond to the impact of generative AI and when. This report helps to identify which areas we should look at first.”The report draws on the FSO’s previous research that identified the generative AI exposure of occupations and VET qualifications across the finance, technology and business sectors, as well as the types of skills most likely to be impacted by generative AI.“A recurring theme during our recent National Forum on skills in the finance, tech and business sectors was the need to recognise the impact of emerging technologies like generative AI in our education and skilling programmes. 1 in 5 Australians work in these sectors; it’s important we are responsive to these changes,” Mr Kidd said.“This research helps to identify the highest priority areas for attention when we collaborate with training providers and industry to help ensure our VET qualifications reflect the needs of the economy.”Leading economic research consulting firm Mandala Partners conducted the research, with Director Tom McMahon recounting the methodology.“We expanded on our earlier research with the Future Skills Organisation, which assessed the exposure to generative AI in VET courses in finance, technology, and business. This report expands on that analysis by creating a prioritisation methodology that determines a qualification’s relative economic impact. This approach can assist the FSO focus their efforts on the most important areas,” Mr McMahon said.“Our industries are at the vanguard of innovation, and generative AI is already making a huge influence on the workplace. However, it is still early days, and we need to better grasp what this means for the skills required. There’s a lot to ponder. This framework will help us identify the topics we should focus on initially. And this will assist drive the results that are likely to have the largest impact,” Mr Kidd said.You can find a copy of the full report attached.

However, 61% of respondents say they are pushing their organisation to adopt generative AI more quickly than some people are comfortable with.The findings also revealed that nearly two-thirds (63%) of surveyed CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, but few understand how generative AI adoption impacts their organisation’s workforce and culture, IBM said in a statement.More than half (56%) of respondents have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees. Yet, 51% of CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI roles that did not exist last year, while 47% expect to reduce or redeploy their workforce in the next 12 months because of generative AI.“There is incredible excitement around generative AI, and CEOs want to move beyond the AI hype to deliver business impact. Yet, without the right people and culture in place, progress will be slow,” said&nbsp;Matt Candy, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting.“As they embed generative AI in their enterprise strategy, it’s critical that executives build a cultural mindset that fosters adoption and lead people through the changes.”Other key study findings include:Workforces are straining under the pressure of generative AI adoption40% of CEOs surveyed plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI.Yet, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles.CEOs surveyed say 35% of their workforce will require retraining and&nbsp;reskilling over the next three years – up from just 6% in 2021.CEOs recognise it takes a cultural shift to successfully scale AI, but face organisational collaboration and adoption challenges65% of CEOs surveyed say their organisation’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet nearly half (48%) say competition among their&nbsp;C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration.Most (81%) CEO respondents say that inspiring their team with a common vision produces better outcomes. At the same time, 37% acknowledge that their employees don’t fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.57% of those surveyed acknowledge that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven organisation than overcoming technical challenges1.CEOs cite generative AI adoption as being critical to success, but nearly two-thirds (64%) of surveyed CEOs say their organisation must take advantage of technologies that are changing faster than people can adapt.CEOs indicate the benefits of rapid technology adoption outweigh potential risksMore than two-thirds (68%) of CEOs surveyed agree that governance for generative AI must be established as solutions are designed, rather than after they are deployed.Although 75% of CEOs surveyed say trusted AI is impossible without effective AI governance in their organisation, only 39% say they have good generative AI governance in place today.At the same time, 62% of CEO respondents say they will take more risk than the competition to maintain competitive edge, with half (51%) agreeing that the risk of falling behind is driving them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value1.67% of surveyed CEOs say the productivity gains from automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.While today 71% of surveyed CEOs are no further than generative AI piloting and experimentation, 49% expect to be driving growth and expansion by 2026.Product and service innovation is a top priority, but a focus on short-term targets might be hindering long-term progressCEOs surveyed ranked product and service innovation as their highest priority for the next three years – up from sixth place in 2023.41% of respondents say they are willing to sacrifice operational efficiency for greater innovation.However, a majority of CEOs surveyed point to a focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.Today, only 36% of the CEOs surveyed are primarily funding their generative AI investments with net new IT spend, with the remaining 64% reducing other technology spend.To view the full study, including actionable strategies to help organisations navigate the complexity of generative AI adoption, visit:&nbsp;https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo This article was provided by IBM Malaysia.

Long before the current craze surrounding generative AI (Gen AI), the energy sector employed traditional artificial intelligence through its use of data to identify oil and gas deposits.But the industry sees even greater potential to save money, reduce accidents and lower greenhouse gases through Gen AI, which exponentially increases and diversifies the data that can be analyzed.The new AI programs can also be employed broadly in the workforce instead of being limited to programmers and data analysts, as has been the case with traditional AI.""Extracting this data from the copious amounts of data generated by drilling activities has historically posed a significant challenge for industry leaders,"" recently wrote Tim Hafke, content marketing specialist with AlphaSense. ""That's where Gen AI comes in.""Read alsoApple partners with OpenAI as it unveils 'Apple Intelligence'In recent years the downstream industry, which includes refineries that process crude oil into gasoline, has increasingly relied on so-called digital twins -- computer-modeled replicas of actual facilities.PAY ATTENTION: Work, Family, Education?

Enroll Today!They allow companies to run simulations to assess operational issues in real-life facilities, mitigate potential hazards and do predictive maintenance (PdM).PdM uses historical and current data to project future performance and determine when parts should be taken down for maintenance or replaced.Microsoft vice president Matthew Kerner sees this as an entry point to generative AI, a way ""to explain why the predictive model is making that prediction"" and provide context to better address the situation, he explained during a panel discussion at energy conference CERAWeek.""Gen AI is useful as a bolt on to some other more predictive AI systems,"" Kerner said.Read alsoApple to break AI silence at developers conferenceNext-generation chatbots similar to the world-famous ChatGPT can also be of help for employees on the ground, said Rob McGreevy, of industry software company Aveva, during the panel.The data-filled chatbot could allow oil field or refinery workers encountering a problem to measure atmospheric conditions like humidity and operational performance like wellhead pressure to quickly diagnose the issue, McGreevy said.Getting a detailed report in seconds allows for a quick fix -- saving time and money in the process. 'Less risk' During refinery maintenance, ""you're putting people in dangerous situations to do work. If you can do those turnarounds faster, you're exposing yourself to less risk,"" said Matthew Babin, head of energy and natural resources at software company Palantir Technologies.Gen AI can provide ""context to people who are in the process of making a decision, even if it's outside their area of expertise,"" Babin said.""So if I'm a reservoir engineer, I don't have to know about maintenance, but I do have to know about maintenance when I'm looking at how that resource is going to perform and what that costs my organization,"" Babin added.Read alsoChinese robot developers hope for road out of 'uncanny valley'Petroleum installations are regularly checked or taken offline for upkeep.A Gen AI interface provides ""access to a maintenance manual, so you can look at how maintenance for that piece of kit should be done,"" all laid out in plain English, thanks to a chatbot, McGreevy said.Such a system could also facilitate the repair work itself, taking the guesswork out of such decisions.For example, the technology would allow a company to use a computer model of a facility to determine if there is enough room to use a ladder or install scaffolding, McGreevey said.McGreevy said it could also help new employees: ""I think we can shorten dramatically the time it takes for people coming on board to be proficient to safely operate these facilities at scale.""Greater efficiencies linked to Gen AI also create a chance to reduce an oil facility's carbon footprint.

How are you leveraging generative AI while considering its impact on your workforce?

Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We've been exploring various use cases for generative AI, particularly focusing on customer payments and enhancing user experience, all while keeping our workforce in mind. Our goal is to democratize e-commerce for users across different cities and empower our employees with these new tools. We're working on improving the end-user experience during purchases. For instance, we're experimenting with virtual try-ons for products like T-shirts and exploring other use cases to personalize user feeds based on their preferences using language models.
Can you elaborate on the challenges and opportunities you faced while integrating generative AI, specifically regarding your workforce?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: Availability of GPUs for training models and managing the hype versus reality were significant challenges. We've been working on this even before it gained widespread attention. It's crucial to ensure a positive ROI and scalability. Cost efficiency is vital, especially in a price-focused market like ours. In terms of workforce impact, we view generative AI as an opportunity to upskill our employees and make them more productive. We're focusing on providing them with the necessary training and tools to collaborate effectively with AI.
How does Meesho ensure ethical AI practices and handle biases while considering the workforce?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We prioritize data governance and minimize biases by controlling data inputs. Our data science team ensures that only relevant and ethical data is used. We avoid external data sources to maintain objectivity and focus on enhancing user experience ethically. This approach also protects our workforce from potential biases that could be introduced through external data.
How do you measure ROI and success metrics for AI deployments, considering the workforce impact?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We tie AI initiatives to business metrics and conduct thorough experimentation before full deployment. Monitoring business metrics alongside control metrics is crucial. We scale up gradually, ensuring positive impacts on business goals while also measuring how AI is affecting employee productivity and satisfaction.
What advice would you give to companies incorporating generative AI, focusing on workforce considerations?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: Start with small, domain-specific models aligned with business goals. Experiment, measure impact, and scale gradually. Focus on tangible outcomes rather than deploying AI for the sake of it. Ensure a clear understanding of the business metrics you aim to influence. When it comes to your workforce, prioritize upskilling and focus on collaboration between your employees and AI tools.
Could you name some tools Meesho uses for generative AI?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We use platforms from Google and Microsoft, along with our in-house ML platform, for for generative AI tasks.
How did the incorporation of generative AI impact your workforce?

The common theme we’ve been hearing from all quarters in recent times is artificial intelligence is the job-killer, accompanied by scary headlines. “AI is going to eliminate way more jobs than anyone realizes,” screamed a headline in Business Insider last August. “AI is replacing human tasks faster than you think,” CNN recently blared. Everywhere are lists of jobs AI is or will soon be replacing, such as this dour piece from MSN: “24 Careers AI Might Take Over: Will Your Job Survive?” “While your job may be safe for now, there’s no guarantee you’ll be set for the future,” the author gloomily predicts.


However, it appears workers didn’t get the memo — or pile of memos. In recent surveys, there is scant evidence of fear and loathing among the workers who may see their jobs shift as AI looms greater on the scene. Most workers, in fact, seem pleased that AI will be assisting them in their pursuits.

For example, a new survey of 6,000 employees by Salesforce finds 77% of today's workers trust AI, and even want AI to do almost half of their work tasks. Leading categories for trust in completely autonomous work tasks include writing code (trusted by 15%), uncovering data insights (13%), and drafting written communications (12%), and acting as a personal assistant (12%).

PROMOTED
Likewise, only five percent of 150,735 workers responding to a survey out of Boston Consulting Group expressed fear that AI would eliminate their jobs. On the other hand, 25% expected no impact on their jobs, and another 49% said AI may change some tasks.

A majority of 56,600 workers surveyed by PwC also expect a positive impact from AI as well. At least 31% anticipate that AI will increase their productivity and efficiency, while 21% expect AI to create new job opportunities.

Workers today already trust AI to do roughly 43% of their work tasks, the Salesforce survey shows. Close to eight in ten, 77%, of workers will eventually trust AI to operate autonomously. Ten percent even trust autonomous AI today, while 26% will trust autonomous AI in less than three years.

Nearly 40% of employees use generative AI tools regularly, the BCG survey observes. They do not fear generative AI, either — most say that they will need help to understand what skills to build.
Trust is the key. Workers want to be involved in the process of rolling out AI to fulfill tasks. At least 63% seek to have more say over AI implementation decisions, the Salesforce survey shows. At issue is the fact that 54% say they do not know how AI is implemented or governed in their workplace. Training may be another key to trusted autonomy: 62% of workers say more skill-building and training opportunities would build their trust in AI.
Workers who currently use generative AI do so for simple activities such as research, administration, and translation, BCG finds — “uses that are akin to replacing Google with genAI,” the survey’s authors observe.
Workers using generative AI the most frequently are leveraging it for their core work tasks, not just for general administrative work and research, the BCG authors add. “Personal GenAI applications most often involve finding facts and gaining general knowledge (40%), developing skills and learning (38%), or translating material from other languages (33%).”
Outside of the workplace, people are using generative AI a career advancement or job-search tool, using it to develop résumés and cover letters, for example.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at New York University Abu Dhabi invites applicants to apply for the open Postdoc position in the Project Collaborative Multi-Robot Swarms in Unknown Environments.</p>

<p>CAIR invites qualified applicants with a doctorate degree in the areas of electrical, or computer, or mechanical engineering, or related field to apply. A strong publication record is encouraged and previous experience in areas such as Distributed control and optimization, Swarms, Autonomous Robots, Embedded systems development, Collaborative and adversarial control, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is desired. The position is open to PhDs with background in robotics, controls, AI, and/or computer vision. The candidate is expected to work in a highly collaborative multi-disciplinary environment with other post-doctoral associates, PhD and undergraduate students, as well as faculty members. It is expected that applicants have a strong publication record in the aforementioned areas.  The applicants are also expected to have strong analytical, communication, and writing skills.</p>

<p>The successful applicant will work on several projects including development of distributed multi-agent autonomous systems and related technologies. This will include development of distributed monitoring algorithms enabling agents in a multi-agent swarm to autonomously locate other agents in its neighborhood, analyze their behavior, and probabilistically predict future motions/behaviors. As part of this work, the successful applicant will work on sensor data processing and data fusion, dynamics modeling and estimation, multi-agent collaboration algorithms, and inter-agent distributed introspection of agent behaviors to detect behavioral modifications (e.g., due to malfunctions and/or attackers). The algorithmic development will need to take into account various uncertainties and possible adversarial elements wherein some agents in a swarm have been modified by an adversary. The work will include algorithm design, prototype implementation (e.g., in Matlab/Python), deployment (to the agents’ autopilots using the Robot Operating System), and experimental testing (on unmanned vehicle swarms).</p>

<p>A solid competency with the standard implementation tools used in autonomous robots and embedded systems (e.g., C, C++, Linux, MATLAB, Python, Robot Operating System, Ardupilot, Solidworks, Gazebo Physics Engine Simulator) is required.</p>

<p>The terms of employment are very competitive and include housing and educational subsidies for children. Applications will be accepted immediately and candidates will be considered until the position is filled. For consideration, applicants need to submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae with full publication list, degree transcript, statement of research interests, and at least two letters of reference, all in PDF format.

Orby AI, a startup building a generative AI platform to automate repetitive and tedious enterprise work, announced today that it has raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. The company also unveiled its new “large action model” technology that powers its AI agents to learn and automate complex business processes.
“We are launching our Series A fundraise—it’s $30 million,” said Bella Liu, co-founder and CEO of Orby AI, in an interview with VentureBeat. “Alongside it, we’re also announcing our big platform technology. We call it a ‘large action model’ — if you can imagine, it’s like a GPT-type of model — it’s really, really big. The input is all the actions the model observes, and the output is the code you can use to automate the work.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Orby AI’s generative AI platform aims to differentiate itself from traditional robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. “Traditional solutions are still mostly built based on rules. In real processes, there are just so many different scenarios, especially when the process becomes complex,” explained Liu. “What we do is fundamentally different because this is using foundation models, it’s generative AI powered, and we can actually automate very complex processes that are not just based on rules.”
Generative process automation: The next frontier in AI-powered productivity
The company is coining the term “generative process automation” to describe its new paradigm. Orby AI’s platform uses multi-modal inputs like screenshots, clicks, and keystrokes to train its large action models. The AI can then generate scripts and code to automate workflows, while still involving human employees for feedback and handling edge cases.
Liu shared a customer example of Fortune 500 auditors using Orby AI to audit millions of employee expense receipts, which normally takes 10-15 minutes per receipt. “The auditor just needs to install Orby and show it what they do. With just one iteration, Orby can already create a workflow with code behind the scenes. When Orby is unsure about some really complex case, it will pop up a window to ask the human auditor for feedback.”
Investors bet big on Orby AI’s vision for enterprise generative AI adoption
The Series A funding will be used for continuous product development and go-to-market expansion. Orby AI is currently focused on serving large enterprise customers, with traction in industries like technology, insurance, consumer goods, and real estate. The company sees the most adoption in back-office functions like finance, accounting, HR and operations.
As generative AI continues to advance, solutions like Orby AI have the potential to dramatically improve efficiency and productivity for data-intensive enterprise workflows. By combining the power of large language models with grounded multi-modal inputs and human feedback, Orby’s approach points to a future where AI works closely alongside human employees to automate complex knowledge work.advertisement
However, as with any automation technology, companies will need to carefully manage the transition and potential impacts on jobs and roles. “I actually think this is going to create a lot more jobs,” said Liu. “When we automate work, it actually makes the human more valuable, because now the human has more leverage… they can do more.”
The $30 million in fresh funding suggests that investors are bullish on the enterprise applications of generative AI and Orby’s approach in particular. As more companies look to harness the technology, Orby AI aims to establish itself as a leader in AI-powered enterprise process automation.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IN A MINUTE OR LESS
Generative AI or “GenAI” is already transforming how we handle discovery in numerous ways, including:

Providing faster access to meaningful information and key documents to help quickly understand and develop critical case strategies;
Summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of data to isolate key documents and narratives without the need for review of every document; and
Generating substantive outputs like privilege logs and deposition digests in shorter amounts of time, allowing increased focus elsewhere.

As a tool designed to connect the dots in data, recognize patterns, and even reason like humans, GenAI “thinks” like you do. If you know how to ask questions, give instructions, and provide feedback, you already know how to use GenAI. In a minute or less, here is what you need to know about working with GenAI in discovery.
Cutting Through the Noise
As data volumes and sources continue to increase, tools that can help sift through data quickly and accurately—finding key documents that support the offensive and defensive narratives of the case—are invaluable. Whereas e-Discovery practitioners have been using AI for decades for just this purpose, the advent of GenAI allows a more interactive and iterative experience with data.
For example, GenAI tools embedded in document review databases can query an entire database to find very specific documents or document sets. Questions like “Are there any documents that indicate that Company A misrepresented its financial performance to investors?” or “Were there internal meetings or conversations at Company A around 1 June 2021 regarding the company’s financials?” can immediately identify key documents and data patterns without needing to rely on search terms. GenAI is designed to eliminate the so-called fishing expeditions we often go on in discovery in order to find those critical pieces of evidence that can make or break a case. 
Rapid Data Synthesis and Outputs
Similarly, a staple of GenAI tools is the ability to summarize large amounts of data—oftentimes in minutes. Whereas we used to have to rely on humans to read and review every document on a particular topic and manually create summaries, GenAI can now do it to requested outputs.
Whether requesting a high-level summary of customer service calls for a product at issue in a matter, a detailed summary of a witness’s disciplinary record and HR file within a company, or a bulleted list of a deponent’s inconsistencies during testimony, GenAI will listen to your prompting and instructions and provide the foundation necessary to build your case.
With proper guidance and input from humans, GenAI tools can generate content such as privilege logs and deposition or witness interview outlines in a fraction of the time that it would take to do it manually. For example, GenAI can use parameters for privilege descriptions and claims, apply those to the designated corpus of data, and create a log or analyze designated key data about a witness.
Practical Tips for Working With GenAI
Learn the Lingo
As with all new technology, it is important to learn key terms and concepts to ensure proper understanding and facilitate effective communication, both with the tool and with your colleagues and clients.

Large Language Models: Models trained on vast amounts of data to create the foundation of a generative AI tool.
Prompt engineering: The (typically iterative) process of designing inputs for AI tools to create the desired output.
Hallucinations: Outputs generated by an AI tool that are inaccurate or misleading but presented as correct.
Machine Learning: A form of AI in which computers and tools learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so and with minimal human intervention. 

Give it a Try
While it may be daunting, the only way to learn about GenAI is to try it out. The tools are designed to interact with users as if they are also human. You can talk to these tools like humans (even “please” and “thank you”), ask direct questions like they are humans, and provide instructions as you would a colleague. GenAI tools can tell you what else you might want to ask it or what else you might need to know that you haven’t thought of yet.
Practice
There are many GenAI tools available that are great options for honing your skills and confidence. With no need for formal training (although this is available as well), simply start asking questions or giving instructions and assess your results.
Be Bossy and Demand Satisfaction
The tool won’t mind if you’re a little demanding. A key to successful reliance on GenAI is clarity in your prompt and iteration to a satisfactory result. If you are not satisfied with the initial (or the second, third, or tenth) results, say so and ask the tool to try again based on revised instruction.
Know Its Limitations
GenAI is designed to work with human interaction and oversight. It should never replace human judgment or eliminate ethical responsibilities and considerations. Trust but verify!

The public release of ChatGPT in April 2022 sparked a wave of fear and excitement among educators. While some expressed hesitation about the ability of generative artificial intelligence to make cheating undetectable, others pointed to its potential to provide real-time, personalized support for teachers and students, making differentiated learning finally seem possible after decades of unmet promises. 
Today, that potential has begun to come to fruition. Recent national survey data indicate 18% of teachers have used genAI, mostly to support differentiated lesson planning, and 56% of educators believe its use in schools will continue to grow. Increasingly, districts are introducing students to this technology, with products like Khanmigo — which provides individualized tutoring — already being adopted in Indiana, Florida and New Jersey. And students are experimenting with it outside the classroom as well. According to a recent survey, approximately half of 14- to 22-year-olds report having used genAI at some point.
But rapid changes in technology and the speed of adoption are far outpacing the field’s understanding of impacts on teaching and learning. Every day there is a new story about an exciting AI-related development, but given the time it takes to conduct careful evaluation, very limited evidence exists about whether any of these tools have positive benefits for students. As schools start facing hard choices about where to spend their resources in response to continued learning gaps and the ESSER funding cliff, it’s important to take a look at what we know about the impact of genAI on education and what more we need to learn. 
What we know
Educators spend about 46% percent of their time on tasks that don’t directly involve teaching, ranging from taking attendance and submitting reports to giving written feedback to students. Gen AI tools hold promise for speeding up and even automating these tasks, saving time that could be spent building meaningful relationships and deepening learning. For example, researchers from UC Irvine found that teachers in California and North Carolina who used the genAI product Merlyn Mind, which automates test question creation and lesson planning, reported spending less time on administrative tasks and more on teaching and learning after seven weeks of use compared to educators without access to the tool. And about 44% of teachers who have used genAI agree the technology has made their job easier. 
Related4 Things Districts Should Do Right Now — Before the Fiscal Cliff
To date, however, most of these findings rely on anecdotal reports. To quantify the impact of genAI on time saved, the field needs more rigorous evidence — such as through randomized controlled trials — to not only gauge the impact on administrative burden but to explore whether these tools help improve teaching quality. 
A separate body of research is finding that genAI-based coaching tools, which aim to give regular, impartial, real-time feedback in a cost-effective way, can have small effects on targeted teacher practices. For example, researchers at Stanford and the University of Maryland developed “M-Powering Teachers,” an automated coaching tool that uses natural language processing to give educators feedback. Across two randomized controlled trials, the tool was shown to reduce teacher-directed talk, increased student contributions and improved completion of assignments. Another study found that feedback provided via TeachFX, an app that uses voice AI to assess key indicators of classroom quality, increased teachers’ use of focusing questions that probe students’ thinking by 20%. 
Another randomized controlled trial found a genAI-enabled coaching tool that provided targeted feedback increased the quality of math tasks assigned to students and created a more coherent learning environment. Perhaps more impressive, the feedback resulted in a small positive improvement in students’ knowledge of ratios and proportional relationships, the area it focused on. 
These studies show early promise, but the impacts they found have been small. As AI-enabled coaching products for teachers start to expand to more classrooms, more evaluation is needed to better understand the potential of genAI to truly improve teaching and, ultimately, student learning. 
What we need to learn
Despite early evidence that AI has potential to make teachers’ jobs a bit easier and professional development more effective, the verdict is still out on whether having students interact directly with genAI can improve academic and social-emotional outcomes. These technologies, especially in education, are changing rapidly, making rigorous studies challenging. This point was recently made by the Alliance for Learning Innovation in calling on Congress to budget almost $3 billion to address the issue.
RelatedAI & Schools: 4 Ways Artificial Intelligence Can Help Students
While some tools — like Khan Academy’s Khanmigo (which has received funding from Overdeck Family Foundation) — are based on evidence that personalized learning can support better outcomes for some students, and some emerging research indicates that hybrid AI-human tutoring may boost achievement, it is not yet clear whether genAI tools themselves can strengthen and supplement student learning. As these types of products move into classrooms, there is a clear need for families, educators and policymakers to demand proof that they improve outcomes and do not unintentionally harm students most in need of effective support by providing incorrect guidance and feedback. 
This is an exciting moment for education, with transformative technology finding its way into all our lives in a way that hasn’t been seen since the introduction of smartphones. Yet much research on genAI does not consider the types of ed tech products schools are actually buying. Instead, it comes from lab-based studies and tools that are not actually used or tested in the classroom. 
RelatedAI Will Not Transform K-12 Education Without Changes to 'the Grammar of School'
Now is the time — before these technologies become pervasive — to rigorously evaluate what is being sold into and used in schools. The goal of educators should always be to ensure that students have the most effective tools for learning, not merely those with the best sales pitch.

AI Robotic Process Automation Companies
The fields of robotics and automation existed long before AI became a viable business solution. However, early uses of robotics—notably in auto factories—were merely devices programmed to perform the same task again and again. The more recently developed field of robotic process automation (RPA) makes full use of AI.
RPA vendors develop AI-based software that learns and automatically performs routine office productivity tasks. For instance, an office manager who has to gather files for a weekly report can set up an RPA automation to do that routine task so they can focus on higher-value work.
While many large companies offer RPA as part of their overall portfolio—notably SAP, ServiceNow, and IBM—the vendors in this category specialize in creating intelligent automation and RPA solutions to boost productivity.

AI Industry Organizations
These industry organizations for the AI sector play a number of roles. First and foremost, they advocate for the regulation of artificial intelligence. This is an enormously important focus, given how AI’s exponential growth will affect everything around it. To what extent can we as a society impose guidelines on AI’s growth, which has thus far been driven by pure profit?
These groups also lobby for greater diversity in AI, which is essential. We’ve already seen that AI systems embody legacy bias; this must be corrected more proactively to create inclusive systems. Additionally, these AI organizations support cross-vendor development of AI to promote the overall advancement of the technology.

Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
Founded in 1979, the AAAI is an international scientific group focused on promoting responsible AI use, improving AI education, and offering guidance about the future of AI. It gives out a number of industry awards, including the AAAI Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity, which provides $1 million to promote AI’s efforts to protect and enhance human life.

Visit AAAI


AI4Diversity
This nonprofit’s motto is “Leveraging AI, education, and community-driven solutions to empower diversity and inclusion.” AI4Diversity was founded by Steve Nouri, a social media influencer and AI evangelist at Wand. Given that AI platforms have been found to perpetuate the bias of their creators, this focus on diversity and inclusion is essential.

Black in AI
Founded in 2017, Black in AI is a technology research and advocacy group dedicated to increasing the presence of black tech professionals in artificial intelligence. Black in AI notes that “representation matters,” and that AI algorithms are trained on data that reflects a legacy of discrimination, so promoting black voices in AI development is crucial to the technology’s growth.

AI Now Institute
AI Now Institute creates policy research to address the concentration of power in the tech world. Their report Confronting Tech Power notes that “there is no AI with big tech,” and that “a handful of private actors have accrued power and resources that rival nation-states while developing and evangelizing artificial intelligence as critical social infrastructure.”

Visit AI Now Institute


The Alan Turing Institute
Funded by the UK government, The Alan Turing Institute produces research that addresses crucial issues in artificial intelligence, society, and the economy and collaborates with businesses and public groups to use the research to deal with pressing concerns. That this group is government-funded raises a major question: Will more governments around the world step up to fund groups that prompt the AI sector to work for greater social good?

Visit The Alan Turing Institute


The Rockefeller Foundation
While AI is only one of many focuses for this famed nonprofit, the Rockefeller Foundation is quite active in the AI sector; for example, one of its core focuses is the responsible governance of AI. The organization issued a report called AI+1: Shaping Our Integrated Future, which is based on conclusions from a diverse group of experts who seek to deploy machine learning for positive social impact. Additionally, the foundation makes grants, including donating $500,000 to Black in AI.

Bottom Line: AI Companies
This list of AI companies is, admittedly, a partial portrait. In truth, it’s a blurry snapshot of something whizzing by too fast to completely capture. The generative AI landscape in particular changes daily, with a slew of headlines announcing new investments, fresh solutions, and surprising innovations.
The progress of artificial intelligence won’t be linear because the nature of AI technology is inherently exponential. Today’s hyper-sophisticated algorithms, devouring more and more data, learn faster as they learn. It’s this exponential pace of growth in artificial intelligence that makes the technology’s impact so impossible to predict—which, again, means this list of leading AI companies will shift quickly and without notice.
As investment pours in, the underlying technologies that fuel artificial intelligence are each seeing their own rocket blasts of innovation. Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, generative AI—legions of researchers and developers are creating a remarkable profusion of generative AI use cases. In sum, the lifecycle for these AI companies is not so much digital transformation as digital revolution, and the next version of this list is likely to look completely different.

According to a recent survey from Microsoft, 71% of business leaders said they were more willing to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. About 77% of leaders said AI will help early career workers take on more responsibilities.Yet students don't see AI as a ticket to full-time employment. According to Handshake's data, most students are still using the technology for personal tasks or fun. One recent graduate told Handshake they were ""hesitant to use generative AI because it doesn't seem 'officially' accepted or commonplace yet, and I would feel lazy and guilty for using it to do work for me.""

The corporate world, however, is rushing to use AI in part because it can take on the tasks no one else wants to do. So it's up to schools to help students embrace the technology, Valerie Capers Workman, the chief talent officer at Handshake, told Business Insider. ""I believe that in three years, every role will require tech skills, regardless of the field,"" she said. ""So it's more critical than ever that institutions and employers support upskilling and provide training opportunities.""

The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) presents both exciting possibilities and significant challenges for the future of work. This article delves deeper into how HR can play a pivotal role in making companies and employees not just ready, but thrive, in this new environment.GenAI: Transforming HR FunctionsGenAI, a powerful form of AI that can create entirely new content, has the potential to revolutionize core HR functions. Imagine streamlining recruitment with AI-powered candidate screening that identifies top talent based on not just resumes but also writing style or coding proficiency. Envision personalized learning and development through intelligent chatbots that tailor training plans to individual needs and learning preferences. These are just a few examples of how GenAI can free up HR professionals from repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic initiatives.HR: The Bridge Between Technology and TalentWhile GenAI offers undeniable benefits, successful integration requires a human-centric approach. HR must become the bridge between this powerful technology and the very people it aims to impact. Here's a detailed breakdown of key strategies:&bull; Future-Proofing the Workforce: Conduct a skills gap analysis to identify areas where AI-related skills are lacking. Develop comprehensive upskilling programmes that prepare employees for collaboration with AI tools. Josh Bersin, a leading HR thought leader, emphasizes, ""The key to success in the AI era is not to fight the machines, but to work alongside them."" Equip your workforce with the skills to leverage AI's capabilities, not be replaced by them.&bull; Building Trust and Transparency: Open communication is crucial. Educate employees about GenAI's role within the organization, addressing concerns about job displacement or bias head-on. Foster a culture of lifelong learning and continuous improvement by highlighting the opportunities GenAI presents for career growth and development. Organize town hall meetings or create internal communication campaigns to ensure transparency throughout the process.&bull; Developing Ethical Frameworks: Establish clear guidelines on responsible AI use in HR practices. This includes ensuring data privacy by adhering to regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Implement measures to mitigate bias in algorithms by using diverse training data sets and employing human oversight during the decision-making process. Develop a robust ethical framework that prioritizes fairness and transparency in all AI-powered HR practices.Leading the GenAI Transformation: A Practical ApproachHR departments must take a proactive stance in leading the GenAI transformation. Here are specific actions you can take:&bull; Partnering with IT: Collaboration between HR and IT is essential. Establish a strong working relationship to ensure the selection, implementation, and maintenance of GenAI tools align with both HR and IT objectives.&bull; Data Governance: Develop robust data governance practices to ensure high-quality training data for AI algorithms. This minimizes bias and discrimination in decision-making processes. Emphasize data security and implement measures to protect sensitive employee information.&bull; Measuring Success: Define clear metrics to track the impact of GenAI on HR processes, employee experience, and business outcomes. This could include metrics around time saved during recruitment, increased employee satisfaction with learning and development programmes, or improved efficiency in performance management processes. Regularly monitor and analyse these metrics to determine the success of your GenAI implementation.Success Stories: Real-World Examples of GenAI in ActionSeveral companies are already reaping the benefits of GenAI in HR:&bull; Hilton: Hilton leverages GenAI to personalize onboarding experiences for new hires. The AI tailors content and recommendations based on individual roles and career goals, ensuring a smoother and more engaging transition into the company.&bull; PwC: PwC utilizes GenAI chatbots to answer employee questions about benefits and company policies 24/7. This frees up HR professionals to handle more complex inquiries and provide personalized support to employees.&bull; Bank of America: Bank of America uses GenAI to analyse employee performance data and identify areas for coaching and development. This data-driven approach allows HR to provide targeted interventions that can significantly boost employee performance.These examples showcase the power of GenAI to enhance the employee experience, streamline HR operations, and unlock valuable insights for talent development.The Future of HR: More Human Than EverGenAI is not a replacement for HR professionals. It's a powerful tool that can augment our capabilities. By embracing GenAI and focusing on strategic people management, HR can position itself as a vital driver of innovation and employee success in the age of artificial intelligence.ConclusionThe future of HR is one where humans and AI work together in a symbiotic relationship. By proactively preparing companies and employees for GenAI, HR can ensure a smooth transition and unlock the vast potential of this technology to create a more efficient, engaging, and future-proof workplace. In the future workforce, humans will need to leverage their creativity, empathy, and judgment alongside the efficiency and scale of AI. By embracing this future, HR can lead the way toward a more human-centred and successful future of work.The author, Samridha Pandey, is Associate Director - HR Business Partner at VVDN Technologies.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

Samsung is unveiling ‘AI Class’, devices that can realistically help with everyday household chores, communication and leisure, thanks to advanced features using artificial intelligence. The devices will be easy to spot thanks to the special ‘AI Class’ label, which will mainly be found on household appliances and TVs. During a special press conference summarising the launch of the entire group of AI Class products – Jowita Michalska , known online as ‘Jowita Digital’ – an expert in AI, founder and CEO of Digital University – highlighted the advantages and opportunities of using AI in our everyday life.
AI is no longer a distant vision but an integral part of our everyday life. Also the domestic one. The future of artificial intelligence development should be based on the synergy between people and technology. And that is exactly what Samsung’s new AI class is. Through the use of the latest technology in devices, we have a real help for knowledge, communication, entertainment, housework, saving water, resources or energy, and even increasing security! Increasingly, we will also be the ones teaching the AI our habits and adapting it even better to our needs. This will give us time for pleasure, relaxation and the all-important self-development of today, concludes Jowita Michalska.
Samsung started working on AI 10 years ago. Today, it introduces the ‘AI Class’ and crosses the boundary beyond which an extremely large group of devices stands out, which, thanks to artificial intelligence, will help us to better organise our work, home and improve the comfort of our lives. It is already present in 240 household appliances, all Excellence Line 8K, OLED, Neo QLED, QLED and The Frame TVs from 2023 and 2024, and Galaxy smartphones from the S24 family. It has also made its way into the Galaxy Z Flip5 and 4, Z Fold5 and 4, S23 and S22 series and Tab S9 series tablets. Samsung’s air conditioners, medical devices and memory sticks also benefit from its capabilities.
AI from behind the scenes
Preparing a shopping list, finding a unique recipe, choosing the right cooking parameters. Cooking is a pleasure, but it also involves a lot of work, time and energy. Now, thanks to AI in Samsung appliances such as ovens and fridges, for example, we have greater convenience in our daily meal preparation. We are talking here about two flagship technologies: AI Vision and AI Pro Cooking!
The intelligent ‘AI Vision’ camera in Samsung fridges can identify the freshness of up to 33 different foods, and it does so based on an extremely rich database of food images. Based on their analysis by machine learning and the algorithms created, the recognised products appear on the display and “AI Vision” automatically updates their list. Users can set the shelf life of products and receive notifications when the end of their shelf life is approaching. AI therefore not only helps them to save money, but also prevents food waste and encourages an eco-friendly lifestyle. The fridge also has a function to suggest recipes using particular ingredients.
Once we have fresh produce, we can get down to cooking. And this is where the AI Pro Cooking in Samsung ovens comes to the rescue. With the help of the camera, the oven will recognise (the Sense Inside function must be activated from the oven control panel) what is in the oven and then suggest what cooking parameters will be suitable for the dish. In addition, thanks to the SmartThings app installed on your smartphone, you won’t forget that it’s time to switch off the oven, and if a cake has baked a while earlier, you’ll get a notification that it might be burning. So you don’t have to worry about missing out on something with multiple chores. Interestingly, you can also record a ten-second video to summarise the baking process.
The cleaning revolution is coming
It could be argued that AI brings 2-in-1 benefits – it simultaneously streamlines the home management process and helps save energy. A good example in this case are selected Samsung washing machines, already equipped with AI EcoBubble™ technology. It enables efficient and energy-saving washing even at low temperatures. Thanks to an intelligent sensor, the washing machine detects the type of fabric and, based on this, improves the washing performance by dosing the right amount of water and detergent, and then creates an active foam that penetrates the fabrics, making dirt removal up to 24% more efficient. Washing at low temperatures can also reduce energy consumption by up to 70%. Another technology available on selected washing machines to make doing the laundry easier is the ‘AI Optimal Wash’ programme, which uses advanced sensors to determine the weight and type of fabrics and how dirty the load is. This information allows you to optimise the amount of water and detergent used and, as a result, do an effective wash while optimising resource consumption!
And what about vacuuming? AI also finds its applications there. The Bespoke Jet upright hoovers have an AI Vacuuming Mode built in, which recognises the type of surface being cleaned in the mode.  And the latest Samsung Jet Bot Combo AI Steam recognises 3D objects, so you don’t have to clean things off the floor before vacuuming. This model adjusts the suction power and cleaning mode according to the surface, and also allows remote control of the device, such as managing the cleaning schedule.
Save energy at home with AI
Saving energy throughout your home with the click of a button? It’s possible! And it’s all thanks to the AI Energy Mode capabilities in the SmartThings app. How does it work? Imagine a fridge or TV that learns the user’s habits, e.g. how often the door is opened or how and when they watch films, whether in movie mode or dynamic mode. Based on this, the fridge optimises the operation of the appliance through an AI algorithm that adjusts the compressor speed and defrost cycle. Such a Fridge remembers how often we open it, when we put in new products and optimises its energy consumption to consume as little as possible. Thanks to this feature, it can use up to 15% less energy – it’s like being off for seven weeks a year. But AI Energy Mode is not just for fridges. The function can be activated throughout the house, the only condition being that appliances are connected to the SmartThings app. This applies to a select few – washing machines, dryers, dishwashers or televisions, where, in AI Energy Mode, the image is adjusted to the ambient brightness for an optimal visual experience in all lighting conditions. It also adapts to the content by analysing what the user sees and selectively lowers the brightness in key parts of the scene to increase the depth and expression of blacks.

TVs and memories have entered the AI era
The progress Samsung has made in AI technology is well illustrated by the development of the processors used in TVs. The first generation of Samsung TVs to use AI algorithms, the Excellence Line series – used a Neural Quantum chip based on 20 neural networks. The latest – the Neural Quantum 8K Gen3 – already supports 512 such networks (these chips were used in the Samsung Neo QLED QN900D 2024 TV). This is a necessary advance when we want to see more and better on our TVs, as evidenced by the growing popularity of screen diagonals of 65 inches or 75 inches and larger.
AI features on Samsung TVs not only improve the quality of the picture or sound, but also automatically optimise its settings. One of the most important tasks is upscaling, i.e. improving SD, HD content to near 4K quality or, in the case of higher resolution TVs such as the QN900D, to near 8K , sharpening the image and ensuring that the full potential of the processor, resolution and algorithms is used. AI Adaptive Mode automatically adjusts the picture settings according to the type of content being watched, be it a movie, sport or general programme, ensuring the best possible visual experience. Active Voice Amplifier Pro, on the other hand, detects ambient noise and intelligently increases the volume of dialogue so that it is always clear, even when background music or special effects are dominant (a real bane of cinema goers until recently).
Meanwhile, the AI Pro Motion Smoothener function removes the typical problems associated with watching any content with dynamically changing images, such as sporting events – it automatically detects the sport and, based on deep learning algorithms, activates the corresponding moving object detection model. This ensures that the ball is always clear no matter how fast it is moving or what type of competition we are watching. With enhanced deep learning, Image Depth Enhancement Pro adds detail to fast-motion images, using artificial intelligence to precisely control the mini LEDs. By detecting the part of the scene on which the eye would naturally focus, it adds realism and three-dimensionality to images. A similar solution has been developed for gamers. Samsung also keeps gamers in mind. AI Automatic Game Mode – this technology intelligently recognises the type of game being watched and optimises picture and sound quality. With reduced input lag, this also ensures better expression of movement during gaming.
And that’s not all! In order to implement and develop artificial intelligence, it is necessary to process huge amounts of data at high speed. At Samsung, we are continuously expanding products that support AI development such as chips, processors or memory, including Data Centre products and solid-state consumer drives. These components are part of AI devices. They are also part of the drives that each of us can have. We use the same technologies that we implement in Samsung Semiconductors’ advanced processes in every product in our portfolio. This means that any Creator today who creates something working with AI can store that data on our innovative and secure media.
Galaxy AI – the power of artificial intelligence in a smartphone
Since the debut of the Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, which were the first to feature Galaxy AI technology, Samsung has also made AI features available to previous generations of mobile devices. On the Galaxy Z Flip5 and 4, Z Fold5 and 4, S23 and S22 series smartphones and Tab S9 series tablets, you can now enjoy Galaxy AI features that are forever changing the way mobile devices assist us in our daily lives. From facilitated online search with Cirlcle to Search, to Live Translate and Interpreteur  features that allow you to translate conversations and content in real time without the need for external apps; to AI-enabled photo editing (crop, cut, zoom in on objects) – all available off-the-shelf selected on Galaxy mobile devices.

What counts in the workplace is changingBeing appreciated, good relations with colleagues and, of course, a quality relationship between private and professional life. About ten years ago, these three job characteristics were the most sought after among employees. A few years later, a good relationship with a superior entered the most important factors of job satisfaction. In 2021, during the pandemic, people still valued relationships with colleagues and work-life balance the most, but financial compensation gained ground. Mainly at the expense of the fact that income has become less stable and predictable for many people. Today we can see some interesting changes.Source: BCGFor the first time since the Boston Consulting Group monitors trends, security or job security in the first place. Perhaps this data is surprising, because at the same time we are in a period of record low unemployment. When we talk about job security, we are mainly referring to events related to enormous changes in many industries and geopolitical uncertainty. BCG believes that these are not the main reasons, but job security should come first because people are concerned about long-term employability. Here, of course, we are talking about technological disruptions, currently the biggest in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Survey participants who prioritize job security were more likely to report concern about the impact of artificial intelligence.The impact of technological developments on jobs is nothing new. The fact is that generative artificial intelligence raises the level of this disruption to a higher level. The impact is thus felt not only by those who perform repetitive work, but also by others with creative and conceptual professions. Therefore, it is quite logical that other attributes, such as the opportunity for learning and career development, salary and other ""goodies"" offered by employers, are also higher on the list.The global labor market remains confident…In the past few years, the demand for talented employees has increased. Employers continue to report that there is a shortage of suitable labor and, by all accounts, the situation will not change, let alone resolve, any time soon. It is interesting, however, that most participants in the BCG survey remain positive and confident. Namely, they believe that they have strong enough arguments to keep their jobs and everything that belongs to them as part of them. Source: BCG... even in the stage of artificial intelligence developmentAccording to the results of the survey, artificial intelligence is not as much of a threat as many feared. Most employees are not afraid that artificial intelligence could replace them. On the other hand, respondents remain realistic. Most around 70% expect their jobs to change, often a lot, and they expect to have to learn new skills. Only a quarter of participants in the survey believe that artificial intelligence will not affect their jobs. People are accepting generative artificial intelligence and are ready to learn new skillsTo understand how employees think about the future of their careers, employers need to explore their attitudes towards artificial intelligence:86% has heard about generative artificial intelligenceless than 50% have experimented with it at least onceapproximately 39% use it regularly, and 10% respondents use it several times a weekSource: BCGPeople are open to learning new skills. As many as 60% respondents are ready to retrain without basic knowledge, and almost 40% are ready to retrain if necessary.Source: BCGOpenness to retraining is influenced by many factors. Respondents who live in countries where job security is one of the main factors of job satisfaction are the most open to retraining. Their main goal is, of course, to ensure long-term employability. Respondents who believe that generative artificial intelligence will have a greater impact on their jobs—perhaps as a preemptive measure that allows them to completely change job types if necessary—share similar sentiments.About the “Decoding Global Talent” research series""Decoding Global Talent” is the largest source of data on where and how people want to work. It contains almost 900,000 answers on this topic. It is a joint project of BCG, The Network and The Stepstone Group.The current report contains trends and preferences in the field of working methods, including the most valued job attributes, willingness to learn new skills and key factors that would influence the unacceptability of jobs. This year's research focuses specifically on the impact of artificial intelligence. In this year's survey, we explored a new influence on ways of working: GenAI.

WATERVILLE, Maine — If you think artificial intelligence has evolved rapidly recently, you're not wrong, but Dr. Frank Appunn said the technology is still in its infant stages. 

“[We've] got to remember that this is going to change at a tremendous rate and we’re going to find new opportunities coming through,"" the cybersecurity professor at Thomas College explained. 







Appunn has worked in the cybersecurity industry for more than 20 years in the United States and in his home country of South Africa. He also helped launch cybersecurity-related programs at schools across the country. 

He's been a professor for Thomas's Master of Science in Cybersecurity program since it launched in 2019. The program will add an ""Artificial Intelligence Implications for Cybersecurity"" course. The school also has a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in cybersecurity. 

“The cyber issue is going to continue getting bigger, we’ll get help in some places and new pains will occur,"" he said. ""So, it’s a never ending cycle of adjustment, improvement, innovation, and defense.” 

Despite the growth of technology and AI-use, and a broader understanding of them, Appunn said there is still a severe need for skilled workers to work in the industry. That's one reason why Thomas College added the new course to the online program. 

“So gaining a skilled workforce for the benefit of education for the benefit of government, business and military and the rest of it is important, and [we can't] think it’s arrived,"" the professor explained. ""It is still in its initial starting phases with many different types of AI to come down the road.""

While AI can help streamline work tasks or assist business owners, Appunn said it also arms attackers with new tools to carry out cyber attacks and internet hacks. 

In February, an apparent cyberattack compromised several of Northern Light Health's computer servers. A spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine patient records were not on the impacted servers. 

U.S. Senator Angus King, I-Maine, has pushed for legislation to expand cybersecurity safeguards within hospital systems and has also been a part of efforts to expand the cybersecurity workforce by training more veterans interested in related careers.

Just last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warned community water systems around the country about an increasing number of cyberattacks.  

“The cyber students we’re creating [at Thomas College] have the mission of reducing and removing the bad and enabling the good,"" Appunn said. “This is an on-ramp and we can develop a lot further."" 

Moving forward, Appunn said he hopes to expand cybersecurity education into other programs around campus so more students have knowledge about evolving technology and know how to protect against attacks on individuals and organizations.

Key Differences Between Generative AI and Traditional AI
Both generative AI and artificial intelligence, sometimes called “traditional AI,” use machine learning algorithms to obtain their results. However, they have different goals and purposes. Generative AI is intended to create new content, while AI goes much broader and deeper—in essence, to wherever the algorithm coder wants to take it. AI’s possible deployments include better decision-making, removing the tedium from repetitive tasks, or spotting anomalies and issuing alerts for cybersecurity. The following summary spells out the common differences between generative AI and AI:

Focus and Output: Traditional AI focuses on analyzing and interpreting existing data to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making as it operates within predefined boundaries. Generative AI, however, is designed to create text, images, music, and models based on existing data.
Implementation: Traditional AI is primarily used in applications such as predictive analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and autonomous systems. In contrast, generative AI is utilized in creative fields like content creation, design, and entertainment, as well as scientific research where new hypotheses and models are needed.
Transparency: Traditional AI models are generally more transparent and interpretable. Generative AI models, especially those using deep learning techniques, often function as “black boxes,” making their decision-making processes less transparent.
Performance and Efficiency: Generative AI models, particularly large language models like GPT-4, require substantial computational resources and training time, making it more difficult to scale compared to traditional AI, which can be more efficient, especially when dealing with specific, well-defined tasks that do not require extensive model training.
Data Requirements and Training: Generative AI typically requires large datasets for training to ensure the generated content is diverse and high-quality. Traditional AI can often operate effectively with smaller datasets, depending on the complexity of the task and the model used.
Adaptability and Flexibility: Generative AI can adapt to various domains and generate content across different fields. Traditional AI, while adaptable to some degree, often needs very specific training for each unique task or application.

This will allow traditional AI to provide more sophisticated solutions across an expanding array of use cases.
Ethical Considerations 
Generative AI and traditional AI face largely similar challenges in terms of ethics, including biases built into systems, job displacement and potential environmental impact.
Bias and Fairness
AI systems can inadvertently magnify biases that were built into their training data. These biases can lead to unfair outcomes, particularly for marginalized groups. To ensure fairness in AI, whether generative or traditional AI, there needs to be meticulous scrutiny of the training data, implementation of bias mitigation strategies, and continual monitoring of AI systems for biased behavior. Techniques like algorithmic fairness reviews and bias audits are a step toward promoting equity and inclusivity in AI applications​.
Security and Privacy
The security and privacy concerns raised by the deployment of AI technologies are pervasive. AI systems often need vast amounts of data, including personal and sensitive information, to function effectively. Whether generative or traditional, ensuring robust data protection measures and maintaining privacy throughout the AI lifecycle are critical. This includes implementing strong encryption, data anonymization techniques, and complying with regulations such as GDPR. Transparency about data usage and incorporating user consent is also essential in building trust and safeguarding privacy​.
Transparency and Explainability
For the ever-increasing reach and use cases of AI, we need to be able to trust AI and hold the technology accountable–and many users do not trust AI systems. This trust is enabled by transparency in AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) practices allow users and stakeholders to understand how AI algorithms make decisions. By providing clear and understandable explanations of AI processes, organizations can enhance user trust and facilitate better decision-making. A transparent system makes it easy to identify and address any ethical issues and to ensure AI systems are used responsibly​​.
Job Displacement and Economic Impact
One of the greatest concerns about the rise of AI has been job displacement as automated systems replace human roles. Alleviating this issue calls for strategies for transitioning workforces to new or evolved roles, such as reskilling and upskilling programs to prepare employees for roles created by AI advancements. Organizations need to consider the broader social implications of deploying AI solutions and work to implement practices that strike a balance between technological progress and socioeconomic stability.
Environmental Impact
The deployment and training of large AI models, especially generative AI, requires significant computational resources, which leads to substantial energy consumption and environmental impact. Organizations using AI need to develop and implement energy-efficient AI models. They also need to optimize computational resources to minimize carbon footprints. Encouraging sustainable practices in AI development and operation is a must for reducing the environmental impact and promoting green AI technologies​.

Strategic Steps for Implementing AI in Mobile Workforces
AI will increasingly drive workforce transformation by enabling employees to acquire new skills, adapt to changing roles, and embrace lifelong learning. Businesses that have already embraced a culture of innovation, experimentation, and continuous learning – where employees feel empowered to explore new ideas, take risks, and embrace change – are ahead of the game compared to those organizations just now acknowledging that AI is here to stay. While rolling out AI-enabled mobile devices across a workforce requires careful planning, coordination, and implementation by key stakeholders and IT departments, addressing a few considerations will help organizations reap the benefits of an AI-centric mobile workforce and empower the workplace of tomorrow:

Assess needs and requirements: A thorough assessment of the organization’s needs, requirements, and objectives for deploying AI-enabled mobile devices will ensure alignment between the goals of the organization, the IT department and end-users: the employees. Identifying key use cases, user personas, security and compliance requirements and integrating with existing IT infrastructure and business processes will provide guidance for rollout.
Select appropriate devices and technologies: There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach to any IT plan, so it’s critical to evaluate and select AI-enabled mobile devices and technologies that best align with the needs and requirements of each organization as a whole, along with different workflows, tasks, environments, and use cases. For example, if security and data privacy are key concerns for the organization, they should ensure the devices have AI on-device capabilities or allow IT teams to turn off select AI features that do not align with the business’s AI approach, enabling a level of control in line with the organization’s security needs.  
Develop a detailed deployment plan: A comprehensive deployment plan must outline steps, timelines, and resources required for rollout. Defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication channels and setting clear goals and milestones will ensure a smooth rollout, build trust among stakeholders and ensure the concerns and needs of the workforce are considered before the plan is implemented.
Provide training and support: As any IT team can attest, rolling out new technology and devices can be an arduous process. To help it run smoothly, organizations should provide training and support to employees to ensure they are familiar with AI-enabled features and functionalities of their mobile devices. Training sessions, user guides, and online resources can help employees make the most of AI-driven applications and services and ensure they feel comfortable using new tools. Not only will this protect the business’s investment in AI-enabled mobile devices for its workforce, but it will also build trust among employees concerned about job security as AI becomes more prevalent in their workplace.
Implement security measures: Undoubtedly, robust security measures to protect AI-enabled mobile devices and the data they contain from security threats and breaches are the most vital components of the rollout. Monitoring tools and processes to track AI usage on mobile devices can ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

The AI revolution is here: How to optimize AI for HR


June 27, 2024

There’s no doubt that generative AI is reshaping business, work and life as we know it. According to a recent Accenture study, ninety-seven percent of global leaders believe generative AI will be transformative to their company and industry.

Many of the business leaders I’m talking to today are experimenting with generative AI. Leaders are piloting use cases, building policies and collecting feedback. As this exploratory phase continues, one thing is abundantly clear to me: Implementing a generative AI strategy is an HR responsibility just as much as an IT responsibility. That’s because generative AI is a human challenge as much as it is a technology challenge. It’s going to revolutionize how organizations manage talent and will fundamentally change how HR gets work done. We need to embrace that.
HR’s role in generative AI
Every conversation about the benefits of generative AI—productivity, performance, personalization—also leads to important questions about job displacement, data privacy and ethics.
These are innately human issues that point to a need for trust and transparency. Successful generative AI implementation isn’t just about being first; it’s about doing it right. It’s about collaboration, sustainability and driving value—and doing so responsibly. That means being discerning about the needs you’re filling and the pain points you’re solving.
It also means taking the time to build clear policies that address these critical areas:

The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape
Ethical AI and preventing bias
Protecting employee and customer data and privacy
Implementing new org structures and operating models to support AI
Offering training, coaching and resources to teach employees how to use generative AI, and reskilling if parts of their jobs are augmented

HR leaders have a responsibility to lean in and lead, working in close partnership with other leaders across the business, to solve these key challenges and set the vision for the company.
Building a culture that embraces AI
An effective internal generative AI strategy must be clear about the purpose it serves for employees. It should set people up for success, make their jobs easier, and encourage learning and growth. Transforming a business with generative AI is impossible until employees understand how it will transform their work. This requires a relentless focus on change management, enablement and communication.
As leaders, we need to help our employees understand:

Why is generative AI central to the business and people strategy? Will it boost productivity, performance, profitability or experience?
How will generative AI change an employee’s role and how work gets done?
Who is going to be impacted by generative AI?
What are we doing to prepare employees for this transformation? Do we have training in place to help employees build the skills they need? Are we creating new roles or responsibilities for impacted employees?

By 2030, activities that account for up to 30% of hours currently worked across the U.S. economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI, according to McKinsey. This doesn’t have to mean that generative AI will put people out of work.
I like to think of generative AI as an extension of our people that augments the work we’re doing. It can accelerate resume screenings and surface candidates with the right skills so recruiters can focus on high-impact work, like relationship-building. It can personalize onboarding to improve the experience a new employee has from day one. It can summarize employee survey results so teams can easily leverage the most important feedback and act quickly without manually sifting through pages of text. These are just a few examples that show the power of generative AI to transform how organizations manage talent.

If we can build a culture with trust, transparency and training at the foundation, we can create an environment for employees to thrive in partnership with AI. We can empower our people to focus on innovation instead of tactical tasks, to turn imagination into action and to do uniquely human things like create, experiment, empathize and invent. If we can lift our people as we embrace generative AI, the outcomes will be transformative. It is clear to me that generative AI will expand what people can accomplish and vice versa.
Welcome to the generative AI era
Driving lasting impact through generative AI can only be done by investing in the potential of people. We should use technology to augment our work lives so that we can focus on what lies at the very root of being human: innovation and ingenuity.
We are only just beginning to understand generative AI’s vast potential. While the concerns are real and we must have guardrails and guidelines, I’m optimistic it will ultimately empower people and unleash creativity. Every successful transformation I have seen has been people-led and tech-enabled. In the generative AI era, talent—paired with the right technology—is what will set your organization apart.

0Sponsored ArticleWhat Does It Mean To Be Skills-First? Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

From human intelligence collection to information gathered in the open, the CIA is leveraging generative artificial intelligence for a wide swath of its intelligence-gathering mission set today, and plans to continue to expand upon that into the future, according to the agency’s AI lead.
The CIA has been using AI for things like content triage and “things in the human language technology space — translation, transcription — all the types of processing that need to happen in order to help our analysts go through that data very quickly” as far back as 2012, when the agency hired its first data scientists, Lakshmi Raman, the CIA’s director of AI, said during an on-stage keynote interview at the Amazon Web Services Summit on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. 
On top of that, AI — particularly generative AI in recent years — has been an important tool for the CIA’s mission to triage open-source intelligence collection, Raman said.
“Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage AI in order to help us to triage,” she said, adding that generative AI has been successful in helping the CIA “classify and triage open-source events to help us search and discover and do levels of natural language querying with that data.”

Raman said the CIA, despite its clandestine reputation, was not insulated from the “generative AI zeitgeist” that has captivated the world since late 2022. That has resulted in other use cases like “search and discovery assistance, writing assistance, ideation aids, helping us with brainstorming, helping us generate counter-arguments.”
In an interview with FedScoop on the Daily Scoop Podcast earlier this year, Raman described how the CIA navigates using commercial generative AI tools due to the classified, sensitive nature of its work, saying that the agency wants to “use those solutions whenever we can.” However, there are cases with classified data that the agency’s AI specialists must build what Raman called “exquisite solutions for our more bespoke problems.”
With this adoption of generative AI comes added work around creating an environment that it can thrive in and a new, evolved approach to risk, she said Wednesday. 
“In addition to the actual pointy edge-of-the-spear tools, right, we also need the foundational capabilities to help us run and deploy the models,” Raman said at the summit. “We have catalogs for our models, as well as our training data sets. So it’s really about us creating that entire ecosystem for us to be able to leverage this to advance our mission and national security.”
In thinking about risk, Raman said one of her main focuses has been: “How will our users be able to use these technologies in a safe, secure and trustworthy manner?”

“That’s about making sure that they’re able to look at the output and validate it for accuracy,” she said. “And being bias-free, right? We work very closely with our general counsel, as well as our Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, to think about those types of activities. We want to make sure that our users feel very comfortable with it, so they understand that what they’re seeing is AI-generated output.”
What’s ahead for the CIA and generative AI
Raman has a number of things on her mind as she ponders the future of generative AI within the CIA, from how it could become a normal part of each of the agency’s five directorates to the way the country’s top adversaries are also building AI capability for their advantage. But ultimately, she doesn’t see it changing the CIA’s mission beyond it serving as “another tool in our toolbox to help us drive the human-machine teaming that is now so necessary for us to do our jobs.”
“We don’t see AI or technology as anything that is going to replace our workforce. But we see it as something that is going to heavily augment our workforce, and help us accelerate our velocity in completing tasks so that we can leverage our minds for higher-order work,” she said. “So we definitely see AI as something —  and generative AI particularly — as something that can be incorporated into workflows all across the agency to help us augment our own judgment and move through our workflows faster.”
As such, Raman said she anticipates AI and AI-focused work roles to permeate functions across the CIA.

“We have a very broad mission at the CIA. We have five directorates that do everything spanning from creating objective analysis, to doing collection, to creating very unique, exquisite technical tools, to spearheading our focus on the digital landscape, but also to doing administrative and logistical functions,” she said. “So that’s a lot of opportunities for people at the agency, in the AI space particularly.”
While Raman didn’t describe her agency’s development of AI capabilities and an AI workforce as a race against adversaries like China and Russia, she did describe how those nations’ pursuit of developing AI capacity for their political, economic and military advantage ultimately impacts the CIA on its journey.
“There’s a lot for us to be thinking about with respect to, you know, how we are reacting to our adversaries’ plans, use and intentions with respect to emerging technology, more generally, and AI very specifically,” Raman said.

Advances in generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, have the potential to disrupt the practice of law for many, many lawyers — especially junior lawyers. A 2023 Thomson Reuters report on the impact of AI on lawyers forecasts an “immense” impact on junior lawyers. This blog has recently reported on an AI tool that can draft a complaint using factual inputs. In the face of the likely decrease in work such as due diligence review and drafting of routine documents that will result from the rapid adoption and increasing efficacy of AI, particularly generative AI, how can lawyers maintain and grow their careers? The answer is both simple and daunting: embrace change, level up your practice to adapt to the change, and, most importantly, listen to your clients, so that you can provide the services they want delivered the way they want them. 
The warning bells heralding the robot apocalypse have been sounded before, yet in the past 25 years, technical advances have not had a sustained negative impact on attorney hiring. This time, however, appears to be different. Earlier legal tech sped and eased processes like document review and due diligence, primarily impacting the work of legal and administrative assistants. Lawyers could look at the data generated in part by tech tools, and use them to craft their output. Now, though, technology can generate and craft that output. At this moment, the quality of tech-generated output is inconsistent, and occasionally plain wrong, but machine learning is a process, and every day the tech gets better at its job (and consequently at your job). ChatGPT has existed for less than two years, and law firms started using their own proprietary chatbots mere months ago. In less than 18 months, the way we practice has radically changed. Now envision what changes are likely with another 18 months of development.
Before starting this article, I asked ChatGPT, “What attorney tasks can ChatGPT take over?” It gave me a long list that included, in part, research, client communication, and the drafting of contracts, memoranda, briefs, and other documents. Even more concerning, the list included analyzing and evaluating case law and “providing insight into potential legal strategies.” Unsurprisingly, the initial responses of many lawyers to a list like this are skepticism and denial, when survival requires acceptance and adaptation.
Still, we have done this before. Online legal research tools disrupted the library, and law firms and lawyers adapted. Sophisticated e-discovery tools disrupted contract document review, and law firms and lawyers adapted. While different, the pandemic disrupted in-person meetings, hearings, and depositions, and through technology, law firms and lawyers adapted.
That said, simply embracing the technology, while otherwise continuing to practice law the way it has been done for the last century, will lead to obsolescence and possibly to unemployment almost as quickly as will denial. The much more significant step is identifying how we use the time that we have freed up to provide better support and counsel to our clients, and to train our new lawyers at a time when their needs are also changing in relation to advances in technology.
But mastering a changing practice is only part of the challenge. The considerations in every transaction, large or small, and the day-to-day considerations of running a functional commercial entity change with every technical advance and every change in the legal and regulatory environment around technology. Each of those considerations are made more complex by a patchwork of laws and regulations that differ wildly from country to country, and in the United States, from state to state. Lawyers do not need to become technologists or regulators, but they do need to master the subject matter they are advising on and the legal landscape around that subject matter, to guide clients on how to ethically, wisely, profitably, and legally manage their legal and business issues.
Rapidly changing technology raises a myriad of client issues that impact commercial lawyers in nearly every practice area. Mastery of those issues takes deep study, often academic study, since there is no settled law to look to. Even if you do not aspire to work in technology transactions, data privacy and innovation, blockchain, or other “tech law” practices, most lawyers must gain expertise in technology law and regulation to advise their clients well. Every client is a tech client now. Regardless of their industry, clients will have questions about how to protect their corporate information when using generative AI or advanced data analytics, how to balance employee privacy rights when using emerging AI employment tools, or how to evaluate the risk of deploying a new customer service chatbot. Every lawyer whose clients collect information must advise on steps that must be taken to keep that information safe and keep website visitors informed. Those are just a few examples, among hundreds, of why specialized tech knowledge is necessary to maintain excellence and relevance as a lawyer.
Finally, staying necessary now requires that lawyers understand how business is being done, and what clients need from their lawyers, both in-house counsel and lawyers at outside firms. Lawyers in the early part of the 20th century, and even earlier, often acted as advisors to clients in all aspects of their business. Though some lawyers still practice that way, specialization has taken over, and most lawyers are expected to only consider issues within their specialties or subspecialties. Though this article has focused on modernity, in this respect, in this new economy everything old is new again. Most businesses — not only startups or tech companies — want lawyers who understand the many business and legal issues their company faces.
Filling that role requires all the technical and legal knowledge discussed earlier in this article, but it also requires a shift in how we define the role of a lawyer, from discrete problem-solver to fundamental business advisor. The lawyer needs the knowledge and training to ask the right questions, to assess the situation, and to identify what legal and regulatory risks are present with each possible solution, in the context of the client’s specific business and operations. This means not just understanding what the company does, but also what people in the development and business units do. While it is up to the client to decide what risks to accept and what ventures and opportunities to pursue as they innovate, when they see that you understand their goals and actions, that you are listening, you will have built a relationship that allows you and them to advance shared goals.
All these pivots require reconsideration and recasting of what makes an effective and necessary lawyer. It also requires a lot of (non-billable) study and work — and for some, retraining and immersion in a tech-focused environment where they can learn what technologists and business professionals now need from their lawyers. For example, at Cornell Tech’s Master of Laws program in Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship, our Tech LLM students work on teams side by side with MBA and tech master’s students. They hear the perspectives of the people whose work will be impacted by the work of lawyers. In this way, Cornell Tech lawyers learn what clients want, and what causes frustration and chills innovation. That knowledge is a foundation from which lawyers can identify what clients need and want to know, and how to provide that information and help clients craft modern solutions.
Few lawyers have the urge to become coders or product managers, but by walking a mile in the shoes of technologists and business professionals, Cornell Tech lawyers understand their clients’ products and their businesses, and can offer the services clients need. And for those who do want to deepen their understanding of or even develop legal technology solutions, an entrepreneurial and innovative environment like Cornell Tech can offer that opportunity as well. Whatever path you choose to adapt to the changing legal environment, taking the step to address it head-on offers an exciting opportunity to be at the very edge of what is now — and what is next.

But the team was uncertain about how, so it turned to Boston Consulting Group for help.Reckitt’s request was one of hundreds that Boston Consulting Group received last year. It now earns a fifth of its revenue — from zero just two years ago — through work related to artificial intelligence.“There’s a genuine thirst to figure out what are the implications for their businesses,” said Vladimir Lukic, Boston Consulting Group’s managing director for technology.The next big boom in tech is a long-awaited gift for wonky consultants. From Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company to IBM and Accenture, sales are growing and hiring is on the rise because companies are in desperate need of technology Sherpas who can help them figure out what generative A.I. means and how it can help their businesses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile the tech industry is casting about for ways to make money off generative A.I., the consultants have begun cashing in.IBM, which has 160,000 consultants, has secured more than $1 billion in sales commitments related to generative A.I. for consulting work and its watsonx system, which can be used to build and maintain A.I. models. Accenture, which provides consulting and technology services, booked $300 million in sales last year. About 40 percent of McKinsey’s business this year will be generative A.I. related, and KPMG International, which has a global advisory division, went from making no money a year ago from generative-A.I.-related work to targeting more than $650 million in business opportunities in the United States tied to the technology over the past six months.ImageIBM has more than $1 billion in sales commitments for its work with generative A.I.Credit...Matthias Balk/picture alliance, via Getty ImagesThe demand for tech-related advice recalls the industry’s dot-com boom. Businesses stampeded consultants with requests for counsel in the 1990s. From 1992 to 2000, sales for Sapient, a digital consulting firm, went from $950,000 to $503 million. Subsequent technology shifts like the migration to mobile and cloud computing were less hurried, said Nigel Vaz, chief executive of the firm, which is now known as Publicis Sapient.“In the mid-90s, C.E.O.s would say, ‘I don’t know what a website is or what it could do for my business, but I need it,’” Mr. Vaz said. “This is similar. Companies are saying: ‘Don’t tell me what to build. Tell me what you can build.’”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTConsulting firms have been scrambling to show what they can do. In May, Boston Consulting Group hosted a one-day conference at a Boston convention center where it set up demonstration booths for OpenAI, Anthropic and other A.I. tech leaders. It also demonstrated some of its own A.I. work in robotics and programming.Generative A.I. sales are helping the industry find growth after a postpandemic lull. The management consulting industry in the United States is expected to collect $392.2 billion in sales this year, up 2 percent from a year ago, according to IBISWorld, a research firm.The work that consultants have been enlisted to do varies from business to business. Some consultancies are advising companies on regulatory compliance as regions like the European Union pass laws regulating artificial intelligence. Others are drawing up plans for A.I. customer support systems or developing guardrails to prevent A.I. systems from making errors.For businesses, the results have been mixed. Generative A.I. is prone to giving people incorrect, irrelevant or nonsensical information, known as hallucinations. It is difficult to ensure that it provides accurate information. It can also be slower to respond than a person, which can confuse customers about whether their questions will be answered.IBM, which has a $20 billion consulting business, ran into some of those issues on its work with McDonald’s. The companies developed an A.I.-powered voice system to take drive-through orders. But after customers reported that the system made mistakes, like adding nine iced teas to an order instead of the one Diet Coke requested, McDonald’s ended the project.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMcDonald’s said it remained committed to a future of digital ordering and would evaluate alternative systems. IBM said it was working with McDonald’s on other projects and was in discussions with other restaurant chains about using its voice-activated A.I.Other programs from IBM have shown more promise. The company worked with Dun & Bradstreet, a business data provider, to develop a generative A.I. system to analyze and provide advice on selecting suppliers. The tool, called Ask Procurement, will allow employees to conduct detailed searches with specific parameters. For example, it could find memory chip suppliers that are minority owned and automatically create a request for proposals for them.Gary Kotovets, chief data and analytics officer at Dun & Bradstreet, said his team of 30 people needed IBM’s help to build the system. To reassure customers that the answers that Ask Procurement provides are accurate, he insisted that customers be able to trace every answer to an original source.“Hallucinations are a real concern and in some cases a perceived concern,” Mr. Kotovets said. “You have to overcome both and convince the client it’s not hallucinating.”Over seven weeks this year, McKinsey’s A.I. group, QuantumBlack, built a customer service chatbot for ING Bank, with guardrails to prevent it from offering mortgage or investment advice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBecause the viability of the chatbot was uncertain and McKinsey had limited experience with the relatively new technology, the firm did the work as a “joint experiment” under its contract with ING, said Bahadir Yilmaz, chief analytics officer at ING. The bank paid McKinsey for the work, but Mr. Yilmaz said many consultants were willing to do speculative work with generative A.I. without pay because they wanted to demonstrate what they could do with the new technology.The project has been labor intensive. When ING’s chatbot gave incorrect information during its development, McKinsey and ING had to identify the cause. They traced the problem back to issues like outdated websites, said Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner at McKinsey working on technology.The chatbot now handles 200 of 5,000 customer inquiries daily. ING has people review every conversation to make sure that the system doesn’t use discriminatory or harmful language or hallucinate.“The difference between ChatGPT and our chatbot is our chatbot cannot be wrong,” Mr. Yilmaz said. “We have to be safe with the system we’re building, but we’re close.”Over a four-month period this year, Reckitt worked with Boston Consulting Group to develop an A.I. platform that could create local advertisements in different languages and formats. With the push of a button, the system can turn a commercial about Finish dishwashing detergent from English into Spanish.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTReckitt’s A.I. marketing system, which is being tested, can make developing local ads 30 percent faster, saving the company time and sparing it from some tedious work, said Becky Verano, vice president of global creativity and capabilities at Reckitt.Because the technology is so new, Ms. Verano said, the team is learning and adjusting its work as new tech companies release updates to the image and language models. She credited Boston Consulting Group with bringing structure to that chaos.“You’re constantly having to move to the latest trends, to the newest findings, and learning each time how the tools respond,” she said. “There’s not an exact science to it.”Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco. His focus on Apple includes product launches, manufacturing issues and political challenges. He also writes about trends across the tech industry, including layoffs, generative A.I. and robot taxis.

Gemini is Google’s artificial intelligence ecosystem, including a chatbot that generates responses to user-provided natural language prompts. In response to a prompt, Gemini can pull information from the internet and present a response. The large language model behind Gemini delivers the response in natural language — in contrast to a standard Google search, where a result consists of a snippet of information or a list of links.
Google announced Gemini (as Bard) in February 2023 after OpenAI and Microsoft both garnered attention for AI chatbot systems. And in May 2023, AI advancements featured prominently in Google’s I/O event. On Feb. 8, 2024, Google renamed the AI products formerly named Bard to Gemini.

What is Google Gemini used for?
Google Gemini is the overarching term for an ecosystem of generative AI models and services, including natural language querying, assistants, content generation and code writing. Gemini’s prompt-response process can help you obtain answers faster than a standard Google search sequence.
A classic Google search requires you to enter a natural language query or keywords, follow links, review content and then compile the results or repeat the process with a refined search.
SEE: Check out these Google AI search prompting tips.
With Gemini, you enter a prompt, then review the response. If the response isn’t exactly what you want, you have at least three options:

View other drafts to display alternatively formatted responses.
Regenerate the response to have the system craft a new reply.
Follow-up with another prompt.

Gemini can handle all sorts of tasks, but many of the most common uses are covered by the categories of capabilities detailed below.
Google Gemini can summarize
As a generative AI assistant powered by a large language model, Gemini can adeptly summarize text. For example, provide a link to a web page and ask Gemini to summarize the contents, e.g.:
Please summarize ​​https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/.
You also can suggest a specific length if you want a particular degree of brevity, such as “Please summarize in 100 words.”
Google Gemini can compare
Gemini can compare two or more items. In many cases, when you ask Gemini to compare things, the system will display some of the data in a table. For example, if you prompt Gemini:
Compare a Pixel 7, Pixel 7a and Samsung Galaxy S23.
Similarly, you may ask Gemini to compare web pages.
Google Gemini can suggest
Gemini may serve as a suggestion engine for products, services or activities. Enter the title of books, music or movies you like, then ask Gemini to suggest others. This can be useful when you’re researching unfamiliar topics. For example, you might try:
I am interested in learning the history of machine learning. Can you recommend 10 useful and highly respected books on the topic?
Google Gemini can explain
When you want to learn about a topic or historical event, you can ask Gemini to explain it to you. If you like, you may suggest a desired level in order to guide the system toward an explanation that may be either easier to understand or more detailed. For a general overview of a core technology that helps make Gemini work, you might ask:
Can you explain the basics of how neural networks operate? Explain it to me as if I am in my first year of college.
Google Gemini can brainstorm
One of the best uses of a chatbot is to gather a long list of ideas. Ask Gemini to “Brainstorm ideas for…” followed by whatever topic you wish, such as a new project, promotional effort or paper. Encourage Gemini to provide creative, unusual or inventive ideas for additional variety in the responses.
Google Gemini can code and debug
In April 2023, Google added the ability to create and help debug code in more than 20 programming languages. When you ask for code, make sure to specify the programming language and describe in as much detail as possible the code you need. If the code generated doesn’t work, let Gemini know what exactly went awry, and ask for a suggested fix or for help interpreting an error code.
SEE: Explore other Google AI enhancements.
Gemini can draft text
Gemini can help you write, too. As with most prompts, provide as much detail about the topic, length, format (blog post, poem, essay, book report, etc.) and style as possible. If you have a rough outline of a blog post, you might include the desired points in your prompt. For this section of text, for example, you might prompt:
Using the following points as an outline, can you draft examples and explanatory text? ""Gemini can summarize. Gemini can compare. Gemini can suggest. Gemini can explain. Gemini can brainstorm. Gemini can draft text. Gemini can code (and debug). Gemini can search.""
The responses Gemini generated were reasonable and might have required only a little editing and correction to be usable.
Google makes it easy to move Gemini text elsewhere. Select the response export button to move content to either a new Google Doc or Gmail. Alternatively, select the More button (the three vertical dots), then choose Copy to place the response text on the system clipboard for pasting into any app of your choice. (Using Gemini in Gmail or Docs requires the Google One AI Premium plan.)
Gemini can search
Since Gemini can access internet content, many conventional keyword searches will also work in Gemini. Ask about current news topics, weather forecasts or pretty much any standard keyword search string. However, Gemini will provide responses mostly in conventional text, sometimes supplemented with images, whereas Google search may show content in custom formats (e.g., weather forecasts often display a chart). When you seek a set of links, switch out of Gemini back to a standard Google search.
As of September 2023, people who sign in to Gemini with personal Google accounts may optionally enable extensions. These extensions allow Gemini to draw data from other Google services, including Google Flights, Hotels, Maps, Workspace (Gmail, Docs and Drive) and YouTube.
Google Gemini can create images
As of Feb. 1, Google’s Imagen 2 image generation technology was interoperable with Gemini , letting users create images in Search (SGE), Ads, Duet AI in Workspace and Vertex AI.
At the same time on Feb. 1, Google announced ImageFX, a distinct image generation tool based on Imagen 2. Its prompt interface works based on a new type of prompt, “expressive chips.” Google said expressive chips “let you quickly experiment with adjacent dimensions of your creation and ideas.” ImageFX is available in Google’s AI Test Kitchen in the English language to users in US, Kenya, New Zealand and Australia.
Images created with Imagen 2 are marked with the SynthID watermark and IPTC metadata.
Gemini can be wrong
Gemini can get things wrong. Select the Double-check Response to take the generated text, search Google for it and then highlight supporting sources in light green and those not found in light orange. Never rely solely on content provided in Gemini responses without verification. When Gemini does provide an inaccurate, misleading or inappropriate response, select the thumbs down icon to convey to the system that it provided a bad response.
What are Gemini’s limitations?
Even the Double-check It with Google feature may make mistakes. As a generative AI chatbot, Gemini provides content that may seem accurate, but it should always be considered carefully, reviewed thoroughly and checked before use.
In addition, Gemini has a limited context window, which means that it may “forget” content in a long conversation.
When was Google Gemini released?
At launch in March 2023, Google limited Gemini access (known as Bard at the time) via a waitlist to people with personal Google accounts. In early May 2023, Google eliminated the waitlist and made Gemini more widely available.
How can you get access to Google Gemini?
To access Gemini, go to https://gemini.google.com in a web browser, and sign in with a Google account (Figure A).
Figure A

If your account is managed by a Google Workspace administrator, such as an account for work or school, the administrator may adjust settings to either allow or prevent access to Gemini. Check with your administrator, should you have any questions.
If you are a Google Workspace administrator and wish to review or adjust the settings that affect Gemini availability for people in your organization, access the Admin console | Apps | Additional Google services | Early Access Apps, then modify the Service status and Core Data Access Permissions as desired.
As of Feb. 8, Gemini is available for mobile on Android and in the Google app on iOS.
On Feb. 21, Google added two new options for accessing Gemini: Gemini for Workspace, a subscription for Google Workspace that adds a natural language chatbot; and Gemini Enterprise, which adds language translation and will soon be able to provide automated meeting notes.
Gemini is built into Chromebook Plus laptops, accessable through updates and new features, starting May 28. With it, you can edit photos, draft written content, create wallpapers and more.
Gemini is available on Vertex AI, Google’s platform for building and scaling AI for enterprise use with Google Cloud.
What new and upcoming features does Google Gemini have?
On May 14, Google expanded Gemini’s context window to 1 million tokens with Gemini 1.5 in Gemini Advanced. In June, Gemini 1.5 Pro expanded that number to a 2 million token context window.
In the next few months, Google plans to roll out Live, a natural-sounding and interruptible voice assistant capability, to Gemini Advanced. Also upcoming are the ability for Gemini to pull information from Gmail to help craft travel plans or other itineraries, and Gems, custom AI agents for specific tasks.
What countries and languages is Google Gemini available in?
Gemini is available in more than 230 countries and territories, including all 27 European Union countries (e.g., Germany, France, Italy and Spain) as well as Brazil.

While access to previous prompts can be helpful, Google gives you full control over whether or not your Gemini Activity history is stored. Image: Andy Wolber
If on, you may choose to Auto-delete activity after three, 18 or 36 months or not at all. Additionally, you may access your activity history, which can be helpful if you wish to review or rerun a previous prompt.
Is Google Gemini free to use?
Yes, Google Gemini is available to use for free. Google Gemini is free of advertising as well. There is a higher tier called Gemini Advanced, which allows access to the larger LLM Ultra 1.0. Gemini Advanced is part of the $19.99 Google One AI Premium plan,
Gemini Business costs $20 per user per month on top of a Google Workspace subscription. A one-year commitment is required.
Gemini Enterprise costs $30 per user per month. A one-year commitment is required.
Is it safe to use Google Gemini?
Google requires you to be 18 years of age or older to use Gemini. An administrator must specifically choose to allow access to Gemini for accounts connected to a Google Workspace organization. Even if allowed, you should make sure your use of Gemini complies with your organization’s policies.
Google takes measures to make Gemini useful and helpful but also prominently notes that the system “may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn’t represent Google’s views.” To preserve privacy, do not share any personal or private information with Gemini in your prompts.
Is Google Gemini using PaLM 2?
As of December 6, Gemini services run on a proprietary Google LLM also called Gemini. The Gemini model was developed by Google DeepMind and comes in three sizes, Ultra, Pro and Nano.
Gemini uses PaLM 2 in languages other than English. On Dec. 6 Google Product Director Jack Krawczyk said Google was working on a “clearer indication in bard of which model is serving you.”

What are alternatives to Google Gemini?
The ability to access current internet content is a key differentiator between Google Gemini and many other chatbot AI systems. Many large language model chatbot systems were trained on older data and lack access to information about current events. This inability to browse the internet limits the usefulness of many of these systems.
Four alternatives to Gemini that can access current internet content and are worth exploring are:

Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise): Available free with a Microsoft account.
ChatGPT: ChatGPT Plus (available for $20 per month) and Enterprise accounts may access the internet as of late September 2023.
Perplexity: Available free with account signin. Optional upgrade to Perplexity Pro features are available for $20 per month.
Pi: Available free with an account.

Another alternative to Gemini that lacks access to current internet content is:

Claude: Available free with an account, with optional Claude Pro features available for $20 per month.

In one of the most significant embraces of generative A.I. on Wall Street to date, Morgan Stanley (MS) is rolling out a new A.I. assistant to aid its wealth management division in client meetings. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and known as “AI @ Morgan Stanley Debrief,” the tool will take notes in client meetings and draft emails to enhance the productivity of its nearly 16,000 financial advisors. Employees have already managed to dedicate more time to clients by saving half an hour of grunt work per meeting with the help of Debrief, according to the bank.

Morgan Stanley became OpenAI’s sole wealth management strategic partner in March 2023—four months after the release of ChatGPT—and has since introduced A.I. features like “AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant,” which was launched in September and currently aids 98 percent of the bank’s financial advisor teams in accessing the bank’s database of research. Morgan Stanley’s newest A.I. tool is currently being piloted and will be widely released to financial advisors next month.
“Through this rollout, financial advisors continue to see first-hand the real benefits GenAI delivers to their practices,” said Jeff McMillan, head of firmwide A.I. at Morgan Stanley, in a statement. “And we’re just getting started in unlocking the true power of this technology for all of Morgan Stanley.”
A.I. is “significantly better” at note-taking
Clients must consent to the use of Debrief, which sits in on meetings to take notes, summarize key points, surface action items, create emails for financial advisors to edit and send, and save notes into Salesforce. Employees in Morgan Stanley’s wealth management sector, which managed $5.5 trillion in assets as of the first quarter of this year, say the pilot tool has already shifted the way they engage with clients. Debrief has “saved me about half an hour per meeting just by handling all the notetaking” and “freed up my time to concentrate on making decisions during client meetings,” said Don Whitehead, a Morgan Stanley financial advisor based in Houston, Texas, in a statement.
The A.I. assistant does a significantly better job at note-taking than humans, McMillan told CNBC, adding that the industry should be prepared for “disruption in some areas.” Nearly 54 percent of jobs across banking have the potential to be displaced by the technology, according to a Citigroup report released earlier this month which also noted that A.I. could additionally boost the banking industry’s profits by 9 percent, or $170 billion, by 2028.
Major Wall Street banks are experimenting with generative A.I.
Morgan Stanley isn’t the only Wall Street player to partner up with leading A.I. companies like OpenAI. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) earlier this year unveiled IndexGPT, an A.I. tool created with the help of GPT-4 that automates thematic indexes to identify investments through emerging trends. And the bank is just getting started on its A.I. journey—as of May, all new employees are set to receive training in the generative technology.
Wells Fargo, too, has been training employees in A.I. by enrolling them in Stanford’s A.I. program. The bank last year launched the virtual assistant Fargo using a large language model from Google and is reportedly in the midst of developing several other A.I. projects. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (DB) is currently attempting to double, or even triple, its roughly 300-person A.I. team and is piloting an A.I.-powered chatbot to aid corporate and investment banking customers.
And a plethora of A.I.-related features are in development at Goldman Sachs (GS), which plans to use the technology to aid developers in generating code, summarizing and drafting documents, and performing queries on various forms and filings. “We’re talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented,” said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in April while discussing the potential to take advantage of A.I. opportunities. “We’re very, very focused on it and very engaged.”

AUSTIN, Texas — A new study ranks Austin as the sixth-highest city in the U.S. for artificial intelligence (AI) job displacement. 

The study, conducted by (un)Common Logic, says that just over 10% of all workers in Austin are at risk of AI-related automation. That's roughly 126,000 workers in the Austin area. 

The jobs facing the highest risk of being done by AI are budget analysts, loan officers, accountants, insurance sales agents and paralegals. The study said these jobs face high AI exposure as well as high risk of automation because their tasks and knowledge can be more easily learned and replicated by AI systems. These roles account for an estimate 9% of all workers nationally, the study said.

Conversely, workers who face both low AI exposure and low risk of automation include “highly hands-on professionals,” such as dancers, firefighters and plumbers. 

But even jobs that are unlikely to be significantly impacted by AI may face other types of automation risks, the study said, including farm laborers or fast food workers. The study also said professions like lawyers, CEOs and civil engineers might rely on AI to enhance decision-making but face low probabilities of being completely automated.

Compared to other types of automation, it’s predicted AI will have a greater impact on high-income workers. Five states – South Dakota, Kansas, Delaware, Florida and New York – have high concentrations of workers in the knowledge sector, making more than one in 10 vulnerable to AI-related automation. Meanwhile, states like Indiana, Arkansas and Nevada, where the workforce is more concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing or service professions, face a lower risk of AI-driven automation. 

Other Texas cities making the top 50 are Dallas-Fort Worth at No. 23 and San Antonio at No. 22, both at around 9%, and then the Houston area at just over 8% at No. 49.

Additionally, 93 per cent of those using GenAI for work in India agreed that it has significantly saved them time.A study by BCG has revealed a striking level of confidence among Indian workers in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) in the workplace.This sentiment is part of a broader trend captured in a global survey involving over 13,000 employees across 15 countries and regions.Conducted by BCG's tech build and design division, BCG X, the survey highlights a growing confidence in AI and GenAI across the board.The findings show that 42 per cent of global respondents expressed confidence in these technologies' impact on their work, a substantial increase from 26 per cent the previous year.However, this confidence is accompanied by an increase in anxiety, with 49 per cent of regular users fearing that their jobs could vanish within the next decade due to these technologies. In contrast, only 24 per cent of non-users shared this concern.The report underscores the increasing integration of GenAI in workplaces worldwide. About 64 per cent of leaders are now implementing GenAI tools, with frontline employees showing a significant uptick in usage--43 per cent regularly use these tools at work, more than double the number from last year.Sylvain Duranton, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, commented, ""Our survey exposes the double-edged nature of GenAI. Familiarity correlates with both comfort and fear. GenAI is a revolutionary technology, so these opposing reactions should not be surprising.""He added, ""By recognizing the complex ways in which humans understand and interact with GenAI, leaders can reshape their organizations to maximize the strengths and value of both their human and machine workers.""A portion of survey respondents who utilize GenAI for work, specifically 58 per cent, reported saving at least five hours per week. The time saved is often redirected towards additional tasks (41 per cent), new initiatives (39 per cent), experimentation with GenAI (38 per cent), or strategic work (38 per cent).Vinciane Beauchene, managing director and partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, said, ""We are entering a new era for GenAI which is less about optimism and curiosity and more about confidence and value realization. Adoption has increased and individuals are starting to see the benefits.""He added, ""Companies are also starting to realize that getting the value out of their investment will require them to think beyond productivity and take a more holistic and proactive approach to redirect the time saved to the most valuable and joyful activities, to reskill their employees to do so, and to reshape their organizations and operating models as a consequence.""The study highlighted a marked difference in attitudes towards GenAI between workers from the Global South and the Global North.Respondents from countries like Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa, and those in the Middle East displayed more optimism and less anxiety about GenAI compared to their counterparts in more developed economies.The Global South not only demonstrated a higher percentage of regular GenAI users among leaders, managers, and frontline employees but also a greater likelihood of having received GenAI training.Additionally, employees in these regions reported using the time saved by GenAI to focus on professional development, experimentation with the tool, and improving the quality of their work.The report concludes with key recommendations for companies aiming to harness the full potential of GenAI.Organizations are advised to establish a transformation-first mindset, continuously manage all transformation efforts to ensure cohesion and efficiency and invest in large-scale training initiatives to equip employees with the necessary skills.Emphasizing value creation and employee satisfaction, companies should prepare for evolving job roles and skills requirements and adapt their organizational structures and governance accordingly.Jeff Walters, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, noted, ""Understandable human reactions to these technologies can pose challenges to companies as they continue on their GenAI journeys.""He added, ""But as we noted in last year's report--and it still holds true this year--these are more change management challenges than technology challenges. And now is the time for organizations to double-down on their commitment to transformation built around GenAI.""PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

Editor’s note: In a recent issue of Upstream Ag Professional, agribusiness analyst Shane Thomas addresses the buzz surrounding conversations about the future of jobs in agribusiness and AI. Here’s a summary of that article:
This week, discussions focused on the future of jobs in agribusiness and AI, addressing the fear of job loss and the need for re-skilling. Historical context, like the Luddites’ resistance to mechanization in the 19th century, highlights the longstanding apprehension towards technological advancements. The Luddites feared losing their skilled jobs to mechanized looms, leading them to destructively protest against these innovations. However, mechanization was inevitable, driving economic progress and societal advancement, much like today’s AI technologies in agriculture.Advertisement
The Lump of Labor Fallacy — the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work — explains why automation doesn’t reduce jobs overall. As automation makes production cheaper and more efficient, it creates new demands and, consequently, new jobs. This phenomenon, illustrated by Jevon’s Paradox, shows that gains in efficiency lead to increased demand and new economic opportunities.

To navigate these changes, the Job to Action Framework helps understand the transformation of job roles. For example, an agronomist’s job involves various tasks and actions, some of which can be automated. Automation tends to eliminate tedious tasks, allowing professionals to focus on more valuable responsibilities. For instance, with automated field scouting by technologies like Solinftec’s Solix, agronomists can devote more time to data analysis and strategic planning.
AI, particularly in agribusiness, offers significant benefits by improving data quality and reducing errors from user input. As Matthew Pryor of Tenacious Ventures suggests, AI can overcome the “garbage-in, garbage-out” challenge by enhancing data accuracy and utility. Similarly, Patrick Walther emphasizes AI’s potential to analyze unstructured data, providing insights from customer interactions and feedback.
Furthermore, AI can improve interoperability between different agtech systems, as highlighted by the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop APIs quickly, enhancing collaboration and data synthesis.
Overall, while AI may change the nature of certain jobs, it will likely eliminate tedious tasks and empower professionals to achieve more. AI will enable agribusiness professionals to leverage their capabilities more effectively, creating a more seamless and productive user experience. Thus, AI is more likely to transform and enhance jobs rather than eliminate them.

JAKARTA - The digital economy is increasingly transforming into one of the sectors that continues to experience significant developments, especially supported by an increase in commitment to research and development, as well as planting an innovation culture.ADVERTISEMENTBased on a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Indonesia's Global Innovation Index (GII) in 2022 is ranked 75th out of 130 countries. This achievement is an increase of 10 levels compared to 2020.One of the innovations in the digital economy sector is through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI development in Indonesia itself is also driven by the large amount of internet usage and start-up growth that utilizes technology to support business activities.ADVERTISEMENTHowever, automation through the use of AI will also pose challenges related to reduced employment opportunities. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in The Future Jobs report, it is estimated that in 2025 43 percent of industry players will reduce their workforce as a consequence of technology integration.Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said that although this was a challenge, not everything regarding AI was negative as seen. Most of the work and industry are only partially affected by automation and are more likely to be equipped than replaced by AI.ADVERTISEMENT""Therefore, the biggest impact of AI technology is most likely not on the loss of employment opportunities, but the potential for changes to the quality of work, especially the intensity and autonomy of work,"" said Airlangga in his statement, Sunday, June 23.Airlangga conveyed that along with the use of AI technology, the Government has also prepared a number of policies in order to overcome various potential risks related to the use of AI, one of which is through the launch of the National Digital Economy Strategy.

Airlangga explained that the framework consisted of 6 (six) pillars, namely first Infrastructure, second Human Resources, third Business Climate and Cyber Security, fourth Research, Innovation and Business Development, fifth Funding and Investment, and six Policies or Regulations.Furthermore, the fourth pillar regarding Research, Innovation and Business Development will focus on efforts to develop and manage the AI ecosystem in Indonesia to make it better.Meanwhile, Airlangga conveyed his main focus on the pillar to improve research and development capabilities as well as innovative processes to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.""One of the initiatives taken by the Government regarding these pillars is to build and launch special innovation zones in several districts in Indonesia, with a focus on developing futuristic technology,"" he said.Airlangga said that in addition to completing the preparation of the stranas, in 2023 the Government also issued regulations regarding the ethics of using artificial intelligence as the starting point for the use of AI in the public sector.Furthermore, Airlangga said that the Government would continue to strive to develop the best practices in the use of AI.Let's take advantage of AI's potential to reshape our labor market for the better. Together, we can build a labor market that is not only resilient but also adaptive, innovative, and inclusive,"" he said.Airlangga hopes that in the future, AI will improve Indonesia's economic landscape and create new opportunities for the workforce, so that it can help in achieving sustainable growth and development.

From drafting reports to curating personalized learning programs, Generative AI is enhancing productivity and fostering creativity. It empowers professionals to achieve more, driving efficiency and innovation in every sector.The challenge for businesses is clear: they must understand the vast potential and inherent risks of Generative AI. By embracing this technology, companies can navigate organizational change and secure a future where human ingenuity and AI capabilities harmoniously coexist. As businesses look to the future, leveraging AI technologies like Generative AI is essential for staying competitive, especially in fields like AI chatbot development, where rapid innovation and reliable performance are paramount.Generative AI’s Impact on the Workforce: Transforming Human RolesGenerative AI is transforming our lives, enhancing how we work and interact with technology. It’s not about replacing us but amplifying our abilities, allowing us to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Imagine a world where mundane chores are automated, freeing us to focus on creative and strategic endeavors.This technology is a powerful tool for innovation. It can draft reports, design visuals, and personalize customer experiences, making us more productive and effective. By taking over repetitive tasks, Generative AI gives us the freedom to think bigger and achieve more. To fully benefit, leaders must prepare their teams to adapt to these changes. Embracing Generative AI means equipping people with the skills to use it wisely, ensuring technology and human talent grow together for a brighter future.Changing the structure of work with the arrival of Generative AIGenerative AI is reshaping how we approach work, making tasks faster and easier. By automating routine tasks, it allows us to focus on more strategic and creative projects. This shift means we can reassign roles and responsibilities, utilizing human skills where they are most impactful. As a result, the structure of work evolves, leading to greater efficiency and innovation in the workplace.1. Work:Work, fundamentally, is about achieving goals and creating value. With Generative AI, we are redefining how we reach these outcomes. By leveraging AI, we can handle repetitive tasks more efficiently, freeing up human potential for creativity and strategic thinking. This not only enhances productivity but also enriches the work experience, making it more fulfilling and impactful. The future of work, therefore, promises to be more dynamic and innovative. 2. Jobs:Jobs, as we know them, are evolving with the advent of Generative AI. While there is concern about automation, the reality is that AI is transforming rather than eliminating jobs. It automates routine tasks, allowing us to focus on roles that require creativity and complex problem-solving. This shift demands new skills, redefining job descriptions, and creating opportunities for growth and innovation in the workforce.3. Tasks:Generative AI is revolutionizing tasks by automating repetitive activities, allowing workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks. This technology enhances efficiency and productivity, enabling humans to achieve better outcomes with less effort. While AI excels at certain tasks, human skills remain crucial for tasks requiring empathy, judgment, and creativity.This collaboration between humans and AI optimizes workflows, creating a synergistic approach where each complements the strengths of the other, ultimately driving innovation and job satisfaction in the evolving workplace. 4. Skills:Skills play a pivotal role in shaping the future of work amidst the advent of Generative AI. While AI excels at automating routine tasks, human skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence remain irreplaceable. Understanding the skill sets within organizations and how they align with AI capabilities is crucial.This insight informs strategic decisions on upskilling initiatives, preparing the workforce for a future where collaboration between humans and AI drives innovation and efficiency. Embracing this “humans with machines” approach ensures that organizations harness the full potential of technology while nurturing the unique capabilities that humans bring to the table.How to prepare for generative AI in the workplace?Preparing for Generative AI in the workplace involves embracing its capabilities while nurturing human skills. It’s crucial to recognize that AI enhances tasks rather than replacing jobs outright. By focusing on developing creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence, organizations can equip their teams to collaborate effectively with AI.This approach ensures smooth integration and fosters a culture of innovation. Embracing Generative AI means adapting job roles and tasks to leverage technology’s strengths, empowering employees to excel in a future where human ingenuity and technological advancements drive organizational success and growth.The Ethical Impact of Generative AIThe impact of Generative AI raises significant ethical questions as technology continues to transform our workplaces. As AI capabilities advance, it’s crucial to address concerns about fairness and equal opportunities across different professions. While fields such as finance and software development may see substantial benefits from AI, others like manual labor or caregiving roles might have fewer opportunities for enhancement. This disparity could widen existing inequalities unless steps are taken to ensure all sectors can access AI advancements fairly.Additionally, there’s a risk that essential human qualities, such as empathy in healthcare or judgment in legal matters, might be undervalued as AI takes on more routine tasks. Balancing technological progress with human-centric values is essential to ensure AI complements rather than replaces human skills. To navigate these challenges, fostering open discussions and implementing inclusive policies will be crucial. By doing so, we can harness the potential of Generative AI while preserving ethical standards and promoting societal well-being. ConclusionGenerative AI is assured to redefine the future of work, ushering in a new era where human potential and technological innovation converge. This transformative technology promises efficiency and creativity by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more strategic endeavors. Partnering with an AI app development company in Houston across the USA can help you build AI apps for your business, enabling you to fully harness the potential of generative AI.As businesses are adopting generative AI, they must also navigate its ethical implications, ensuring fairness and inclusivity across all sectors.

Imagine a world where creating content, designing graphics, or formulating marketing strategies happens with great speed and accuracy. Generative AI makes this a reality, augmenting human skills with its ability to generate high-quality outputs swiftly.



This innovation extends across industries, offering endless possibilities. From drafting reports to curating personalized learning programs, Generative AI is enhancing productivity and fostering creativity. It empowers professionals to achieve more, driving efficiency and innovation in every sector.



The challenge for businesses is clear: they must understand the vast potential and inherent risks of Generative AI.

As businesses look to the future, leveraging AI technologies like Generative AI is essential for staying competitive, especially in fields like AI chatbot development, where rapid innovation and reliable performance are paramount.



Generative AI's Impact on the Workforce: Transforming Human Roles



Generative AI is transforming our lives, enhancing how we work and interact with technology. It’s not about replacing us but amplifying our abilities, allowing us to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Imagine a world where mundane chores are automated, freeing us to focus on creative and strategic endeavors.



This technology is a powerful tool for innovation. It can draft reports, design visuals, and personalize customer experiences, making us more productive and effective. By taking over repetitive tasks, Generative AI gives us the freedom to think bigger and achieve more.&nbsp;



To fully benefit, leaders must prepare their teams to adapt to these changes. Embracing Generative AI means equipping people with the skills to use it wisely, ensuring technology and human talent grow together for a brighter future.



Changing the structure of work with the arrival of Generative AI



Generative AI is reshaping how we approach work, making tasks faster and easier. By automating routine tasks, it allows us to focus on more strategic and creative projects. This shift means we can reassign roles and responsibilities, utilizing human skills where they are most impactful. As a result, the structure of work evolves, leading to greater efficiency and innovation in the workplace.



1. Work:



Work, fundamentally, is about achieving goals and creating value. With Generative AI, we are redefining how we reach these outcomes. By leveraging AI, we can handle repetitive tasks more efficiently, freeing up human potential for creativity and strategic thinking. This not only enhances productivity but also enriches the work experience, making it more fulfilling and impactful. The future of work, therefore, promises to be more dynamic and innovative.&nbsp;



2. Jobs:



Jobs, as we know them, are evolving with the advent of Generative AI. While there is concern about automation, the reality is that AI is transforming rather than eliminating jobs. It automates routine tasks, allowing us to focus on roles that require creativity and complex problem-solving. This shift demands new skills, redefining job descriptions, and creating opportunities for growth and innovation in the workforce.



3. Tasks:



Generative AI is revolutionizing tasks by automating repetitive activities, allowing workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks. This technology enhances efficiency and productivity, enabling humans to achieve better outcomes with less effort. While AI excels at certain tasks, human skills remain crucial for tasks requiring empathy, judgment, and creativity.



This collaboration between humans and AI optimizes workflows, creating a synergistic approach where each complements the strengths of the other, ultimately driving innovation and job satisfaction in the evolving workplace.&nbsp;



4. Skills:



Skills play a pivotal role in shaping the future of work amidst the advent of Generative AI. While AI excels at automating routine tasks, human skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence remain irreplaceable. Understanding the skill sets within organizations and how they align with AI capabilities is crucial.



This insight informs strategic decisions on upskilling initiatives, preparing the workforce for a future where collaboration between humans and AI drives innovation and efficiency. Embracing this ""humans with machines"" approach ensures that organizations harness the full potential of technology while nurturing the unique capabilities that humans bring to the table.



How to prepare for generative AI in the workplace?



Preparing for Generative AI in the workplace involves embracing its capabilities while nurturing human skills. It's crucial to recognize that AI enhances tasks rather than replacing jobs outright. By focusing on developing creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence, organizations can equip their teams to collaborate effectively with AI.



This approach ensures smooth integration and fosters a culture of innovation. Embracing Generative AI means adapting job roles and tasks to leverage technology's strengths, empowering employees to excel in a future where human ingenuity and technological advancements drive organizational success and growth.



The Ethical Impact of Generative AI



The impact of Generative AI raises significant ethical questions as technology continues to transform our workplaces. As AI capabilities advance, it's crucial to address concerns about fairness and equal opportunities across different professions. While fields such as finance and software development may see substantial benefits from AI, others like manual labor or caregiving roles might have fewer opportunities for enhancement. This disparity could widen existing inequalities unless steps are taken to ensure all sectors can access AI advancements fairly.



Additionally, there's a risk that essential human qualities, such as empathy in healthcare or judgment in legal matters, might be undervalued as AI takes on more routine tasks. Balancing technological progress with human-centric values is essential to ensure AI complements rather than replaces human skills. To navigate these challenges, fostering open discussions and implementing inclusive policies will be crucial. By doing so, we can harness the potential of Generative AI while preserving ethical standards and promoting societal well-being.&nbsp;



Conclusion



Generative AI is assured to redefine the future of work, ushering in a new era where human potential and technological innovation converge. This transformative technology promises efficiency and creativity by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more strategic endeavors. Partnering with an AI app development company in Houston across the USA can help you build AI apps for your business, enabling you to fully harness the potential of generative AI.



As businesses are adopting generative AI, they must also navigate its ethical implications, ensuring fairness and inclusivity across all sectors. This means safeguarding human qualities that are crucial for professions like healthcare and law, where empathy and judgment are irreplaceable. By fostering a balanced approach that values both AI capabilities and human skills, businesses can pave the way for a future where innovation thrives alongside ethical responsibility.
