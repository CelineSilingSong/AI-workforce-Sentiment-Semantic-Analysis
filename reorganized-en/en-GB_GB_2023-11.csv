OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, estimates that the jobs most at risk from the new wave of AI are those with the highest wages, and that someone in an occupation that pays a six-figure salary is about three times as exposed as someone making $30,000. McKinsey warns of the models’ ability to automate the application of expertise.

I understand the temptation to wave away these warnings as mere projections. Thousands of years of history have lulled many of us into the false sense of security that automation is something that happens to other people’s jobs, never our own.

But for some, the fear that AI may one day take white-collar jobs is already a reality. In an ingenious study published this summer, US researchers showed that within a few months of the launch of ChatGPT, copywriters and graphic designers on major online freelancing platforms saw a significant drop in the number of jobs they got, and even steeper declines in earnings. This suggested not only that generative AI was taking their work, but also that it devalues the work they do still carry out.

Most strikingly, the study found that freelancers who previously had the highest earnings and completed the most jobs were no less likely to see their employment and earnings decline than other workers. If anything, they had worse outcomes. In other words, being more skilled was no shield against loss of work or earnings.

But the online freelancing market covers a very particular form of white-collar work and of labour market. What about looking higher up the ranks of the knowledge worker class?

For that, we can turn to a recent, fascinating Harvard Business School study, which monitored the impact of giving GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most advanced offering, to employees at Boston Consulting Group.

BCG staff randomly assigned to use GPT-4 when carrying out a set of consulting tasks were far more productive than their colleagues who could not access the tool. Not only did AI-assisted consultants carry out tasks 25 per cent faster and complete 12 per cent more tasks overall, their work was assessed to be 40 per cent higher in quality than their unassisted peers.

Employees right across the skills distribution benefited, but in a pattern now common in generative AI studies, the biggest performance gains came among the less highly skilled in their workforce. This makes intuitive sense: large language models are best understood as excellent regurgitators and summarisers of existing, public-domain human knowledge. The closer one’s own knowledge already is to that limit, the smaller the benefit from using them.

There was one catch: on a more nuanced task, which involved analysing quantitative evidence only after a careful reading of qualitative materials, AI-assisted consultants fared worse: GPT missed the subtleties. But two groups of participants bucked that trend. The first — termed “cyborgs” by the authors — intertwined with the AI, constantly moulding, checking and refining its responses, while the second — “centaurs” — divided labour, handing off more AI-suited subtasks while focusing on their own areas of expertise.

Taken together, the studies tell us three things. First, regulation will be key. Online freelancing is about as unregulated a labour market as you will find. Without protections, even knowledge workers are in trouble.

Second, the more multi-faceted the role, the less risk of complete automation. The gig-worker model of performing one task for multiple clients — copywriting or logo design, for example — is especially exposed.

And third, getting the most out of these tools, while avoiding their pitfalls, requires treating them as an extension of ourselves, checking their outputs as we would our own. They are not separate, infallible assistants to whom we can defer or hand over responsibility.

In millennial-speak, generative AI is the white-collar worker’s frenemy. It’s wise to be wary, but this could become a flourishing relationship.

											Artificial intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human thought. The implications will change virtually every aspect of our world. Needpix



How does AI work? It helps to start at the beginning. Back in October 1950, British techno-visionary Alan Turing published an article called ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"" in the journal MIND that raised what at the time must have seemed to many like a science-fiction fantasy.
""May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?"" Turing asked.

Turing thought that they could. Moreover, he believed, it was possible to create software for a digital computer that enabled it to observe its environment and to learn new things, from playing chess to understanding and speaking a human language. And he thought machines eventually could develop the ability to do that on their own, without human guidance. ""We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields,"" he predicted.
Nearly 70 years later, Turing's seemingly outlandish vision has become a reality, thanks to monumental advancements in the field of computer science and AI research. Artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, gives machines the ability to learn from experience and perform cognitive tasks, the sort of stuff that was once thought to be reserved for human intelligence.
AI is rapidly spreading throughout civilization, where it has the promise of doing everything from enabling self driving cars to navigate the streets to making more accurate hurricane forecasts. On an everyday level, AI figures out what ads to show you on the web, and powers those friendly chatbots that pop up when you visit an e-commerce website to answer your questions and provide customer service. And AI-powered personal assistants in voice-activated smart home devices perform myriad tasks, from controlling our TVs and doorbells to answering trivia questions and helping us find our favorite songs.

But we're just getting started with it. As AI technology grows more sophisticated and capable, it's expected to massively boost the world's economy, creating about $13 trillion worth of additional activity by 2030, according to a McKinsey Global Institute forecast.
""AI is still early in adoption, but adoption is accelerating and it is being used across all industries,"" says Sarah Gates, an analytics platform strategist at SAS, a global software and services firm that focuses upon turning data into intelligence for clients.

How AI Could Transform the Economy








How Artificial Intelligence Works
 

It's even more amazing, perhaps, that our existence is quietly being transformed by deep learning algorithms that many of us barely understand, if at all — something so complex that even scientists have a tricky time explaining it.
""AI is a family of technologies that perform tasks that are thought to require intelligence if performed by humans,"" explains Vasant Honavar, a professor and director of the Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at Penn State University. ""I say 'thought,' because nobody is really quite sure what intelligence is.""


Advertisement  

Honavar describes two main categories of intelligence. There's narrow AI, which is achieving competence in a narrowly defined domain, such as analyzing images from X-rays and MRI scans in radiology. Artificial general intelligence, in contrast, describes much more human like thinking processes, like the ability to learn about anything and to talk about it. ""A machine might be good at some diagnoses in radiology, but if you ask it about baseball, it would be clueless,"" Honavar explains. Humans' intellectual versatility ""is still beyond the reach of AI at this point.""
According to Honavar, there are two key pieces to AI models. One of them is the engineering part — that is, building a computer program and computer systems that utilize intelligence in some way. The other is the science of intelligence, or rather, how to enable a machine to come up with a result comparable to what a human brain would come up with, even if the machine achieves it through a very different process. To use an analogy, ""birds fly and airplanes fly, but they fly in completely different ways,"" Honavar. ""Even so, they both make use of aerodynamics and physics. In the same way, artificial intelligence is based upon the notion that there are general principles about how intelligent systems behave.""





AI is ""basically the results of our attempting to understand and emulate the way that the brain works and the application of this to giving brain-like functions to otherwise autonomous systems (e.g., drones, robots and agents),"" Kurt Cagle, a writer, data scientist and futurist who's the founder of consulting firm Semantical, writes in an email. He's also editor of The Cagle Report, a daily information technology newsletter.
And while humans don't really think like computers, which utilize circuits, semi-conductors and magnetic media instead of biological cells to store information, there are some intriguing parallels. ""One thing we're beginning to discover is that graph networks are really interesting when you start talking about billions of nodes, and the brain is essentially a graph network, albeit one where you can control the strengths of processes by varying the resistance of neurons before a capacitive spark fires,"" Cagle explains. ""A single neuron by itself gives you a very limited amount of information, but fire enough neurons of varying strengths together, and you end up with a pattern that gets fired only in response to certain kinds of stimuli, typically modulated electrical signals through the DSPs [that is digital signal processing] that we call our retina and cochlea.""
""Most applications of AI have been in domains with large amounts of data,"" Honavar says. To use the radiology example again, the existence of large databases of X-rays and MRI scans that have been evaluated by human radiologists, makes it possible to train a machine to emulate that activity.
AI systems work by combining large amounts of data with intelligent algorithms — series of instructions — that allow the software to learn from patterns and features of the data, as this SAS primer on artificial intelligence explains.
In simulating the way a brain works, AI utilizes a bunch of different subfields, as the SAS primer notes.

Machine learning automates analytical model building, to find hidden insights in data without being programmed to look for something in particular or draw a certain conclusion.Artificial neural networks imitate the brain's array of interconnected neurons, and relay information between various units to find connections and derive meaning from data.Deep learning utilizes really big neural networks and a lot of computing power to find complex patterns in data, for applications such as image and speech recognition.Cognitive computing is about creating a ""natural, human-like interaction,"" as SAS puts it, including using the ability to interpret speech and respond to it.Computer vision employs pattern recognition and deep learning to understand the content of pictures and videos, and to enable machines to use real-time images to make sense of what's around them.Natural language processing involves analyzing and understanding human language and responding to it.

Decades of Research
 

The concept of AI dates back to the 1940s, and the term ""artificial intelligence"" was introduced at a 1956 conference at Dartmouth College. Over the next two decades, researchers developed programs that played games and did simple pattern recognition and machine learning. Cornell University scientist Frank Rosenblatt developed the Perceptron, the first artificial neural network, which ran on a 5-ton (4.5-metric ton), room-sized IBM computer that was fed punch cards.
But it wasn't until the mid-1980s that a second wave of more complex, deep neural networks were developed to tackle higher-level tasks, according to Honavar. In the early 1990s, another breakthrough enabled AI to generalize beyond the training experience.

In the 1990s and 2000s, other technological innovations — the web and increasingly powerful computers — helped accelerate the development of AI. ""With the advent of the web, large amounts of data became available in digital form,"" Honavar says. ""Genome sequencing and other projects started generating massive amounts of training data, and advances in computing made it possible to store and access this data. We could train the machines to do more complex tasks. You couldn't have had a deep learning model 30 years ago, because you didn't have the data and the computing power.""






AI and Robotics
 

AI systems are different from, but related to, robotics, in which machines sense their environment, perform calculations and do physical tasks either by themselves or under the direction of people, from factory work and cooking to landing on other planets. Honavar says that the two fields intersect in many ways.
""You can imagine robotics without much intelligence, purely mechanical devices like automated looms,"" Honavar says. ""There are examples of robots that are not intelligent in a significant way."" Conversely, there's robotics where intelligence is an integral part, such as guiding an autonomous vehicle around streets full of human-driven cars and pedestrians.

""It's a reasonable argument that to realize general intelligence, you would need robotics to some degree, because interaction with the world, to some degree, is an important part of intelligence,"" according to Honavar. ""To understand what it means to throw a ball, you have to be able to throw a ball.""
AI technologies have quietly become so ubiquitous that they're already found in many consumer products.
""A huge number of devices that fall within the Internet of Things (IoT) space readily use some kind of self-reinforcing AI, albeit very specialized AI,"" Cagle says. ""Cruise control was an early AI and is far more sophisticated when it works than most people realize. Noise dampening headphones. Anything that has a speech recognition capability, such as most contemporary television remotes. Social media filters. Spam filters. If you expand AI to cover machine learning, this would also include spell checkers, text-recommendation systems, really any recommendation system, washers and dryers, microwaves, dishwashers, really most home electronics produced after 2017, speakers, televisions, anti-lock braking systems, any electric vehicle, modern CCTV cameras. Most games use AI networks at many different levels.""
AI tools can outperform humans in some narrow domains, just as ""airplanes can fly longer distances, and carry more people than a bird could,"" Honavar says. AI, for example, is capable of processing millions of social media network interactions and gaining insights that can influence users' behavior — an ability that the AI expert worries may have ""not so good consequences.""
It's particularly good at making sense of massive amounts of information that would overwhelm a human brain. That capability enables internet companies, for example, to analyze the mountains of data that they collect about users and employ the insights in various ways to influence our behavior.

How AI Could Transform the Economy
 

Given AI's potential to do tasks that used to require humans, it's easy to fear that its spread could put most of us out of work. But some experts envision that while the combination of AI and robotics could eliminate some positions, it will create even more new jobs for tech-savvy workers.
""Those most at risk are those doing routine and repetitive tasks in retail, finance and manufacturing,"" Darrell West, a vice president and founding director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based public policy organization, explains in an email. ""But white-collar jobs in health care will also be affected and there will be an increase in job churn with people moving more frequently from job to job.


Advertisement  

New jobs will be created but many people will not have the skills needed for those positions. So the risk is a job mismatch that leaves people behind in the transition to a digital economy. Countries will have to invest more money in job retraining and workforce development as technology spreads. There will need to be lifelong learning so that people regularly can upgrade their job skills.""
And instead of replacing human workers, AI may be used to enhance their intellectual capabilities. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil has predicted that by the 2030s, AI have achieved human levels of intelligence, and that it will be possible to have AI that goes inside the human brain to boost memory, turning users into human-machine hybrids. As Kurzweil has described it, ""We're going to expand our minds and exemplify these artistic qualities that we value.""

Now That's Interesting
Cagle was on a panel at a science fiction convention several years ago with author David Brin, who has written about the concept of uplift, in which AI would be used to enhance the intellectual capabilities of sentient nonhuman life such as dolphins and apes to human level. ""Are we ethically prepared to shepherd a new intelligent species into the universe?"" Cagle asks. ""Are we comfortable enough with our own existence to create others that we will love, argue with, learn from and teach?""

Frequently Answered Questions
What are the 4 types of AI?

There are four types of AI: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware. Reactive AI is the simplest form of AI, and it is what most people think of when they think of AI. Limited memory AI can remember past events and use them to make decisions. Theory of mind AI can understand the thoughts and emotions of others. Self-aware AI is aware of its own thoughts and emotions.

A quick scan of the headlines makes it seem like generative artificial intelligence is everywhere these days. In fact, some of those headlines may actually have been written by generative AI, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that has demonstrated an uncanny ability to produce text that seems to have been written by a human.
But what do people really mean when they say “generative AI?”
Before the generative AI boom of the past few years, when people talked about AI, typically they were talking about machine-learning models that can learn to make a prediction based on data. For instance, such models are trained, using millions of examples, to predict whether a certain X-ray shows signs of a tumor or if a particular borrower is likely to default on a loan.
Generative AI can be thought of as a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific dataset. A generative AI system is one that learns to generate more objects that look like the data it was trained on.
“When it comes to the actual machinery underlying generative AI and other types of AI, the distinctions can be a little bit blurry. Oftentimes, the same algorithms can be used for both,” says Phillip Isola, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
And despite the hype that came with the release of ChatGPT and its counterparts, the technology itself isn’t brand new. These powerful machine-learning models draw on research and computational advances that go back more than 50 years.
An increase in complexity
An early example of generative AI is a much simpler model known as a Markov chain. The technique is named for Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician who in 1906 introduced this statistical method to model the behavior of random processes. In machine learning, Markov models have long been used for next-word prediction tasks, like the autocomplete function in an email program.
In text prediction, a Markov model generates the next word in a sentence by looking at the previous word or a few previous words. But because these simple models can only look back that far, they aren’t good at generating plausible text, says Tommi Jaakkola, the Thomas Siebel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, who is also a member of CSAIL and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS).
“We were generating things way before the last decade, but the major distinction here is in terms of the complexity of objects we can generate and the scale at which we can train these models,” he explains.
Just a few years ago, researchers tended to focus on finding a machine-learning algorithm that makes the best use of a specific dataset. But that focus has shifted a bit, and many researchers are now using larger datasets, perhaps with hundreds of millions or even billions of data points, to train models that can achieve impressive results.
The base models underlying ChatGPT and similar systems work in much the same way as a Markov model. But one big difference is that ChatGPT is far larger and more complex, with billions of parameters. And it has been trained on an enormous amount of data — in this case, much of the publicly available text on the internet.
In this huge corpus of text, words and sentences appear in sequences with certain dependencies. This recurrence helps the model understand how to cut text into statistical chunks that have some predictability. It learns the patterns of these blocks of text and uses this knowledge to propose what might come next.
More powerful architectures
While bigger datasets are one catalyst that led to the generative AI boom, a variety of major research advances also led to more complex deep-learning architectures.
In 2014, a machine-learning architecture known as a generative adversarial network (GAN) was proposed by researchers at the University of Montreal. GANs use two models that work in tandem: One learns to generate a target output (like an image) and the other learns to discriminate true data from the generator’s output. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and in the process learns to make more realistic outputs. The image generator StyleGAN is based on these types of models.  
Diffusion models were introduced a year later by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. By iteratively refining their output, these models learn to generate new data samples that resemble samples in a training dataset, and have been used to create realistic-looking images. A diffusion model is at the heart of the text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion.
In 2017, researchers at Google introduced the transformer architecture, which has been used to develop large language models, like those that power ChatGPT. In natural language processing, a transformer encodes each word in a corpus of text as a token and then generates an attention map, which captures each token’s relationships with all other tokens. This attention map helps the transformer understand context when it generates new text.
These are only a few of many approaches that can be used for generative AI.
A range of applications
What all of these approaches have in common is that they convert inputs into a set of tokens, which are numerical representations of chunks of data. As long as your data can be converted into this standard, token format, then in theory, you could apply these methods to generate new data that look similar.
“Your mileage might vary, depending on how noisy your data are and how difficult the signal is to extract, but it is really getting closer to the way a general-purpose CPU can take in any kind of data and start processing it in a unified way,” Isola says.
This opens up a huge array of applications for generative AI.
For instance, Isola’s group is using generative AI to create synthetic image data that could be used to train another intelligent system, such as by teaching a computer vision model how to recognize objects.
Jaakkola’s group is using generative AI to design novel protein structures or valid crystal structures that specify new materials. The same way a generative model learns the dependencies of language, if it’s shown crystal structures instead, it can learn the relationships that make structures stable and realizable, he explains.
But while generative models can achieve incredible results, they aren’t the best choice for all types of data. For tasks that involve making predictions on structured data, like the tabular data in a spreadsheet, generative AI models tend to be outperformed by traditional machine-learning methods, says Devavrat Shah, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of IDSS and of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems.
“The highest value they have, in my mind, is to become this terrific interface to machines that are human friendly. Previously, humans had to talk to machines in the language of machines to make things happen. Now, this interface has figured out how to talk to both humans and machines,” says Shah.
Raising red flags
Generative AI chatbots are now being used in call centers to field questions from human customers, but this application underscores one potential red flag of implementing these models — worker displacement.
In addition, generative AI can inherit and proliferate biases that exist in training data, or amplify hate speech and false statements. The models have the capacity to plagiarize, and can generate content that looks like it was produced by a specific human creator, raising potential copyright issues.
On the other side, Shah proposes that generative AI could empower artists, who could use generative tools to help them make creative content they might not otherwise have the means to produce.
In the future, he sees generative AI changing the economics in many disciplines.
One promising future direction Isola sees for generative AI is its use for fabrication. Instead of having a model make an image of a chair, perhaps it could generate a plan for a chair that could be produced.
He also sees future uses for generative AI systems in developing more generally intelligent AI agents.
“There are differences in how these models work and how we think the human brain works, but I think there are also similarities. We have the ability to think and dream in our heads, to come up with interesting ideas or plans, and I think generative AI is one of the tools that will empower agents to do that, as well,” Isola says.

One of the most pressing questions for employers and employees alike is how and to what degree the emergence of generative artificial intelligence will change the way people work.
Revolutionary technologies have the power to create new economic activity and entirely new professions, and natural-language chatbots that use AI to create text, images, code and audio with human-like fluency are expected to be especially transformative.
Generative AI—hailed as one of the most disruptive technologies since the smartphone—is expected to have wide-ranging effects on labor and the broader economy. In a recent report, Morgan Stanley Research economists gauged the groundbreaking technology’s near-term reverberations. Their conclusion: More than 40% of occupations might be affected by generative AI in the next three years.
“It is impossible to know for sure, but current generative AI technologies could affect as much as a quarter of the occupations that exist today, meaning that AI has the potential to augment them now or in the future, with associated labor costs that could reach at most $2.1 trillion,” says Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley. “Within three years, this might rise to 44% of occupations affected and $4.1 trillion of associated labor costs.”
Here’s where Morgan Stanley Research thinks generative AI for work could make the biggest ripples:





Balancing Disruption



Generative AI will increasingly augment or automate job roles and tasks, but accurately forecasting any resulting labor displacement remains a challenge. It has the potential for positive disruption—for example, the creation of completely new roles, or increased demand for specific jobs as costs fall and efficiencies rise. However, Generative AI could also cause negative disruption, such as AI replacing humans in certain functions. “As with any period of technological innovation, predictions of related job losses have generally proven unfounded amid increased productivity, lower prices and new products and services,” says Carpenter.
It is too soon to predict how rapidly these technologies will be adopted, analysts caution, with a recent AlphaWise survey of CIOs finding that companies are in the early stages of dealing with the legal, regulatory and implementation issues of generative AI. Of the survey respondents who said they plan to use generative AI in the future, most said they expected initial projects to be implemented in 2024 or 2025.

On the policy front, meanwhile, the White House has recently weighed in, with labor issues featuring in an executive order       (opens in a new tab) signed by President Joe Biden on Oct. 30, 2023, aimed at ""seizing the promise and managing the risks of artificial intelligence."" It calls for a report on AI’s potential labor-market impacts, as well as ""best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers"" in terms of job displacement and labor standards.





Productivity’s Macro Impacts



The adoption of new technologies generally boosts productivity, affecting not just labor markets but inflation, interest rates globally when new technologies diffuse around the World.
In the short term, increased labor productivity could spur faster GDP growth and lower inflation. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in the short run either because it decides to boost economic activity to a new higher production capacity, or inflation slows due to faster productivity growth. However, in the long-run, interest rates might rise amid sustained productivity growth and higher investment demand.
“Over the long term, labor disruptions could herald an unprecedented demand for reskilling displaced workers and require a significant increase in capacity for retraining that may depend on public-private partnerships to address,” Carpenter says.
To that end, he thinks some combination of corporate investment in reskilling and retraining programs together with government social-insurance programs are more likely to emerge as support mechanisms for workers impacted or displaced by generative AI, rather than more sweeping reforms such as universal basic income.
Indeed, the recent executive order calls for the Labor Department to identify and study options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions, including from AI.
In terms of hiring, a shift to prioritizing skills—especially those that are more difficult to replace with AI models—over credentials or occupation seems likely in areas most affected by job displacement.

New Era for Side Hustles



Generative AI is already proving a significant differentiator for the 5% of the population who work more than one job or have multiple earnings streams. A recent Morgan Stanley Research survey shows that multi-earners who use generative AI tools to enhance productivity or efficiency make $8.50 per hour, or 21%, more than those who don't.
Multi-earning in the U.S. has risen 11% in the past year, the survey shows, with the figures for content creation and ecommerce up 7%.
“The multi-earner era is an evolution of the gig economy,” says Ed Stanley, Morgan Stanley’s head of thematic research in Europe. “It centers on platforms from social media and gaming to shared mobility and vacation rentals that offer avenues to earn money outside of traditional employment streams.”
In the most optimistic scenario, income from multi-earning could top $1.4 trillion globally with generative AI adding $300 billion of that, by 2030.

With tech tycoon Elon Musk claiming that ""no job is needed"" in the future because of artificial intelligence and that you can have a job for ""personal satisfaction"" but AI would be able to do everything, does this genuinely indicate a jobless future?During a 50-minute fireside chat with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the end of the AI summit last week (Thursday 2 November), Musk said: “I think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history here. We will have for the first time something smarter than the smartest human. It’s hard to say exactly what that moment is but there will come a point where no job is needed. “One of the challenges in the future will be how we find meaning in life. So I don’t know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable.“That's why I say if you wish for a magic genie that gives you any wishes you want, there’s no limit. You don’t have this three-limit nonsense – you just have as many wishes as you want,” he said, adding that the world would enter “an age of abundance”.Musk added: “We won’t be on universal basic income, we will be on universal high income – because everyone will have access to this magic genie.” However, Sunak disagreed with Musk, saying: ""I am someone who believes work gives you meaning.”He said: “Work is a good thing and gives people purpose in their lives and, if you remove a large chunk of that, what does that mean and where do you get that drive, motivation or purpose?"" The debate comes as, according to The Telegraph, Labour frontbenchers have been considering a ‘robot tax’ which will target companies that sack staff and replace them with artificial intelligence. 
Hayfa Mohdzaini, senior research adviser for data, tech and AI at the CIPD, said a future of “no work” was one of the many possible futures of work, but what happens will depend on how we as a society respond to developments in AI. Mohdzaini added that key considerations will include which uses of AI are widespread and accepted and which ones we need to regulate or even “prohibit” – as well as which tasks we still choose to do ourselves and not rely on AI to complete. “It’s worth nothing as AI is already here and there are many examples within HR; for example, AI-embedded internal talent marketplace and AI chatbots for employee queries,” she said. People Management asked HR experts if artificial intelligence genuinely means a future without ‘work’ and what impact AI will have on the world of work and the HR function. Importance of lifelong learning“We’re in an unprecedented time where something is going to be far smarter than humanity,” said Annee Bayeux, chief learning strategist at Degreed. ""What this means for our future career prospects is yet to be determined,"" she said, adding that, to keep up, we must become lifelong learners who constantly refresh our skills and reinvent our careers.Bayeux added: ""I expect everyone will still want to work in some capacity.“Of course, finances and living standards also need to be considered; if AI takes most jobs, how will people make a living?“Simultaneously, we have some organisations like IBM, Unilever and Ericsson transforming into skills-based organisations, with a view of completely removing the job construct. In which case, we will see jobs disappear from our future... but work, in its essence, won’t.”Bayeux said that while AI will bring many benefits to individuals and organisations, this must be balanced with the risks that such advances can pose. She said employers must “tread carefully”, particularly when using AI in workplaces where adoption is growing exponentially, and that finding the right balance was dependent on employers using solutions with clear employee benefits.AI will complement humansDavid Collings, chair of sustainable business at Trinity Business School, said generative AI has the potential to be hugely disruptive in the world of work, ""on top of a pretty disruptive few years in the context of the pandemic and the impact that had on work for many of us"". He said Musk was ""probably correct in the sense that most work could be done to some extent by technology"", but the reality was that, rather than replacing humans, ""AI will complement humans in the workplace.""Do we want robots to be the default in law enforcement, health care or education, for example? Even if technologically possible, it is highly unlikely that we would choose that path as a society.”Collings added that some jobs would be eliminated and that as a society we needed to plan for and support those whose jobs were replaced through proactive reskilling and upskilling.Collaborative toolSarah Hamilton-Gill, managing director of Globus HR Consulting, said the introduction of AI had fuelled fears of a ""no-work future"", particularly in light of Musk's comments at the AI conference in the UK, but this overlooked its potential as a ""collaborative tool"" rather than one that replaces current roles. “AI is not a harbinger of joblessness but a transformative force in the workplace,” she said, adding that, for HR, AI presents a dual opportunity, optimising operations and enriching the employee experience. However, Hamilton-Gill said AI’s rise “necessitates a reskilling revolution” and HR will play a pivotal role in managing this transition. “Rather than displacing jobs, AI can redefine a fostering culture, fostering a future where human ingenuity and artificial intelligence co-exist to enhance productivity and innovation in the workplace,” she added.Disruption and change According to Gary Cookson, director of Epic HR, while AI will significantly disrupt work and will replace many jobs, it seems “unlikely to render work obsolete”.He said that would require more than just AI; it would take a “fundamental reimagining of our global economy and what the labour market is”. “Currently people work in exchange for money. If AI does the work, who pays the AI? And where do people get their money from? We aren’t ready as a society to address those issues,” Cookson said.Gemma Bullivant, HR coach and consultant, said the long-term future was “impossible to predict with any real accuracy” but it felt “premature” to predict the end of work and the end of jobs. She added that AI brings huge possibilities but also very real and serious risks, and we will need to “embrace the former while managing and mitigating the latter”.For the CIPD's resources on AI in the workplace, click hereCarry on the conversation on People Management's LinkedIn page

As countless organizations race to investigate or adopt artificial intelligence technologies, many are building out an AI skilled workforce. That includes the decision to appoint or hire a chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO).
Indeed, new research from Foundry finds that 11% of midsize to large organizations have already designated such an individual in the role, and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking one.
Foundry / AI Priorities Study 2023
The ideal individual to assume this role should have much more than top technology and AI skills, says Colin Reeves, principal data and AI recruiter at ConSol Partners in Los Angeles. They should be a champion for smart AI adoption, and be able to recognize and balance AI benefits with risks. They should be able to work collaboratively with many departments in developing AI strategy and vision, and they should be able to design and target relevant business use cases, assess project outcomes, and measure ROI in each case.
 
 
 













 
 

Clear expectations are emerging on the top experiences, skills, and traits that a CAIO candidate should bring to the job, Reeves says. Assuming the candidate passes muster on those counts, the individual can expect very positive short- and long-term impacts on their careers by taking up this emerging IT leadership role, he says.

What is a chief AI officer?
A chief AI officer is a senior IT executive who is responsible for setting a company’s overall AI strategy, including the design, development, and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies. Peruse job advertisements for CAIOs, and one might conclude that the majority of these executives are needed at technology vendors. Many certainly are, but opportunities abound — and are increasing — at organizations of all types, Reeves notes. A typical candidate is someone who has a proven track record of leading successful AI programs, and a vision for transforming the organization with AI.
Candidates for the CAIO role are typically mandated to modernize processes with AI, ensuring that AI is used with ethics and governance in mind, and in building an AI-first culture, Reeves explains.
 
 
 













 
 

The CAIO role and responsibilities
Parminder Bhatia is a prime example of the CAIO today. As chief AI officer at GE HealthCare, Bhatia focuses on AI strategy and execution, which includes utilizing AI to help streamline radiology workflows, reduce scan times, automate measurement, and enhance diagnosis, among other activities.
Bhatia’s team is responsible for the AI center-led development of platform, reusable components, and capabilities, such as building large models and advanced visualization with business unit partnerships.
“We’re driven by a mission to revolutionize healthcare interfaces by integrating voice, text, and the latest in AI visualizations,” Bhatia says. “This approach isn’t just about technological novelty. It’s also about creating user-centric tools that aim to redefine how medical professionals interact with and leverage technology, improve their efficiencies, and ultimately improve patient experience and outcome.”
 
 
 













 
 

GE HealthCare recognizes the transformative potential of generative AI and large foundational models, and is taking active steps to harness their capabilities, Bhatia says. His previous tenure at Amazon equipped him with valuable insights and experience, as he spearheaded the company’s HealthAI initiative. This initiative saw the birth of trailblazing services such as Comprehend Medical, which he says stands out as a premier healthcare-specific natural language processing (NLP) tool on the cloud.

Ozzie Coto, chief AI officer and CTO at The Cult Branding Co., provides another model for the CAIO role evolving today. Coto co-founded the company, served as its initial chief technology officer, and was later tasked with overseeing AI investments as well.
Coto views his promotion to CAIO as the result of his extensive experience in key leadership positions in the past, and his deep understanding of AI and its potential impact on the business. His primary mission as CAIO is to align the company’s AI initiatives with its business goals, and to ensure that the company is leveraging AI in a way that is ethical and compliant with regulations.
 
 
 













 
 

“This includes shaping a future-centric AI vision, orchestrating collaboration between different departments, and demystifying AI for all stakeholders,” Coto explains. “Additionally, I am tasked with fostering a culture of curiosity and innovation, promoting responsible use of AI, and ensuring that our AI initiatives are resilient and adaptable to changing business environments.”
Where the CAIO fits in the C-suite
A chief AI officer is considered to be part of the C-suite executive team, whether they report to the CEO directly, or another top officer, Reeves says.
Parminder Bhatia reports to GE HealthCare CTO Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, and is part of the central Science & Technology Organization that works in partnership with the company’s business segments such as Imaging, Ultrasound, Patient Care Monitoring, and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics.
 
 
 













 
 

For the past three years, Bhatia was leading several foundation models and generative AI efforts at Amazon — technology platforms such as Amazon CodeWhisperer and Bedrock, where a lot of these foundation models act similarly to ChatGPT. But he wanted to have a more direct impact himself.  
“At GE HealthCare we get into the devices. You’re a lot closer, so the impact you can have is a lot larger,” Bhatia explains. “I’ve worked on healthcare in the past, but I think GE HealthCare provided the best opportunity to combine those together and have a real impact on the problems that we work on.”
Ozzie Coto reports directly to the CEO. His role is strategic and cross-functional, and he works closely with other key leaders in the organization to drive AI initiatives. The position enables him to have a significant impact on the strategic direction of the company, and he says it underscores the importance that the organization places on AI and its potential to drive business growth and innovation.
 
 
 













 
 

While Coto works closely with other leaders to align AI initiatives with the overall budget, he does have a certain degree of budgetary autonomy.
“I map out a data-driven roadmap that is based on Kurzweil’s predictions,” Coto explains. “This autonomy is crucial in allowing me to make strategic decisions about our AI investments and to ensure that we are allocating resources in a way that maximizes the return on our AI investments.”
Coto typically oversees AI-related initiatives and strategies within the units that his team serves. His team implements advanced initiatives in their own organization, and then rolls out pretested systems. 
 
 
 













 
 

Budgets and staffs the CAIO can expect
A CAIO may have full budget authority for internal AI investments and external partnerships, Reeves explains. Some will state that they go by the CEO/CFO-set budget, and still seek sign-off at the board level. Typically reporting to the CAIO are data scientists and engineers, ML engineers, AI product leads, and software engineers focused on leveraging AI algorithms.

Why an AI-driven strategy is a must to defend against today’s cyberthreats

By Zscaler


21 May, 2024





Bhatia manages the central AI and ML organization at GE HealthCare, consisting of scientists, engineering, AI program and product teams. He works closely with colleagues across each segment and business.
GE HealthCare allocates more than $1 billion annually to R&D, Bhatia says. The company’s follows a hybrid approach to AI development and implementation, combining center-led development of platform, reusable components, and capabilities, such as advanced visualization, with business unit (BU) partnerships.
 
 
 













 
 

“Additionally, we utilize an internal process known as Worldwide Product Planning to ensure alignment across our company, guaranteeing that we meet the needs of both providers and patients,” Bhatia explains. “As part of central Science and Technology Organization, I am responsible for both horizontal capabilities to 10X accelerate the development of AI-enabled applications as well as vertical AI applications that are focused on business units.”
At Cult Branding, a cross-functional team of IT professionals, leading computer scientists, engineers, and data scientists report to Coto.
“Together, we work to implement and scale our AI projects. This team is critical to the success of our AI initiatives, and I am committed to fostering a collaborative and innovative environment that enables them to do their best work,” Coto says. “Additionally, we collaborate with various business units and departments to integrate AI into their processes. The reporting structure can differ from one organization to another.”
 
 
 













 
 

Coto believes he brings a strong technical understanding of AI, business acumen, leadership skills, communication skills, and ethical and legal knowledge to his role. These skills and traits enable him to effectively drive the organization’s AI initiatives, and to ensure that they are aligned with business goals and ethical standards.
“My ability to communicate complex AI concepts in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders is particularly important in ensuring the successful implementation of our AI initiatives,” Coto notes.
The benefits of the CAIO role — for the IT execs and organization as a whole
Success in the CAIO role can have significant short-term and long-term benefits, both for the individual and for their organization. In the short term, a successful CAIO will help enable AI adoption ad digital transformation, Reeves says. In the long term, it can help establish the individual and their organization as a world-class AI leader.
 
 
 













 
 

Both results apply at GE HealthCare. In short term, Bhatia says his role has provided great confidence in his abilities as both a technologist and a business strategist.
“I realized that I could do a lot of things that I didn’t think I could do prior to this,” Bhatia says. “I’ve gained a lot of confidence from this experience, and I feel now that I’ve done this, I can do almost anything.”

Long term, Bhatia says he would love to see his role make impact towards health-care equity. For example, one goal is to empower clinicians — including those without specialized ultrasound training — to conduct quick and accurate assessments, he explains. These tools will run on multiple ultrasound devices, expanding access to high-quality care worldwide, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
 
 
 













 
 

“At GE HealthCare, our D-3 precision strategy focuses on integrating smarter devices, a disease-specific approach, and digital solutions to address workflow inefficiencies and enhance care quality,” Bhatia explains. “We aim to develop scalable technology that can tackle a wide range of diseases using digital prowess. Generative and foundational models are vital here, as they could allow us to quickly adapt to different diseases for screening, early detection, progression, and even pinpointing noninvasive biomarkers with minimal training.”
In the short term, Coto says his role as CAIO has enabled him to solidify his position as a leader in the tech industry. In the long term, he believes it will allow him to play a crucial role in shaping the future of AI and its impact on businesses and society.
“This role provides me with the opportunity to influence the direction of our company and the broader industry, and I am excited about the potential to drive significant change and innovation through AI,” Coto says.
 
 
 













 
 

Skills and traits of successful chief AI officers
As to others that might aspire to a CAIO role, Coto says a best fit would be someone with a strong technical understanding of AI, business acumen, leadership skills, communication skills, and ethical and legal knowledge. They should also be adaptable, forward-thinking, and passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovation and efficiency. This individual should also have a proven track record of leading successful AI initiatives and a deep understanding of the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with AI, he says.

Why you should consider hiring a CAIO
With 21% of companies looking to add a chief AI officer to their IT leadership team, it’s becoming clear that rising interest in AI is translating into a greater desire for leadership around the complexities of AI in the enterprise. And it’s all about keeping on top of this promising, disruptive technology as it evolves, Coto says.
“I see AI becoming increasingly integrated into all aspects of business operations. For organizations not currently using AI, this means they will need to adapt quickly or risk falling behind,” Coto stresses. “It’s not just about implementing AI, but doing so in a way that is ethical, compliant, and aligned with business goals. As AI continues to evolve, it will become an increasingly important driver of business growth and innovation. Organizations that fail to embrace AI risk being left behind by their competitors.”
Bhatia agrees: “For organizations not currently utilizing AI technologies — I say the time is to get started now. There are so many benefits that will be left on the table if you do not embrace this technology.”
 
 
 













 
 

These can start with small steps — such as embracing devices that utilize AI to addressing training and skill barriers to enable more employees to make the most of the technology, Bhatia says. Partnerships will also be key to advancing AI, so organizations should look to find a trusted partner that can help them along the way to make their AI journey as seamless as possible.
And for many organizations, that journey may best be undertaken with a CAIO at the helm, to ensure an effective and ethical AI strategy is in place and that it is executed to advance the organization’s mission.

How generative AI is changing creative work


Text, image and audio generators offer new content creation capabilities, but they raise concerns about originality, ethics and the impact of automation on creative jobs.

Published: 07 Nov 2023


 
Generative AI tools such as Dall-E and ChatGPT are already affecting fields including graphic design, video and music. As these tools continue to evolve and improve, they raise considerations around copyright and attribution.







In some cases, generated content might not be directly copyrightable unless it involves substantial human input. Regulators and courts are also in the early stages of considering when and how intellectual property implications arise when AI is trained on copyrighted content to create new works.
C.J. Bangah, U.S. software principal and digital platform subsector leader at PwC, said AI has been in place in creative workflows in various ways for many years. However, the latest crop of generative AI tools is increasing awareness about how AI can be applied in creative workflows.
""Highly talented creatives worldwide can use AI to help bring their vision, at scale and with speed, to global markets without requiring massive upfront investments to translate an idea to action,"" Bangah said.
Narine Galstian, chief marketing officer at business and technology consulting service SADA, has found that generative AI tools have shifted her team's focus from the early stages of creating content to later stages by making the first draft faster and easier to whip up.
Increasingly, creative talent must be more involved in the middle and later stages of content production. Generative AI tools enable creatives to experiment with more choices in terms of creative direction. But in the middle stage, creatives need to verify that the output is what they intend. And at the end of the process, humans must edit and refine the content to ensure it's on brand and it accurately reflects the creator's aesthetic or intent.

How generative AI is affecting various creative fields
Alex Weishaupl, managing director at digital transformation consultancy Protiviti, said that -- far from earlier doom-and-gloom predictions -- the design and creative community is starting to enthusiastically embrace new generative services and tools.
Teams are finding interesting ways to integrate these tools into their workflows. In some cases, Weishaupl said, he sees a four- to fivefold increase in speed from the initial stages of idea generation and concept development to the final result.
Along the way, designers and creatives are taking advantage of generative AI integrations into tools to make mood boards, storyboards and visual inspirations, which enable teams to start exploring and iterating on interesting ideas much faster. Generative AI tools are also reducing the burdensome work of content operations for localization and personalization across local markets and smaller segments.
Nishant Jeyanth, practice director at research firm Everest Group, also sees generative AI tools playing a broader role in creative content lifecycles in enterprises. Tools such as ChatGPT and Dall-E are especially useful for crafting first drafts.
In graphic design, generative AI could automate repetitive tasks such as resizing and cropping, while ensuring consistency in design and quality. It could also make the processes of conceptualization, prototyping and design verification faster and more cost-effective. However, overreliance on AI could lead to issues such as a lack of human touch, loss of cultural context and aesthetic fatigue.
For video production, AI tools can provide automated transcripts and video tagging, as well as predictive editing and real-time feedback. Generative AI also shows promise for improving efficiency in postproduction and cross-platform optimization. But concerns remain around authenticity, trust, privacy, content pollution and loss of signature style.
In music, generative AI can produce adaptive compositions, synthesize and enhance voices, auto-tag, and generate metadata. AI tools can also offer users personalized song recommendations based on their mood. However, potential pitfalls include emotional deficiency, overemphasis on predictive analysis and difficulty measuring the quality of AI-generated music.





Generative AI raises new copyright and attribution issues
The creative industry, courts and regulators are still trying to figure out how generative AI will affect the future of copyright and attribution.
""No one has a definitive answer on how to handle copyright and attribution when the benefits of using large language models are so widespread and apparent,"" Galstian said.
Copyright and attribution remain gray areas for generative AI because, to date, there are few cases to show how courts will evaluate copyright claims. It helps that major generative AI providers are offering training data indemnity to soften these concerns. However, this will continue to be an area of uncertainty until legislators or judges clearly spell out how they will interpret such claims, Weishaupl said.
An additional complication is that copyright and business practices vary widely across industries. Written works, for example, have high standards and clear protocols for attribution and fair use. The music industry, in contrast, has a much more convoluted legal framework consisting of minute -- and sometimes inconsistent -- distinctions between copy and interpolation.
It's unclear exactly where generative AI creations will fall along this spectrum, including within the same domain and across different types of content. In Bangah's view, attribution specific to AI learning models will need to be considered from the perspective of human creators and AI learning agents.
""The monetization, access rights and responsibility of the enterprise in navigating the right way to harness AI without violating standards or expectations will be a continued area of focus in the future,"" she said.


The threat of automation in creative fields
Automated and augmented content generation tools could erase some jobs at the same time that they create others and make some existing work much easier.
Galstian said most enterprises will approach generative AI as a tool to enhance creativity, not replace it. Because today's crop of generative AI tools can create realistic yet ultimately fabricated content, rigorous evaluation and quality control will be critical aspects of generative AI-driven creative workflows.
John Singleton, co-founder of AI development platform Watchful, warned that automation could replace entire workflows if one worker is able to perform tasks that previously required a team of 10. Although this could let business users and some creatives invest more time into important work, many other creators could lose their jobs, creating friction alongside new opportunities.


Generative AI's potential impacts on the creative process
Marco Santos, Americas CEO at digital transformation consultancy GFT, said that at his firm, generative AI is already removing days and weeks of time that graphic designers previously used to find inspiration and best practices to inform their approach. Designers can now input a description of a general idea into an AI tool and eliminate the process of reviewing other platforms and sites one by one.
For instance, a designer might input a prompt similar to the following: ""A minimalistic mobile banking interface that takes the user fluidly through a four-step process, showing no more than three fields per screen."" The AI tool will then return several concepts based on best practices it identifies across the digital landscape, often within seconds.
Rather than using these outputs as the final design, designers can then use their own skills and creativity to review the elements across those concepts and conceive of something greater than the sum of its parts. This could include other internal considerations to which the AI doesn't have access.
Nisha Krishan, practice director at Everest Group, said that some of the various ways generative AI is affecting creative workflows in the enterprise include the following:

Idea generation, such as AI-assisted brainstorming and content suggestions.
User-centric content design, such as personalized content that is dynamically generated and displayed based on user behavior.
Agile content production, such as automated content drafting based on content briefs and user insights.
A/B testing and optimization, such as many variations of AI-powered A/B tests backed by user data.
Trendspotting and predictive content, such as using AI trend prediction to proactively create content on emerging topics.
Interactive and visual content generation, such as AI-generated quizzes, questions, enhanced visuals and other interactive elements.
Content quality assurance, such as AI-enhanced proofreading and editing to maintain quality and accuracy.
Data-backed insights, such as AI-generated insight reports that summarize user data and content performance matrices.

 Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth: Goldman Sachs Research forecasts AI will start having a measurable impact on US GDP in 2027 and begin affecting growth in other economies around the world in the years that follow.
 The foundation of the forecast is the finding that AI could ultimately automate around 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10-20% of work in emerging economies, Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani write in the team’s report.



 They estimate a growth boost to GDP from AI of 0.4 percentage points in the US, 0.3 percentage points on average in other DMs, and 0.2 percentage points on average in advanced EMs by 2034. In other emerging markets, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts a smaller boost from AI given adoption will probably take longer and AI exposure will likely be lower.
 “We expect this automation to drive labor cost savings and free up workers’ time, some of which will likely be allocated to new tasks,” Briggs and Kodnani write. The ultimate size of those effects will depend on how capable AI actually becomes and how it’s implemented.
 

           
       
 How much can AI improve productivity?
 In the baseline scenario, the Goldman Sachs Research economists estimate AI could increase US productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points annually assuming widespread adoption over a 10-year period. They expect similar effects in other major developed markets, and a somewhat smaller impact of 0.7-1.3 percentage points in most emerging economies given their higher share of employment in sectors with low AI exposure like agriculture and construction.
 Taken at face value, those kinds of productivity gains would suggest a substantial jump in GDP growth around the globe. Assuming workers aren’t permanently replaced by automation and there’s capital to support the increase in productivity, the increase in productivity could boost long-run worldwide GDP by as much as 15%. But Briggs and Kodnani think the net effect will be somewhat lower than that for two key reasons.
 First, our economists already include technological innovation in their economic forecasts. Simply adding their estimates for the boost in productivity from AI to the current trend would likely result in some double counting. They note that information and communication technology (ICT) investment has already been the main driver of productivity growth in major economies over the last 20-30 years.
 And second, the underlying productivity growth has been slowing. Academic research suggests that growth in total factor productivity (calculated by dividing real output by the combination of labor and capital inputs) tends to slow over time as countries develop, except during rare “regime shifts” such as those triggered by the first and second industrial revolutions.
 Predictions of AI superintelligence seem premature
 Is generative AI different? Some observers have argued that it could be a paradigm-shifting technology that ushers in a new regime for productivity growth. Equity analysts in Goldman Sachs Research have identified sectors where they think this could happen, including in healthcare and drug discovery, cybersecurity, design, and software development. Some have gone a step further and view recent advancements in AI as a meaningful step towards a “superintelligence” that is able to process information, formulate views, and innovate beyond the capability of humans.
 For now, the more extreme predictions appear “very premature, especially given the well-documented limitations of current AI models,” Briggs and Kodnani write. “We therefore maintain our view that for the foreseeable future, generative AI will mostly drive efficiency gains by automating less difficult but time-consuming tasks, thereby empowering workers to engage in more productive activities.”
 In the meantime, much will depend on the adoption timeline. Historically, productivity booms driven by prior milestone technologies — such as the electric motor and personal computer — have lagged the initial innovation by more than a decade. These innovations only began to show up in macroeconomic data once roughly half of affected businesses had adopted the technology.
 
  
 “We have been relatively cautious on the AI adoption timeline,” Briggs and Kodnani say. “While a rapid acceleration in AI-related investment is ongoing for leading technology and professional services firms which are developing and pioneering the use of AI, the effects on productivity that we have estimated will require the implementation of AI across a broader set of industries and job functions.”
 AI’s effects on GDP will take time to emerge
 Surveys of businesses and executives indicate that they generally anticipate a small impact from AI on activity and hiring needs in the next 1-3 years but a much larger impact in the next 3-10 years. Likewise, Goldman Sachs Research expects broad-based adoption to accelerate in the US beginning in the second half of this decade. The adoption timeline may be even more drawn out elsewhere, as the US and other advanced economies have historically led in the adoption of milestone technologies.
 Taken together, our economists’ model indicates AI will probably have a positive impact on GDP over the next decade — but it will take a few years to show up in the numbers. Goldman Sachs Research is leaving its forecasts unchanged until at least 2027 for the US and 2028 for other economies. How the timeline for adoption plays out, the amount of ICT investment that’s displaced by AI spending, the extent of AI’s emerging capabilities, as well as potential regulatory barriers, will all influence how and to what extent these economic gains are realized.
 “Our estimates reflect a balanced consideration of these risks, and provide a template for analyzing the longer-run effects of AI on the macroeconomy,” Briggs and Kodnani write. “In our view, the development of capable AI is likely to be among the most consequential macroeconomic stories of the 21st century, with important implications for relative economic performance, financial market returns, and longer-run interest rates.”

A new executive order on artificial intelligence could help immigrants and temporary visa holders with AI backgrounds. The measure instructs government agencies to implement the order’s aspirational language. The possibility the proposed H-1B rule could make it harder to recruit and retain foreign-born AI experts looms over the executive order.


The AI Executive Order
On October 30, 2023, President Biden issued an executive order on the “Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The order recognizes the significant role of immigrants, international students and high-skilled temporary visa holders in AI.

“Immigrants have founded or cofounded nearly two-thirds (65% or 28 of 43) of the top AI companies in the United States, and 70% of full-time graduate students in fields related to artificial intelligence are international students,” according to a National Foundation for American Policy study. “Seventy-seven percent of the leading U.S.-based AI companies were founded or cofounded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. Forty-two percent (18 of 43) of the top U.S.-based AI companies had a founder who came to America as an international student.” (I authored the study.)

PROMOTED
“Within 90 days of the date of this order, to attract and retain talent in AI and other critical and emerging technologies in the United States economy, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take appropriate steps to “streamline processing times of visa petitions and applications, including by ensuring timely availability of visa appointments, for noncitizens who seek to travel to the United States to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.”

“The fast timelines being imposed on USCIS, State and the Department of Labor make it clear that the president wants action quickly,” said Greg Siskind of Siskind Susser.
The executive order asks the State Department to consider adding J-1 research scholars and F-1 students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to the upcoming domestic visa renewal program. The State Department may also initiate rulemaking “to establish new criteria to designate countries and skills on the Department of State’s Exchange Visitor Skills List as it relates to the 2-year foreign residence requirement for certain J-1 nonimmigrants, including those skills that are critical to the United States” and to “consider publishing updates to the 2009 Revised Exchange Visitor Skills List.”

Guidance On EB-1 And EB-2, Schedule A
Expanding the occupations lists on Schedule A and the directive on EB-1 (employment-based, first preference) and EB-2 (employment-based, second preference) are likely the most positive elements in the executive order, according to Lynden Melmed of Berry Appleman & Leiden, a former chief counsel of USCIS.

The executive order asks the Department of Homeland Security (and USCIS) to “clarify and modernize immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies, including O-1A and EB-1 noncitizens of extraordinary ability; EB-2 advanced-degree holders and noncitizens of exceptional ability; and startup founders in AI and other critical and emerging technologies using the International Entrepreneur Rule.”
Melmed believes the guidance could make it easier to establish grounds for a National Interest Waiver, helping more outstanding individuals to qualify and self-petition.
The executive order assigns the Secretary of Labor to consider expanding the Schedule A list of occupations after soliciting public input and “identifying AI and other STEM-related occupations, as well as additional occupations across the economy, for which there is an insufficient number of ready, willing, able, and qualified United States workers.”
If DOL lists a foreign national’s occupation on Schedule A, their employer can avoid labor certification and lengthy PERM processing. However, the Department of Labor has not updated the list in decades.
“The case for using Schedule A is stronger when DOL’s processing times are long,” said Melmed. “Today, companies face a 6-8 month process to obtain a Prevailing Wage Determination, and then the request for a labor certification can take just as long. A failure to designate an occupation for Schedule A often means a year-long delay and significant operational costs for the government and the private sector.
“When we look at the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the U.S. can’t afford self-imposed delays in attracting and retaining foreign workers with those specialized skills. Leveraging Schedule A for those occupations where the executive branch has already determined a shortage exists is an easy way to advance U.S. interests.”
Melmed thinks DOL should add several occupations to Schedule A, including software developers, computer programmers, computer and information systems managers, computer and information research scientists, operations research analysts, data scientists, quantitative analysts, hardware engineers and silicon engineers.
Adjustment Of Status
The executive order asks DHS to “consider initiating a rulemaking to enhance the process for noncitizens, including experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies and their spouses, dependents, and children, to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident.” This section likely refers to upcoming rulemaking on adjustment of status.
Proposed H-1B Rule: A Cloud Hanging Over The AI Executive Order
The executive order references the proposed H-1B rule that likely would make it more difficult for employers to attract and retain AI and related foreign-born talent.
“The Biden administration’s proposed rule takes crucial language on degrees from a restrictive interim final rule the Trump administration published in 2020,” according to a recent Forbes article. “Courts later blocked the Trump rule. Attorneys and companies warned at the time the rule’s language would stop many talented foreign-born professionals from working in America.”
The Biden H-1B rule uses the phrase “directly related specific specialty” to narrow the positions considered specialty occupations.
“There is an inconsistency between the proposed rule and AI executive order,” according to Kevin Miner of Fragomen. “Unfortunately, there are several aspects of the proposed H-1B regulation that—if implemented as proposed—will have the exact opposite effect and limits the ability of highly skilled temporary visa holders to stay and work in the United States.
“The language in the proposed regulation could be used by adjudicators at USCIS to deny H-1B petitions where the degree field doesn’t precisely match what the adjudicator believes would be required to perform the role, and with fast-evolving jobs like those in AI, this can change quickly. USCIS would be far better off focusing on the entire course of study—including specific coursework completed—rather than the degree field.”
Miner notes the rule’s restriction would ultimately affect immigrants as well since most employment-based immigrants begin working in the United States with H-1B status. “The reality is that a lot of technology roles, including those in AI, are filled by people who have degrees that are not in something traditional like computer science,” said Miner. “A whole variety of engineering disciplines, mathematics, statistics, operations research, physics, and a host of other fields have the kinds of technology content that is required by employers seeking to fill these roles.” Today, USCIS often looks at the actual coursework rather than the degree field, which would likely change if the proposed rule takes effect as currently drafted.
A More Optimistic Take On AI
The non-immigration parts of the Biden administration’s AI executive order have been criticized as alarmist and potentially leading to overregulation that will stifle innovation.
The Conservative Futurist: How To Create The Sci-Fi World We Were Promised by James Pethokoukis adopts a more optimistic take on AI and other technologies. Pethokoukis writes in his book that the absence of heavy regulation in the 1990s allowed the Internet and accompanying innovation to flourish. “That 1990s lesson should strongly inform how government regulations artificial intelligence/machine learning, including generative AI, given the tremendous potential benefits to humanity.”
Pethokoukis argues if America wants to lead and succeed in the industries and technologies of the future, it needs a more open immigration policy. He cites NFAP research on immigrant entrepreneurs in AI and billion-dollar startups to highlight the benefits of immigration. “America needs all the smart people it can get,” he writes. “On that, economists seem unanimous.” He also favors more open trade, which has veered into protectionism during the Trump and Biden administrations.
“We currently stand at a moment when great progress is possible thanks to a host of emerging technologies,” writes Pethokoukis. The Biden executive order recommends America attract and retain talent in AI so that the most significant technologies in the 21st century can be produced in the United States.

Talent   //   November 10, 2023What’s at risk when using ChatGPT to write cover letters? By Hailey Mensik

Roughly half of job candidates are using generative AI to help with their job applications, leaning on the tools to tailor their resumes to best align with a job description, or to come up with answers to potential interview questions. They’re most often using it for one of the more dreaded tasks — writing their cover letters — that survey, which included responses from over 3,500 job hunters conducted this August found.
As more organizations employ other AI tools to filter and sort through hundreds of applications, cover letters remain one of the only opportunities job seekers have to express their voice and individuality, and to tell a more colorful story of their career arc.  
“If your resume does not fully tell the story of why you’re a good fit for this job, your cover letter is the only other opportunity that you have,” said Jamie Kohn, a senior research director in Gartner’s human resource practice. “But whether that cover letter actually gets read becomes another question.”







            ""[Cover letters] can be an opportunity to set yourself apart, especially if you are in the process of changing careers. Generative AI is never going to capture that narrative of your career,”         


 

                Jamie Kohn, senior research director, Gartner’s human resource practice.            







Some industries lean far less on writing samples and cover letters than others, and are continuing to rely less on them — like the tech space — where technical skills matter most. HR software firm Paycor no longer requires cover letters. “They’re definitely not as common as they used to be,” said Shayna Royal, Paycor’s director of talent acquisition.

There’s about a 50% chance your cover letter will actually get thoroughly read by a recruiter, Kimberly Gottschalk, head of innovation at global talent solutions provider LHH, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing a good job on. 
“Theoretically a cover letter is important because it’s your first opportunity to present yourself, and first impressions are very meaningful,” Gottschalk said.
More writing-heavy professions, like marketing and public relations and research roles still depend on those, and candidates using AI to write them could be doing themselves a disservice. “They can be an opportunity to set yourself apart, especially if you are in the process of changing careers,” Kohn said. “Generative AI is never going to capture that narrative of your career,” she said.

The survey found that among job seekers using generative AI in job applications, about half use it to write their cover letters, and slightly less (49%) are using it for their resumes. Some 44% said they’ve used AI on writing assessments during the interview process, while 39% said they’ve used it to write answers to questions in assessments. And 31% said they’ve let AI write their personal biography for their personal pages on hiring platforms.
The rapid adoption of generative AI among job seekers, particularly ChatGPT after it launched a year ago, means recruiters will have to adapt and should already be revisiting their hiring strategies, according to the report.

How companies should respond
Company leaders are approaching this issue from two points of view. Those in the first camp believe candidates are being resourceful using the tools for their applications, and that using AI will likely increasingly become a part of their own jobs. Those in the other camp are now worried about their ability to determine who is actually a high quality candidate. Much depends on how exactly candidates are using AI in the process, though. 
“I think people are less concerned about resumes and cover letters, and more thinking about those interview and assessment implications,” Kohn said.
Some tips for recruiters to better evaluate whether a candidate is actually a good fit or using AI to make them look like it is to look harder at specific examples of situations discussed in interviews, Kohn said. Those on the hiring side should also ask many follow up questions in interviews to better determine the logic behind a candidate’s answer. 
They should also remain cognizant of the way their filters may sort out potentially qualified candidates, and still lean on things like cover letters when possible and other ways for candidates to better express their personality and working experience. 
More recently some job seekers have shifted their efforts from telling their story in strong cover letters, instead writing directly to hiring managers via email or Linkedin. “So they’re still trying to make that personal connection and tell their story, but they’re just doing it in a more direct way. In that situation you can help to ensure that your name at least crosses somebody’s desk,” she said. 
Royal is seeing the same. “People are using the tools available to them to just find the right person,” she said.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

That’s because working with generative AI has profoundly changed the way I work, what I work on and, increasingly, how I think. Here is what I have learned in my 11 months of experimentation and exploration of tools like ChatGPT, Scite and Claude—and the lessons that may help other people make the most of these new technologies, too.1. Ask for a quick prototypeBefore dressmakers sew a silk dress, they make a “muslin”: a version of the dress made from inexpensive fabric, so they can troubleshoot before using the good stuff. That’s how I write with AI: Before I invest in drafting an article or report that may or may not work, I get ChatGPT to do a quick version. It helps me see whether the idea or structure I have in mind is going to work, and then I can adjust and do my own (better) version.Copyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In times gone by, lawyers would spend hours poring over documents and huge amounts of time and energy on research. But for many of today’s law firms, those days are coming to an end. The landscape is being revolutionised, thanks to exciting new technology and automation.
Artificial intelligence tools can now help shoulder the burden of the kind of work that drains lawyers’ time — from reviewing documents and due diligence checks, to drafting legal documents and carrying out legal research. In 2021, Oxford University estimated that around half of all solicitors in England and Wales were using at least one form of AI-assisted lawtech (specialised solutions for the legal sector). 
And generative AI has the potential to make even greater strides in our legal sector. With the advent of increasingly advanced programmes — like ChatGPT and other large language models — we can see just how much power they have to understand and generate meaningful responses to complex questions.
It gives us a tantalising glimpse into the future. Just think of the potential this could offer to law firms when it comes to improving access to legal services — reducing the time and costs from previously labour-intensive work.
Lawtech UK
TNW Conference 2025 - Back to NDSM on June 19-20, 2025 - Save the date!As we wrapped up our incredible 2024 edition, we're pleased to announce our return to Amsterdam NDSM in 2025. Registration now!

Each new advancement brings the possibility of faster, smarter, more effective working, freeing up lawyers’ time to focus on the things that really require their expertise. Above all, it’s a real opportunity to make legal services more accessible for the public as they navigate a world of legal rights. That’s a win for law firms, but most of all, it’s a win for those needing their services.
So, now we are in a new and exciting phase of experimentation and exploration. It’s a huge area of interest for the Government, and for me as Justice Minister, as we do even more to improve access to legal services for people in this country.
In the past decade the UK has quickly become a world-leader in lawtech and we want to help our innovators to continue to grow.
In 2019, we set up LawtechUK as an industry-led programme to support the growth of the lawtech industry in the UK. Now in its second phase, and headed up by CodeBase and Legal Geek, it has been a huge success. Backed by £6 million of funding from 2019 up to 2025, it is a cause close to my heart — one I’m incredibly proud of.
We’re also helping our lawtechs promote and sell their products in international markets. The Ministry of Justice’s GREAT Legal Services campaign and Department for Business and Trade have helped UK lawtech make business connections across the world — including high-potential markets like Singapore, Australia, and the US. The GREAT campaign promotes a variety of UK legal services, and in the last financial year helped to generate more than £6 million in projected business wins for UK lawyers, and over 60 business leads.
Lawtech startups leading the way
The sector is going from strength to strength with each new development. Take Harvey AI, which is using natural language processing, machine learning, and data analytics to automate and enhance various aspects of legal work, such as contract analysis, litigation, and regulatory compliance. Genie AI has created a tool for drafting contracts, drawing on extensive data to suggest clauses. And Summize offers legal contract lifecycle management and generates internal summaries of contracts to assist lawyers. 
RobinAI has created a machine learning model using data from over 4 million legal documents, enabling users to draft and negotiate contacts as much as 80% faster while saving people up to 75% of their legal fees. And Legl has integrate a generative AI layer to enhance client due diligence, reducing complexity, and speeding up the collection of information to reduce the amount of data to be assessed by professionals.
The benefits extend far beyond more efficient legal services. A report from the Solicitors Regulation Authority estimated that AI could add as much as £630 billion to the economy by 2035. And it could create upwards of 14 million new jobs by 2027, as more firms bring in tech specialists and upskill teams — so collaboration and support for businesses really is key.
Isambard-AI
It’s why we’re investing in a world-leading AI Research Resource in Bristol, backed by a £900 million fund, to turbocharge scientific discovery and keep the UK at the forefront of AI development. The Isambard-AI cluster will be one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, helping industry experts and researchers harness the game-changing potential of AI.
But amid all this growth and innovation, we have to consider risk if we’re to fully capitalise on the benefits of generative AI. We need appropriate regulation that allows innovation while protecting users.  
We also need transparency in the systems we create, because if we can’t understand how a decision has been made, how can we explain it or trust it in our services? And we need reliable data to draw from and to avoid the risk of bias and discrimination, so that users feel safe to manage information in line with GDPR and data privacy regulation.  
Supporting startups in navigating regulation
The Government is fully behind this work, identifying AI as one of five critical technologies essential for making the UK a global science and technology superpower.
Just last month, LawtechUK brought together lawyers, technologists, regulators, and other experts to explore what generative AI means for the legal sector and how it can benefit consumers of legal services. They are now leading on work to understand how this technology is being used across the country, mapping out areas of work to improve collaboration and truly grasp its potential. And LawtechUK’s Regulatory Response Unit is bringing together regulators into a single, fast response forum to support startups navigating the regulatory landscape.  
And that’s not all. The new Office for Artificial Intelligence is developing a pro-innovation regulatory framework to address risk without stifling growth. This will be underpinned by five principles which guide and inform the responsible development and use of AI.
Ethically future-proofing legal services
Ultimately all innovation carries risk, and Generative AI raises many ethical, social, and practical concerns. But it’s a risk we’re determined to manage. That’s why our Frontier AI Taskforce is helping evaluate the risks of AI, and the UK hosted a global AI Safety Summit last week.
What we can’t risk is our world class legal services sector getting left behind as others surge forward on the rising tide of AI. By gripping the issues, and encouraging safe adoption — we can future-proof our legal services without compromising on ethics, accuracy, and quality.
And as a long-standing legal services world leader, there’s no place we’d rather be than leading the charge on this exciting new lawtech.

To navigate this shift,  employers, employees and policymakers must be prepared . Ensuring workers can harness the true potential of AI, while setting clear rules that uphold job quality, is one of the key themes of this year’s  European Employment & Social Rights Forum  (EESRF). The Forum, focusing this year on  ‘The impact of AI on the world of work’,  is hosted by the European Commission in Brussels and online  on 16 and 17 November  2023. Be part of the dialogue  to help shape fair, safe and inclusive workplaces at a time when AI enters the world of work. Europe’s policies must keep up with technology, and technological innovation requires social innovation. Even many leading players within the AI community are calling for comprehensive legislation to address these challenges, including ethical standards and clear rules on the development and use of AI. And Europe is acting: as part of its  digital strategy , the EU wants to regulate AI through the  AI Act , the world’s first comprehensive AI legislation , creating better conditions for the development and use of this innovative technology. There is no doubt that AI has the potential to create many benefits for workers, such as better healthcare, safer and cleaner transport, more efficient manufacturing, and cheaper and more sustainable energy. AI also has the potential to improve workplace safety and make for more inclusive and stable work environments. According to an OECD study, 63 per cent of workers using AI in the finance and manufacturing sectors found their jobs more enjoyable as a result.

Jessica Lessin, founder and CEO of The Information, explored the symbiotic relationship between generative AI and hybrid work at The Information’s 2023 WTF Summit with three experts: Rosie Sargeant, project leader, Boston Consulting Group Lyra Schramm, vice president, people strategy and innovation, Google Dr. Rebecca Hinds, head of The Work Innovation Lab, Asana  The Intersection of Hybrid Work and Generative AILessin started by asking how forward-looking workplaces are thinking about AI at this moment. Rosie Sargeant answered first: “In considering how generative AI can unlock productivity gains at BCG, we’re also thinking about the kinds of work where it is important to maintain or even augment the human element – and how we can best enable that through our ways of working and collaboration tools and spaces. For instance, rethinking how we spend our days to co-locate as a team for the moments that matter, whilst enabling our people to do certain tasks like focus and admin work remotely if they prefer to do so.”Without question, AI is top of mind and a high priority for companies today. Lyra Schramm said, “Every single company is trying to reimagine and redefine how they work. With generative AI, you’re going to have this mix of human colleagues and AI colleagues.” She added, “At Google, we're using generative AI in HR around chatbots and more tactical work. We’re beginning to use it for predictive analytics. Next up? Skills gaps analysis.”Every company represented on the panel is experimenting to see where AI fits within their organization. Dr. Rebecca Hinds asked her team at Asana’s Work Innovation Lab to use AI for every possible task for a week. The goal was to understand where AI can add value—and where it simply can’t. She agrees with Schramm about where the current use cases are across the company: tactical tasks such as administrative work, data analysis and content productionThe Fear Is RealSkepticism about AI is palpable within the panelists’ organizations. “Right now at Asana, there’s a tension between excitement, nervousness and uncertainty,” said Hinds.Sargeant agreed, but pointed out that feelings about AI vary significantly within corporate ranks. “There is a lot of nervousness—and it centers around the more junior ranks,” she said. “People need to understand how generative AI can really make work better for them.”This is an area Hinds at Asana has been delving into: “More transparency, more upskilling and reskilling around AI, strongly correlates not only with confidence in employees’ ability to use AI, but also excitement and optimism around the technology.”It’s not just important to sell AI internally, Sargeant added. Companies need to be very thoughtful about next steps. “We’re going to have to go very specifically into individual teams and functions and understand how generative AI is really going to change the work for them. And we need to bring workers along on the journey.”Putting AI to WorkBuilding AI into a company’s workflow is time-consuming, resource intensive and expensive. What does that mean for companies today?Schramm advised a gradual approach like the one Google is using internally: “Start small and do pilots to determine where AI will have the most impact—because yes, AI is expensive.”“The biggest problem I see in organizations today is a lack of visibility into how work is happening,” Hinds said. The good news, she pointed out, is that AI is uniquely poised to solve this: “Currently, there isn’t data to concretely say whether a company’s hybrid model is working. With AI, you can start to answer whether your in-office collaboration leads to higher productivity. You can even find out if in-office collaboration on Wednesdays leads to higher productivity than it does on Fridays.”What to Expect in the Next 24 MonthsThe panelists agreed that the immediate future for AI is all about productivity.Sargeant said: “My teams will be able to create content more quickly than ever before—whilst maintaining or perhaps even improving the quality and relevance of our output.”“Right now, AI is doing a good job of boosting individual productivity. What’s really exciting is the opportunity to boost productivity at the team and organizational levels,” said Hinds.Schramm shares Hinds’ excitement. She said: “It will be really interesting to measure the increase in productivity. We’re all going to have to figure out how to reinvest capital to most effectively accelerate the business.”It’s early days, of course, in the partnership between AI and hybrid work, but all of the panelists were optimistic. “AI is at the worst it will ever be right now. The more we can learn with AI, the more we can harness its potential. It’s only going to get better,” said Hinds.RecommendedWhy Many AI Startups Are Consultancies Posing as Software BusinessesBy Stephanie Palazzolo3 months agoGenerative AI’s Open Secret: Everyone Is Copying Everyone ElseBy Stephanie Palazzolo3 months agoFunding for Generative AI Startups Shifts to ApplicationsBy Akash Pasricha3 months agoAmazon, Google Quietly Tamp Down Generative AI ExpectationsBy Anissa Gardizy and Aaron Holmes4 months agoThe Information Subscriber CouncilLearn more VirtusaPerspectives with VirtusaComcast NBCUniversal LIFT LabsPartnering with startups at every stage!TapOnItThe next generation of SMSDownload Clip",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.theinformation.com/articles/wtf-recap-generative-ai-the-secret-weapon-for-a-hybrid-workforce'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.seo-paywall-content'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discover the transformative synergy of Generative AI and intelligent search in the workplace, as explained by Jeff Evernham, vice president of product strategy at Sinequa. Learn how grounding GenAI in accurate, up-to-date information ensures reliable results and empowers efficient decision-making.
Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming how businesses operate. From writing marketing content and helping developers code to delivering customer service, the range of possibilities for businesses is extraordinary. Its popularity has caused organizations and industries to rethink their business processes and the value of human resources, pushing generative AI to what Gartner calls the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Hype CycleOpens a new window . Amid all the attention, there are now two questions businesses are asking about leveraging GenAI: how can we teach it about our internal content, and can we be sure it’s safe?
What’s the Hesitation?
 Generative AI and LLMs(large language models) like ChatGPT are designed to process and produce text that resembles that of humans. These models understand language and can answer questions in a natural, conversational manner. However, they’re limited by what they’ve been trained on — or, more accurately, what they haven’t been trained on, and that’s the information in your company. LLMs are trained to generate text based on language patterns, and they are proficient, for example, in writing perfect prose and confident, convincing arguments. However, the writing is based on probabilities of words in the language, not on understanding how the world works, so these models can’t be relied on to convey accurate information. This is a crucial linchpin for most business applications. 
When applied to business cases with complex and knowledge-intense environments, GenAI and LLMs suffer from four common problems:


“hallucinations” (confidently presenting fabricated misinformation)
opaqueness (no ability to give or cite sources)
obsolescence (no knowledge of events since the model was initially trained)
ignorance (no knowledge of internal corporate information)  

Combined, these vulnerabilities create a perfect storm for falsehood, risk, and even irreparable reputation damage. For instance, the cringe-inducing case of the lawyer who relied on ChatGPT to craft a motion full of made-up case law and was unaware that the chatbot could lead him astray.

AI Guardrails
As a result of these concerns, the public, experts, industry, and governments are calling for measures and regulations to limit these risks. Progress will undoubtedly be made, but improving the generative AI models themselves won’t eliminate these challenges. Further, the impact on business use is much more significant than private, individual use. A recent Harvard Business Review articleOpens a new window  described it best:
A business using generative AI technology in an enterprise setting differs from consumers using it for private, individual use. Businesses need to adhere to regulations relevant to their respective industries (E.g., healthcare), and there’s a minefield of legal, financial, and ethical implications if the content generated is inaccurate, inaccessible, or offensive. For example, the risk of harm when a generative AI chatbot gives incorrect steps for cooking a recipe is much lower than when giving a field service worker instructions for repairing a piece of heavy machinery. If not designed and deployed with clear ethical guidelines, generative AI can have unintended consequences and potentially cause real harm.”
Adding Search to Generative AI Eliminates These Risks
For enterprises, a different approach is needed, and in the past few months, a straightforward process has emerged as the answer. Use the power of search to find information that grounds the generative AI in the truth. In other words, let GenAI be the knowledge interface and use search as the knowledge source.
This is done with prompt engineering by including the information from the search in the prompt and asking the GenAI to respond based only on that information. With intelligent search providing the information, the response is constructed from accurate, up-to-date, and traceable information – without hallucinations.
 This approach capitalizes on the strengths of each tool: the knowledge comes from the most relevant information found by the search, and the phrasing comes from the GenAI. The result is an intelligent assistant who can answer any question about any information in your enterprise! And it can do it safely – combining GenAI with search provides all the guardrails needed to ensure it’s accurate and unbiased. It also safeguards against security concerns by only working with information the employee can access. 
The Future Is Bright
AI has enormous potential to revolutionize the workplace, making it easier for businesses to manage their knowledge, save time, and improve efficiency. However, the future of using these tools relies on implementing the proper safeguards. 
If we can’t trust the models to provide accurate results, the tools will never be broadly usable in the enterprise. Search provides precisely what’s missing – grounding the GenAI with search results provides all the guardrails needed to leverage GenAI in the workplace. Combining generative AI with a proven and intelligent search platform ensures results are driven by the latest, most accurate, and most specialized information inside and outside your organization.  From there, your team will be able to work efficiently with confidence that their efforts are supported with accurate and reliable information.  
Today, almost everything we do in the digital world starts with a search — asking questions and looking for answers. Search is at the core of everything we do. Still, the search included as part of most applications has lagged far behind the quality and efficacy we expect in our daily interactions with the likes of Google, Amazon, and Netflix. Generative AI changes that. Now that computers can speak our language, powering GenAI with search will transform everything about how work gets done, accelerating the next breakthrough, innovative product, and market to expand into. The future is bright with AI-enabled search.

Our Artificial Intelligence analyses explore the most compelling challenges that generative AI will bring to legal professionals in the year ahead.“This copyright dispute tests the boundaries of fair use,” Judge Pierre N. Leval wrote at the beginning of the Second Circuit’s 2015 opinion in Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. In this case, the author-plaintiffs sued Google for copyright infringement for scanning digital copies of books, without permission from the copyright holders, and establishing a publicly available search function. The court ultimately decided on summary judgment that Google’s copying was fair use under the doctrine by that name.  In 2015, it was inconceivable that those boundaries would be tested again by the creation of generative artificial intelligence and large language models. Now, as we head into 2024, there’s no doubt that generative AI tech companies will seek refuge in the fair use doctrine, as several plaintiffs allege that OpenAI LLC and Meta Platforms Inc. ingest copyrighted books without permission in order to train their large language models. It’s unlikely that courts will unravel the intricate, cutting-edge development of generative AI models in support of copyrighted works. Rather, courts will rely on the fair use doctrine to allow the transformative use of copyrighted works to train generative AI models for public enrichment. The Fair Use DoctrineAuthors have an exclusive right under the US Constitution to their respective writings, for a limited time period, in order “to promote the progress of science and useful arts.” Understandably, US copyright laws were intended to encourage authors to create and release for public consumption “informative, intellectually enriching work,” in exchange for a limited monopoly over their own work. Many courts, however, recognize that the primary and ultimate beneficiary of copyright laws is the public, who consume copyrighted works in order to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world. In furtherance of public enrichment, Congress enacted the 1976 Copyright Act, which codified the doctrine of fair use, allowing the copying and use of copyrighted work in certain circumstances. Fewer than 10 years later, the US Supreme Court took up the issue of fair use for the first time in Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., where the court found that the use of video-tape recorders at home to record material broadcasted on television was a fair use of copyrighted works and didn’t constitute copyright infringement. In 1994, the Supreme Court elaborated on the fair use doctrine in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., where it first considered “whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.” A transformative work is one that adds something new, with further purpose, the court said. It was this very reasoning that led the Supreme Court to reject the fair use argument most recently in Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts Inc. v. Goldsmith. Affirming the Second Circuit’s decision in favor of the plaintiff, photographer Lynn Goldsmith, the court recognized that whether a secondary work is transformative depends on “whether it is in service of a fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character.” The Warhol painting shared substantially the same purpose and function as the original photograph by Goldsmith. They were both portraits of the same person, one imposing its style over another, without more, the court said. However, the fair use analysis doesn’t stop at “the purpose and character of the use.” Courts evaluate three other factors, with varying degrees of importance. The fourth factor is the most important, and considers “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” Does the secondary use reduce the market or value of the original work and its potential derivatives? Is the secondary use “unrestricted and widespread”? The first and fourth factors are undeniably intertwined. The more transformative the use, the less of an adverse impact it will have on the market, as compared to a work that supersedes the original. In addition, courts recognize that only “traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets” can be considered in connection with potential licensing revenue under the fourth factor. A Groundbreaking Decision to ComeThere’s currently no fair use case that explores the abundance of information consumed by large language models. Any decision rendered on the issue will have far-reaching consequences on a wide range of industries, either crippling the advancement of generative AI or diminishing the exclusivity of copyright. A strong argument can be made that OpenAI’s and Meta’s use of the copyrighted works is highly transformative and doesn’t usurp the original copyrighted work. The copyrighted works, along with a large volume of other data, are used to train large language models on word usage, semantics, grammar, and sentence structure. The statistical data derived from these works serves an entirely different purpose than the copyrighted works themselves. It allows the models, for example, to “generate creative text, solve mathematical theorems, predict protein structures, answer reading comprehension questions, and more.” These capabilities are quite distinguishable from the original work. One of the reasons for OpenAI’s and Meta’s ingestion of the original copyrighted works is to make available significant information about those works (and others) that is otherwise not available—similar to what Google did in Author’s Guild. The copyrighted works are also not being used in the manner originally intended. Moreover, even if the copyright holders establish a market for licensing their works for ingestion by large language models, there’s no evidence that this is a traditional market. Copyright holders can’t prevent fair use by creating or licensing a market for that very use. This may be an unpopular opinion, but one that courts hearing the generative AI copyright infringement claims are likely to make in the year to come.

It’s Time to Build a Career in AI: Here’s How to Get Started
The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020 states that by 2025, greater adoption of technology will transform many jobs, tasks, and skills. According to the study, 43% of businesses intend to downsize their workforce as a result of technology integrations. The report also indicates that in 5 years, employers will equally divide tasks between machines and humans, displacing over 85 million jobs.
PwC, the world's second-largest professional services network, predicts that automated operations will jeopardize 38 percent of jobs in the United States by 2030. 35 percent of jobs in Germany, 30 percent of jobs in the United Kingdom, and 21 percent of jobs in Japan are also exposed to high risk because of automation. Along the same lines, Forrester Research estimates that cognitive technologies, including AI and ML, will replace 16 percent of jobs in the U.S. by 2025.
The data cited above point to the fact that, in this age of disruption, upskilling is mandatory for survival.

In a broadcasted interview with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday, Elon Musk told Sunak at the close of the AI Safety Summit last week, ""I think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history; we will have something that for the first time is smarter than the smartest human...There will come a point where no job is needed.""


This startling statement quickly became viral online, and re-ignited what is becoming an age-old debate: will AI really eliminate the need for jobs?

Yes...and no.

After all, the global AI Safety Summit hosted by the UK—the first of its kind—in which global tech business leaders and heads of 28 countries were delegates, was intended to bring awareness and address the key global threats poised by AI. The focus was not merely on the kind used for specific tasks (such as ChatGPT), but frontier AI, the supercharged artificial intelligence of the future that encompasses foundational models with the potential for dangerous capabilities.

PROMOTED
Some of the likely risks highlighted by the delegates included intentional and unintentional misuse, disinformation, and negative impact on cybersecurity and the labor market. In the subsequent policy paper, the Summit's delegates noted that we should work globally towards a ""human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI.""
Having humans at the center therefore, means creating an environment where artificial intelligence is run by humans and works for humans, not the other way around. So while some jobs will no longer be needed, others will remain or be created.

AI Is Replacing Jobs—And Creating Jobs
Artificial intelligence has already made ground-breaking shifts and caused major disruptions to industries including justice, retail, marketing, transportation, media, and the biosciences. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2020, an estimated 85 million jobs are predicted to be impacted by a shift ""in the division of labour between humans and machines, while 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms.""

This indicates that although AI has the potential to eliminate many roles, it also promises the advantage of not only replacing them but adding an extra 12 million jobs to the labor market, in addition to boosting the economy.

Some of the jobs that are most easily susceptible to being completely replaced by AI include customer service, executive assistant and administrative jobs, graphic design, data entry roles, transcription services, and market research analysts.
However, while the loss of these roles will be keenly felt by those who have built entire careers and fortunes around them, the key thing to remember here is that the labor market is evolving; and as with any dramatic market shift underpinned by technological advancements, there will be significant disruption which will be uncomfortable and potentially result in millions of job losses. But to survive this evolution, one should prepare themselves and proof their careers to adapt to the changes imposed by AI.Forbes5 Skills For The Future: How To Proof Your Career For The AI RevolutionBy Rachel Wells
AI Jobs In Demand
AI has already begun to create and popularize previously unheard of roles, which will become more of a necessity as the strategic initiatives of the AI Safety Summit are implemented. Some of these in-demand roles include AI research scientist, prompt engineer, deep learning engineer, AI chatbot developer, AI ethics and bias analyst, director of responsible AI, and AI ethics programme manager.
Beyond technology itself, it's essential to recognize the fact that technology is not the answer to all problems. There are fields that demand the human touch and cannot be completely replaced by artificial intelligence, although they may assist in delivering these roles more efficiently.
The job market appetite is increasing for roles that require leadership skills and strategic problem-solving. For example, people managers, program managers, early years practitioners, and doctors will have a very difficult time being replaced by AI—it's virtually impossible. These all require some aspect of human intelligence, empathy, and intuition that cannot be mimicked or left to technology alone.
Humans Can't Live Without Work, So AI Will Complement Work
As humans, we thrive on work as part of our daily lives. Work is more than a means of survival, it's essential to meaning in life. Scientific research demonstrates that we work for reasons other than a salary. It boosts our mental health, and is part of the way we are wired to desire purpose, fulfilment, satisfaction, and pride through making a contribution, and working with others, which in turn, promotes happiness.
One of the most significant benefits of artificial intelligence is its boost to productivity, and performing ""boring"" repetitive tasks for you, which in turn, free you up to endless possibilities and creativity in your work. Professionals will begin to enjoy doing more meaningful work as the mundane is removed and their human creativity is supercharged.
Bearing this in mind, it is critical to focus your attention now on three key aspects of personal development:


Stay aware of ongoing developments within AI—they are progressing at a phenomenal rate.
Explore other career possibilities so you are not left out of work.
Learn how to use AI to augment your work.


Will Elon Musk's vision of a world without jobs become reality? Most likely not. However, the role of work in our lives will certainly evolve as technology advances.

But every once in a while, in someone’s head, a special light bulb clicks on. Years ago, as an example, the mind of George R. R. Martin conceived a story of dragons, ice and betrayal, capable of enchanting millions of readers. This was an idea, a work of art, a talent… culture, essentially. And culture is considered to be so important for a society that it’s vehemently protected with copyright law, so that the creators of this culture are properly credited and compensated. These regulations are also meant to protect — in theory — other individuals from stealing or copying said cultural material. But in practice today, intellectual property faces a colossal threat that legislators of the past couldn’t have imagined: artificial intelligence (AI). Several artists have complained — either via public statements or through the courts — about the massive theft of their work, so that machines can be trained to imitate creators. Actor Stephen Fry recently shared his indignant astonishment at a documentary that used his voice, with phrases that he had never recorded. Scarlett Johansson has taken legal action against an application that used her image and name for an advertisement, without even asking for her permission. It turns out that the future –—with all its opportunities and dark clouds — is already here. One of the pillars of the strikes organized by the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild has been the issue of AI. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, UNESCO held its first conference on the impact of AI in the world of cinema. Similarly, the EU is preparing a series of regulations that are scheduled to come into force between 2024 and 2025, which are intended to make this technology fairer, including in the creative field. A question increasingly hovers over workshops, studios and parliaments: is AI robbing artists of their work? History, in some way, is repeating itself. In the past, the appearance of the internet drew tens of millions of viewers around the planet, while also offering a world of opportunities to the arts. But, at the same time, the number one public enemy of the last decades emerged as a result: piracy. This isn’t just about culture. The dangers to the privacy, stability, or even health of citizens is of such concern that President Joe Biden recently resorted to a law from the era of the Korean War (1950-1953) to force technology companies to notify the American government about any advancement that poses a “serious risk to national security.” The dilemmas affect everything from the running of the White House to the day-to-day life of any household. The concerns and complaints in the field of copyright don’t stop multiplying. “[This widespread occurrence] cannot be described as theft. Generative AI systems draw on pre-existing texts and images to learn to produce their own. If [the materials are] protected by intellectual property rights, their use may require authorization. What the authors are denouncing is that they didn’t give permission [to the AI systems],” explains José María Méndez, a lawyer at Baker McKenzie who’s an expert in the sector. He insists, however, on distinguishing each incident on a case-by-case basis. David Fuentes Lahoz — a lawyer specializing in intellectual property at Bird &amp; Bird — seconds this. ”The correct thing would be to talk about a potential infringement of intellectual property rights.” This results in an economic benefit only for the companies that own these programs, while the artists don’t even get the crumbs. Both experts also mention another possible risk: that the works generated in such a manner actually represent plagiarism. Iban García del Blanco — a socialist member of the European Parliament for Spain, who is involved in the preparation of the EU regulations on AI — has spoken about the evasion of the law when it comes to AI. While he acknowledges that this is a matter of interpretation, he has pointed out that the European copyright directive — approved in 2019 — does permit data mining and the use of licensed content without authorization, but only for scientific research and development. García del Blanco has denounced the fact that generative AI often tries to hide under this umbrella term. “We’re facing the exploitation of rights of owners, [via the] use of a standard that wasn’t designed for [this purpose].” He has suggested that the European Commission issue an official clarification on the matter, or even modify the article in question. At the same time, future EU regulations want to register generative AI systems and require maximum transparency regarding what data they use, how much they use and how they use it. This is key so that creators can claim their piece of the pie — including the one that big tech firms have already eaten. Brussels is also considering an explicit notice that accompanies any work not created by humans, to distinguish them and avoid deepfakes (modifications made by AI based on videos or real images). Keanu Reeves has thrown credibility to this initiative: the actor is already signing contracts in which he vetoes being subject to digital touch-ups. There’s also another front in this battle — perhaps the most devilish one. Once trained, the machines are ready to generate their own cultural offerings. And, therefore, they compete with the same artists whose work they have been swallowing up. First they steal the creations… then, they steal the audience. “They could have used millions of works [that are already available] in the public domain, but they choose to work with the current ones. It’s evident that [these tech companies] want to compete in the market,” García del Blanco sums up. That’s exactly why the Screen Writers’ Guild got the studios to commit to limiting the role of this technology in the writing of movies. The current actors’ strike is also putting forward the proposal to limit the use of AI in the filming of movies. Companies that want to generate culture through AI may also find themselves facing a specific problem, according to lawyer Fuentes Lahoz: “To speak of copyright, [a creation] must be the result of at least one person. If said [creation] came substantially or exclusively from an artificial intelligence system, copyright protection could hardly be recognized. Hence, the spread of [certain creations] that lack authorial protection could occur.” “Let’s think about a company that decides to invest millions of [dollars] into a system that creates songs. These [productions] could be free of copyright and, therefore, the company wouldn’t have the right to object to the unauthorized use of said music.” “There’s something that’s glaringly absent from texts generated by AI: the soul that is born from desires, hope, pain, violence. The machine has none of that… [All you can do] is teach it to simulate [those things],” explains writer Lorenzo Silva. He — along with many other storytellers — aren’t so concerned about competing with works created by AI, which they consider to be “empty.” Rather, they take issue with the use of their books to train these systems. The novelist Javier Sierra adds: “Perhaps it is easier to copy novels from a genre that follows a structure — such as detective stories or romances — but, in general, books written by AI will cause discomfort in their readers, due to the feeling that they’re always reading the same thing.” Identity theft, professional replacement and precariousness are all fears that have shaken up the cultural sector. Just look at the number of promotional campaigns that already save on commissioning an illustrator, as the machines draw for free. A movement among photographers is encouraging all professionals to make explicit in each image that they prohibit its use for AI. More and more groups — from the plastic arts to the publishing industry — are loudly demanding compensation and justice. Obviously, the arts always draw on past influences. For instance, every author recommends reading a lot before facing the blank page. And there’s no filmmaker or musician who hasn’t watched and listened to something before recording. Isn’t AI then a disciple like any other? “These are machines that imitate a certain style through mass reproduction. They can replicate it [in just] a few moments. The future writer who intends to be inspired by George R. R. Martin will at least have had to have [purchased] and read his books,” answers García del Blanco. “At a legal level, a book or a movie isn’t protected in the same way as other assets, because we consider them to be different [from other products]. We find it acceptable that an author draws on the works of his predecessors to generate his own, because this is the only way in which human creativity can develop. The absence of the human element is what leads us to a different reasoning with AI. [However, this doesn’t stop some parties from] advocating for the protection of works generated by AI through intellectual property rights,” explains attorney José María Méndez. Generative AI — which has been developing for about seven or eight years now — is fed with all the information available on the web. Through the algorithm used to analyze the codes of websites in search of information, it collects everything: from the images that an illustrator uploads, to products available in the public domain. “[These systems] have fed on data that was available on the internet: they haven’t stolen it or hacked any computer,” explains Jordi Torres, a researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. But does this also include data posted illegally? “I couldn’t say if each image or text that is added to these massive databases is reviewed, or if the use [that a company] wants to apply to it complies with the licensing terms of each product,” admits Enzo Ferrante, who holds a doctorate in Computer Science from Paris-Saclay University. Precisely in his legal complaint, George R.R. Martin claims that ChatGPT obtained his A Song of Ice and Fire literary saga from illegal online libraries. EL PAÍS tried unsuccessfully to communicate with the developers of ChatGPT, OpenAI, and Stability to ask about the origins of the information that they feed their large language models (LLMs). Not everything, however, is bad news. AI also offers a universe of possibilities to the entire planet, creators included. García del Blanco himself is aware of this. “Some cartoonists told me that they’ve stopped wasting time drawing repetitive cartoon backgrounds to be able to concentrate on the creative parts that stimulate them the most and are considered essential. The same [mechanism] can be applied in the audiovisual sector or the music sector.” “In the history of humanity, whenever a new tool has emerged, it has never been dismissed,” Torres emphasizes. However, he advocates for its democratization through legislation that everyone can participate in drafting. “Let it not just be a few people who do it for us. We have to get closer [to the process], we have to learn from it and not leave it in the hands of a few politicians or engineers,” he affirms. García del Blanco agrees. “AI is coming to give us a hand. But controls must be established.” It’s all about carefully considering how to regulate and which regulations to ultimately impose.

Large language models, such as GPT-3.5, are at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. With their colossal neural networks encompassing billions of parameters, they possess a remarkable ability to comprehend and generate human-like text. Trained on massive datasets culled from the internet, these models have honed language understanding, context awareness, and even rudimentary reasoning skills.
These technological marvels are driving a seismic shift across industries. They're the powerhouse behind natural language processing tasks, including translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis, while also lending their creative touch to content generation and problem-solving. The impact of large language models extends to healthcare, education, entertainment, and beyond, promising a future where human-computer interaction is more intuitive, insightful, and transformative than ever before.
What are the Large Language Models?
Large language models, such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. These LLM models are built using deep learning techniques and have been trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet.
These models use self-attention mechanisms to analyze the relationships between different words or tokens in a text, enabling them to capture contextual information and generate coherent responses.
These models have significant implications for various applications, 
including virtual assistants, chatbots, content generation, language translation, and aiding in research and decision-making processes. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text has led to advancements in natural language understanding and human-computer interaction.
What are Large Language Models Used For?
Large language models are utilized in scenarios with limited or no domain-specific data available for training. These scenarios include both few-shot and zero-shot learning approaches, which rely on the model's strong inductive bias and its capability to derive meaningful representations from a small amount of data or even no data at all.
How are Large Language Models Trained?
Large language models typically undergo pre-training on a broad, all-encompassing dataset that shares statistical similarities with the dataset specific to the target task. The objective of pre-training is to enable the model to acquire high-level features that can later be applied during the fine-tuning phase for specific tasks.
The training process of LLM involves several steps:
1. Text Pre-processing
The textual data is transformed into a numerical representation that the LLM model can effectively process. This conversion may involve techniques like tokenization, encoding, and creating input sequences.
2. Random Parameter Initialization
The model's parameters are initialized randomly before the training process begins.
3. Input Numerical Data
The numerical representation of the text data is fed into the model for processing. The model's architecture, typically based on transformers, allows it to capture the contextual relationships between the words or tokens in the text.
4. Loss Function Calculation
It measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the next word or token in a sentence. The LLM model aims to minimize this loss during training.
5. Parameter Optimization
The model's parameters are adjusted through optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, to reduce the loss. This involves calculating gradients and updating the parameters accordingly, gradually improving the model's performance.
6. Iterative Training
The training process is repeated over multiple iterations or epochs until the model's outputs achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy on the given task or dataset.
By following this training process, large language models learn to capture linguistic patterns, understand context, and generate coherent responses, enabling them to excel at various language-related tasks.
How do Large Language Models Work?
Large language models leverage deep neural networks to generate outputs based on patterns learned from the training data.
Typically, a large language model adopts a transformer architecture, which enables the model to identify relationships between words in a sentence, irrespective of their position in the sequence.
In contrast to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that rely on recurrence to capture token relationships, transformer neural networks employ self-attention as their primary mechanism. 
Self-attention calculates attention scores that determine the importance of each token with respect to the other tokens in the text sequence, facilitating the modeling of intricate relationships within the data.
Applications of Large Language Models
LLM has a wide range of applications across various domains. Here are some notable applications:

			73 Percent Of Lawyers Expect To Be Using Generative AI Next Year... But To Do What Exactly?		

			Survey says AI is rolling into the profession sooner rather than later.

Only around 15 percent of lawyers may be using generative AI for work right now, but that’s set to change in a big way. And quickly. This morning, Wolters Kluwer released the 2023 edition of its Future Ready Lawyer Report, and in addition to insights about ESG work and diversity programs, respondents sounded off on artificial intelligence and a whole lot of them see AI entering their workflow soon.


These are just the folks expecting to be using AI next year. Add in the poor schlubs who will get dragged into AI against their will and it’s likely somewhere north of three-quarters of attorneys will be getting answers from “MachineLearned Hand” by this time next year.
But what exactly will AI do for these attorneys? Probably not explaining international airline law.
According to the report, 77 percent of attorneys “expect it to be in the areas of big data and predictive analytics.” Which is interesting because those are use cases that get a little lost in all the pie-in-the-sky talk about whipping up first drafts of briefs. They’re also not use cases that present much risk. Legal tech has used artificial intelligence to find answers in the data for years. At the risk of oversimplification, generative AI just adds a bit more maturity and polish to the output.




This 77 percent figure is down slightly from 80 percent offering that answer last year, which is probably just noise, but could indicate more attorneys looking outside the comfort zone of crunching big data for ways to use AI.
Regardless of the answers in this survey, this tech is evolving so quickly that it’s doubtful the industry even knows how it’ll be best deployed by next November.
And while most lawyers recognize that GenAI will have an impact on the legal profession, there’s no clear consensus on whether these applications are an opportunity, a threat, or both. Almost half (43%) see it as an opportunity, a quarter as a threat, and 26% as both a threat and opportunity.
Isn’t there a Chinese character for that? Threatotunity?
Homer Simpson references aside, it’s encouraging that so many lawyers see value in advancing technology. That’s certainly not always been the case. The legal community isn’t exactly known for operating on the cutting edge of tech.

But here we are.

In <a href=""https://www.gbkcollective.com/thoughtleadership/generative-ai-study"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a new study</a> carried out in collaboration with marketing consultancy GBK Collective, Wharton marketing professor<strong> </strong><a href=""https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/stefano-puntoni/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Stefano Puntoni</a><strong> </strong>unearthed fresh insights into the adoption of generative AI and its impact across the U.S. economy.<strong> </strong>He said that generative AI is relatively new, and no blueprint or recipe exists for its implementation. “Everybody is experimenting, the technology is changing very fast. This paper helps us understand the state of play,” he explained.
<h2>U.S. Survey Shows Generative AI Is Here to Stay</h2>
Puntoni’s research revealed that generative AI has reached a critical threshold, experiencing significant and rapid adoption, leading to substantial changes in business practices. He polled 672 respondents based in the U.S. “Over 50% of the sample is already using generative AI in their work, with many use cases indicated as being already under exploration or soon to be. This shows the tech has already passed a crucial tipping point,” he said.

Furthermore, the study predicts that the situation is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. In the next 12 months, enterprises plan to increase their spending on generative AI by an additional 25%.<strong> </strong>Much of this spending will be allocated to internal teams that are tasked with developing generative AI strategies.

However, the research also suggests that external partners will play a significant role, with half of the businesses surveyed expecting to bring in external consultants, partners, or contractors. “I expect we’ll see very fast-growing lines of businesses for the main consulting and IT outsourcing companies,” Puntoni said.

<h2>What Industries Benefit Most From Generative AI Investments?<strong> </strong></h2>
The study highlights how the most significant growth in generative AI investment will occur in sectors and functions where current adoption is still in its nascent stages. This includes larger corporations, the professional services and retail industries, as well as marketing, sales, HR, and operations departments.

Smaller companies are more agile in leveraging the potential of generative AI compared to their larger counterparts (57% vs. 18%). This reflects their ability to adapt tools and processes quickly, driven by the greater pressure to realize the efficiency gains of generative AI. “The technology can streamline processes and reduce operational costs, potentially giving smaller firms a competitive edge,” explained Puntoni.
<h2>Will Generative AI Investments Impact Jobs? Executives Are Mostly Optimistic</h2>
Despite the anticipated surge in generative AI investments, the executives surveyed are optimistic that generative AI will not lead to widespread job cuts. Rather, they believe it will enhance employee skills in some tasks (48% of those using AI said this) rather than replace human skills (36%). “At the end of the day, generative AI is producing content — that’s what many office workers are doing. On the other hand, this will be a way for existing employees to do a much better job, or more jobs. Which scenario — skill enhancement or replacement — prevails will depend on the function, company, and specific employees,” Puntoni said.

Business leaders polled in the survey anticipate a wide array of tasks that generative AI will undertake in the coming years, with a strong focus on data analysis (89% cited this task), marketing content creation (87%), and customer and competitor research (84%).<strong> </strong>The use of generative AI in software development, particularly coding, also receives high endorsements. “The quip now is that the hottest programming language is English — you can just tell the algorithm what you want it to code,” said Puntoni.<strong> </strong>

The majority of those surveyed believe that generative AI will be used for managing supply chains (71%) and recruiting employees (67%). However, a smaller proportion (58%) expects AI to assist in drafting legal contracts, possibly due to concerns regarding accuracy.

Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that generative AI will deliver substantial benefits to businesses, with executives expecting enhanced employee efficiency and optimized business operations. “A lot of companies can use this technology not just to cut costs but to help employees do a better job. Those who believe the tech is powerful think it will raise both efficiency and effectiveness,” Puntoni stated.
<blockquote>“A lot of companies can use this technology not just to cut costs but to help employees do a better job.”[attribution]-- Stefano Puntoni[/attribution]</blockquote>
<h2>Businesses Continue to Wrestle With Pros and Cons of AI</h2>
However, the research shines a spotlight on the challenges that executives face when implementing generative AI into their businesses. Key concerns revolve around the accuracy of results (AI has been known to produce “hallucinations”), the risk to customer privacy, internal resistance, and ethical considerations. Decision-makers express a range of emotions about AI, including caution (reported by 64% of those who don’t yet use generative AI) and skepticism (35%).<strong> </strong>

“Concerns revolve around privacy and data: to what extent can we use these algorithms when we’re feeding them with data we might not want to be outside the company?” noted Puntoni. However, these concerns are balanced by feelings of optimism (expressed by 62% of AI-users) and excitement (55%) about AI’s potential.
<h2>Key Recommendations for Leaders Using Generative AI</h2>
<strong> </strong>For those looking to harness the positive benefits of generative AI, Puntoni offered three key recommendations. Firstly, he stressed the importance of embracing an intentional “test and learn approach,” ensuring there is a method in the madness. “Leaders should maximize organizational learning while minimizing risks and share the new insights with others,” he said.

Secondly, companies should establish policies for dealing with company and customer data. “They must ensure technical and legal support in the intentional testing and learning approach, incorporate quality-control systems -- especially for front-line service deployment -- and invest in training for staff,” Puntoni said.

Lastly, he advocates for using generative AI to make humans more productive and capable rather than seeking to make them obsolete. “Far from the doomsday scenarios we often read in the media, generative AI offers organizations the opportunity to help many employees find more meaning in their work and creativity, fostering human flourishing,” concluded Puntoni.",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Knowledge@Wharton', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/themes/knowledge-wharton/includes/img/logo-katw.svg', 'width': 500, 'height': 30}}",,,,,,,"

AI algorithms imitate real-world systems. The more repetitive a system is, the easier it is for AI to replace it. That’s why jobs in customer service, retail and clerical roles are regularly named as being the most at risk. That doesn’t mean other jobs won’t be affected.   The latest advances in AI have shown all kinds of creative work and white-collar professions stand to be impacted to various degrees. However, there’s one important point that’s usually not addressed in discussions about AI’s impact on jobs. That is: where you work may be as important as what you do. Current trends and projections suggest people in developing countries, where a higher proportion of jobs involve repetitive or manual tasks, will be the first and most affected.   Privileged by geography   According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, emerging technologies and digitalisation are among the biggest driving factors for job displacement. The report states: The majority of fastest declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with bank tellers and related clerks, postal service clerks, cashiers and ticket clerks, and data entry clerks expected to decline fastest.   Let’s take an office clerk as an example, whose responsibilities include answering phones, taking messages and scheduling appointments. We now have access to AI tools that can perform all these tasks. They can also work non-stop, for free (or a fraction of the price), without being affected by personal problems, and without having to mentally strain to optimise their workflow. Of course, they’re going to be attractive to employers!   At first glance, you might assume an office clerk living in a developed country is more likely to lose their job than their counterpart in a developing country, since the former seems more likely to implement new AI tools. In reality, however, it’s expected more people in developing countries will lose their jobs. The success of each nation will depend on how well it can adapt to the displacement of its workforce.   In 2009, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union created the information and communication technologies (ICT) development index to benchmark and compare ICT performance within and across countries. This index measures, among other things: 1. The level and evolution over time of information and communication technologies in different countries 2. How each country’s experience compares to others’ 3. The extent to which a country can develop and use these technologies to boost its own growth and development in the context of the capabilities and skills available. In other words, a country’s score on this index can be correlated with how well it adapts to emerging technologies such as AI.   Unsurprisingly, developed countries rank higher than the rest of the world. In 2012, the top five ranking countries were the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. The bottom five were Eritrea, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger. Wealth and opportunity makes a difference The World Bank has divided the world by income and region, showing developing countries are among the lowest earners.   Generally speaking, employing people is much easier in developing countries, due to lower wages, tighter competition and less regulation to support employees. The World Bank estimates about 84 per cent of the world’s working-age population lives in developing countries. Similarly, a 2008 report from the International Labour Organisation estimated 73 per cent of all the world’s workers lived in developing countries, while only 14 per cent lived in advanced industrial countries.   That means whatever clerical jobs aren’t taken by AI in developing countries will become more competitive than most people can handle. As World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos wrote in 2016, in reference to the digital revolution,”[…] the jobs where workers are likely to lose out are disproportionally held by the least educated and the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. As a result, the biggest risk from the digital revolution is not massive unemployment but widening income inequality.” These factors will result in an employer-ruled ecosystem in developing countries. These countries have both a higher occurrence of jobs that can be replaced or displaced (such as call centre jobs), and less of the money and skills needed to implement AI tools effectively.   The cost and affordability of AI programmes and algorithms will also speed up this process in certain regions. Critical thinking remains important Experts note AI will create many employment opportunities, including jobs that don’t yet exist. It’s just that not all countries will be well-equipped to make the transition when the time comes.   The Future of Jobs report says “analytical thinking and creative...",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Hans India', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/thehansindia/', 'https://plus.google.com/+HansIndiaHyderabad/posts', 'https://twitter.com/thehansindiaweb', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hansindia'], 'logo': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'The Hans India - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png'}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '1', 'name': 'Latest News', 'description': 'Latest News', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/latest-news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '2', 'name': 'Hyderabad', 'description': 'Hyderabad', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/hyderabad'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '3', 'name': 'Cricket', 'description': 'Cricket', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/sports'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '4', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'description': 'Entertainment', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/cinema'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '5', 'name': 'Photo Stories', 'description': 'Photo Stories', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/photo-stories'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '6', 'name': 'Festival of Democracy', 'description': 'Festival of Democracy', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/festival-of-democracy'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '7', 'name': 'Telangana', 'description': 'Telangana', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '8', 'name': 'Andhra Pradesh', 'description': 'Andhra Pradesh', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/andhra-pradesh'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '9', 'name': 'Visakhapatnam', 'description': 'Visakhapatnam', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/visakhapatnam'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '10', 'name': 'Delhi Region', 'description': 'Delhi Region', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/new-delhi'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '11', 'name': 'Karnataka', 'description': 'Karnataka', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '12', 'name': 'Lifestyle', 'description': 'Lifestyle', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '13', 'name': 'Education & Careers', 'description': 'Education & Careers', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/education-careers'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '14', 'name': 'Business', 'description': 'Business', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/business'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '15', 'name': 'Editorial', 'description': 'Editorial', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/hans-editorial-'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '16', 'name': 'Technology', 'description': 'Technology', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/tech'}]",Whose job will AI replace?,,https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/whose-job-will-ai-replace-835713,News Analysis,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'The Hans India - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png'}",,,"['https://www.facebook.com/thehansindia/', 'https://plus.google.com/+HansIndiaHyderabad/posts', 'https://twitter.com/thehansindiaweb', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hansindia']",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/whose-job-will-ai-replace-835713'}",,,,,,,,News Analysis,,,,,,,en,,,,mixed,The Hans India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quick Hits

President Biden signs first-of-its-kind executive order addressing the growing use and development of artificial intelligence.
The order directs various federal agencies to take certain exploratory steps in the coming year.
Most relevant for employers, the EO focuses on new immigration policy, civil rights issues, wage-and-hour compliance, and labor risks and opportunities.

As various state, local, and international jurisdictions continue to propose and enact legislation relating to AI, the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence is the first broad-based roadmap of the federal government’s approach to the quickly developing AI space.
Consistent with trends in other AI-regulatory developments, the Biden Administration’s focus is on both procedural safeguards surrounding AI (such as auditing/vetting of AI tools) as well as substantive safeguards (steps designed to ensure, for example, equity and fairness in the use of AI tools).
A core theme of the EO is the inherent tension between the promise of AI to help “solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure” with the potential perils of irresponsible use “such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation.” The EO lays out the administration’s initial playbook for balancing these promises and perils by encouraging the development of AI through various mechanisms while also setting in motion exploratory steps to impose checks and balances on AI use/development.
Guiding Principles
As relevant to the workplace, the EO identifies certain guiding principles and priorities for the development and implementation of AI, including:
“Artificial Intelligence must be safe and secure.”
According to the EO, meeting this goal “requires robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized evaluations of AI systems, as well as policies, institutions, and, as appropriate, other mechanisms to test, understand, and mitigate risks from these systems before they are put to use.” The concept of testing and evaluation of AI systems is not new in the evolving guidance on workplace AI use. For example, mandatory testing is required in New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has also recommended employers implement testing of AI tools pre- and post-implementation.
“The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers.”
The EO ties this commitment to labor issues, flagging that as AI “creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.” The EO further states that “[i]n the workplace itself, AI should not be deployed in ways that undermine rights, worsen job quality, encourage undue worker surveillance, lessen market competition, introduce new health and safety risks, or cause harmful labor-force disruptions.”
“Artificial Intelligence policies must be consistent with [the] Administration’s dedication to advancing equity and civil rights.”
The EO further states that the administration will seek “to ensure that AI complies with all Federal laws and to promote robust technical evaluations, careful oversight, engagement with affected communities, and rigorous regulation.” Interestingly, the EO underscores guidance previously provided by the EEOC that both developers and users of AI may have potential liability, stating that “[i] t is necessary to hold those developing and deploying AI accountable to standards that protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse.”
Immigration
The EO contains new immigration policies focused on spearheading United States leadership in AI development. For example, the EO instructs the Departments of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to streamline visa processing times for noncitizens traveling to the United States to “work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.” Additionally, the EO encourages DHS to evaluate rulemaking to ease the process for noncitizens “including experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies and their spouses, dependents, and children, to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident.”
Further, the EO instructs the Department of Labor (DOL) to solicit public input on AI and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) labor shortages for purposes of considering updates to the “Schedule A” list of occupations. Finally, the EO encourages the State Department to initiate changes to J-1 visitor exchange program to attract and retain experts in AI and related fields. Through these—and likely further—steps, the Biden administration seeks to continue to position the United States at the forefront of AI progress.
Department of Labor
The EO also requires the DOL to take certain actions designed to address the risks of AI in the workplace.
1. AI-induced worker displacement
First, the EO requires the DOL, within 180 days, to issue a “report analyzing the abilities of agencies to support workers displaced by the adoption of AI and other technological advancements.”
2. Best practices
The EO further requires the DOL, within 180 days, to “develop and publish principles and best practices for employers that could be used to mitigate AI’s potential harms to employees’ well-being and maximize its potential benefits.” The EO requires these best practices to address, at a minimum:

“[J]ob-displacement risks and career opportunities related to AI, including effects on job skills and evaluation of applicants and workers”;
“[L]abor standards and job quality, including issues related to the equity, protected-activity, compensation, health, and safety implications of AI in the workplace”; and
“[I]mplications for workers of employers’ AI-related collection and use of data about them, including transparency, engagement, management, and activity protected under worker-protection laws.”

Notably, to develop these standards, the EO directs the DOL to consult with “other agencies and with outside entities, including labor unions and workers, as the Secretary of Labor deems appropriate.” Absent from this list is a direction that the secretary consult with the employer community. The best practices structure contemplated by the EO may ultimately look similar to the technical assistance guidance issued by the EEOC relating to employer use of AI, which recommended employers deploy various “promising practices” as they use technology like AI.
3. Wage-and-hour
Interestingly, the EO requires the DOL to “issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act.” Wage-and-hour issues have not historically been a focus in the development of AI employment regulatory guidance; this latest guidance may be a sign of more to come in this area.
4. Federal contractors
Finally, the EO requires the DOL to publish, within the year, “guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.”
Next Steps
The EO follows up on the Biden administration’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” released in October 2022, which outlined nonbinding recommendations for the design, use, and deployment of AI and automated decision-making systems and guidance from the EEOC on the potential disparate impact of employers’ use of such technology.
As companies increasingly utilize and rely on AI for a variety of purposes, including making employment decisions, guidance from various regulatory bodies will continue to issue.
Employers may want to consider reviewing their current and planned use of AI and the impact on employees in light of increasing federal scrutiny and carefully watch for additional forthcoming guidance.
Ogletree Deakins will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the Employment Law and Technology blogs.

The EO directs US immigration agencies to streamline the immigration process for individuals who possess AI expertise, amend the J-1 exchange visitor program and modernize the existing immigration pathways for AI experts, including the EB-1, EB-2 (both of which are employment based green cards) and O-1 (non-immigration visas for those with extraordinary abilities) categories and the International Entrepreneur parole program.Timelines relating to smoothing the immigration processes and ushering in suitable policies, have been set for various agencies to ensure that the objective of the EO is met.1. Visa processing: Within 90 days, the US Department of State (DOS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are required to streamline processing times for visa petitions and applications, including ensuring continued and timely availability of visa appointments for foreign nationals who seek to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical emerging technologies in the US. They are also required tofacilitate continued availability of visa appointments in sufficient volume for applicants with expertise in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.2. J-1 exchange program: Within the next 180 days, DOS is ordered to consider changes to the J-1 exchange visitor program that could enhance opportunities for AI talent. These include reviewing the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills list to potentially reduce the number of J-1 nonimmigrants in AI and related fields who are required to return to their home country for two years after completing their J-1 program in the US. The EO urges DOS to consider new regulations governing the two-year home residency requirement for J-1 exchange visitors, including updates to the 2009 list of countries and skills subject to the home-residency requirement.3. Review and initiate policy changes in existing immigration pathways: DHS is required to within 180 days review and initiate any policy changes that it determines necessary and appropriate to clarify and modernize existing immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies, including the EB-1, EB-2 and O-1 categories, and the International Entrepreneur parole program.The EO also asks DOS to consider AI workers who are already in the US in the development of its upcoming domestic visa renewal program and eventually this is to be expanded to F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors.Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm sums up: “While the new EO emphasizes the Biden Administration’s interest in promoting AI innovation through recruitment of foreign talent, immediate changes are unlikely, though some process and policy developments may emerge in the future as a result of the required reviews.” He explains that some changes, like the directive for increased visa appointment availability at US consulates, are likely to depend on agency staffing and resources. Changes that require a regulation would generally be implemented through notice and comment rulemaking, which can take several months or more.",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Times Of India', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-92877370/92877370.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,Joe Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence could help experts who aspire to work in the US,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-bidens-executive-order-on-artificial-intelligence-could-help-experts-who-aspire-to-work-in-the-us/articleshow/105042535.cms,,,"

 Washington UniversityWashington University students study computer science at the McKelvey School of Engineering. AI-ACCESS will include engineering students and students within other disciplines to use artificial intelligence to tackle environmental issues and its effects on communities.





Scientists and students at Washington University are using artificial intelligence to tackle social and environmental issues, thanks to a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation.The Artificial Intelligence Advancements and Convergence in Computational, Environmental and Social Sciences program aims to find new ways to use AI across multiple disciplines.The program adds an environmental focus to the Wash U's AI research efforts across computer science and social sciences, AI-ACCESS Director William Yeoh said.“We wanted to also expand to the environmental science space, especially given the reasons, immediate concerns about climate change and the effects of climate change on the different communities within the U.S.,” said Yeoh, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Wash U. “We felt that this intersection between these three different areas, AI, social science and environmental science is something that would require a lot more attention and tools of different disciplines to work in this interdisciplinary space.”The university is recruiting 49 students for the program, which has received $3 million in funding from the National Science Foundation over five years.The program starts as scientists continue to ring the alarm on the threat of climate change. Many scientists say that the world's countries can limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as established by the Paris climate agreement.Using AI to help researchers in environmental and social science can help policymakers better understand and make policy changes and help local communities, Yeoh said.“What we realized is how much homelessness resources are needed has a large dependency on weather and how cold does it get in St. Louis,” Yeoh said. “All these effects of climate change can contribute to the need for people to require temporary shelter. That’s how we realized that this intersection of AI, social science and environmental science that there can be some cross-disciplinary synergies that can be exploited to help solve or inform these decisions better.”Researchers said the initiative allows them to use AI to analyze datasets quickly and process information to quickly respond to problems.“When it comes to issues with climate change and public health in general, we're starting to get these really large datasets that are difficult for one person or even a team of people to go through in a quick time,” said Drew Crenshaw, a Wash U doctoral student and fellow in the AI-ACCESS program. “When it comes to things like making quick decisions for disease surveillance or disaster preparedness, we really need a tool like AI to kind of help us make quick responses and notify the public in a timely manner.”

November 15, 2023By Music Business WorldwideMBW Views is a series of exclusive op/eds from eminent music industry people… with something to say. The following article is a little different than the usual first-person pieces we run: it’s something of a public resignation letter.Ed Newton-Rex is one of the most prominent figures in the evolution of generative AI in music. The California-based entrepreneur founded the pioneering music-making AI platform Jukedeck over a decade ago, before selling it to TikTok/ByteDance in 2019. He subsequently became Product Director of TikTok’s in-house AI Lab, before becoming Chief Product Officer at music app Voisey (sold to Snap in late 2020).Since last year, Newton-Rex has worked at Stability AI, home of generative AI image-maker, Stable Diffusion. Last year Stability AI raised USD $101 million at a $1 billion valuation.Newton-Rex has made a big impact at Stability AI in a relatively short time. As VP of Audio at the company, he’s led the development of Stable Audio, a generative AI music-making platform trained on licensed music in partnership with rights-holders. Last month, Stable Audio was named one of Time’s ‘Best Inventions Of 2023’.Despite this success, Newton-Rex has just quit his role at Stability on a point of principle. A published classical composer himself, Newton-Rex has, throughout his career, been consistent in his belief in the importance of copyright for artists, songwriters, and rightsholders.As he explains below, Newton-Rex’s personal respect for copyright has somewhat clashed with that of his employer in recent weeks, after Stability AI argued in favor of the ‘fair use’ of copyrighted material to fuel generative AI within a submission to the US Copyright Office. (As Newton-Rex points out, several other large generative AI companies share Stability’s position on this.)Some additional recent context: Newton-Rex’s decision to resign from Stability AI arrives as the debate over the ‘harvesting’ of copyrighted music by generative AI platforms gets even louder. Just last week, superstar Bad Bunny expressed his fury over an AI-generated track that artificially replicates the sound of his vocals, as well as those of Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee.The purported maker of that track, which has over 22 million plays on TikTok, calls themselves FlowGPT. In a message responding to Bad Bunny published on TikTok, FlowGPT offered to let the artist re-record the AI-generated track “for free with all rights… but don’t forget to credit FlowGPT”. It gets worse: If Bad Bunny’s team managed to get the track removed from digital platforms, FlowGPT threatened, “I’ll have to upload a new version.”Over to Ed…I’ve resigned from my role leading the Audio team at Stability AI, because I don’t agree with the company’s opinion that training generative AI models on copyrighted works is ‘fair use’.First off, I want to say that there are lots of people at Stability who are deeply thoughtful about these issues. I’m proud that we were able to launch a state-of-the-art AI music generation product trained on licensed training data, sharing the revenue from the model with rights-holders. I’m grateful to my many colleagues who worked on this with me and who supported our team, and particularly to Emad for giving us the opportunity to build and ship it. I’m thankful for my time at Stability, and in many ways I think they take a more nuanced view on this topic than some of their competitors.But, despite this, I wasn’t able to change the prevailing opinion on fair use at the company.“I don’t see how using copyrighted works to train generative AI models of this nature can be considered fair use.”This was made clear when the US Copyright Office recently invited public comments on generative AI and copyright, and Stability was one of many AI companies to respond. Stability’s 23-page submission included this on its opening page:“We believe that Al development is an acceptable, transformative, and socially-beneficial use of existing content that is protected by fair use”.For those unfamiliar with ‘fair use’, this claims that training an AI model on copyrighted works doesn’t infringe the copyright in those works, so it can be done without permission, and without payment. This is a position that is fairly standard across many of the large generative AI companies, and other big tech companies building these models — it’s far from a view that is unique to Stability. But it’s a position I disagree with.I disagree because one of the factors affecting whether the act of copying is fair use, according to Congress, is “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work”. Today’s generative AI models can clearly be used to create works that compete with the copyrighted works they are trained on. So I don’t see how using copyrighted works to train generative AI models of this nature can be considered fair use.“Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works. I don’t see how this can be acceptable.”But setting aside the fair use argument for a moment — since ‘fair use’ wasn’t designed with generative AI in mind — training generative AI models in this way is, to me, wrong. Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works. I don’t see how this can be acceptable in a society that has set up the economics of the creative arts such that creators rely on copyright.To be clear, I’m a supporter of generative AI. It will have many benefits — that’s why I’ve worked on it for 13 years. But I can only support generative AI that doesn’t exploit creators by training models — which may replace them — on their work without permission.I’m sure I’m not the only person inside these generative AI companies who doesn’t think the claim of ‘fair use’ is fair to creators. I hope others will speak up, either internally or in public, so that companies realise that exploiting creators can’t be the long-term solution in generative AI.Ed Newton-RexMusic Business WorldwideAnalysis United States United Kingdom MBW ViewsRelated Posts  ‘Music licensing is the bridge which connects creators and users – a connection that encourages new ideas and increased value.’  ‘There is no legal or indeed moral excuse for the commercial use of music by AI companies without the prior permission of songwriters and rightholders.’  ‘Neighbouring rights are becoming a significant and vital revenue stream for recording rightsholders.’  Why Daniel Ek’s celebration of local artists is really anti-‘streaming tax’ spin    ",,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/search/{search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-just-resigned-from-my-job-generative-ai/'}",,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/#/schema/WebSite', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/', 'name': 'Music Business Worldwide', 'description': 'News, jobs and analysis for the global music industry', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': {'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/search/{search_term_string}/'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/#/schema/Organization', 'name': 'Music Business Worldwide', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2020/05/Vc15Mog7_400x400.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2020/05/Vc15Mog7_400x400.png', 'width': 400, 'height': 400}}}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-just-resigned-from-my-job-generative-ai/', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-just-resigned-from-my-job-generative-ai/', 'name': 'Why I just resigned from my job in generative AI. &#x2d; Music Business Worldwide', 'description': 'Ed Newton&#x2d;Rex has quit his role at Stability AI.

  To understand the latest advance in generative AI, imagine a courtroom.
Judges hear and decide cases based on their general understanding of the law. Sometimes a case — like a malpractice suit or a labor dispute — requires special expertise, so judges send court clerks to a law library, looking for precedents and specific cases they can cite.
Like a good judge, large language models (LLMs) can respond to a wide variety of human queries. But to deliver authoritative answers that cite sources, the model needs an assistant to do some research.
The court clerk of AI is a process called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG for short.
How It Got Named ‘RAG’
Patrick Lewis, lead author of the 2020 paper that coined the term, apologized for the unflattering acronym that now describes a growing family of methods across hundreds of papers and dozens of commercial services he believes represent the future of generative AI.
Patrick Lewis
“We definitely would have put more thought into the name had we known our work would become so widespread,” Lewis said in an interview from Singapore, where he was sharing his ideas with a regional conference of database developers.
“We always planned to have a nicer sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea,” said Lewis, who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.
So, What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.
In other words, it fills a gap in how LLMs work. Under the hood, LLMs are neural networks, typically measured by how many parameters they contain. An LLM’s parameters essentially represent the general patterns of how humans use words to form sentences.
That deep understanding, sometimes called parameterized knowledge, makes LLMs useful in responding to general prompts at light speed. However, it does not serve users who want a deeper dive into a current or more specific topic.
Combining Internal, External Resources
Lewis and colleagues developed retrieval-augmented generation to link generative AI services to external resources, especially ones rich in the latest technical details.
The paper, with coauthors from the former Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London and New York University, called RAG “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it can be used by nearly any LLM to connect with practically any external resource.
Building User Trust
Retrieval-augmented generation gives models sources they can cite, like footnotes in a research paper, so users can check any claims. That builds trust.
What’s more, the technique can help models clear up ambiguity in a user query. It also reduces the possibility a model will make a wrong guess, a phenomenon sometimes called hallucination.
Another great advantage of RAG is it’s relatively easy. A blog by Lewis and three of the paper’s coauthors said developers can implement the process with as few as five lines of code.
That makes the method faster and less expensive than retraining a model with additional datasets. And it lets users hot-swap new sources on the fly.
How People Are Using RAG
With retrieval-augmented generation, users can essentially have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences. This means the applications for RAG could be multiple times the number of available datasets.
For example, a generative AI model supplemented with a medical index could be a great assistant for a doctor or nurse. Financial analysts would benefit from an assistant linked to market data.
In fact, almost any business can turn its technical or policy manuals, videos or logs into resources called knowledge bases that can enhance LLMs. These sources can enable use cases such as customer or field support, employee training and developer productivity.
The broad potential is why companies including AWS, IBM, Glean, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle and Pinecone are adopting RAG.
Getting Started With Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
To help users get started, NVIDIA developed an AI workflow for retrieval-augmented generation. It includes a sample chatbot and the elements users need to create their own applications with this new method.
The workflow uses NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for developing and customizing generative AI models, as well as software like NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for running generative AI models in production.
The software components are all part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that accelerates development and deployment of production-ready AI with the security, support and stability businesses need.
Getting the best performance for RAG workflows requires massive amounts of memory and compute to move and process data. The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, with its 288GB of fast HBM3e memory and 8 petaflops of compute, is ideal — it can deliver a 150x speedup over using a CPU.
Once companies get familiar with RAG, they can combine a variety of off-the-shelf or custom LLMs with internal or external knowledge bases to create a wide range of assistants that help their employees and customers.
RAG doesn’t require a data center. LLMs are debuting on Windows PCs, thanks to NVIDIA software that enables all sorts of applications users can access even on their laptops.
An example application for RAG on a PC.
PCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now run some AI models locally. By using RAG on a PC, users can link to a private knowledge source – whether that be emails, notes or articles – to improve responses. The user can then feel confident that their data source, prompts and response all remain private and secure.
A recent blog provides an example of RAG accelerated by TensorRT-LLM for Windows to get better results fast.
The History of RAG 
The roots of the technique go back at least to the early 1970s. That’s when researchers in information retrieval prototyped what they called question-answering systems, apps that use natural language processing (NLP) to access text, initially in narrow topics such as baseball.
The concepts behind this kind of text mining have remained fairly constant over the years. But the machine learning engines driving them have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity.
In the mid-1990s, the Ask Jeeves service, now Ask.com, popularized question answering with its mascot of a well-dressed valet. IBM’s Watson became a TV celebrity in 2011 when it handily beat two human champions on the Jeopardy! game show.

Today, LLMs are taking question-answering systems to a whole new level.
Insights From a London Lab
The seminal 2020 paper arrived as Lewis was pursuing a doctorate in NLP at University College London and working for Meta at a new London AI lab. The team was searching for ways to pack more knowledge into an LLM’s parameters and using a benchmark it developed to measure its progress.
Building on earlier methods and inspired by a paper from Google researchers, the group “had this compelling vision of a trained system that had a retrieval index in the middle of it, so it could learn and generate any text output you wanted,” Lewis recalled.
The IBM Watson question-answering system became a celebrity when it won big on the TV game show Jeopardy!
When Lewis plugged into the work in progress a promising retrieval system from another Meta team, the first results were unexpectedly impressive.
“I showed my supervisor and he said, ‘Whoa, take the win. This sort of thing doesn’t happen very often,’ because these workflows can be hard to set up correctly the first time,” he said.
Lewis also credits major contributions from team members Ethan Perez and Douwe Kiela, then of New York University and Facebook AI Research, respectively.
When complete, the work, which ran on a cluster of NVIDIA GPUs, showed how to make generative AI models more authoritative and trustworthy. It’s since been cited by hundreds of papers that amplified and extended the concepts in what continues to be an active area of research.
How Retrieval-Augmented Generation Works
At a high level, here’s how an NVIDIA technical brief describes the RAG process.
When users ask an LLM a question, the AI model sends the query to another model that converts it into a numeric format so machines can read it. The numeric version of the query is sometimes called an embedding or a vector.
Retrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.
The embedding model then compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base. When it finds a match or multiple matches, it retrieves the related data, converts it to human-readable words and passes it back to the LLM.
Finally, the LLM combines the retrieved words and its own response to the query into a final answer it presents to the user, potentially citing sources the embedding model found.
Keeping Sources Current
In the background, the embedding model continuously creates and updates machine-readable indices, sometimes called vector databases, for new and updated knowledge bases as they become available.
Retrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.
Many developers find LangChain, an open-source library, can be particularly useful in chaining together LLMs, embedding models and knowledge bases. NVIDIA uses LangChain in its reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation.
The LangChain community provides its own description of a RAG process.
Looking forward, the future of generative AI lies in creatively chaining all sorts of LLMs and knowledge bases together to create new kinds of assistants that deliver authoritative results users can verify.

Within two months 100m users were posing all sorts of entertaining queries (“Write me a rap song using references to SpongeBob SquarePants”). The number of people Googling “artificial intelligence” surged, and the mania set off investors’ enthusiasm for all manner of AI projects. Yet the real promise, these investors and entrepreneurs are betting, lies with its use in business. Here, too, it could be more rapidly adopted than past innovations. But that does not mean it will happen overnight.The potential is exciting. According to McKinsey, a consultancy, three-quarters of the business uses of generative ai will fall into four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development. Navigating a complex tax code or summarising a legal document could become a breeze. Type in the right prompt and a first draft of marketing copy could magically appear. Already many coders rely on Copilot, a coding tool from Microsoft, to help them write software. Studies show that professional workers with below-average performance tend to experience the most benefit from using generative ai, promising a big increase in output for firms.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. This approach is known as “poisoning” data. It will lead to generative AI tools creating images that are messed up or don’t match what is being searched for.AI tools extract data from billions of images online, so the more Nightshade is used, the more AI could become poisoned, MIT Technology Review adds.How Nightshade poisons the data that AI tools use. Image: University of ChicagoWhy has Nightshade been developed?AI companies disrespect artists’ copyright and intellectual property when they train their image-generating tools on artists’ work without permission, says Ben Zhao, the computer science professor at University of Chicago leading the Nightshade project.He hopes Nightshade will deter this behaviour and give some power back to artists.Artists, performers and record labels have filed lawsuits against AI companies including OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, for training their AI on artists’ material without permission, reports tech news site VentureBeat.How could Nightshade affect the AI industry?Nightshade could have an important impact if AI companies are forced to be more respectful of artists and their rights, for example by agreeing to pay out royalties, say the contributors to the MIT article.Some AI companies have mechanisms for artists to opt out of their work being used to train generative AI. But artists argue that this isn’t enough, and that AI companies still have too much power.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesGenerative AI is a global emerging technologyGenerative AI is one of the top technologies listed in the World Economic Forum’s Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2023 report.The report highlights the technologies expected to have a positive impact on society in the next three to five years.

Artificial Intelligence Not Main Cause of Recent Insurance Layoffs: AM Best

     Listen to this article 2 min    AM Best does not believe artificial intelligence is the main cause of recent insurance industry layoffs.
In commentary released today, the credit rating agency wrote that “it is too soon to cite AI as the leading cause of the job losses, at least at this nascent stage.” Instead, AM Best said the layoffs likely fall into “the cyclical, rather than the structural, category.”




The rating agency explained that structural unemployment refers to jobs that are made redundant because of systemic changes and the adoption of technology, or a misalignment between business needs and employee skills. Cyclical unemployment refers to employment fluctuations driven by the business cycle, “which seems to be the case in the insurance industry,” AM Best said.
This insight comes after Liberty Mutual, American Family and GEICO announced staff reductions in recent months. AM Best wrote that personal lines are most affected by the latest layoffs, as loss ratios and underwriting margins are pressured by loss cost inflation, reinsurance capacity and pricing and rising climate risk.

The commentary said the recent insurer layoffs alone do not signal ratings pressure.
AM Best did share that artificial intelligence-related advances will gradually reshape the outlook for insurance industry employment. Many insurance companies are experimenting with and are motivated by generative AI’s customer service potential, AM Best reported, later noting that the speed at which AI develops over the coming years will determine the level of industry disruption.
“Although the overall impact of generative AI on employment remains uncertain, it will likely change the way society works, as current employees learn to leverage the power of this developing technology,” AM Best said.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hiring by insurance carriers and related companies slowed to an estimated 1,100 positions in October. This was down from September, when the BLS reported 3,900 people were hired, and July, when 8,300 new workers were brought on board.
Insurance technology companies have also been downsizing. Hippo, Branch Insurance, Corvus Insurance and Pie Insurance announced layoffs earlier this year. Last year, Thimble, NEXT, Lemonade and Root were among the insurtechs trimming their workforces.

Well-loved. Like or Dislike: 14 3Greed:  If one needs any further proof the root issue in America, it is summed up in one word Greed. Why else is the Federal Minimum wage STILL at $7.25.  Next is these companies pay their CEO such crazy pay. Take for example the GM CEO, she makes close to 30 million a year, her workers wanted to match her percentage of rate pay increase.  She makes in one month, what some will make in their entire careers, showing up, every day, working every day.  Until the company sends some slickster in too fire you, let you go, and give you a warm embrace as they shove you out the door, only to turn around and interview you the following 6 months for half the pay.  Again, GREED.

There's no longer any doubt that generative AI, based on models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, will impact our jobs.

Workers are already aware of this; 36% of them believe that their job will be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a BCG study conducted in 13 countries in June. It’s not just speculation. In recent weeks, reports of AI-related layoffs have been multiplying. Onclusive, a media company, recently announced the elimination of 200 jobs (nearly half of its workforce), replaced by an artificial intelligence solution. The CEO of Dukaan, an Indian company that creates e-commerce websites, has announced the layoff of 90% of his customer service teams, replacing them with a chatbot. Business leaders aren't spared either. Almost one in two American CEOs believes that AI would be perfectly capable of carrying out all or part of their roles.


Clearly, GenAI will unlock substantial productivity gains—already certain functions within companies are witnessing productivity surge by over 50%. And though this has sparked anxiety about job losses, it depends on how business leaders intend to use that productivity.

Many businesses will reinvest the savings rather than simply eliminating jobs. Some banks, for example, have harnessed these gains to develop innovative customer outreach strategies, turning previously unprofitable services into profitable ones due to the reduced costs per customer interaction. And higher productivity can also translate into increased capacity where humans are the bottleneck. AI-assisted surgeons, for example, can prepare for operations more rapidly, reducing wait times for ailing patients and potentially increasing the number of people treated.

PROMOTED
Beyond these announcements, researchers have tried to evaluate the likely qualitative and quantitative impact of GenAI on jobs. Research teams from Harvard Business School, MIT, Wharton, Warwick and the BCG Henderson Institute, for example, jointly conducted an experiment with more than 750 BCG consultants worldwide. They observed the impact of using GenAI for 18 so-called “creative” tasks (like coming up with product names, synthesizing documents, writing emails, etc.) and for two complex problem-solving tasks (making a diagnosis and suggesting actions). The results clearly show that undifferentiated deployment of GenAI - beyond creative tasks- is not the solution.
While 90% of employees using generative AI solutions improved their performance in “creative” tasks, and the quality of their output increased by an average of 40% (in terms of content and speed), the same was not true for complex problem-solving. For these more complicated tasks, the average performance of employees using GenAI dropped by 23%. Even more concerning, the performance gain on creative tasks comes at the cost of group creativity, with the variety of results decreasing by 41%.

This is indeed the main dilemma for companies: how to deploy the new generative AI to improve performance while maintaining creative capacity? How can companies differentiate themselves if generative AI standardizes offerings, ideas, discourses and interactions? Ultimately, how can a company differentiate itself if all competitors use the same models and the same data?

Nothing is certain at this stage, but there are some hints on how best to deploy the technology. Above all, be wise in choosing what to automate and what not to automate; decide on a task-by-task basis, not by job category.

Next, always consider the role of humans, understand the value they add over a machine and recruit accordingly. If sales agents are assisted by AI to answer technical questions about products, the best salespeople might be those with stronger relationship skills than is required today. Finally, set aside ""AI-free"" teams to maintain a core group of creatives.
Beyond the impact on specific tasks, GenAI can also help in the shifting labor landscape by bridging skill gaps. Tools like ChatGPT are democratizing job access for individuals with literacy challenges by providing conversational interfaces that simplify complex interactions. AI tutors can smooth and speed certification processes, lowering entry barriers, and aligning with diversity initiatives. Technical jobs with an aging workforce and high qualification barriers, such as elevator maintenance in some countries, are now more accessible to a broader demographic. These advancements position generative AI not only as a tool for productivity but also as a catalyst for a more inclusive workforce.
One thing is certain: the collaboration between humans and the new generative AI systems, harmonious or not, will be a fundamental challenge in the coming decade.

New Generative AI Model Designs Proteins Not Found in Nature

In a new study “Illuminating protein space with a programmable generative model,” published in Nature, researchers present a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, named Chroma, that creates novel proteins not previously found in nature with programmable properties for therapeutic potential and demonstrated experimental success in the lab.
The work comes from Generate:Biomedicines, a company based in Somerville, MA, which works at the intersection of machine learning, biological engineering and medicine with an emphasis on protein design.




“We’ve been working on generative models of proteins since Day 1. That’s why our name is Generate!” exclaimed Gevorg Grigoryan, PhD, co-founder and chief technology officer of Generate:Biomedicines.
Prior to the AI revolution, protein design approaches were limited to generating designs based on nature’s existing proteins, which presented limitations as nature has only sampled a small subset of the possible protein landscape. In contrast, generative AI approaches emphasize de novo protein design—designing new proteins from scratch—to expand the repertoire of functions and desirable attributes beyond what nature has achieved.
Chroma is documented to design proteins under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, and even natural-language prompts. Experimental characterization of 310 proteins generated from Chroma resulted in proteins that express, fold, and possess favorable biophysical properties.







Grigoryan noted that programmability was integral to Chroma’s framework from the get-go, as producing therapeutic applications requires more than generating structures that can be experimentally validated. Evaluating protein function, such as binding, allosteric control, and enzymatic activity, is critical for therapeutic potential.
In addition, Grigoryan highlights that one novelty of the study was a shifted paradigm when thinking about experimental validation in a protein design campaign.
“Instead of the goal being ‘I want the protein to work,’ our goal was to characterize the model. We wanted to understand how much of what Chroma learned was real versus not real,” Grigoryan told GEN.
When deciding which computational structures to experimentally validate, common methodology involves a filtering step, in which protein designers critique designs based on their understanding of biophysical structure, such as penalizing overrepresentation of hydrophobic regions due to solubility concerns.
Grigoryan told GEN that the 310 proteins chosen for experimental validation were taken directly from the model output and not filtered in this way.




“From those proteins, we saw a massively high success rate, which of course is very exciting because it suggests that this large protein space parameterized by Chroma is real [and allows for more effective protein design],” Grigoryan continued.
 Making data work for you
The protein design field’s traditional “bottom up” approach, which simulated protein behavior based on biophysical dynamics of atoms, was logically “fine and consistent” but hasn’t led to the advances that are now achievable with machine learning.
Rather than starting with first principles and evaluating whether simulations are accurate, machine learning approaches start with observations and infer the principles that led to those observations.
“Machine learning tools can make data work for you,” stated Grigoryan.
Specifically, Chroma leverages diffusion models, a machine learning tool that has seen considerable success in image generation tools, such as Midjourney, DALL-E 2 from OpenAI, and Stable Diffusion from Stability AI. These generative models learn the patterns of their training data and generate new outputs with similar characteristics.
Grigoryan emphasizes that this framework makes Chroma malleable to the introduction of new programmable conditions.
“It’s very easy to create a model for new properties and plug it into Chroma. Similar to DALL-E image generators, you don’t have to create a separate model of images for animals, the beach, and mountains. You can just tell the model, ‘I would like a panda dancing on the beach with a sombrero’ and it can generate that for you,” described Grigoryan.
Chroma is not the only generative AI tool leveraging diffusion models for protein design. In July, the lab of David Baker, PhD, professor in biochemistry and the director of the University of Washington (UW) Institute for Protein Design (IPD), published their diffusion model, RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), which demonstrated strong experimental validation and ease of use, in Nature.
“So far, [Chroma] has only been experimentally demonstrated to design new structures, but could likely be adapted to design new protein, peptide and small molecule interactions as has been demonstrated by RFdiffusion,” Baker told GEN.
Along this vein, Grigoryan notes that an effective protein design model is only one piece to the broader process of therapeutic discovery.
“Chroma is a model and not a drug printer. There’s so much more that goes into making therapeutics, which can be resource intensive and involves a very close integration between the wet and dry lab,” said Grigoryan.
Open to all
Generate:Biomedicines has made the code behind Chroma available as open-source software for all researchers across academia and industry.
“Our intention was to go open source before we posted the preprint. From a societal perspective, it would not feel right to stand in the way of what [Chroma] can do for advancing biomedical science, but also other applications, such as nanotechnology and material science,” explained Grigoryan.
From a company perspective, Grigoryan also noted that the ability to continue at the forefront of science is linked to a company’s ability to attract and retain the best talent. Sharing this work is a key action to contributing to the research community.
“It’s great that Generate:Biomedicines is making Chroma available to the scientific community!” said Baker. Baker also indicates that the community will benefit from having multiple generative protein design models to explore.
While diffusion models are the “flavor of the moment,” new protein design tools are expected to infiltrate a rapidly growing field.
“Now that the code is available, [the community] is certainly free to build on it and create better versions. I expect and hope that’s exactly what happens,” stated Grigoryan.

Key Takeaways
Job website Indeed found that postings mentioning AI grew to 20 times what it was at the beginning of the year. Despite the rapid growth, job postings using AI keywords are still a small portion of the overall job market. In its analysis, Indeed found that AI is not taking over full jobs, and is instead being integrated more into work. 
 The growing hype around artificial intelligence (AI) has raised questions for employers and workers alike: Employers want to know if advanced AI tools can boost productivity, and some workers wonder if they’ll be replaced by a mindless chatbot.So-called generative AI algorithms like ChatGPT, which can respond to user prompts by spitting out text that can seem like what a human would write, are starting to make an impact on the job market, albeit a tiny one, according to data from job website Indeed. By the end of October, there were 20 times as many job postings mentioning generative AI-related keywords than when the year began.




 The rapid rise of AI technology has alarmed many government officials and labor leaders, who worry about the possible abuse of the technology and its ability to displace workers. In late October, President Joe Biden called for regulators to establish safeguards on the use of AI. The potential use of AI in scriptwriting was a major reason that Hollywood writers went on strike this summer.Indeed’s job posting data may provide a clue about where the technology is headed because keywords capture not only jobs developing AI but, more important, ones in which workers are expected to use AI tools on the job.


 According to Indeed’s analysis, AI isn't fully taking over entire jobs as of yet but could be used for some specific job functions, like writing marketing copy, for instance.“If we do see continued growth in that area of job postings … that could be an indication there's increasing usage of those tools, that they're spreading throughout the labor market,” said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed’s hiring lab research unit.

This data-labeling ranges from the simple—identifying images of street lamps, say, or comparing similar ecommerce products—to the deeply complex, such as content moderation, where workers classify harmful content within data scraped from all corners of the internet. These tasks are often outsourced to gig workers, via online crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, which was where Hassan started his career.
A friend put him on to the site, which promised work anytime, from anywhere. He found that an hour’s labor would earn him around $1 to $2, he says, more than the national minimum wage, which was about $0.26 at the time. His mother is a homemaker, and his dad is a mechanical laborer. “You can say I belong to a poor family,” he says. When the pandemic hit, he needed work more than ever. Confined to his home, online and restless, he did some digging, and found that Toloka was just the tip of the iceberg.
“AI is presented as a magical box that can do everything,” says Saiph Savage, director of Northeastern University’s Civic AI Lab. “People just simply don’t know that there are human workers behind the scenes.”
At least some of those human workers are children. Platforms require that workers be over 18, but Hassan simply entered a relative’s details and used a corresponding payment method to bypass the checks—and he wasn’t alone in doing so. WIRED spoke to three other workers in Pakistan and Kenya who said they had also joined platforms as minors, and found evidence that the practice is widespread.
“When I was still in secondary school, so many teens discussed online jobs and how they joined using their parents' ID,” says one worker who joined Appen at 16 in Kenya, who asked to remain anonymous. After school, he and his friends would log on to complete annotation tasks late into the night, often for eight hours or more.
Appen declined to give an attributable comment.
“If we suspect a user has violated the User Agreement, Toloka will perform an identity check and request a photo ID and a photo of the user holding the ID,” Geo Dzhikaev, head of Toloka operations, says.
Driven by a global rush into AI, the global data labeling and collection industry is expected to grow to over $17.1 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, Appen, Clickworker, Teemwork.AI, and OneForma connect millions of remote gig workers in the global south to tech companies located in Silicon Valley. Platforms post micro-tasks from their tech clients, which have included Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, Google, Nvidia, Boeing, and Adobe. Many platforms also partner with Microsoft’s own data services platform, the Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS).
These workers are predominantly based in East Africa, Venezuela, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines—though there are even workers in refugee camps, who label, evaluate, and generate data. Workers are paid per task, with remuneration ranging from a cent to a few dollars—although the upper end is considered something of a rare gem, workers say. “The nature of the work often feels like digital servitude—but it's a necessity for earning a livelihood,” says Hassan, who also now works for Clickworker and Appen.
Sometimes, workers are asked to upload audio, images, and videos, which contribute to the data sets used to train AI. Workers typically don’t know exactly how their submissions will be processed, but these can be pretty personal: On Clickworker’s worker jobs tab, one task states: “Show us you baby/child! Help to teach AI by taking 5 photos of your baby/child!” for €2 ($2.15). The next says: “Let your minor (aged 13-17) take part in an interesting selfie project!”
Some tasks involve content moderation—helping AI distinguish between innocent content and that which contains violence, hate speech, or adult imagery. Hassan shared screen recordings of tasks available the day he spoke with WIRED. One UHRS task asked him to identify “fuck,” “c**t,” “dick,” and “bitch” from a body of text. For Toloka, he was shown pages upon pages of partially naked bodies, including sexualized images, lingerie ads, an exposed sculpture, and even a nude body from a Renaissance-style painting. The task? Decipher the adult from the benign, to help the algorithm distinguish between salacious and permissible torsos.
Hassan recalls moderating content while under 18 on UHRS that, he says, continues to weigh on his mental health. He says the content was explicit: accounts of rape incidents, lifted from articles quoting court records; hate speech from social media posts; descriptions of murders from articles; sexualized images of minors; naked images of adult women; adult videos of women and girls from YouTube and TikTok.
Many of the remote workers in Pakistan are underage, Hassan says. He conducted a survey of 96 respondents on a Telegram group chat with almost 10,000 UHRS workers, on behalf of WIRED. About a fifth said they were under 18.
Awais, 20, from Lahore, who spoke on condition that his first name not be published, began working for UHRS via Clickworker at 16, after he promised his girlfriend a birthday trip to the turquoise lakes and snow-capped mountains of Pakistan’s northern region. His parents couldn’t help him with the money, so he turned to data work, joining using a friend’s ID card. “It was easy,” he says.
He worked on the site daily, primarily completing Microsoft’s “Generic Scenario Testing Extension” task. This involved testing homepage and search engine accuracy. In other words, did selecting “car deals” on the MSN homepage bring up photos of cars? Did searching “cat” on Bing show feline images? He was earning $1 to $3 each day, but he found the work both monotonous and infuriating. At times he found himself working 10 hours for $1, because he had to do unpaid training to access certain tasks. Even when he passed the training, there might be no task to complete; or if he breached the time limit, they would suspend his account, he says. Then seemingly out of nowhere, he got banned from performing his most lucrative task—something workers say happens regularly. Bans can occur for a host of reasons, such as giving incorrect answers, answering too fast, or giving answers that deviate from the average pattern of other workers. He’d earned $70 in total. It was almost enough to take his high school sweetheart on the trip, so Awais logged off for good.
Clickworker did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
“In some instances, once a user finishes the training, the quota of responses has already been met for that project and the task is no longer available,” Dzhikaev said. “However, should other similar tasks become available, they will be able to participate without further training.”
Bypassing age checks can be pretty simple. The most lenient platforms, like Clickworker and Toloka, simply ask workers to state they are over 18; the most secure, such as Remotasks, employ face recognition technology to match workers to their photo ID. But even that is fallible, says Posada, citing one worker who says he simply held the phone to his grandmother’s face to pass the checks. The sharing of a single account within family units is another way minors access the work, says Posada. He found that in some Venezuelan homes, when parents cook or run errands, children log on to complete tasks. He says that one family of six he met, with children as young as 13, all claimed to share one account. They ran their home like a factory, Posada says, so that two family members were at the computers working on data labeling at any given point. “Their backs would hurt because they have been sitting for so long. So they would take a break, and then the kids would fill in,” he says.
The physical distances between the workers training AI and the tech giants at the other end of the supply chain—“the deterritorialization of the internet,” Posada calls it—creates a situation where whole workforces are essentially invisible, governed by a different set of rules, or by none.
The lack of worker oversight can even prevent clients from knowing if workers are keeping their income. One Clickworker user in India, who requested anonymity to avoid being banned from the site, told WIRED he “employs” 17 UHRS workers in one office, providing them with a computer, mobile, and internet, in exchange for half their income. While his workers are aged between 18 and 20, due to Clickworker’s lack of age certification requirements, he knows of teenagers using the platform.
In the more shadowy corners of the crowdsourcing industry, the use of child workers is overt.
Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) solving services, where crowdsourcing platforms pay humans to solve captchas, are a less understood part in the AI ecosystem. Captchas are designed to distinguish a bot from a human—the most notable example being Google’s reCaptcha, which asks users to identify objects in images to enter a website. The exact purpose of services that pay people to solve them remains a mystery to academics, says Posada. “But what I can confirm is that many companies, including Google's reCaptcha, use these services to train AI models,” he says. “Thus, these workers indirectly contribute to AI advancements.”
Google did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
There are at least 152 active services, mostly based in China, with more than half a million people working in the underground reCaptcha market, according to a 2019 study by researchers from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.
“Stable job for everyone. Everywhere,” one service, Kolotibablo, states on its website. The company has a promotional website dedicated to showcasing its worker testimonials, which includes images of young children from across the world. In one, a smiling Indonesian boy shows his 11th birthday cake to the camera. “I am very happy to be able to increase my savings for the future,” writes another, no older than 7 or 8. A 14-year-old girl in a long Hello Kitty dress shares a photo of her workstation: a laptop on a pink, Barbie-themed desk.
Not every worker WIRED interviewed felt frustrated with the platforms. At 17, most of Younis Hamdeen’s friends were waiting tables. But the Pakistani teen opted to join UHRS via Appen instead, using the platform for three or four hours a day, alongside high school, earning up to $100 a month. Comparing products listed on Amazon was the most profitable task he encountered. “I love working for this platform,” Hamdeen, now 18, says, because he is paid in US dollars—which is rare in Pakistan—and so benefits from favorable exchange rates.
But the fact that the pay for this work is incredibly low compared to the wages of in-house employees of the tech companies, and that the benefits of the work flow one way—from the global south to the global north, leads to uncomfortable parallels. “We do have to consider the type of colonialism that is being promoted with this type of work,” says the Civic AI Lab’s Savage.
Hassan recently got accepted to a bachelor’s program in medical lab technology. The apps remain his sole income, working an 8 am to 6 pm shift, followed by 2 am to 6 am. However, his earnings have fallen to just $100 per month, as demand for tasks has outstripped supply, as more workers have joined since the pandemic.
He laments that UHRS tasks can pay as little as 1 cent. Even on higher-paid jobs, such as occasional social media tasks on Appen, the amount of time he needs to spend doing unpaid research means he needs to work five or six hours to complete an hour of real-time work, all to earn $2, he says.
“It’s digital slavery,” says Hassan.",,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/business/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Underage Workers Are Training AI'}]",,,https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-data-labeling-children/,tags,,"Niamh RoweBusinessNov 15, 2023 6:00 AMUnderage Workers Are Training AICompanies that provide Big Tech with AI data-labeling services are inadvertently hiring young teens to work on their platforms, often exposing them to traumatic content.Photo-Illustration: Cameron Getty; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveLike most kids his age, 15-year-old Hassan spent a lot of time online. Before the pandemic, he liked playing football with local kids in his hometown of Burewala in the Punjab region of Pakistan. But Covid lockdowns made him something of a recluse, attached to his mobile phone. “I just got out of my room when I had to eat something,” says Hassan, now 18, who asked to be identified under a pseudonym because he was afraid of legal action. But unlike most teenagers, he wasn’t scrolling TikTok or gaming. From his childhood bedroom, the high schooler was working in the global artificial intelligence supply chain, uploading and labeling data to train algorithms for some of the world’s largest AI companies.The raw data used to train machine-learning algorithms is first labeled by humans, and human verification is also needed to evaluate their accuracy.

Artificial Intelligence Referees: Offsides and Out of Bounds
Posted by berryht1 on Monday, November 13, 2023 in  Blog Posts.
By Benjamin Dias 
Popcorn spills as the group collectively leaps from the couch to scream at the TV. You hear a cacophony of explicit phrases and derisive language. “Use your eyes!” “How do you call that?!” “Someone paid the ref!” This scene could easily describe fans across the world as they watch football, baseball, basketball, or even tennis. Inextricably linked to any sports competition is the notion of fairness. In any sport, athletes are constrained to the defined rules of their game—no matter how broad or narrow that rule is. Referees and umpires (collectively referred to here as referees) adjudicate these rules in real time to facilitate game management, diagnose rule infractions, and promote player safety.[1]
Referees are human and are therefore subject to human error. While a minor mistake—an errant call, a missed call, or a misinterpretation of an unimportant rule—has a nominal effect on a match, sometimes blown calls alter games and entire seasons.[2] The margin of error for referees seems to shrink over time. For example, recent advances in replay technology enables referees to confirm whether a football player scores touchdown or secures a turnover,[3] a basketball player shoots before the shot clock expires,[4] or a baseball player beat a throw to first base.[5] Although replay review creates more accurate calls, it also contributes to controversy. Referees make on-the-field calls and utilize a pseudo-legal standard, “substantial evidence,” to overturn field calls.  With widespread access to slow-motion replay, fans can review the most minute details of quick interactions and debate whether the videos provide sufficient evidence to overturn the referee’s visceral judgment. Often, fans come to a different conclusion that the officials.
Technological improvement has given birth to greater social scrutiny of referee performance. Beyond replay review, Sports Governing Organizations (“SGOs”) like the National Football League (“NFL”), National Basketball Association (“NBA”), and Major League Baseball (“MLB”) have implemented various camera angles, dedicated replay officers, and trained rules analysts to ensure each game complies with official rulebooks. Still, errors occur. Sports fans and players alike call upon SGOs to replace core referee functions with Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to improve officiating accuracy.[6] Sports like tennis and soccer have already applied some degree of artificial intelligence technology in VAR and Hawk Eye to enhance refereeing.[7] SGOs and engineers have begun developing AI tools to police whether a pitcher tosses a ball or strike,[8] or whether a basketball player commits a foul.[9] Similar technology could be feasibly adapted for automatic ball-spotting functions in football.[10]
Although SGOs could develop and apply AI technology to supplant core refereeing functions, this blog post cautions against rapid integration out of concern for three distinct categories of legal ramifications.
First, SGOs applying AI technology would feed into the current social narrative that SGOs fix matches, violating anti-racketeering legislation.[11] Congress has long sought to inhibit racketeering in professional sports,[12] but recently, states have nullified federal sports gambling laws, enabling sportsbooks to exist and advertise on television. SGOS derive pecuniary benefits from these advertisements, increasing their incentive to engage in match-fixing. Human referees serve as an inherent barrier to match-fixing because involving more people in SGOs match-fixing schemes increases the chances for leaks. Supplanting human referees with AI that SGOs can manipulate increases the likelihood that SGOs would engage in match-fixing. At a minimum, replacing humans with AI referees would supercharge the social narratives around SGOs and match-fixing, likely culminating in stringent government regulation of AI in the sports industry.
Second, emerging studies indicate a rational fear of algorithmic discrimination where AI predicts biased outcomes utilizing biased data.[13] Algorithms like AI require data to predict realistic outcomes, but sometimes, that data is biased. Algorithmic discrimination—whether malignant or benign—appears ubiquitously across industries who adopted AI tools early like criminal law,[14] health care,[15] and employment hiring practices.[16] If historical biases, like racial biases in penalty rates, exist in human refereeing, these errors would compound under AI and result in discriminatory officiating. Presumptively, discriminatory applications of AI referees would expose SGOs to employment discrimination lawsuits for violating Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations on discharge and discipline.
Third, referees play a significant role in mitigating on-field health and safety issues. Replacing referees with AI could result in a failure by SGOs to uphold their (often contractual) duties to protect player safety.[17] By nature, sports are competitions that pit athletes against each other in a zero-sum, winner-takes-all game. Athletes and fans sometimes succumb to their passions resulting in “chippy” game atmospheres. SGOs expect referees to both enforce rules and prevent athlete and viewer passion from boiling over into all-out brawls. SGOs equip referees with various mechanisms like penalties, warnings, and ejections, to quell aggressive behavior. If SGOs replace human referees with an AI alternative, they knowingly remove an important entity responsible for preventing fights. Assumedly, AI referees would not be able to discern “unnecessary roughness,” “excessive celebration,” or an “intentional hit by pitch” penalties from typical in-game actions. Without shifting the fight prevention responsibility to other human entities, SGOs risk breaching their duty to safeguard the health and safety of their athletes.
Ultimately, although AI technology would likely improve the accuracy and quality of officiating, SGOs should pump the breaks on rapid integration. Legal concerns surrounding racketeering, discrimination, and employment safety highlight the need for more research before adopting available technology to wholly replace human referees. If SGOs remain keen on developing AI tools to improve officiating accuracy, the best solution would be to implement a hybrid system where human referees partner with AI referees to enhance penalty accuracy without sacrificing a core human element in sports. Considering legal liabilities, AI referees should remain technology of the future until sufficient measures are taken to address the racketeering stigma, algorithmic discrimination, and health and safety concerns involved with full adoption.

Should You Use A.I. to Apply for Jobs?

What if you could apply for thousands of jobs with a single mouse-click?

That dream is driving a new generation of A.I.-powered startups that allow job candidates to apply for jobs with a minimum of time and effort. A recent article in Wired breaks down how these companies will use their trained bots to help applicants write and send applications to jobs that meet certain criteria. 

According to Wired, a software engineer named Julian Joseph recently used one such tool, called LazyApply, to apply for 1,000 jobs in less than a day. Eventually, LazyApply would fire off 5,000 applications on Joseph’s behalf, earning 20 interviews. “Compared to the 20 interviews he’d landed after manually applying to 200 to 300 jobs, the success rate was dismal,” the article continued. “But given the time Job GPT saved, Joseph felt it was worth the investment.”

These kinds of stories spark the inevitable question: is it worth entrusting a critical part of your job hunt—crafting your application materials and sending them off to a recruiter or HR specialist—to an A.I.?

The Upside of A.I. of A.I.-Powered Job Applications

Over the past several years, the process of applying for jobs has become exponentially more complicated. Many companies force you to upload your resume and fill out a redundant online form breaking down your skills and experience. Automated resume software may delete your perfectly acceptable resume because you didn’t include the right selection of keywords. And poorly written job postings and documentation can make it difficult to determine what an employer actually wants out of a candidate.

At first glance, bots that apply for jobs might seem like the perfect antidote to this aggravating situation. Who wouldn’t want a virtual assistant who finds the best jobs and fires off applications in the time it takes to make a decent cup of coffee? Just think of what you could do with the time savings.

However, there are a number of downsides to this A.I. revolution—and those could ultimately hurt your chances of landing the job of your dreams.

The Inevitable Downside of A.I.-Powered Job Applications

There’s something to be said about quality over quantity.

It’s worth seeing things from the perspective of the (human) recruiter or hiring manager who, at a certain point, will read your resume and application. They’ll want to know why you want this specific job. How do the job’s requirements align with your past experience and skillset? Why are you interested in this job over a thousand others?

For all of its potential benefits, generative A.I. lacks context and awareness; it doesn’t know which elements of your experience are more relevant to a particular job, and it can’t determine whether listing one skill over another would impress a hiring manager more. Although 46 percent of job seekers are already using ChatGPT to generate a resume or cover letter (according to one survey from earlier this year), just relying on a A.I.-generated resume or cover letter usually won’t yield results: you need to customize such documents to both the job and your background, or the potential employer will reject it as too generic.

Plus, when you “hand apply” to different positions, you have time to check your grammar, spelling, and whether you’re inputting the right information into the right fields. All of those things can boost your chances of landing an interview.

While it takes more time to customize a resume and submit it to a promising company, you’ll likely achieve better results than if you leave the process to an A.I.-powered bot. A “spray and pray” approach to applications won’t result in a happier or more lucrative career.

The actors’ guild concluded a nearly four-month long strike last week after finally reaching a deal with major Hollywood studios securing protections for actors against artificial intelligence, but some SAG-AFTRA members who feel the terms of the deal don’t go far enough are urging colleagues to vote no.

Key Facts


SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union that represents 160,000 entertainment industry professionals, concluded the longest strike in its history on Thursday after 118 days, which was prolonged by disagreements between the union and studios over artificial intelligence.



The SAG-AFTRA board approved the new contract with 86% of board members voting in favor, though it still has to be ratified by the union’s full membership.



The union released a summary of the deal Monday, which contains protections including mandatory consent from performers, or from representatives of deceased performers, to create a “digital replica” of an actor.



Performers must also be paid for the days they would have had to work in person if their digital replica is being used and background actors must be paid if their replicas are used as principal characters.


Actors will be owed residual payments, which compensate performers when their work is rebroadcast or reused, when their digital replicas are used onscreen.


Employers must also receive consent from performers to use their likenesses in a project for which they were not employed, or to digitally alter their performances.


The agreement also allows employers to create “synthetic performers,” which are nonhuman and artificially generated, though consent from performers is required if the synthetic performer’s facial features are recognizable as a real actor.

Chief Critics
Actress Justine Bateman, who was an AI adviser to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, garnered attention for a 29-post thread on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which she voiced concerns over the language used regarding artificial intelligence. Bateman criticized what she considered loopholes in the proposed contract, including an exception for studios to use digital doubles without consent “when the photography or sound track remains substantially as scripted, performed and/or recorded,” which she said is vague and will be up to a studio’s interpretation. Bateman also criticized another exception, which allows employers to use digital doubles without a performer’s consent when the project is “comment, criticism, scholarship, satire or parody, a docudrama, or historical or biographical work.” Actors may find themselves in a “project you never consented to, doing things you never were informed of, for no compensation at all,” Bateman stated. She called the “synthetic performer” clause the most serious issue, stating it is “baffling that a union representing human actors would give approval of those same actors being replaced by an AI Object.” Actress Katja Herbers posted on X the contract should define performers as human beings to separate them from “synthetic performers,” and said a reliance on nonhuman performers will diminish opportunities for film crew members since AI-generated performers will not need makeup, hair or costume workers. Several actors, including Kellen Goff, Jessie Pridemore and Belsheber Rusape Jr. posted on X they will vote no on the deal because of the AI terms and urged fellow actors to do the same. Some actors, including Francesca Monet Calo, voiced concerns on social media that actors may be pressured to give consent for AI usage for fear of not being hired otherwise. “‘Ensuring whether the actors have the RIGHT to say no’ does not protect the actors once they DO say no,” Calo posted.
Contra
In a Monday Zoom meeting for SAG-AFTRA members, union president Fran Drescher condemned “naysayers who have exploited this momentum of ours,” accusing opponents of the deal of trying to “tear down what was being done in the negotiating committee.” Lead negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland defended the deal and stated any contract that forbids the use of AI altogether would have been unfeasible. Drescher also criticized members who plan to vote “no” on the deal based on a single issue, which would be “detrimental to the greater good,” stating these members are overlooking other benefits of the contract.
PROMOTED
Key Background
The months-long actors and writers strikes were both largely held up by concerns over AI. SAG-AFTRA pushed back against studio proposals that would have allowed employers to use likenesses of deceased performers without the consent of their estates or the union, and the union pushed for compensation when AI scans of actors are re-used. The writers strike ended in September after securing protections that allows writers, but does not compel them, to use AI and prevents AI-generated writing from being considered “literary material,” meaning AI will not receive screenwriter credits over the actual writers.
What To Watch For
Whether SAG-AFTRA members will vote to ratify the contract. Voting reportedly begins Tuesday. If the contract is rejected, the strike will resume. SAG-AFTRA has reportedly never rejected a contract before.

By Navneet Singh, Founder & CEO of AVSAR
In the dynamic landscape of the global economy, the inexorable advance of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is ushering in a new era, and India finds itself on the front lines of this transformative wave. This technological surge is not merely altering the job market; it’s fundamentally reshaping the very nature of employment, presenting an intricate tapestry of opportunities and challenges.
Automation’s Unveiling Impact
At the heart of this revolution lies the automation of mundane tasks. Jobs characterised by repetition and rule-based functions are progressively being assumed by machines, heralding efficiency gains but also prompting the obsolescence of traditional roles. Industries like manufacturing, data entry, and customer service are witnessing a discernible shift toward automation, compelling a reevaluation of jobs once deemed the bedrock of employment.
However, the story doesn’t end with job displacement. It unfolds with job creation. AI and automation are fostering the emergence of new roles and industries, necessitating a workforce equipped with skills aligned to the evolving technological landscape. Professions in AI development, machine learning, robotics, and data analysis are experiencing a surge in demand, emphasising the need for professionals with a specialised skill set.
India’s Tech Odyssey Continues
India, with its burgeoning tech industry, stands at the forefront of this transformative wave. The Information Technology (IT) sector, a linchpin of the country’s employment ecosystem, is undergoing a paradigm shift. While routine coding and testing functions face automation, there’s a burgeoning demand for AI specialists, cybersecurity experts, and professionals adept at crafting and maintaining intricate algorithms.
Further, the transformative impact extends beyond the tech sector, permeating into healthcare, finance, and agriculture. AI is revolutionising healthcare diagnostics, streamlining financial transactions, and optimizing precision in agriculture. This promises not only increased efficiency and innovation but also necessitates a robust commitment to reskilling and upskilling to align the workforce with the demands of these emerging fields.
The Gig Economy and Flexibility
The surge of the gig economy stands as another testament to the influence of AI and automation. AI driven platforms offer unprecedented flexibility, from ride-sharing to freelancing opportunities in programming and content creation. Individuals now have a myriad of avenues for income generation. However, this shift raises pertinent questions about job security and the imperative need for comprehensive social safety nets in this evolving employment landscape.
Re-skilling for the Future
Effectively addressing the impact of AI and automation on the job market demands a holistic approach to education and skill development. As industries metamorphose, a dynamic and adaptable workforce becomes imperative. Educational institutions and training programs must recalibrate their curricula to synchronise with the emerging demands of the job market, emphasising not only technical skills but also critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability.
Moreover, a collaborative effort between the government and the private sector is indispensable to facilitate this transition. Initiatives promoting digital literacy, providing accessible training programs, and supporting research and development in emerging technologies are vital components of preparing the workforce for the future.
Embracing Change for a Brighter Tomorrow
In summation, the transformative impact of artificial intelligence and automation on India’s job market is both profound and multifaceted. While certain jobs confront challenges induced by automation, new opportunities and industries are burgeoning. The crux lies in embracing change, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and preparing the workforce for a future where collaboration between humans and machines defines the new world of work.
This transformative journey necessitates concerted efforts from all stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition and a future where technology enriches, rather than diminishes, the employment landscape. As India strides through this tech-savvy era, adaptation and innovation will emerge as the cornerstones of a future where the workforce not only survives but thrives in the age of artificial intelligence and automation.

LLMs, like some other sorts of artificial intelligence, are inspired by - but do not recreate - the way human brains work. The basic structure of these models consists of nodes and connections.




The nodes in the large language model are, in essence, words, and the basic task of the model is to map the ""distances"" between words, with the output being ""the word mostly likely to come next"".




The words, and in some cases parts of words, such as the plural marker ""s"" or the prefix ""un-"", are stored in the model as tokens. Each token is represented not as a sequence of letters, but as a vector, a sequence of numbers.




The vectors work similarly to map coordinates. It's common to represent the locations of cities, say, by using a vector such as [2.34337,48.85663]. That one is for Paris. The first number represents distance and direction east-west from Greenwich. The second does the same for distance from the equator.




The vectors also tell us about the relationship between the places. Paris and Orléans's numbers are close together, because the two places are close together. Using some (relatively) simple maths, we can derive from those vectors a number of useful insights; the distance between places, which is further east and which further north.




The vectors assigned to the word tokens in the model similarly place them in a ""space"", and similarly encode how ""close together"" they are in that space.




But the distances are not only expressed in two dimensions as (many) map references, nor in three dimensions as in this cloud ...




... but in hundreds of dimensions. This is the actual vector for happy in one LLM. We don't know exactly what the dimensions encode, but they may be things like ""substitutability"" - on that dimension ""happy"" would be close to ""sad"", even if on another dimension they might be very far apart.




The basic predictive text in SMS apps, in contrast, only really has one dimension; what is the word which most commonly, in all scenarios, comes next. But crucially an LLM is still, deep down, only figuring out what word - or sequence of words -  is most likely to come next. It can do so much better than predictive text for two related reasons; ""transformers"" and ""attention"".




A transformer is a mathematical process that recalculates the vectors for each token; that is, it assigns new distances between each pair of tokens, based largely on what other tokens are in its utterance. If you ask ""What is a tidy thing to eat pasta with?"" and (in a different chat ... ) ""What is a nice thing to eat pasta with?"" the LLM will start typing its answer...




In each case the LLM gets the first few words from rearranging your question into a response. Now it just has to find the most probable next word.




First the LLM weights all the relationships between all the words it knows, in thousands of dimensions, based on its immense corpus of training data. But then, crucially, it looks at what words have come before and reweights those associations. It is possible that within the model's computations, ""Tidy"" has a close relationship with ""utility"" and ""tools"" and that informs the output. .




Indeed the word ""with"" itself will be reweighted by the preceding terms to lie closer to one set of its alternatives, such as ""using"", ""by means of"". In the second sentence ""nice"", it seems, has relationships with ""taste"" and ""flavour"" and the word with gets reweighted to lean closer to its other alternative, ""accompanied by"".





That reweighting step is what the LLM technicians call a “transformer”, and the principle of re-evaluating the weights based on the salience given to previous bits of the text is what they call “attention”.The LLM applies these steps to every part of a given conversation. So that if you ask “What is the capital of France?” it can re-evaluate capital to probably mean “city” not “financial resources” when it gets the added input of “France”.And when you subsequently ask “How many people live there?” it has already assigned enough salience to the idea of “Paris (city)” that it can conclude that “there” is standing in for “Paris”.Attention is widely considered a breakthrough development in natural language AI, but it doesn’t make for the successful models on its own. Each of those models then goes through extensive training, partly to master the question-and-response format, and often to weed out unacceptable responses – sometimes sexist or racist – that would arise from an uncritical adoption of the material in the training corpus.NotesMost of the visualisations are illustrative but informed by conversations with industry experts, to whom thanks, and by interaction with publicly available LLMs. The vector for happy is from the BERT language model using the transformers Python package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is artificial intelligence?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, How does artificial intelligence work?Artificial intelligence, or AI, is where a computer is able to carry out a task in a way that can be considered human-like.The term ""artificial intelligence"" was first used in 1956.In the 1960s scientists were teaching computers how to mimic - or copy - human decision-making.This developed into research around ""machine learning"", where robots were taught to learn for themselves and to remember their mistakes, instead of simply copying behaviour. Algorithms play a big part in machine learning as they help computers and robots to know what to do.How does it work?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Artificial intelligence works by learning rules and patterns from lots of kinds of dataComputers can be ""taught"" how to do things in a number of different ways.One way is through algorithms - which is a fancy term for a set of rules that a computer must follow.Another way is through experience.For example, a computer might learn how to play chess by being taught the rules of the game before playing millions of matches, and then gaining an understanding of chess with every win and every loss.A computer should be able to spot patterns in the information it receives, which helps it to make decisions, predictions and even take real-world action.If you cannot see this image, click here.What are some examples of artificial intelligence?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Facial recognition technology has been made possible through developments in artificial intelligenceYou can find artificial intelligence being used almost anywhere now - even in your home or at school. Search engine Google uses AI to rank the webpages that come up when something is searched for, and allows users to search with images and voice commands instead of text. Artificial intelligence is also used by social media apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat to show you posts and products the apps think are most relevant to you.Facial recognition has also been made possible due to artificial intelligence, allowing someone to unlock their phone or computer using only their face.Outside of the home, artificial intelligence has been used to create driverless cars, flight simulators and to predict the weather.Artificial intelligence is also being used to help detect and diagnose illnesses like cancer.What is generative artificial intelligence?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, AI has produced an image inspired by Johannes Vermeer's painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" on display at the Mauritshuis museum in the NetherlandsGenerative artificial intelligence is where programs can learn from lots and lots of data to create, or generate, new content that seems human-made.ChatGPT is an example of generative artificial intelligence. It is a chat bot that is able to talk and respond like a human.And other programmes like DALL-E can use text instructions to create images that look as if they've been photographed, painted or drawn.What do critics of artificial intelligence have to say?Artificial intelligence is being used in all sorts of ways, but as the technology develops quickly, some people have raised concerns.For example, there are worries over the accuracy of data that is given to AI by humans.In 2019, a US government conducted a study into the facial recognition software of 99 companies.The technologies struggled to accurately identify African-American and Asian faces compared to white faces.""When we've been teaching it about people's faces there hasn't been as much focus on people of colour so the data contains more images of white men and women,"" technology expert Krittika D'Silva said.Image source, REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaImage caption, Vice-President of the United States, Kamala Harris, shared her concerns about artificial intelligence in London on WednesdayOthers are worried about the privacy of artificial intelligence.Vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, spoke ahead of the UK's Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit on Wednesday about her concerns of ""cyberattacks at a scale beyond anything we have seen before"".Some technology experts, such as Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, say they worry that AI could be a big threat to the world.But lots of experts say this is too negative a view, with Meta's president of global affairs Nick Clegg saying ""speculative, sometimes somewhat futuristic predictions"" should not get in the way of immediate issues to do with AI technology.Others are more concerned about jobs, as it's believed artificial intelligence could replace many careers.Investment bank Goldman Sachs wrote a report that suggested AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe.Prof Gina Neff, who runs an AI centre at the University of Cambridge, said: ""We're concerned about what's going to happen to our jobs, what's going to happen to our news, what's going to happen to our ability to communicate with one another.""What is being done to protect us from artificial intelligence?Image source, CHRIS J RATCLIFFE/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, UK science, innovation and technology secretary Michelle Donelan posed for a photograph with international ministers at the AI Safety Summit 2023The summit has brought together world leaders to discuss the future of artificial intelligence, and ways to protect the world from the technology developing in a way that might cause harm.The Bletchley Declaration shows there is a desire for countries to work together to better understand the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence.Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said at the summit: ""We have always said that no single country can face down the challenges and risks posed by AI alone, and today's landmark declaration marks the start of a new global effort to build public trust by ensuring the technology's safe development.""China's Vice Minister of Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui, agreed that the world needed to work together on this issue.""We call for global collaboration to share knowledge and make AI technologies available to the public,"" he said.More on this storyIs using AI to help with school work cheating?Published1 March 2023AI helps decode an ancient mysterious scrollPublished15 October 2023What is facial recognition and why are people talking about it?Published5 August 2020",,,,,,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67288332,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_bbc/B76E/production/_131585964_gettyimages-1458155158.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As AI-based tech becomes ever more sophisticated, concerns about its possible negative effects on society are growing. Chief among these is the threat it poses to the labour market. Indeed, in a new paper entitled Future Risks of Frontier AI, the Government Office for Science considers a scenario in which increased automation disrupts the UK’s workforce, leading to increased unemployment and poverty by 2030.
Such outcomes are far from unlikely. IBM’s chairman and CEO, Arvind Krishna, expects that about 7,800 jobs at the company could be replaced by generative AI in the medium term, for instance. Meanwhile, BT Group’s leadership team has been open about its plan to slash the firm’s headcount by 55,000, using tech including AI to automate up to 10,000 jobs within seven years. 
Harmeen Mehta, the telco’s chief digital and innovation officer, believes that too much attention is being paid to the technology’s negative impact on people whose jobs it’s already affecting. 
I don’t know how horses felt when the car was invented, but they didn’t complain that they were put out of a job; they didn’t go on strike
“Society changes and jobs morph,” she says. “I don‘t know how horses felt when the car was invented, but they didn’t complain that they were put out of a job; they didn’t go on strike. It’s part of evolution. Some jobs will change, some new ones will be created and some will no longer be needed.” 
The UK press has adopted a particularly circumspect attitude towards AI, according to Mehta, who believes that the media focus in the US and much of Asia has been much more on its potential applications. 
“The media here is creating a level of paranoia that’s going to paralyse this country – it creates more emotional problems for me than I do for myself,” she says. “I’ve spent the past two years trying to convince my company that human intelligence and artificial intelligence can work together.”
Mehta believes that the UK is trailing badly in the innovation stakes behind the US, which is home to firms at the forefront of AI development, including OpenAI, Amazon and Microsoft. 
“The UK is a leader in research, but we lag on turning that into products that generate revenue,” she observes. “We‘re not monetising our own brain cells.“
Creating a startup culture at BT
Mehta joined the company in March 2021 to lead its digital transformation unit, BT Digital. This department is responsible for modernising the business, which she describes as “a little bit more institutionalised” than her previous employer, Indian telco Bharti Airtel.
Having missed out on a “whole wave of transformation”, BT has left itself “a lot of catching up to do”, according to Mehta. With this in mind, she is determined that the firm will seize the latest opportunities created by the rise of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT. 
“If I don‘t do this for BT, the business won’t survive because every other company will do it and overtake us,” she stresses.
The UK is not going to be an AI hub if you don’t let companies adopt AI
In her bid to “shake up” the enterprise, which can trace its roots back to 1846, Mehta has been hiring candidates with experience in startups to inject some entrepreneurial spirit into the organisation. 
“These people have shown what they can do without the resources of BT, so imagine what they can do for the country, not just for the company, if we give them a bit of room,” she says.
Alongside its remit for product innovation and service digitalisation, Mehta’s unit is also responsible for finding £1bn in savings through digital transformation with a project that’s known internally as “simplify”. This forms part of the wider £3bn cost-reduction target set last year by BT’s outgoing CEO, Philip Jansen.
These savings will come from measures such as productivity improvements, a reduction in spending on legacy systems, a shift away from using subcontractors and, crucially, the adoption of generative AI. 
AI should be a ‘call to arms’ for society
While Mehta accepts that this last measure in particular will affect numerous roles at the company, she encourages people to retrain to avoid being automated out of a job. 
“Every job that exists today won’t exist in exactly the same form in the future,” she argues. “The people who reskill themselves will have jobs, at this company or another, while those who don‘t might not. That is simply part of the evolution of society.”
This challenge should be reframed as a “call to arms for society“ that urges people to “wake up, reinvent yourself and get ready”, says Mehta, who adds: “Why is it my job to make every person in the company relevant for the future? It‘s their responsibility to put themselves on the map and mine to create an opportunity for them to do that. It takes two to tango.” 
Reskilling works beautifully if it’s done with the right mindset and people are hungry to lea
Mehta can provide a clear example of how this approach is working at BT. Earlier this year, she encouraged tech-savvy workers in the firm’s Belfast call centre to apply for jobs in her business unit. Of the 50 or so applicants, four have gone on to have full-time roles in BT Digital and have received training on low-code platforms (which don’t require deep knowledge of programming languages to use). 
“They’ve gone from working in call centres to building the technology we’ll be using in call centres,” Mehta says. “I just created a little bit of an atmosphere and gave them a platform. The experience has made me confident that reskilling works beautifully if it’s done with the right mindset and people are hungry to learn.”
She would like such a model to become more prevalent in British business. In her view, if this country is ever to become a leading AI power, people must learn to stop worrying about the risks posed by the technology and focus on the opportunities it offers. 
“The UK is not going to be an AI hub if you don’t let companies adopt AI. While this will mean that some mundane jobs will disappear, new kinds of jobs will be created,” she argues. “This can lead to much more innovation because we’ll be spending less time writing emails and more time actually thinking.”

				Concerns about AI range from how will it change the nature of work to what it might mean for human life on earth

As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, technology moguls and influencers across the globe have been sharing their views on what impacts are to be expected.With the progression comes a whole series of questions, which Telegraph readers have been sending in their multitudes.Many are concerned how artificial intelligence will change the nature of their work, and whether it will make certain jobs redundant. Others question how society will change, and indeed what the advancement of AI might mean for human life on earth. The Telegraph’s technology editor, James Titcomb, has answered the most pressing of readers’ queries about AI and what it holds for the future. Read on to have your questions about AI answered by our expert, and please share any additional questions in the comments section.Reader Gary Bowers asks: “How fast is AI coming along? For instance, is it learning how human emotions work yet?”The Telegraph’s technology editor, James Titcomb, responds: “AI is clearly making rapid progress in some areas, but remains fairly basic in others. One of the problems with the term ‘artificial intelligence’ is that it makes us think of these systems in human terms. “The reality is that in some fields - arithmetic, for example - machines have outperformed us for decades; in others, they are nowhere near. Emotions fall into the latter: we haven’t really built AI that exhibits anything close to an emotion, partly because we don’t really understand how they work in living things. “There are certainly AIs that scan faces and voices to detect emotions, which have been used by police and marketing companies, although their effectiveness has been questioned.“For now, it’s probably better to think about AI in terms of individual capabilities than comparing it to the human brain. In some areas, such as generating images or summarising text, it is improving quickly, although these changes tend to come in fits and spurts, rather than improving gradually.”Another reader, Ben Francis, wants to know: “How do we prevent this tech hitting escape velocity and leaving us behind?”James replies: “For now, AI still can’t do a lot of things we can do, so it’s unlikely that we will be left behind any time soon, but experts do have some ideas about how to manage its rise. “One is that we should ban AI from writing computer code to develop AI. This would prevent a phenomenon known as ‘recursive self-improvement’ where a system repeatedly improves itself until it outsmarts humans and then becomes all-powerful.“Another emerging research area is known as AI alignment: ensuring that a robot’s goals are in line with ours. It is hoped that this would prevent famous doomsday scenarios where an AI is given a straightforward task - cleaning up the oceans or creating paperclips - and ends up destroying humanity as a side effect.”








Roy Read questions: “Surely we are our own worst enemies when it comes to AI?”Here’s what James has to say: “If you bring up concerns about artificial intelligence with researchers, or suggest that progress could be slower, many will argue that easing back is pointless. They say that somebody is going to develop this technology sooner than later, and wouldn’t you rather it was us than China or Russia?“As with most technologies, development is often hard to stop. One exception has been nuclear weapons, where a concerted international effort stopped their deployment decades ago. Safety advocates would like to see similar treaties and international agreements when it comes to AI: some have proposed a body similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency to regulate use of the technology.”Frederick Otobele asks: “How will cybersecurity experts’ work be impacted by AI?”Our expert responds: “In short: they’ll be busy! Security experts have warned for years that AI could lead to the industrialisation of hacking as automated systems probe for weaknesses in security networks. “A growing concern is that AI software that can accurately replicate people’s voices and likenesses could bypass security controls such as voice banking, or automate scams so that vulnerable people are fooled into sending money.“We’re yet to see that come to pass, but it is probably only a matter of time. Cybersecurity experts are likely to be as in-demand as ever.”Kates Ferrier queries: “I don’t understand why AI is being introduced. Why would we as a nation give further way to instability in the employment industry and opportunity to earn a salary? It’s frightening.”James says: “New technologies - from the loom to the steam engine - have often threatened to displace jobs, but have in the end made us more productive, with plenty of employment still available. The question with AI is whether it represents a step change that could make vast swathes of the workforce, not just certain jobs, redundant. We’re not there yet.“The other response is that it’s simply difficult to hold inventions back, at least not without very strict regulation. Employers that could save money by employing AI are unlikely to voluntarily choose to ignore it.”Reader Richard Burgess would like to know: “Do we need AI?”Our expert replies: “We often talk about the downsides of AI, and many of the uses that have emerged in the last few months - cheating at homework, hacking or copyright infringement - seem like things we could do without. AI’s supporters say there are very serious advantages, such as making us more productive at work, helping to discover new drugs, and the eventual arrival of self-driving cars, which could make the roads safer.“The UK’s flatlining productivity in the last decade and a half has consistently puzzled economists and politicians: if AI can help fix the puzzle, it would certainly be a benefit.”Mohamad Behery queries: “Surely if jobs are at risk it means it’s not good for the economy with less tax being pumped into the system, shouldn’t the Government intervene to protect the citizens?”James answers:“Generally, new technologies haven’t meant fewer jobs over the long run, but there is an active debate over whether taxpaying human jobs should be protected in the short term to minimise disruption to individual livelihoods.“One proposal, that has been supported by Bill Gates and others, is to tax robots and AI in the same way we do humans. In theory, this would level the playing field, putting humans at less of an advantage.“In practice, it’s hard to define AI, and even harder to tax it. But if millions of humans are rendered redundant, governments will have to find a way to adapt. Higher taxes on wealth or on corporate profits to fund a universal basic income are among the ideas that have been mooted.”




Jobs safe from AI that pay the highest salaries



Jane Pourtney’s question is: “To what extent are A level and university essay questions being redesigned to overcome AI assistance?”Here’s what our experts says:“One of the first clear impacts of ChatGPT has been a cheating epidemic. Thousands of students have turned in essays and homework generated by the system, leading some schools and universities to ban the software. “Others have turned to anti-cheating tools designed to check if something has been written by AI, although many produce errors, leading students who have written their own work being falsely accused of cheating.“Teachers seem to be gradually adapting, rather than resisting, however. Some are moving essay writing to the classroom, where students cannot use ChatGPT. Others are allowing students to use the software, but adding interviews to show that students understand the subject. “The latter might prove more useful: like calculators and spell check, students are likely to continue using AI in the world of work.”Another reader, Charlie Jones, asks: “If you were a teenager soon to be making choices for university and future career, what would you seek or avoid with AI in mind?”James replies: “This is a great question. The instinctual answer is computer science or maths: if AI is going to replace jobs, it seems a safe bet that at least the people developing it will be in employment. “Any skilled physical job is likely to be in demand for some time: while software has come on in leaps and bounds, robots remain a challenge. Lawyers will have no shortage of work either, judging by the frequent lawsuits against AI companies from people who say they have been libelled or had their data stolen.“With some exceptions, however, many of today’s jobs are still likely to exist, just in different forms. AI is a tool that still requires human intervention.”A question from Joe Jackson: “Should we consider films based on tech, such as Will Smith in I, Robot being a very possible reality within the next 50 years?”James answers: “Probably not. Hollywood movies such as The Terminator have done a good job of entertaining us but a pretty poor job of educating us about an AI future. For example, they often give AI human qualities - a lust for power - that we have no evidence they possess.“50 years is a long time frame, and AI will undoubtedly make huge advances over the decades. “We should certainly be wary of the risks - but the most risky scenarios to do with AI are probably about humans incorrectly deploying them in areas like weapons systems than the typical Hollywood examples of a race of robots enslaving humans.”Peter Mitchell asks: “Will AI be able to replace customer service operators?”Our expert replies:“This is something that is already happening. Go on many websites today and you’ll find yourself talking to an AI bot, rather than a human operator. Energy provider Octopus, for example, says that customers actually prefer communicating with AI than staff.“AI is unlikely to be able to answer all queries for many years, but the number of cases it can deal with are likely to gradually increase until it is handling the majority of customer service issues. “For now, AI is better at answering chats and emails than phone calls, but voice recognition and replication technology means that is changing too, although some people may find it uncanny.”Finally, reader Peo Rakata would like some advice: “As a finance and banking professional, how can one adapt to the new AI environment to avoid retrenchment?”In response, James says:“It is hard to predict, but the white collar jobs that are probably most at risk from artificial intelligence are those in repetitive or data-intensive tasks: data entry and analysis, compliance, and so on. Those that involve a lot of personal interaction are less likely to be affected. That is probably the case from finance to a lot of other office-based jobs.“These changes tend to happen relatively gradually though, and employers often find new jobs for their workers. Computers and the internet have changed offices hugely, but we still have just as many people employed in them, even though we have fewer typists and secretaries.”Do you have a question about AI?

DOWNLOAD NOWThe system, trained on the hiring patterns from the previous 10 years, was observed to be recreating the gender-based inequalities that existed in the company’s previous recruitment cycles. Recent research has shown racial bias, in addition to gender-based inequality, remains a pervasive issue in tech recruitment, suggesting AI systems trained on currently available datasets are likely to reflect this bias, and may even amplify it.The potential for AI to address employment inequalitiesYet AI’s impact on labor market inequalities has the potential to be a positive one if applied in specific ways. This is the argument of the founder and chief executive of Melbourne-based startup Sapia.ai, Barb Hyman.The hiring automation service interviews thousands of candidates simultaneously via text chat, which removes many of the factors that might influence an AI or human in charge of recruitment, claimed Hyman when speaking to The Guardian in March 2023. “The only way to remove bias in hiring is to not use people right at the first gate,” Hyman says. “That’s where our technology comes in: it’s blind; it’s untimed, it doesn’t use resume data or your social media data or demographic data. All it is using is the text results.”

Generative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns and risks


Under the radar for decades, generative AI is upending business models and forcing ethical issues like customer privacy, brand integrity and worker displacement to the forefront.

Like other forms of AI, generative AI can influence a number of ethical issues and risks surrounding data privacy, security, policies and workforces. Generative AI technology can also potentially produce a series of new business risks like misinformation, plagiarism, copyright infringements and harmful content. Lack of transparency and the potential for worker displacement are additional issues that enterprises may need to address.







""Many of the risks posed by generative AI … are enhanced and more concerning than others,"" said Tad Roselund, managing director and senior partner at consultancy BCG. Those risks require a comprehensive approach, including a clearly defined strategy, good governance and a commitment to responsible AI. A corporate culture that embraces generative AI ethics must consider eight important issues.

1. Distribution of harmful content
AI systems can create content automatically based on text prompts by humans. ""These systems can generate enormous productivity improvements, but they can also be used for harm, either intentional or unintentional,"" explained Bret Greenstein, partner, cloud and digital analytics insights, at professional services consultancy PwC. An AI-generated email sent on behalf of the company, for example, could inadvertently contain offensive language or issue harmful guidance to employees. Generative AI should be used to augment, not replace humans or processes, Greenstein advised, to ensure content meets the company's ethical expectations and supports its brand values.


2. Copyright and legal exposure
Popular generative AI tools are trained on massive image and text databases from multiple sources, including the internet. When these tools create images or generate lines of code, the data's source could be unknown, which can be problematic for a bank handling financial transactions or pharmaceutical company relying on a formula for a complex molecule in a drug. Reputational and financial risks could also be massive if one company's product is based on another company's intellectual property. ""Companies must look to validate outputs from the models,"" Roselund advised, ""until legal precedents provide clarity around IP and copyright challenges.""

Businesses are scrambling to maximize the benefits of today's generative AI while wrestling with inherent ethical issues.







3. Data privacy violations
Generative AI large language models (LLMs) are trained on data sets that sometimes include personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals. This data can sometimes be elicited with a simple text prompt, noted Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute. And compared to traditional search engines, it can be more difficult for a consumer to locate and request removal of the information. Companies that build or fine-tune LLMs must ensure that PII isn't embedded in the language models and that it's easy to remove PII from these models in compliance with privacy laws.


4. Sensitive information disclosure
Generative AI is democratizing AI capabilities and making them more accessible. This combination of democratization and accessibility, Roselund said, could potentially lead to a medical researcher inadvertently disclosing sensitive patient information or a consumer brand unwittingly exposing its product strategy to a third party. The consequences of unintended incidents like these could irrevocably breach patient or customer trust and carry legal ramifications. Roselund recommended that companies institute clear guidelines, governance and effective communication from the top down, emphasizing shared responsibility for safeguarding sensitive information, protected data and IP.


5. Amplification of existing bias
Generative AI can potentially amplify existing biases -- for example, bias can be found in data used for training LLMs outside the control of companies that use these language models for specific applications. It's important for companies working on AI to have diverse leaders and subject matter experts to help identify unconscious bias in data and models, Greenstein said.








6. Workforce roles and morale
AI can do a lot more of the daily tasks that knowledge workers do, including writing, coding, content creation, summarization and analysis, said Greenstein. Although worker displacement and replacement have been ongoing since the first AI and automation tools were deployed, the pace has accelerated as a result of the innovations in generative AI technologies. ""The future of work itself is changing,"" Greenstein added, ""and the most ethical companies are investing in this [change].""
Ethical responses have included investments in preparing certain parts of the workforce for the new roles created by generative AI applications. Businesses, for example, will need to help employees develop generative AI skills such as prompt engineering. ""The truly existential ethical challenge for adoption of generative AI is its impact on organizational design, work and ultimately on individual workers,"" said Nick Kramer, vice president of applied solutions at consultancy SSA & Company. ""This will not only minimize the negative impacts, but it will also prepare the companies for growth.""


7. Data provenance
Generative AI systems consume tremendous volumes of data that could be inadequately governed, of questionable origin, used without consent or contain bias. Additional levels of inaccuracy can be amplified by social influencers or the AI systems themselves.
""The accuracy of a generative AI system depends on the corpus of data it uses and its provenance,"" explained Scott Zoldi, chief analytics officer at credit scoring services company FICO. ""ChatGPT-4 is mining the internet for data, and a lot of it is truly garbage, presenting a basic accuracy problem on answers to questions to which we don't know the answer."" FICO, according to Zoldi, has been using generative AI for more than a decade to simulate edge cases in training fraud detection algorithms. The generated data is always labeled as synthetic data so Zoldi's team knows where the data is allowed to be used. ""We treat it as walled-off data for the purposes of test and simulation only,"" he said. ""Synthetic data produced by generative AI does not inform the model going forward in the future. We contain this generative asset and do not allow it 'out in the wild.'""





8. Lack of explainability and interpretability
Many generative AI systems group facts together probabilistically, going back to the way AI has learned to associate data elements with one another, Zoldi explained. But these details aren't always revealed when using applications like ChatGPT. Consequently, data trustworthiness is called into question.
When interrogating generative AI, analysts expect to arrive at a causal explanation for outcomes. But machine learning models and generative AI search for correlations, not causality. ""That's where we humans need to insist on model interpretability -- the reason why the model gave the answer it did,"" Zoldi said. ""And truly understand if an answer is a plausible explanation versus taking the outcome at face value.""
Until that level of trustworthiness can be achieved, generative AI systems should not be relied upon to provide answers that could significantly affect lives and livelihoods.

IntroductionOccupation is a major component of adult life and is an important determinant of overall health. Workers are exposed to negative conditions such as prolonged sitting, stress, and chemical and physical agents including diesel engine exhaust and asbestos1. Such occupational exposures globally account for 2.8% of deaths and 3.2% of disability-adjusted life years from all causes2. For example, about 26% of low back pain has been estimated to be work-related and 3.2% to 4.6% of all cancer deaths are due to occupational exposure. Occupational epidemiological studies that assess exposure-response associations fuel interventions to promote workers’ health. Such studies rely on high-quality exposure assessments to secure correct or unbiased results3.Occupational data in population-based cohorts is collected from respondents via open-ended surveys where they report their job title as they know it in a free-text format4. Subsequently, Job-Exposure Matrices (JEMs) can be used to assign a wide range of exposures to occupations5. A JEM comprises of estimated probabilities and intensities of exposure to harmful agents by standardized occupational titles and industries. Through the use of occupational and industry classification systems, free-text job descriptions are translated into such standardized occupational titles and industries6.Occupational coding is performed manually by expert coders. To ensure high quality and consistency of coding, documentation, procedures, and training are provided4. Nevertheless, consistent coding of job descriptions remains challenging, given the large number of different outcome categories. After three months of extensive coding and training, the coding efficiency of an expert coder can reach ~2700 codes per month7. Furthermore, because of the repetitive nature of the task, prolonged occupational coding sessions result in reduced coding accuracy due to fatigue. Hence, given the large scale of many occupational epidemiological cohorts, multiple expert coders need to be deployed. This introduces a 44–89% inter-coder reliability range for the most detailed coding level8, with more recent studies reporting ranges between 42–71%9,10,11,12.Tools have been developed to support manual assignment of occupational codes to job descriptions13,14. Additionally, tools have been developed that enable completely automatic coding, achieving a prediction accuracy ranging 15–64% on the highest coding level with an out-of-distribution accuracy ranging 17–26% (see Table 1)10,15,16,17,18,19,20. Although some coding tools achieve a human-coder level prediction accuracy, their exposure assessment accuracy may be lower. Research on automatic coding tools reports inter-coder reliability of 51% with an exposure assessment Cohen’s Kappa score between 0.4–0.87. However, a separate study reports higher minimum human exposure assessment Cohen’s Kappa ranges between 0.66 and 0.84 with only 36–50% inter-coder reliability21. Hence, human intervention is required during or after the automatic coding process to ensure reliable exposure assessment. However, current (semi-)automatic coding tools either lack the implementation of machine learning techniques, which are essential for achieving human-level prediction accuracy16,22 or are limited to one national occupational coding classification system10. This implies that only JEMs using these national classifications can be applied, limiting the use of these tools in global exposure assessment studies requiring other classifications. Consequently, we developed, tested, and validated OPERAS, a decision support system for epidemiological job coding that utilizes ML-based classification models for four (inter)national classification systems. Its goal is to support expert coders during occupational coding through both automatic coding as well as decision support through code suggestions. Our evaluation shows that OPERAS outperforms existing automatic coding tools and expert coders, leading to a substantial workload reduction and highly accurate exposure assessment.Table 1 Supported occupational classification(s), applied classification algorithm, and accuracy (%) of the currently available automatic occupational coding tools.Full size tableMethodsOPERAS has been developed via six phases. First, we acquired datasets and identified classification performance barriers. Additionally, we specify the origin, available input classes, and used occupational classification systems. Second, to enable complete code suggestions, we removed missing and incomplete codes during data preparation. Furthermore, to ensure optimal classification performance, we reduced the dimensionality and retained crucial information of the free-text job descriptions through multiple Natural Languange Processing (NLP) techniques. Third, using state-of-the-art gradient tree boosting, we trained the classification models. We optimized for generalizability by using pre-defined parameter settings and the inclusion of generally described job descriptions from the coding index in the training set. Fourth, using prediction accuracy and Cohen’s kappa, we evaluated the classification models on their classification performance and present its impact on the occupational coding process. Fifth, based on two occupational inter-coder reliability studies, we compared OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to expert coders. Sixth, using four JEMs, we evaluated the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models on their exposure assessment for two groups: 1) all individuals, and 2) exposed individuals. In the following subsections, each phase will be explained in detail.DatasetsUsing French23, Asian24, and Dutch25 datasets, we developed OPERAS’ classification models. These datasets respectively contain French, English, and Dutch manually expert-coded free-text job descriptions in four hierarchically structured occupational/activity sector coding classifications. Each classification consists of multiple numbers and/or letters (e.g., “211A”) where each added (combination of) character(s) provides additional detail about the job description. For example, the major, sub-major, minor, and unit groups of the ISCO-88 code “2221” are “Professionals” (2), “Life Sciences and Health Professionals” (22), “Health Professionals” (222), and “Medical Doctors” (2221), respectively. For insufficiently detailed job descriptions the expert coder will replace not codable levels with a pre-defined character (e.g., “#”). In the following paragraphs, each dataset and coding classification will be further described. The descriptive statistics of each dataset can be found in Tables 2 and 3.Table 2 Descriptive statistics of viable entries from the Constances, AsiaLymph and Lifework datasets (IQR = interquartile range).Full size tableTable 3 Minimum, 25%, 50%, 75% quantiles, and maximum word count of job descriptions per input class for AsiaLymph, Constances, and Lifework datasets.Full size tableConstances is a general-purpose cohort of French adults aged 18–69 with a focus on occupational and environmental factors23. The dataset contains free-text answers to open-ended questions regarding participants’ occupations held and sector of activity. This information was manually coded into the French Nomenclature d’Activités Française (NAF)2008 and Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles (PCS)2003 classifications by expert coders using a dedicated application showing the entire summary of a participant’s occupational history26. Here, a NAF code describes one’s activity sector and consists of four digits and one letter (e.g., “4231A”), whereas a PCS code describes occupation and consists of three digits and a letter (e.g., “211A”). The Constances cohort has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the French Institute of Medical Research and Health, the “Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés”, and the “Conseil National de l’Information Statistique”. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data for the current study were provided by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of the original study.The AsiaLymph dataset is a hospital-based case-control study of lymphoma among Chinese in Eastern Asia24. This dataset contains free-text traditional and simplified Chinese occupations, tasks, employers, and products that were translated into English. They were manually coded using the International Standard Classifications of Occupation (ISCO)-88 coding classification, which consists of four hierarchical levels of detail, each represented with a number (e.g., “4521”). The occupational data were independently coded by two study centers, where discordant codes were resolved by a third expert coder. The AsiaLymph study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the four participating sites, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data in the current study were provided by the PIs of the original study.The Lifework cohort is a large federated prospective cohort from the Netherlands that quantifies the health effects of occupational and environmental exposure25. The dataset includes job names, descriptions, and company types that were manually coded into ISCO-68 occupational codes, which is an earlier version of ISCO-88. This version has an additional level of detail to describe a job description (e.g., “1-21.10”). Contrastingly, instead of supplemented incomplete codes, only the levels that can be coded are given (e.g., “1-21” instead of “1-21.##”). The coding was performed by expert coders, where uncertain initial codes were resolved by a second expert coder (see manual coding procedures in the Supplementary Methods). The Lifework cohort and contributing subcohorts were reviewed and approved by the committee at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the committee at TNO (Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research) Nutrition and Food Research, and the committee at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Participants signed an informed consent form for each subcohort prior to enrolment. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data in the current study were provided by the steering group of the Lifework study.Data preparationThe Constances, Asialymph, and Lifework datasets contain 637,148, 36,179, and 12,120 entries, respectively. To ensure complete code suggestions, entries with incomplete codes were considered nonviable for classification model training. After data cleaning, 281,418, 483,090, 36,007, and 12,007 viable entries remained to train the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 models, respectively. A large number of incomplete NAF and PCS entries were removed using this strategy due to the insufficiently detailed descriptions before occupational coding. However, this was warranted as it ensures optimal decision support during the occupational coding process through complete code suggestions.As all data were collected in an open-ended format, tokenizing, removing punctuation marks, converting all input to lowercase, and stemming all words to their root form allowed for the reduction of the random noise and dimensionality of the data27. Compared to other automatic text-classification systems, we noticed a low word count of the descriptions, and high variability between descriptions of the same occupation27,28,29. Hence, to allow for the retention of important information and similar representation of similar job descriptions, we embedded all descriptions into numerical feature vectors using sentence embedding30. Sentence embeddings are fixed-length vector representations of sentences that allow for comparison and computation with other sentences. These embedders have been trained on large corpora of textual data to learn highly generic semantic relations between sentences. The goal is to encode the sentence so that similar sentences (in terms of meaning) are close in the embedding space, and dissimilar sentences are far apart. In the current context, this would result in similar job descriptions being represented as such. When multiple input classes per occupational code were required for classification model training (e.g., job description and sector), we summed the resulting feature vectors to combine all information31. To increase the generalizability of the models, we randomly split up the prepared data from each dataset into a training (60%), test (30%), and validation (10%) set, and supplemented the training set of each occupational classification with job descriptions from their respective coding indexes.As classification models tend to overly represent majority classes, the class sizes of the outcome categories should be balanced32. However, algorithms that synthetically provide data balance could not be applied to the current datasets due to the difference in class size being too large33,34. Oversampling algorithms could not compute synthetic samples due to the minority classes having too few samples. Contrastingly, undersampling resulted in the loss of too much information due to the majority classes being reduced to only a few samples.Classification model trainingUsing the state-of-the-art gradient tree boosting algorithm XGBoost, we developed the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models35 (see Fig. 1). We chose this algorithm due to a study performed by Schierholz and Schonlau22, where multiple Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated on their classification performance based on five occupational datasets. They found that, when the training data was supplemented with the job descriptions from the coding index, the XGBoost algorithm performed best.Fig. 1: Flowchart of the data preparation and training strategy of OPERAS’ classification models.An arbitrary example (i.e., “Service Employee.” and “Electronic Retail.'') of two input classes (i.e., job description and sector) of the same entry in an occupational database is given.Full size imageXGBoost generates an ensemble of weak Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs) and combines their predictions to produce a strong, accurate model35. The model is trained by minimizing a regularized objective function, which includes a loss function to measure the error between the target class (i.e., the ‘gold-standard’ occupational code), and a regularization term to prevent overfitting. For multi-class problems such as the current one, XGBoost builds a binary outcome ensemble for each class. The ensemble is trained in an additive manner, where a new CART is added to the ensemble in each iteration to fit the residual errors of the previous iteration. Furthermore, XGBoost uses several techniques to prevent overfitting, such as the addition of the regularization term, subsampling of training data and columns, and the penalization of large weights. These strategies can be fine-tuned using several adjustable hyperparameters. A more extensive description of the algorithm and its hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary Methods and in the original paper from Chen and Guestrin35.Schierholz and Schonlau22 empirically optimized the hyperparameters for the largest occupational dataset and proposed a default setting. As the datasets used in ref. 22 are similar to the current datasets in terms of data collection (i.e., free-text job descriptions), (number of) outcome categories (i.e., occupational codes), and average word count, we expected similar relative performance when the proposed default set of hyperparameters is used in the current study36. Following the instructions from Schierholz and Schonlau22 we have set lower values for η and max_depth for optimal classification performance. Hence, we adopted and used the following hyperparameter settings for the development of each classification model: Early stopping if performance does not improve for 1 round, η = 0.6, max_delta_step = 1, max_depth = 20, γ = 1.5, λ = 1e−4, min_child_weight = 0, subsample = 0.75, colsample_by_tree = 1, and colsample_by_level = 1.We trained the NAF, PCS, and ISCO-68 classification models in the original language of the corresponding dataset, whereas we trained the ISCO-88 model using its English translation. Here, the classification models were solely trained using the training data. The validation set was used during training to allow for early stopping of training to reduce the chance of overfitting37. We performed feature selection to find the combination of input classes that yield the best predictive performance for each dataset. Here, we used an exhaustive wrapper approach, where a classification model is trained for each combination of input classes in a dataset and evaluated to find the combination which provides the best predictive performance38. Using exclusively the test set, we measured the performance of the classification models.Evaluation metricsUsing the entries in the test set of the corresponding datasets, we assessed the accuracy and inter-coder reliability of OPERAS’ classification models using accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa (κ), respectively. Here, we consider the manually expert-coded job descriptions from the aforementioned datasets as the gold standard.We deem accuracy to be an important metric in the current study, as it indicates the proportion of occupational codes which will potentially require less coding time during the occupational coding process. We define accuracy as the number of correctly predicted codes relative to the total number of predicted codes39,40.$$Accuracy\,(\%) =\frac{{Number\,of\,correct\,predictions}}{{Total\,number\,of\,predictions}} \times 100\%$$
                    (1)
                For each classification model, we computed the accuracy per code level and major occupational group.Since OPERAS autonomously codes the entries from the test set, it can be considered an (automatic) coder. Hence, OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability can be calculated using κ, which takes into account the correct prediction occurring by chance. This is defined as:$$({P}_{o}-{P}_{e})/(1-{P}_{e}),$$
                    (2)
                where Po represents the probability of overall agreement over the label assignments between the classifier and true process. Pe represents the chance agreement over the labels. This is defined as the sum of the proportion of examples assigned to a class times the proportion of true labels of that class in the dataset41.OPERAS contains a feature to automatically process predicted codes with a confidence score above a pre-defined threshold. This confidence score is obtained through XGBoost’s class probability prediction function35. As little to no time will be spent reviewing the codes above the threshold, we grouped predicted codes based on their confidence score in intervals of 5% ranging from 0% to 100% and evaluated the accuracy of each group. Here, we estimate a minimum workload reduction by correcting the automatically processed codes above a threshold for the percentage of correct codes.Human-model cross-validationWe compared OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to two occupational inter-coder reliability studies9,11. Maaz et al.9 studied the inter-coder reliability of two professional coding institutions and two in-house expert-coders in Germany. Here, the self-reported occupations of 300 students’ mother and father were coded (2 × n = 300) into ISCO-88 codes, resulting in n = 12 coder pairs. They found mean inter-coder reliability (in κ) on the first, second, third, and fourth coding level of 0.71 (range: 0.68–0.76; SD = 0.04), 0.66 (range: 0.63–0.72; SD = 0.03), 0.57 (range: 0.53–0.63; SD = 0.04), and 0.51 (range: 0.48–0.57; SD = 0.03), respectively. Similar results were found in Massing et al.11 where occupational data from a German social survey (n = 5,130) and a German field test for adult competencies (n = 4, 159) (ALLBUS and PIAAC) were separately coded into ISCO-08 by three and two agencies, respectively. This resulted in n = 4 coder pairs, where they found mean inter-coder reliability (in κ) of 0.65 (range: 0.59–0.70; SD = 0.03), 0.60 (range: 0.56–0.65; SD = 0.02), 0.53 (range: 0.46–0.59; SD = 0.03), and 0.46 (range: 0.40–0.55; SD = 0.04), on the same coding levels, respectively.Using an independent sample t-test, we compared the mean inter-coder reliability of each coder pair from these studies to OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability on all coding levels. Here, we provide a two-sided p value where the statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05. To account for the difference in coding levels and to ensure a fair comparison, we used coding levels 2-5 for the NAF classification model. Given the small sample size, we report the effect sizes in Hedges g42.Exposure assessment evaluationUsing the Formaldehyde-JEM43 and Silica-JEM44, we evaluated the exposure assessment accuracy and κ for the NAF and PCS classification models. For the ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, we performed the exposure assessment evaluation using the ALOHA-JEM45 and DOM-JEM46, respectively.We performed the evaluation for two groups, 1) all individuals and 2) exposed individuals. For the first group, we calculated the accuracy using all individuals in the test set. For the second group, we only included job episodes in the evaluation that were deemed exposed according to the gold-standard expert codes. For each JEM, we considered an episode exposed if the total exposure level is higher than 0. This was done to account for the chance level of a non-exposure assignment being substantially higher given the many occupational codes in the JEM resulting in no exposure. Furthermore, assigning an exposed individual a not-exposed status often has the largest effect on the following epidemiological study. Hence, performing an evaluation for this group will give more insight into the applicability of these classification models in real-world scenarios. The accuracy and κ in both groups are calculated using Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) respectively. Additionally, we grouped the predicted exposure assessments on the confidence score of the original code in intervals of 5% ranging from 0% to 100% and evaluated the accuracy of each group. To resemble OPERAS’ real-world usage of the automatic coding function, we used the minimum confidence score of the NAF or PCS code for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM. In the following sections, we provide additional information on the content and application of the JEMs.Formaldehyde-JEMThe Formaldehyde-JEM has been developed by “Santé Publique France” (the French National Health Surveillance Agency), as part of its “Matgéné” program to assess formaldehyde exposure in the French population43. It has been developed by a team of occupational experts through a meta-analysis of 469 scientific, medical, and technical sources. This resulted in a matrix evaluating formaldehyde exposure based on occupational history describing occupation, sector, and corresponding dates between 1950 and 2018. The occupational history was coded using the NAF2008 and PCS2003 and provides three exposure indices for each combination: the probability of exposure, the intensity of exposure, and the frequency of exposure. These respectively refer to the percentage of exposed workers, the mean exposure dose during tasks, and the percentage of working time performing tasks with exposure. Additionally, exposure indices are provided for different calendar periods to account for variations due to changes in exposure over time. As this study concerned a meta-review, no approval by an Institutional Review Board was needed.We applied the Formaldehyde-JEM to the gold standard manually coded NAF and PCS codes and OPERAS’ predictions to obtain the formaldehyde exposure for each job episode. This is obtained by multiplying the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure. We used these to calculate the exposure assessment accuracy of OPERAS’ NAF and PCS classification models. Further, after applying a JEM to manually coded occupational codes stemming from the same job activity, similar exposure levels are expected47. Here, even unequal exposure levels from these codes are still considered relevant for subsequent occupational epidemiological studies. Hence, to assess OPERAS’ performance in such real-world exposure assessment scenarios, we also performed the evaluation using a dichotomous status of ’exposed’ or ’not exposed’. Further, we measured the rank correlation between the formaldehyde exposure levels of gold-standard manual coding and OPERAS’ coding using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (τ)48.Silica-JEMThe Silica-JEM assesses the crystalline silica exposure in the French population44. Similar to the Formaldehyde-JEM, it has been developed by a team of occupational experts from “Santé Publique France”, as part of its “Matgéné” program through a meta-analysis of 469 scientific, medical, and technical sources. This resulted in a matrix evaluating exposure to crystalline silica based on occupational histories describing occupation, sector, and corresponding dates between 1947 and 2007. Similar exposure indices, namely the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure are provided for each combination of NAF2008 and PCS2003 codes for different calendar periods. As this study concerned a meta-review, no approval by an Institutional Review Board was needed.For each job episode, we applied the Silica-JEM to the gold standard manually coded and OPERAS-predicted NAF and PCS codes. To obtain the total exposure, we multiplied the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure and used this to calculate the exposure assessment accuracy. Here, we also calculated the accuracy and κ for the dichotomous ’exposed’ or ’not exposed’ status and calculated τ for the silica exposure levels.ALOHA-JEMThe ALOHA-JEM has been developed for a study assessing the association of occupational exposure and symptoms of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary ventilatory defects in a general population-based study of five areas in Spain45. Subjects completed a respiratory questionnaire on symptoms and occupation and underwent baseline spirometry. Based on expert knowledge, The JEM was developed ad hoc by two occupational experts. It contains a job axis, and an exposure estimate for 12 generic industrial exposures, namely: biological dust, mineral dust, gas fumes, VGDF (i.e., vapors, gases, dust, and fumes), all pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents, other types of solvents, and metals. Exposure estimates for each aforementioned exposure can be obtained for all ISCO-88 codes. Here, three levels of exposure can be assigned, namely 0: no exposure, 1: low exposure, and 2: high exposure. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating centers. All patients gave written informed consent.For each gold standard manually coded and OPERAS-predicted ISCO-88 code, we applied the ALOHA-JEM to obtain a level of exposure for each aforementioned exposure. Here, we deemed OPERAS’ exposure assessment correct if all exposures matched this gold standard for each job episode. Consequently, if a single exposure level is inaccurate, it will deem the entire exposure assessment incorrect. This provides a baseline measure of performance. To allow for the evaluation and comparison of single exposures, we calculated accuracy and κ individually for each exposure. Additionally, we calculated accuracy per exposure level for each exposure in the JEM.DOM-JEMThe DOM-JEM has been developed for the assessment of the inter-method reliability of retrospective exposure assessment related to occupational carcinogens46. Based on a multi-center lung cancer case-control study conducted in seven European countries, it contains estimations of nine related exposures for each ISCO-68 code. These are asbestos, chromium, DME, nickel, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), silica, animals, biological dust, and endotoxin. The DOM-JEM has been developed based on expert knowledge by three independent occupational exposure experts assigning exposure levels to each manually coded ISCO-68 code from the original study. Similar to the ALOHA-JEM, exposure levels ranging 0–2 were used, respectively signifying no exposure, low exposure, and high exposure. This study was approved by the ethics review board of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Informed consent was obtained for all participants.We applied the DOM-JEM to the gold standard manually and OPERAS-predicted ISCO-68 codes to obtain a level of exposure for each exposure in the DOM-JEM. Here, we deemed OPERAS’ exposure assessment correct if it matched the gold standard for all exposures. Similar to the evaluation conducted with the ALOHA-JEM, we determined overall accuracy and κ for each exposure and computed accuracy per exposure level.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Ethics statementSince the datasets used in the current study do not contain any information that could be used to identify a person, ethical review from an Institutional Review Board was not required.ResultsAfter data cleaning, 281,418 (Constances)23, 483,090 (Constances), 36,007 (Asialymph)24, and 12,007 (Lifework)25 entries were available to train NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, respectively. Additionally, using the Formaldehyde-JEM (NAF&PCS)43, Silica-JEM (NAF&PCS)44, ALOHA-JEM (ISCO-88)45 and DOM-JEM (ISCO-68)46 exposure assessment evaluation was conducted (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This evaluation was conducted for two groups: all individuals, providing OPERAS’ performance in real-world exposure assessment scenarios, and exposed individuals, to account for the chance level of a non-exposure assignment being substantially higher.Using the expert codes as the gold standard, we used prediction accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa (κ) as evaluation metrics (see Table 4 and Supplementary Tables S3-S6). Additionally, OPERAS provides a confidence score indicating the probability of correctness of a suggested code for each prediction. This is used to interpret the quality and usefulness of a classification model (see Fig. 2).Table 4 Per coding level (CL), the outcome categories (OC), accuracy (Acc., %), and inter-coder reliability (Cohen’s Kappa, κ) are given for the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models.Full size tableFig. 2: Confidence score distribution and accuracy of the classification performance and exposure assessment evaluation.The proportion (%) of codes in a confidence score interval is denoted by the bars in the histogram. The mean accuracy (%) and standard deviation of codes (n = 4 independent accuracy scores) in an interval are respectively represented by the dotted and vertical lines in the continuous graph. Here, the dots denote the individual accuracy of each classification model in an interval. The grey area represents the accuracy range over the intervals. Colors correspond to the different classification models. a Results of the classification performance evaluation. b Results of the exposure assessment evaluation of all individuals and c exposed individuals.Full size imageModel evaluationNAF and PCS use Constances’ input-classes occupation and sector with an accuracy per major occupational group ranging between 52.17–95.91% and 32.45–90.56%, respectively. 57.41% of the suggested NAF codes have a confidence score in the 95–100% range, with an accuracy of 97.02%. 43.11% of the suggested PCS codes are within this range, with 94.47% correctly predicted. Using the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, exposure assessment for all individuals gave 98.09% (κ = 0.84) and 98.41% (κ = 0.67) accuracy, respectively. Here, 31.28% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% minimum confidence score for both the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, with 99.32% and 99.77% accurate exposure assessment, respectively. Evaluation for the dichotomous ‘exposed’ or ‘not exposed’ status for this group gave 98.30% (κ = 0.85) and 98.51% (κ = 0.68) accurate exposure assessment for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, respectively. Kendall rank correlation for the exposure levels of the same JEMs respectively was τ = 0.85 (p < 0.01) and 0.68 (p < 0.01). For exposed individuals (6.30% and 2.58% of job episodes, respectively), exposure assessment using the same JEMs respectively gave 81.85% (κ = 0.81) and 61.82% (κ = 0.61) accuracy. 54.22% and 20.27% of these codes had a 95–100% confidence score, of which 98.59% and 93.33% had correct exposure assessment, respectively. Here, the dichotomous evaluation resulted in 85.18% and 65.54% accurate exposure assessment for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, respectively.ISCO-88 uses Asialymph’s input-classes occupation, task, employer, and product with an accuracy per major occupational group ranging between 63.53–96.11%. 21.54% of the predicted codes have a confidence score in the 95–100% range, with 94.57% accuracy. Using the ALOHA-JEM, exposure assessment for all individuals gave 75.05% accuracy (range: 83.69–98.03%) and κ = 0.70, where 21.54% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% confidence score with 97.68% correct exposure assessment. For the exposed individuals (62.53% of job episodes), exposure assessment gave 65.58% (range: 57.12–87.68%) accuracy, κ = 0.63, with 22.35% of the suggested codes having a 95–100% confidence score, where 96.88% had a correct exposure assessment.ISCO-68 uses Lifework’s job name input-class, where the accuracy per major occupational group ranged 53.58–80.67%. 20.65% of the suggested codes have a 95–100% confidence score, with a 95.38% correct prediction. Using the DOM-JEM, exposure assessment for all participants gave 84.19% accuracy (range: 91.84–98.90%) and κ = 0.59 where 20.65% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% confidence score, with 99.32% correct exposure assessment. For the exposed individuals (24.54% of job episodes), exposure assessment gave 49.97% (range: 25.00–59.71%) accuracy and κ = 0.46, with 17.98% of the suggested codes having a 95–100% confidence score and 98.11% correct exposure assessment.Human-model cross-validationHuman inter-coder reliability studies including coder pair level inter-coder reliabilities report ranges (in κ) of 0.51–0.719 and 0.46–0.6511. We compared this to OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability (see Table 4).The Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality and Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances reveal that all coding levels are normally distributed, where coding levels 3 and 4 do not have equal variances across groups. Hence, to compare OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to the aforementioned human inter-coder reliability studies we use the independent sample t-test while correcting for the inequality of variances of coding levels 3 and 4. We find that OPERAS significantly outperforms expert coders on all coding levels (see Table 5).Table 5 Per coding level (CL*) the mean, range, standard deviation (SD), and comparison (including Hedges g) of expert coders (N = 16) with OPERAS (N = 4) are given.Full size tableHuman workload reductionOPERAS improves the efficiency of the occupational coding process by enabling the automated processing of codes with a confidence score above a custom threshold. Figure 2 shows the confidence score distribution of the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models in intervals of 5%, ranging from 0% to 100%. The (mean) prediction accuracy within each interval is also displayed.An estimated minimum workload reduction can be calculated through the percentage of automatically coded job descriptions above a threshold while correcting for incorrectly coded job descriptions. Given a confidence score threshold of 95% for the NAF, which has 57.4% of the suggested codes above this threshold of which 97.0% are correct, a minimum workload reduction of 55.7% (57.41 × 0.9702) could be realized. Although the overall prediction accuracy of the PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models is lower, their accuracy within the 95–100% confidence score interval remains similar. Hence, given the same confidence score threshold, a minimum workload reduction of 40.7%, 20.4%, and 19.7% could be realized using OPERAS’ PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, respectively.DiscussionTo build robust generic classification models, we refrained from tweaking hyperparameter settings. Instead, we used default values and included generalized job descriptions from the coding indexes in the training data22. This provided us with a good baseline performance that can be expected to generalize to other datasets36. Further, OPERAS proposes a limited set of probable codes for similar job descriptions. This holds the potential for improved inter-coder reliability among expert coders utilizing OPERAS13, which can contribute to the occupational coding process’ robustness. Moreover, OPERAS’ adaptable automatic coding can enable a substantial workload reduction for a wide range of applications. For example, the default 95% confidence score threshold could be lowered to increase workload reduction for applications that are tolerant to less accurate codes or solely require high accuracy on lower coding levels.Differences in classification performance can be attributed to the difference in available job descriptions per classification model. The NAF and PCS were respectively trained with 281,418 and 483,090 entries, whereas the ISCO-88 and ISCO-68 models were trained with respectively 36,007 and 12,007 entries. Additionally, the difference in combined job description length between datasets could also have contributed to the difference in classification performance. Longer job descriptions decrease coding reliability if the additional information does not directly correspond to the definition of the occupational code12. This is due to an increase in potential occupational codes that can be assigned to a job description. In classification model training, the information increases variance within outcome categories, resulting in decreased classification performance49. The accuracy of OPERAS’ classification models shows a comparable non-monotonic downward trend with an increase in description length. However, the very small number of entries for the larger description lengths of the used input classes (see Table 3) warrants being careful with definitive conclusions on the association between prediction accuracy and description length.The difference in exposure assessment performance could be attributed to the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM containing specific occupational exposures that are relatively rare in the general population. Hence, the chance of discordant codes resulting in a non-exposed status is relatively high50. When the prevalence of exposed individuals increases, or when only exposed individuals are considered in the comparison, inter-rater reliability tends to decrease (see Fig. 2b, c). However, a moderate increase in reliability can be observed during the dichotomous evaluation for exposed individuals of the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM. The correlation coefficients for all exposure levels also show strong and moderate correlation for respectively the same JEMs. However, they are not near perfect as evidenced by their inter-rater reliability for all individuals. Hence, to ensure reliable health outcomes it is crucial to take these factors into account during (semi-automatic) occupational coding47,50.The class imbalance in current datasets presents a substantial challenge for the development and deployment of the classification models. This is due to the fact that ML models tend to over-classify the majority class, thereby compromising the classification performance of minority classes32. This is a large issue, particularly in the current domain where the misclassification of minority classes can have critical implications on health outcomes. Traditional methods designed to tackle this issue, such as SMOTE, are in this case inadequate as the representation of the minority class in the datasets is excessively low33,51. As such, it is important that alternative data augmentation techniques are developed that can effectively enhance the representation of minority classes in datasets where the representation of the minority class is (close to) one. This will contribute to a more balanced and accurate performance of ML models, thereby increasing their generalizability and applicability in critical domains.OPERAS’ classification models are trained using one occupational dataset each. However, job description characteristics often differ between occupational datasets, possibly resulting in a lower out-of-distribution performance11,20. Additionally, OPERAS has been trained and tested on expert-coded occupational data coded on the least aggregated level. Although OPERAS’ data pre-processing pipeline can manage and produce predictions for ambiguous or incomplete data, its performance in such scenarios remains untested. Hence, to assess the generalizability of OPERAS’ classification models, its evaluation could be extended using external validation sets. To further improve the classification model performances, other classification techniques, hyper-parameter settings, and the use of additional datasets could be considered52. Additionally, OPERAS’ human-model cross-validation is currently based on external occupational inter-coder reliability studies containing different occupational characteristics compared to the current ones9,11,23,24,25. Hence, to gain more insight into OPERAS’ performance against expert-coders, additional cross-validations using the same underlying datasets could be performed.With OPERAS, a decision support system for epidemiological job coding of free-text job descriptions is introduced, which outperforms both expert coders9,11 and state-of-the-art coding tools18,53. This is achieved through the ML-based classification models for four (inter)national classification systems. OPERAS’ codes are accompanied by confidence scores that can be used by the expert coder to partially automate the coding process with accurate exposure assessment, resulting in a substantial workload reduction. Additional insight into OPERAS’ classification performance can be gained through the use of external data sets and comparisons with expert coders using the same underlying data. As such, OPERAS supports custom occupational coding, enabling large-scale occupational health research in an efficient, effective, accurate, and stable manner.

Although several automatic coding tools have been developed, accurate exposure assessment is only feasible with human intervention. We developed OPERAS, a customizable decision support system for epidemiological job coding. Using 812,522 entries, we developed and tested classification models for the Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles (PCS)2003, Nomenclature d’Activités Française (NAF)2008, International Standard Classifications of Occupation (ISCO)-88, and ISCO-68. Each code comes with an estimated correctness measure to identify instances potentially requiring expert review. Here, OPERAS’ decision support enables an increase in efficiency and accuracy of the coding process through code suggestions. Using the Formaldehyde, Silica, ALOHA, and DOM job-exposure matrices, we assessed the classification models’ exposure assessment accuracy. We show that, using expert-coded job descriptions as gold standard, OPERAS realized a 0.66–0.84, 0.62–0.81, 0.60–0.79, and 0.57–0.78 inter-coder reliability (in Cohen’s Kappa) on the first, second, third, and fourth coding levels, respectively. These exceed the respective inter-coder reliability of expert coders ranging 0.59–0.76, 0.56–0.71, 0.46–0.63, 0.40–0.56 on the same levels, enabling a 75.0–98.4% exposure assessment accuracy and an estimated 19.7–55.7% minimum workload reduction. OPERAS secures a high degree of accuracy in occupational classification and exposure assessment of free-text job descriptions, substantially reducing workload. As such, OPERAS significantly outperforms both expert coders and other current coding tools. This enables large-scale, efficient, and effective exposure assessment securing healthy work conditions. Work can expose us to health risks, such as asbestos and constant noise. To study these risks, job descriptions are collected and classified by experts to standard codes. This is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expert knowledge. To improve this coding, we created computer code based on Artificial Intelligence that can both automate this process and suggest codes to experts, who can then check and change it manually if needed. Our system outperforms both expert coders and other available tools. This system could make studying occupational health risks more efficient and accurate, resulting in safer work environments. Langezaal, van den Broek, et al. develop a decision support system for epidemiological job coding. This system is used for occupational classification and exposure assessment of job descriptions and performs better than both expert coders and alternative currently available tools.', 'datePublished': '2023-11-04T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2023-11-04T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '11', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-023-00397-4', 'keywords': ['Epidemiology', 'Population screening', 'Medicine/Public Health', 'general'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-023-00397-4/MediaObjects/43856_2023_397_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-023-00397-4/MediaObjects/43856_2023_397_Fig2_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Communications Medicine', 'issn': ['2730-664X'], 'volumeNumber': '3', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Mathijs A.

But how do they actually integrate AI with their workforce to achieve good business outcomes?...moreLeer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSaveBuy CopiesPrintRight now, the corporate world is in the throes of a generative AI hype cycle. Leaders have been inundated with speculation about the technology’s potential to transform work. However, this raises an entirely new sets of problems for leaders: They now understand that the future will involve humans working with AI and feel immense pressure to “do something” to implement AI solutions. But how do they actually integrate AI with their workforce to achieve good business outcomes?
Since the launch of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in November 2022, and the tsunami of other applications that have followed, we have conducted dozens of in-depth CEO interviews across industry sectors. Our goal was to identify how generative AI has changed the practices of leading firms and extract lessons for success.
Our recent interviews reveal a marked shift in focus from earlier studies — both our own and those of other researchers. While our own earlier interviews showed the importance of a human-focused culture, our recent interviews have signaled a definitive shift toward development of individual human competencies. The current hype cycle is around AI capability, digital skills, and the need for organizational change management, but our current finding reveals the importance of specific human capabilities to the successful use of AI.
In fact, it is the human ability to understand context — which AI tools lack — that necessitates the need for greater human skills. This is an important insight that can help leaders understand the necessary human elements that drive an organization’s successful use of AI.
The Skills Companies Really Need

We observed two categories of human skills that leaders see as critical — and which organizations are actually teaching to their employees. First are effective interpersonal skills, such as basic conflict resolution, communication, skills of disconnecting from emotions, and even mindfulness practices. Second is domain expertise, with a focus on preserving that knowledge among experienced talent and developing it among young inexperienced workers.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
While digital literacy was viewed as a given by the leaders we spoke to, interpersonal skills such as the ability to effectively communicate, meaningfully engage with others, and garner team cooperation were not. Our interviews reveal that while technical skills get more press, it is these uniquely human skills that companies need — and find to be in short supply in today’s marketplace. Peter Cameron, CEO of Lenox Group, underscored that workplace success depends on the ability to cultivate personal relationships, saying that, “Nothing replaces long-term relationships that are personal — and the longer the relationship the better.” Maria Villablanca, co-founder and CEO of Future Insight Network, pointed to specific qualities to look for in talent: “People that can be creative and innovative in the way they find solutions — problem solvers.” Broader research backs this up: A study of 1,700 global companies found that companies that excelled on human capital metrics were four times as likely to have superior financial performance.
One of the greatest values of experienced workers is domain expertise — deep knowledge of one’s environment. As AI takes over more tasks, there is a significant danger of atrophy of skills and loss of this kind of knowledge. John Sicard, president and CEO of the supply-chain-management company Kinaxis, pointed out that domain knowledge is essential to helping a business navigate through turbulent times. He gave the analogy that when an airplane experiences anything unusual, the autopilot is immediately turned off and pilots take control — at which point the pilots need to know what to do. Developing and maintaining these skills is essential.
Further, generative AI is shown to be more useful as a co-pilot for senior employees that can sift through AI “hallucinations” — inaccurate information presented as fact — and take the output as an aid. Inexperienced employees, however, may not be discerning enough and need a path to develop this knowledge. The sentiment was echoed by Ted English, former CEO of TJX Companies and current executive chairman of Bob’s Discount Furniture, who told us leadership requires “a lot of instinct, experience, and knowledge. Some of it you can’t get from a machine. Technology reinforces and allows you to make a more confident decision.”
While much has been written on the need to combine humans with AI, the real issue is how to implement this in practice. Here’s what companies need to do.
More Than Just Combining Humans and AI 
In 2020 we published our Four I framework for using AI that calls for creating a human-centric organization. As a result of our current findings, we have modified the descriptors of our original framework, making it more specific in its mandates. This offers a direct comparison — and shift — between the use of AI in the post pandemic business environment.
The first layer of the framework is intentionality. In this context, we mean that a company’s business model should be purposefully designed around AI capability, rather just applying AI to existing processes. Spencer Fung, president and CEO of Li & Fung, a global supply-chain and logistics company, gave us an analogy: “Companies acquiring AI without a new business model is like a company digitizing a horse and carriage — while the competition has created a digital automobile.” He offered the clothing company Shein as an exemplar: a company that became a fast-fashion industry leader by using a business model centered around a seamless e-commerce platform leveraging a data-driven approach.
Next comes integration across all functions of the enterprise, with horizontal communication and AI as the enabling layer — in other words, getting rid of silos. For example, ekaterra, the world’s largest tea company, invested in a unifying AI platform to create complete horizontal connectivity, integration, and real-time visibility.
The real challenge, however, is implementation. Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion, has written that winning performance does not come from combining the best technology with the best people — but from the best process of combining. To achieve this, talent must be familiar with AI capabilities and know how best to utilize them.
However, AI is an evolving technology, and that necessitates a business add slack to the system to allow opportunity for learning. One of the authors learned this in an earlier project with Lockheed Martin on the F-22 Raptor, where downtime was needed for workers to become familiar with new tools and technologies. With an evolving technology new learning may even cause a temporary loss of productivity, but that loss will ultimately be more than made up — it’s the proverbial, “putting down an axe to learn how to use a chain saw.”
Implementation also requires differentiation between “deep work” and “shallow work,” with the latter assigned to AI. Deep work, however, requires worker training for developing talent literacies. For example, one company builds in 90-minute sessions as part of the regular work week.
The last part of the framework is indication, or performance measurement. Forget traditional performance measures or the inane debate on working from office or home. Look to develop novel metrics tied directly to purposeful intentionality of your business model using generative AI. Organizations from Google to Schneider Electric are now using AI to redefine what to measure, how to measure, and improve performance.
Humans With Enhanced Skills “In the Loop”
Competitive advantage cannot be achieved without humans in the loop. Rushing to replace talent with AI is a huge mistake.
Why?
First, AI is copyable. What is not copyable is a unique business model, processes, and thoughtful integration of humans.
Second, AI is based on historical data that may not hold true in a volatile global business environment. Kinaxis’s Sicard underscored that “every math-based model collapsed when the pandemic hit. None of the assumptive parameters could be trusted. It is not an indictment on the science … but an indictment on the believe that those technologies eliminate the need to be agile.” Business decisions are not made in a vacuum separate from issues of labor, inflation, geopolitics — and this is where domain expertise of people is essential. In our executive interviews we repeatedly heard that the new competitive advantage is “the human mind,” “human critical thinking,” and “human decision intelligence.”
Third, AI is subject to hallucination and “drift,” where output is either fabricated by the AI or simply inaccurate. Handing the reins over to AI poses great risks in terms of inaccurate decision making and even legal liability.
AI is still a tool. The centerpiece are people, but with enhanced human literacies, a well-thought-out business model, and superb processes that integrate humans with their AI co-pilots.Read more on Talent management or related topics Technology and analytics and AI and machine learningNSNada R.

Companies are using artificial intelligence to determine who to hire and fire. It is simultaneously being deployed in various ways to improve recruitment and retention. This includes résumé screenings, candidate matching, interview schedules, probability analysis, performance evaluations and layoff decisions.


AI screens résumés and identifies the most qualified candidates for a job, matches candidates with job openings based on their skills, experience and preferences, schedules interviews and reduces the time it takes to fill open positions.

With predictive analytics, AI determines which employees are most likely to leave a company. Employers can use this insight to course-correct and have transparent conversations about how they can alleviate the risk of voluntary turnover. It also evaluates employee performance and identifies areas for improvement.

PROMOTED
Most concerningly, some companies are using AI to make layoff decisions, leveraging the data to determine the workers who are the poor performers. In a 2023 Capterra survey of 300 human resources leaders, 98% of surveyed HR executives said they plan to employ software and algorithms to reduce labor costs.

Recruiting And Hiring With AI
The role of recruiters is to find the best, most suitable applicants for the job efficiently, which is not easy. Search professionals must allocate many hours to sourcing qualified people for the position. This involves elaborate Boolean searches, sending dozens of emails, texting and calling prospective candidates.

AI-powered recruiting tools offer advantages over traditional recruiting methods, including analyzing large amounts of data, automating the recruitment process, reducing bias, helping companies find and hire passive candidates who may not be actively looking for a job and improving employee retention.

LinkedIn, the go-to site for job seekers and networking, plans to leverage generative AI technology with its insights of more than 950 million professionals, 63 million companies and 40,000 skills on the platform.
Over the next year, LinkedIn will roll out Recruiter 2024 to enable recruiters and talent acquisition professionals to find on-target candidates for their jobs faster.
The feature will offer a clean interface with a rectangular box in which recruiters and talent leaders can use natural language to express their hiring goals in their own words. For example, a hiring professional would write, “I’m searching for a software engineer with 10 years of experience,” then add specific skills, background and experiences pertinent to the role. AI combined with LinkedIn’s massive data can produce the candidates the employer desperately seeks.
Getting Fired By AI
In 2019, the Verge reported that Amazon used an AI system to monitor and automatically fire hundreds of fulfillment center workers for failing to meet productivity quotas.
A signed letter by Amazon’s attorney disclosed, “Amazon’s system tracks the rate of each individual associate’s productivity and automatically generates any warnings or terminations regarding quality or productivity without input from supervisors.”
At the time of the reporting, a company spokesperson contested the cold firings:
""It is absolutely not true that employees are terminated through an automatic system. We would never dismiss an employee without first ensuring that they had received our fullest support, including dedicated coaching to help them improve and additional training. Since we’re a company that continues to grow, it’s our business objective to ensure long-term career development opportunities for our employees. Similar to many companies, we have performance expectations regardless of whether they are corporate or fulfillment center employees. We support people who do not perform to the levels expected of them with dedicated coaching to help them improve and be successful in their career at Amazon.""
According to the Washington Post, former employees at Google began to wonder if AI played a role in the 12,000 job cuts the company made this year, since HR uses technology to analyze employee data that recommends who to interview, hire and retain.
In a Discord post, an ex-Googler theorized the company may have used a “mindless algorithm carefully designed to not violate any laws.” However, Google denied this claim and said there was “no algorithm involved” in its layoff selection.
This month, an Amsterdam court ruled that Uber had failed to comply with the European Union’s algorithmic transparency requirements, which prohibits using AI or similar technology from being the sole decision-maker on actions that have “legal or other significant effects” on people. Two drivers in the U.K. and one from Portugal sought legal action against the rideshare company for their alleged “robo-firings.”
Uber was required to provide transparency in how it used automation to make decisions to workers affected by them, but the company argued that in doing so, it’d be compromising trade secrets.
In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, a company spokesperson said:
“At the time when these drivers’ accounts were flagged, they were reviewed by our Trust and Safety Teams, who are specially trained to spot the types of behavior that could potentially impact rider safety. The Court confirmed that the review process was carried out by our human teams, which is standard practice when our systems spot potentially fraudulent behavior.”

Artificial intelligence is changing the world – and one of the main areas it will affect in the short-to-medium term is the workforce. 
AI algorithms imitate real-world systems. The more repetitive a system is, the easier it is for AI to replace it. That’s why jobs in customer service, retail and clerical roles are regularly named as being the most at risk.
That doesn’t mean other jobs won’t be affected. The latest advances in AI have shown all kinds of creative work and white-collar professions stand to be impacted to various degrees. 
However, there’s one important point that’s usually not addressed in discussions about AI’s impact on jobs. That is: where you work may be as important as what you do. 
Current trends and projections suggest people in developing countries, where a higher proportion of jobs involve repetitive or manual tasks, will be the first and most affected.

      The hidden cost of the AI boom: social and environmental exploitation




Privileged by geography
According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, emerging technologies and digitalisation are among the biggest driving factors for job displacement. The report states:

The majority of fastest declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with bank tellers and related clerks, postal service clerks, cashiers and ticket clerks, and data entry clerks expected to decline fastest.

Let’s take an office clerk as an example, whose responsibilities include answering phones, taking messages and scheduling appointments. We now have access to AI tools that can perform all these tasks. 
They can also work non-stop, for free (or a fraction of the price), without being affected by personal problems, and without having to mentally strain to optimise their workflow. Of course they’re going to be attractive to employers!
At first glance, you might assume an office clerk living in a developed country is more likely to lose their job than their counterpart in a developing country, since the former seems more likely to implement new AI tools. 
In reality, however, it’s expected more people in developing countries will lose their jobs. The success of each nation will depend on how well it can adapt to the displacement of its workforce.
In 2009, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union created the information and communication technologies (ICT) development index to benchmark and compare ICT performance within and across countries.
This index measures, among other things:

the level and evolution over time of information and communication technologies in different countries 
how each country’s experience compares to others’
the extent to which a country can develop and use these technologies to boost its own growth and development in the context of the capabilities and skills available.

In other words, a country’s score on this index can be correlated with how well it adapts to emerging technologies such as AI. 
Unsurprisingly, developed countries rank higher than the rest of the world. In 2012, the top five ranking countries were the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. The bottom five were Eritrea, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger.



People in developing nations won’t have as many resources to adapt to disruption caused by increasing AI use.

Wealth and opportunity makes a difference
The World Bank has divided the world by income and region, showing developing countries are among the lowest earners. 
Generally speaking, employing people is much easier in developing countries, due to lower wages, tighter competition and less regulation to support employees.
The World Bank estimates about 84% of the world’s working-age population lives in developing countries. Similarly, a 2008 report from the International Labour Organisation estimated 73% of all the world’s workers lived in developing countries, while only 14% lived in advanced industrial countries.
That means whatever clerical jobs aren’t taken by AI in developing countries will become more competitive than most people can handle. As World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos wrote in 2016, in reference to the digital revolution: 

[…] the jobs where workers are likely to lose out are disproportionally held by the least educated and the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. As a result, the biggest risk from the digital revolution is not massive unemployment, but widening income inequality.

These factors will result in an employer-ruled ecosystem in developing countries. These countries have both a higher occurrence of jobs that can be replaced or displaced (such as call centre jobs), and less of the money and skills needed to implement AI tools effectively. 
The cost and affordability of AI programs and algorithms will also speed up this process in certain regions. 
Critical thinking remains important
Experts note AI will create many employment opportunities, including jobs that don’t yet exist. It’s just that not all countries will be well-equipped to make the transition when the time comes. 
The Future of Jobs report says “analytical thinking and creative thinking remain the most important skills for workers”. So if you’re worried about keeping your job in the future, it’s worth acquiring more of these skills.
Beyond that, you might stop and consider how the place you live could play a role in whether you’ll have work in the future – and if you happen to live in a wealthy, developed country, consider yourself lucky.

Some tech executives and political leaders have warned the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to the world if not controlled, sparking a race by governments and international institutions to design safeguards and regulation.
In a first for Western efforts to manage its safe development, a Chinese vice-minister joined US and EU leaders and tech bosses such as Elon Musk and ChatGPT’s Sam Altman at Bletchley Park, home of Britain’s World War Two codebreakers.
More than 25 countries present, including the US and China, as well as the EU, signed a “Bletchley Declaration” saying countries needed to work together and establish a common approach on oversight.
Chinese scientists create ‘faster, more energy efficient’ AI chip
The declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.
Wu Zhaohui, China’s Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, told the opening session of the two-day summit that Beijing was ready to increase collaboration on AI safety to help build an international “governance framework”.
“Countries regardless of their size and scale have equal rights to develop and use AI,” he said.
Fears about the impact AI could have on economies and society took off in November last year when Microsoft-backed start-up OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public.
Using natural language processing tools to create humanlike dialogue, it has stoked fears, including among some AI pioneers, that machines could in time achieve greater intelligence than humans, leading to unlimited, unintended consequences.
Governments and officials are now trying to chart a way forward alongside AI companies which fear being weighed down by regulation before the technology reaches its full potential.

“I don’t know what necessarily the fair rules are, but you’ve got to start with insight before you do oversight,” Musk told reporters, adding that a “third-party referee” could be used to sound the alarm when risks develop.
While the EU has focused its AI oversight on data privacy and surveillance and their potential impact on human rights, the British summit is looking at so-called existential risks from highly capable general-purpose models called “frontier AI”.
Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of AI research lab Google Deepmind, told reporters he did not think current AI frontier models posed any “significant catastrophic harms”, but said it made sense to plan ahead as the industry trains ever larger models.

The summit is the brainchild of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who wants to carve out a post-Brexit role for his country as an intermediary between the economic blocs of the United States, China and the EU.
British digital minister Michelle Donelan said it was an achievement just to get so many key players in one room. She announced two further AI Safety Summits, one to be held in South Korea in six months and another in France six months after that.
“For the first time, we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risk around frontier AI,” Donelan told reporters.
Just as tech companies compete for dominance in AI, governments are jostling to lead the way on regulation.
China is a key participant at the summit, given the country’s role in developing AI. But some British lawmakers have questioned whether it should be there given the low level of trust between Beijing, Washington and many European capitals when it comes to Chinese involvement in technology.
The US government made clear on the eve of the summit that the call to Beijing had very much come from Britain, with its Ambassador to London, Jane Hartley, telling Reuters: “This is the UK invitation, this is not the US”.
US Vice-President Kamala Harris’ decision to give a speech in London on Wednesday about her government’s response to AI, and hold some meetings with attendees away from the summit, meaning they may have to leave early, also raised some eyebrows.
Sachin Dev Duggal, founder of London-based AI firm Builder.ai, said it risked undermining the event’s core focus, while some lawmakers from Sunak’s Conservative Party suggested Washington was trying to overshadow his summit.
British officials denied that, saying they wanted as many voices as possible.

Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 8 months oldNo utopia: experts question Elon Musk’s vision of world without workThis article is more than 8 months oldUsing AI to create less and better work would benefit society but getting rid of it altogether would be unproductive, experts sayCaroline DaviesFri 3 Nov 2023 13.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Nov 2023 12.49 EDTShareOscar Wilde thought hard work “the refuge” of those with nothing better to do while he envisaged a society of “cultivated leisure” as machines performed the necessary and unpleasant tasks.Karl Marx’s dream was of a society regulated general production that allowed liberated workers to “hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner” without the drudgery of being tied to one job.The 19th-century socialist activist William Morris advocated for more pleasurable work, believing that once the profit motive of the factory had been abolished, less necessary labour would led to a four-hour day.So Elon Musk’s suggestion to Rishi Sunak that society could reach a point where “no job is needed” and “you can do a job if you want a job … but the AI will do everything” revives a debate on the issue of how we work that has long been discussed.Yet a world without work, experts question, may be more dystopian than utopian.“This is an old, old story that never actually happens,” said Tom Hodgkinson, co-founder of the Idler magazine, which for three decades has been a platform to examine issues surrounding work and leisure.“There was a poem in ancient Greece saying, ‘Isn’t it wonderful that we have invented the watermill so that we no longer have to grind our corn? The women can sit around doing nothing all day from now on.’ It’s that kind of recurrent idea.“People like Bertrand Russell were talking about this in the 30s. What would we do without work? One view is people wouldn’t know what to do because people are more or less slavish. That they would just sit around watching daytime TV or porn all day.”In fact, given more free time, such as on furlough during Covid, “they start living better”, Hodgkinson said. “They are starting neighbourhood groups, doing more gardening, doing up the house, spending more time with family, doing creative things, playing music, writing poetry, all the things that are part of what I would call a good life.”Despite that, he said, studies had shown that paid work was beneficial for mental health, for status and identity.“I think we need to do some sort of work. We should be moving towards a shorter working week, and more leisure-filled society,” Hodgkinson said, adding that a radical overhaul of our economic and education models would be needed to eliminate work on the scale that Musk predicted.One significant body of research in 2019, led by Brendan Burchell, professor in social sciences and a former president of Magdalene College, Cambridge, established that eight hours of paid employment a week was optimal in terms of benefit in mental health, and that no extra benefit was subsequently accrued.Setting aside the “awful jobs that really screw you up”, Burchell said, “your average job is good for you” in terms of social interaction, working collectively, giving structure and sense of identity.A world without work “is a terrible idea of what society would look like for all sorts of reasons, as well as people’s mental health”, he said.The labour market, as a way of distributing money around the economy, would have to be transformed, as would the education system, “to teach people how to fill their days, by writing poetry or going fishing or whatever, instead of going to the factory or the office”, Burchell continued.Shifting to shorter working hours was shown to have “massive benefits for people”, said Burchell, but he added: “If we move to a society where lots of people are completely excluded from the labour market, then I get very worried that’s going to be a very dystopian future.”In his book Making Light Work: An End to Toil in the 21st Century, David Spencer, professor of economics at the University of Leeds, also makes the case for less work, but not its elimination. “It would leave us bereft potentially of things that we value in work,” he said, citing communal enterprise, personal relationships and the development of skillsets.So in essence, we would be a poorer, sadder, less skilled society. “Yes, there will be some loss through loss of work,” Spencer said. “I realise not all work is good. So we ought to automate drudgery, seek to use AI to reduce the pain of work, and therefore leave work which is good.”He draws from Morris, who talked about bringing joy to work. “Skilful work is good work and it has a role in the creation of a better society,” said Spencer. “We ought to use technology to create less and better work. In that sense, the future can be really positive.This was, he added, the future imagined by “Oscar Wilde, William Morris, and a lot of utopian positive thinking, where technology makes work lighter. It’s not eliminating work – it’s bringing light to work.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris for Democratic nomination – reportBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in face",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Copilot has been built to ""enhance your creativity and productivity,"" Microsoft says, and it works in a similar way to Bing's chatbot—capable of coming up with everything from travel advice to an original poem.
To get Copilot in Windows 11, make sure you're running the very latest version of the operating system: Head to Windows Update in Settings to check (you might need to turn on the Get the latest updates as soon as they're available toggle switch).
By default, you should see a Copilot button on the taskbar, which you can click to launch it (head to Personalization then Taskbar in Settings if you want to change this). You can also launch Copilot with the Win+C keyboard shortcut, or via the Start menu.
Text and Image Generation
If you're completely new to generative AI, just dive in and try something: You can tell Copilot to compose a short poem, an introduction to a cover letter, or text for an email to a coworker. When you start a new chat, you'll see you can choose between More Creative, More Balanced, and More Precise conversation styles, just like Bing Chat on the web—so you can tweak how imaginative Copilot gets with its responses.
You're not just limited to generating text though, because you can ask Copilot questions as well. Thanks to its links to Bing and the web, it can tell you about the must-see sights in a particular place, give you cooking and recipe tips, or offer advice on the best ways to fix a DIY problem around the home. You'll see that the responses come with links to where the information has been sourced from online.
After each response from Copilot, you'll be given a list of suggested ways to continue the conversation, or you can come up with your own follow-up questions. If you want to start over again, click the New topic button (the blue bubble) at the bottom. Meanwhile, hover over any Copilot output with the cursor and you'll see you can copy the text (as well as give feedback on how good the response was).
Copilot can code, too. Tell it what you want your code to do, and which language you want it in, and you'll get formatted code back in return that you can copy and paste elsewhere. As with everything else that the AI bot does, you can ask for edits and tweaks to the original response, without having to start again from scratch.
Thanks to Dall-E integration, Copilot is able to generate images as well. Tell it what you want a picture of, and in what style, and after a few moments you'll get a choice of four options—together with follow-up ideas you can use to change the output (you might want to take something out of the scene or add something in, for example, or change some of the colors used).
Click on any image to see it full size and download it—these links actually open up on the web, showing how closely Copilot is currently linked to Bing Chat. There's also an Add an image button in the input box, which you can use to upload pictures: Copilot can tell you about what's in the picture, or use it as the basis of a new image.
Windows 11 Functions
Everything we've talked about so far matches what Bing Chat can already do on the web, and it's really the integration with the Windows 11 operating system itself that sets Copilot apart. This is also the functionality that's newest and still under construction—bear in mind that you're using an early preview version of Copilot.
One basic task that Copilot is able to do is open up programs for you—just type ""open"" followed by the app name, and your bidding is done (you will see a confirmation dialog first, which seems somewhat redundant). Click on the microphone button in the input box, and you can speak out your requests instead, which you might find easier.
As well as opening the apps in question, Copilot can also tell you how to use them or help with troubleshooting problems. A few suggestions along these lines will pop up every time you open up a program in Windows 11, so it can be a useful way of exploring what a particular software tool can do for you.
A variety of Windows 11 commands work in Copilot as well: Try ""mute volume"" for example, though it seems a rather convoluted way of doing it compared with just tapping an icon or pressing a button on your keyboard. Again, you'll get a prompt dialog on screen, to make sure the AI bot is exactly sure about what it is you want to do.
Other commands that work include “turn on do not disturb” and “turn on dark mode,” which both save you a trip through the Settings screens. Speaking of Settings, you can ask Copilot to bring up a particular options screen—relating to Wi-Fi, for example, or changing the configuration of the Start menu—and it'll appear in a second or two (together with related instructions about how to use it).
What Copilot can't do yet is much inside your programs—even the ones developed by Microsoft. For it to be a truly useful digital AI assistant, it would be helpful for it to be able to view and manipulate elements inside apps: Right now, this only works with Edge, and you can enable this by clicking the three dots (top right), then Settings, and turning on the Let Copilot in Windows use Microsoft Edge content toggle switch.",,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Gear', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/gear/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Microsoft', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/microsoft/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Here’s Everything You Can Do With Copilot, the Generative AI Assistant on Windows 11'}]",,,https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-windows-11-copilot-generative-ai-assistant-tips/,tags,,"David NieldGearNov 5, 2023 7:00 AMHere’s Everything You Can Do With Copilot, the Generative AI Assistant on Windows 11Microsoft’s operating system just got supercharged with Bing and Dall-E integrations, and more.Illustration: Jorg Greuel/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveDespite plenty of misgivings, artificial intelligence—and in particular, generative AI that produces text and images from prompts—continues to be pushed into the hardware and software we use every day.Microsoft has been active in the space, adding AI chatbot capabilities to its Bing search engine earlier this year, and it's now previewing an early version of its new Copilot AI assistant in Windows 11.Copilot has been built to ""enhance your creativity and productivity,"" Microsoft says, and it works in a similar way to Bing's chatbot—capable of coming up with everything from travel advice to an original poem.Featured VideoWhy Vintage Tech Is So Valuable To CollectorsTo get Copilot in Windows 11, make sure you're running the very latest version of the operating system: Head to Windows Update in Settings to check (you might need to turn on the Get the latest updates as soon as they're available toggle switch).By default, you should see a Copilot button on the taskbar, which you can click to launch it (head to Personalization then Taskbar in Settings if you want to change this).

A few suggestions along these lines will pop up every time you open up a program in Windows 11, so it can be a useful way of exploring what a particular software tool can do for you.A variety of Windows 11 commands work in Copilot as well: Try ""mute volume"" for example, though it seems a rather convoluted way of doing it compared with just tapping an icon or pressing a button on your keyboard. Again, you'll get a prompt dialog on screen, to make sure the AI bot is exactly sure about what it is you want to do.Various Windows 11 settings and features are within Copilot's reach.
Microsoft via David NieldOther commands that work include “turn on do not disturb” and “turn on dark mode,” which both save you a trip through the Settings screens. Speaking of Settings, you can ask Copilot to bring up a particular options screen—relating to Wi-Fi, for example, or changing the configuration of the Start menu—and it'll appear in a second or two (together with related instructions about how to use it).What Copilot can't do yet is much inside your programs—even the ones developed by Microsoft. For it to be a truly useful digital AI assistant, it would be helpful for it to be able to view and manipulate elements inside apps: Right now, this only works with Edge, and you can enable this by clicking the three dots (top right), then Settings, and turning on the Let Copilot in Windows use Microsoft Edge content toggle switch.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterGadget LabThe latest news, expert guides, and in-depth reviews from WIRED's Gear team.

AI chatbots show an impressive ability to generate clear and coherent text from simple natural-language prompts. But what's going on behind the scenes?







In the following excerpt from How AI Works: From Sorcery to Science, a recent release from No Starch Press, author and programmer Ronald Kneusel breaks down the components of large language models (LLMs), which power popular AI chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Bard. Kneusel explains how LLMs use transformer neural networks -- a type of AI architecture introduced in 2017 -- to process input text, enabling them to identify complex relationships and patterns in massive data sets.
Check out the rest of How AI Works for a deep dive into the history and inner workings of AI that doesn't involve extensive math or programming. For more from Kneusel, read his interview with TechTarget Editorial, where he discusses the generative AI boom, including LLMs' benefits and limitations and the importance of alignment.
Large language models are impressive and powerful. So how do they work? Let's take a shot at an answer.
I'll begin at the end, with a few comments from the conclusion of the ""Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence"" paper mentioned earlier:
How does [GPT-4] reason, plan, and create? Why does it exhibit such general and flexible intelligence when it is at its core merely the combination of simple algorithmic components -- gradient descent and large-scale transformers with extremely large amounts of data? These questions are part of the mystery and fascination of LLMs, which challenge our understanding of learning and cognition, fuel our curiosity, and motivate deeper research.

That quote contains questions that currently lack convincing answers. Simply put, researchers don't know why large language models like GPT-4 do what they do. There are certainly hypotheses in search of evidence and proof, but as I write this, no proven theories are available. Therefore, we can discuss only the what, as in what a large language model entails, and not the how of its behavior.
Large language models use a new class of neural network, the transformer, so we'll begin there. (GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer.) The transformer architecture appeared in the literature in 2017, with the influential paper ""Attention Is All You Need"" by Google researchers Ashish Vaswani et al. The paper had been cited over 70,000 times as of March 2023.
Traditionally, models that process sequences (such as sentences) used recurrent neural networks, which pass their output back in as input along with the next input of the sequence. This is the logical model for processing text because the network can incorporate the notion of memory via the output fed back in with the next token. Indeed, early deep learning translation systems used recurrent networks. However, recurrent networks have small memories and are challenging to train, which limits their applicability.
Transformer networks utilize a different approach: they accept the entire input at once and process it in parallel. Transformer networks typically include an encoder and a decoder. The encoder learns representations and associations between the parts of the input (think sentences), while the decoder uses the learned associations to produce output (think more sentences).
Large language models like GPT dispense with the encoder and instead learn the necessary representation in an unsupervised way using an enormous text dataset. After pretraining, the decoder part of the transformer model generates text in response to the input prompt.
The input to a model like GPT-4 is a sequence of text made up of words. The model splits this into units called tokens. A token might be a word, a part of a word, or even an individual character. Pretraining aims to map tokens to a multidimensional embedding space, which it does by associating each token with a vector that can be thought of as a point in that space.

Ronald Kneusel/No Starch Press

Figure 7-3: Context encoding in the embedding space





The learned mapping from tokens to vectors captures complex relationships between the tokens so that tokens with similar meanings are nearer to each other than tokens with dissimilar meanings. For example, as shown in Figure 7-3, after pretraining, the mapping (context encoding) will place ""dog"" closer to ""fox"" than to ""can opener."" The embedding space has many dimensions, not the mere two of Figure 7-3, but the effect is the same.
The context encoding is learned during pretraining by forcing the model to predict the next token given all previous tokens in an input. In effect, if the input is ""roses are red,"" then during the pretraining process the model will be asked to predict the next token after ""roses are."" If the predicted token isn't ""red,"" the model will use the loss function and backpropagation to update its weights, thereby taking a gradient descent step after suitable averaging of the error over a minibatch. For all their abilities, large language models are trained the same way as other neural networks.
Pretraining enables the model to learn language, including grammar and syntax, and seemingly to acquire enough knowledge about the world to allow the emergent abilities that have turned the world of AI on its head.
The decoder step takes the input prompt and produces output token after output token until a unique stop token is generated. Because so much of language and the way the world works was learned during pretraining, the decoder step has the side effect of producing extraordinary output even though the decoder is, in the end, just predicting most likely token after most likely token.
More specifically, during the prediction process, GPT-style models use attention to assign importance to the different tokens in the input sequence, thereby capturing relationships between them. This is the primary difference between a transformer model and older recurrent neural networks. The transformer can pay attention to different parts of the input sequence, enabling it to identify and use the relationships between tokens even if they are far apart within the input.
When used in chat mode, LLMs give the illusion of a back-and-forth discussion when, in reality, each new prompt from the user is passed to the model along with all the previous text (the user's prompts and the model's replies). Transformer models have a fixed input width (context window), which is currently around 4,000 tokens for GPT-3.5 and some 32,000 for GPT-4. The large input window makes it possible for the attention portion of the model to go back to things that appeared far back in the input, which is something recurrent models cannot do.
Large language models are ready for use after pretraining if desired, but many applications fine-tune them first using domain-specific data. For generic models like GPT-4, fine-tuning likely consisted of a step known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, the model is trained further using feedback from real human beings to align its responses to human values and societal expectations.
This is necessary because LLMs are not conscious entities, and thus they cannot understand human society and its many rules. For example, unaligned LLMs will respond with step-by-step instructions for many activities that human society restricts, like how to make drugs or bombs. The ""Sparks"" paper contains several such examples of GPT-4 output before the RLHF step that aligned the model with societal expectations.
Stanford University's open source Alpaca model is based on LLaMa, a large language model from Meta. As of this writing, Alpaca has not undergone an alignment process and will answer questions that GPT and other commercial LLMs correctly refuse to answer.
Conclusion: Alignment is absolutely critical to ensure that powerful language models conform to human values and societal norms.

		Microsoft’s generative AI assistant is integrated within a host of the company's workplace apps. Here’s what enterprises need to know about the renamed ‘Copilot for Microsoft 365.’	




 









Initially called Microsoft 365 Copilot when it launched in November 2023, the renamed “Copilot for Microsoft 365” brings a range of generative AI (genAI) features to office productivity apps such as Word, Outlook, Teams and Excel. 
In a blog post announcing the tool, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described it as “the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing…. With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”
At launch, Microsoft explained that the Copilot “system” consists of three elements: Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, and Teams, where users interact with the AI assistant; Microsoft Graph, which includes files, documents, and data across the Microsoft 365 environment; and the OpenAI models that process user prompts, such as the ChatGPT-4 large language model and DALL-E 3 model for image generation.
 
 
 













 
 

With the tool, Microsoft aims to create a “more usable, functional assistant” for work, J.P. Gownder, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester’s Future of Work team, told Computerworld in fall 2023. “The concept is that you’re the ‘pilot,’ but the Copilot is there to take on tasks that can make life a lot easier.”

The Copilot for M365 is “part of a larger movement of generative AI that will clearly change the way that we do computing,” he said, noting how the technology has already been applied to a variety of job functions — from writing content to creating code — since ChatGPT-3.5 launched in late 2022.
A Forrester report last year predicted that 6.9 million US knowledge workers — around 8% of the total — would be using Copilot for M365 by the end of 2024.
 
 
 













 
 



 


Nadella talked up the effectiveness of the M365 Copilot during a 2023 earnings call, claiming customers had seen productivity gains in line with that of the GitHub Copilot, the AI assistant aimed at developers that launched two years ago. (For reference, GitHub has previously claimed developers were able to complete a single task 55% quicker thanks to the GitHub Copilot, while acknowledging the challenges in measuring productivity.)
Even priced at $30 per user per month, there’s potential to deliver considerable value to businesses, assuming the Copilot delivers on its promise over time. Said Gownder: “The key issue is, ‘Does it actually save that time?’ because it’s hard to measure and we don’t really know for sure. But even conservative time savings estimates are pretty generous.”
The Copilot for M365 is billed as providing employees with access to genAI without the security concerns of consumer genAI tools; Microsoft says its models aren’t trained on customer data, for instance. But deploying the tool represents significant challenges, said Avivah Litan, distinguished vice president analyst at Gartner.
 
 
 













 
 

There are two primary business risks, she said: the potential for the Copilot to ‘hallucinate’ and provide inaccurate information to users, and the ability for the Copilot’s language models to access huge swathes of corporate data that’s not locked down properly.
“Information oversharing is one of the biggest issues people are going to face in the next few months, or six months to a year,” said Litan. “That’s where the rubber is going to hit the road on the risk — it’s not so much giving the data to Microsoft or OpenAI or Google, it’s all the exposure internally.”
Copilot for Microsoft 365 features: How do you use it?

Copilot interactions within apps can take a variety of forms, depending on the application. In many cases, users will interact with it via the chat interface available in a sidebar; Copilot functionality is also built more directly into some apps, such as a pop-up in a Word document or Outlook email, for instance. 
 
 
 













 
 

Here’s how the Copilot works in some M365 apps.
In a Word doc, it can suggest improvements to existing text or let users create a first draft from scratch. To generate a draft, a user can ask Copilot in natural language to create text based on a prompt, and can upload additional files and sources of information to guide the AI assistant. Once created, the user can edit th document, adjust the style, or ask the Copilot to redo the whole thing. A Copilot sidebar provides space for more interactions with the bot, which also suggests prompts to improve the draft, such as adding images or an FAQ section, or summarize the text. 
During a Teams video call, the Copilot provides a recap of what’s been discussed so far, with a brief overview of conversation points in real time. It’s also possible to ask the AI assistant for feedback on people’s views during a call, or what questions remain unresolved. Those unable to attend a particular meeting can send the AI assistant in their place to provide a summary of what they missed and action items they need to follow up on. 
 
 
 













 
 


Copilot can help a Word user draft a proposal from meeting notes. 

In PowerPoint, Copilot can automatically turn a Word document into draft slides that can then be adapted via natural language in the Copilot sidebar. It can also generate suggested speaker notes to go with the slides and add more images. 
These are just some examples. Other apps that feature Copilot integration include Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Loop, and Whiteboard.
The other way to interact with Copilot is via a separate chat interface that’s accessible via Teams. Here, the Copilot works as a search tool that surfaces information from a range of sources, including documents, calendars, emails, and chats. For instance, an employee could ask for an update on a project, and get a summary of relevant team communications and documents already created, with links to sources.
 
 
 













 
 

Microsoft will extend Copilot’s reach into other apps workers use via “plugins” — essentially third-party app integrations. These will allow the assistant to tap into data held in apps from other software vendors including Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Mural. Fifty such plugins are available, with “thousands” more expected eventually, Microsoft said. 
How much does Copilot cost — is it worth $30 per user, per month?
The main Microsoft 365 Copilot is available for enterprise customers on E3, E5, F1 and F3 plans, as well as Office E1, E3, E5, and Apps for Enterprise. It’s also available for smaller business customers on the following plans: Businesses Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium, and Apps for Business.
In each case, the Copilot for Microsoft 365 costs an additional $30 per user each month.
 
 
 













 
 

It’s a significant extra expense given that M365 subscriptions start at $6 per user each month for Busines Basic and go up to $55 per user each month for E5. Part of this due to the cost of the high computing costs of the Copilot incurred by Microsoft, said Raúl Castañón, senior research analyst at 451 Research, a part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“Microsoft is likely looking to avoid the challenges faced with GitHub Copilot, which was made generally available in mid-2022 for $10/month and, despite surpassing more than 1.5 million users, reportedly remains unprofitable,” said Castañón.
In addition to the core Copilot for M365, job role-specific Copilots are available as paid add-ons. Sales and service Copilots each cost an additional $20 per user each month, while a finance Copilot is currently in preview.
 
 
 













 
 

The pricing strategy reflects Microsoft’s confidence in the impact that genAI will have on workforce productivity.
Per Forrester’s calculations in the “Build Your Business Case For Microsoft 365 Copilot” report, an employee earning $120,000 annually — roughly $57 per hour — might save four hours a month on various productivity tasks; those four hours would be worth around $230 a month. In that scenario, it would make sense to invest in Copilot for an employee earning even half that amount, and that’s leaving aside less tangible benefits around employee experience when automating mundane tasks.
There are, as the Forrester points out, other costs to consider beyond licensing — employee training, for instance, as employees learn the new technology. Gartner also predicts that enterprise security spending will increase in the region of 10% to 15% in the next couple of years as a result of efforts to secure genAI tools (not just M365 Copilot).
 
 
 













 
 

Businesses are likely to take a cautious approach to deploying the Microsoft tool, at least at first. Microsoft expects revenue related to M365 Copilot to “grow gradually over time,” Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call. On the same call, Nadella noted that Copilot will be subject to the usual “enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp.”
Even if the pace of adoption is gradual, there appears to be plenty of interest in deploying it. Forrester expects around a third of M365 customers in the US to invest in Copilot in the first year. Companies that do so will provide licenses to around 40% of employees during this period, the firm estimated.
(Note: while not actually branded as Copilot, Microsoft also makes some genAI features available in Teams Premium. This includes AI-generated notes, AI-generated tasks and live translations in video calls, all of which are powered by ChatGPT AI models. For businesses that are mostly interested in AI assistant features for meetings, this offers a cheaper option than a full Copilot for M365 subscription.) 
 
 
 













 
 

What are Microsoft’s other Copilots?
Microsoft’s Copilot is embedded in a wide array of products. Beyond the M365 suite, there are Copilots for Dynamics, Power BI, GitHub, and Microsoft’s security suite.
And then there are Copilots aimed primarily at consumer, rather than business, users. 

Microsoft launched Copilot Pro in January 2024, a $20 a month subscription that provides individuals with similar functionality to the Copilot for M365. Copilot Pro customers gain access to Copilot chatbot and genAI image creation, as well as AI assistant features in free web versions of apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook (though not Teams). Those with Microsoft 365 Personal and family subscriptions can also access the Copilot in desktop apps. 
 
 
 













 
 

There’s also a free version of the Copilot with access to chatbot functionality only.
The Copilot chat interface is accessible in several ways by both paid and free users. There’s a dedicated web page, a mobile app, and a chatbot built into the Windows operating system, Edge browser, and Bing search engine.
How are early customers using Copilot?
There are two basic ways users will interact with Copilot. It can be accessed directly within a particular app — to create PowerPoint slides, for example, or an email draft — or via a natural language chatbot accessible in Teams, known as Microsoft 365 Chat. 
 
 
 













 
 

Interactions within apps can take a variety of forms, depending on the application. When Copilot is invoked in a Word document, for example, it can suggest improvements to existing text, or even create a first draft.

To generate a draft, a user can ask Copilot in natural language to create text based on a particular source of information or from a combination of sources. One example: creating a draft proposal based on meeting notes from OneNote and a product road map from another Word doc. Once a draft is created, the user can edit it, adjust the style, or ask the AI tool to redo the whole document. A Copilot sidebar provides space for more interactions with the bot, which also suggests prompts to improve the draft, such as adding images or an FAQ section. 
During a Teams video call, a participant can request a recap of what’s been discussed so far, with Copilot providing a brief overview of conversation points in real time via the Copilot sidebar. It’s also possible to ask the AI assistant for feedback on people’s views during the call, or what questions remain unresolved. Those unable to attend a particular meeting can send the AI assistant in their place to provide a summary of what they missed and action items they need to follow up on. 
In PowerPoint, Copilot can automatically turn a Word document into draft slides that can then be adapted via natural language in the Copilot sidebar. Copilot can also generate suggested speaker notes to go with the slides and add more images. 
 
 
 













 
 

The other way to interact with Copilot is via Microsoft 365 Chat, which is accessible as a chatbot with Teams. Here, Microsoft 365 Chat works as a search tool that surfaces information from a range of sources, including documents, calendars, emails, and chats. For instance, an employee could ask for an update on a project, and get a summary of relevant team communications and documents already created, with links to sources.
Microsoft will extend Copilot’s reach into other apps workers use via “plugins” — essentially third-party app integrations. These will allow the assistant to tap into data held in apps from other software vendors including Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Mural. Fifty such plugins are available, with “thousands” more expected eventually, Microsoft said. 

Copilot can synthesize information about a project from different sources.

How are early customers using Copilot?
Prior to launch, many businesses accessed the Copilot for M365 as part of a paid early access program (EAP); it began with a small number of participants before growing to several hundred customers, including Chevron, Goodyear, and General Motors. 
One of those involved in the EAP was marketing firm Dentsu, which began deploying 300 licenses to tech staff and then employees across its business lines globally. The most popular use case so far is summarization of information generated in M365 apps — a Teams call being one example.
“Summarization is definitely the most common use case we see right out of the box, because it’s an easy prompt: you don’t really have to do any prompt engineering…, it’s suggested by Copilot,” Kate Slade, director of emerging technology enablement at Dentsu, said.
Staffers would also access M365 Chat functions to prepare for meetings, for instance, with the ability to quickly pull information from different sources. This could mean finding information from a project several years ago “without having to hunt through a folder maze,” said Slade.
The feedback from workers at Dentsu has been overwhelmingly positive, said Slade, with a waiting list now in place for those who want to use the AI tool.
“It’s reducing the time that they spend on [tasks] and giving them back time to be more creative, more strategic, or just be a human and connect peer to peer in Teams meetings,” she said. “That’s been one of the biggest impacts that we’ve seen…, just helping make time for the higher-level cognitive tasks that people have to do.”
Use cases have varied between different roles. Denstu’s graphic designers would get less value from using Copilot in PowerPoint, for example: “They’re going to create really visually stunning pieces themselves and not really be satisfied with that out-of-the-box capability,” said Slade. “But those same creatives might get a lot of benefits from Copilot in Excel and being able to use natural language to say, ‘Hey, I need to do some analysis on this table,’ or ‘What are key trends from this data?’ or ‘I want to add a column that does this or that.’”
How does Copilot compare with other productivity and collaboration genAI tools?
Most vendors in the productivity and collaboration software market have added genAI to their offerings at this point.
Google, Microsoft’s main competitor in the productivity software arena, launched DuetAI for Workspace in 2023, and rebranded to Gemini Enterprise ($30 per user each month) and   Gemini Business ($20 user each month). Google’s AI assistant can summarize Gmail conversations, draft texts, and generate images in Workspace apps such as Docs, Sheets,and Slides. 
Slack, the collaboration software firm owned by Salesforce and a rival to Microsoft Teams, launched its Slack AI feature in February. Other firms that compete with elements of the Microsoft 365 portfolio, such as Zoom, Box, Coda, and Cisco, have also touted genAI plans. 
Meanwhile, Apple announced that it will build generative AI features into its range of productivity tools.
Then there are the AI specific tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Claude, Perplexity AI, Jasper AI and others, that provide also provide text generation and document summarization features. 
Copilot has some advantages over rivals. One is Microsoft’s dominant position in the productivity and collaboration software market, said Castañón. “The key advantage the Microsoft 365 Copilot will have is that — like other previous initiatives such as Teams — it has a ‘ready-made’ opportunity with Microsoft’s collaboration and productivity portfolio and its extensive global footprint,” he said. 
Microsoft’s close partnership with OpenAI (Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the company on several occasions since 2019 and has a large non-controlling share of the business), likely helped it build generative AI across its applications at faster rate than rivals. 
“Its investment in OpenAI has already had an impact, allowing it to accelerate the use of generative AI/LLMs in its products, jumping ahead of Google Cloud and other competitors,” said Castañón. 
What are the genAI risks for businesses? ‘Hallucinations’ and data protection
Along with the potential benefits of genAI tools like the Copilot for M365, businesses should consider risks. These include the hallucinations large language models (LLMs) are prone to, where incorrect information is provided to employees.
“Copilot is generative AI — it definitely can hallucinate,” said Slade, citing the example of one employee who asked the Copilot to provide a summary of pro bono work completed that month to add to their timecard and send to their manager. A detailed two-page summary document was created without issue; however, the address of all meetings was given as “123 Main Street, City, USA” — an error that’s easily noticed, but an indication of the care required by users when relying on Copilot.
The occurrence of hallucinations can be reduced by improving prompts, but Dentsu staff have been advised to treat outputs from the genAI assistant with caution. “The more context you can give it generally, the closer you’re going to get to a final output,” said Slade. “But it’s never going to replace the need for human review and fact check.
“As much as you can, level-set expectations and communicate to your first users that this is still an evolving technology. It’s a first draft, it’s not a final draft — it’s going to hallucinate and mess up sometimes.”
Tools that filter Copilot outputs are emerging that could help here, said Litan, but this is likely to remain a key challenge for businesses for the forseeable future.
Another risk relates to one of the major strengths of the Copilot: its ability to sift through files and data across a company’s M365 environment using natural language inputs.
While Copilot is only able to access files according to permissions granted to individual employees, the reality is that businesses often fail to adequately label sensitive documents. This means individual employees might suddenly realize they are able to ask Copilot to provide details on payroll or customer information if it hasn’t been locked down with the right permissions.
A 2022 report by data security firm Varonis claimed that one in 10 files hosted in SaaS environments is accessible by all staff; an earlier 2019 report put that figure — including cloud and on-prem files and folders — at 22%. In many cases, this can mean organization-wide permissions are granted to thousands of sensitive files, Varonis said.
In many cases, the most important data, around payroll, for instance, will have strict permissions in place. A greater challenge lies in securing unstructured data, with sensitive information finding its way into a wide range of documents created by individual employees — a store manager planning payroll in an Excel spreadsheet before updating a central system, for example. This is similar to a situation that the CTO of an unnamed US restaurant chain encountered during the EAP, said Litan. 
“There’s a lot of personal data that’s kept on spreadsheets belonging to individual managers,” said Litan. “There’s also a lot of intellectual property that’s kept on Word documents in SharePoint or Teams or OneDrive.”
“You don’t realize how much you have access to in the average company,” said Matt Radolec, vice president for incident response and cloud operations at Varonis. “An assumption you could have is that people generally lock this stuff down: they do not. Things are generally open.”
Another consideration is that employees often end up storing files relating to their personal lives on work laptops.
“Employees use their desktops for personal work, too — most of them don’t have separate laptops,” said Litan. “So you’re going to have to give employees time to get rid of all their personal data. And sometimes you can’t, they can’t just take it off the system that easily because they’re locked down — you can’t put USB drives in [to corporate devices, in some cases].
“So it’s just a lot of processes companies have to go through. I’m on calls with clients every day on the risk. This one really hits them.”
Getting data governance in order is a process that could take businesses more than a year to get sorted, said Litan. “There are no shortcuts. You’ve got to go through the entire organization and set up the permissions properly,” she said.
In Radolec’s view, very few M365 customers have yet adequately addressed the risks around data access within their organization. “I think a lot of them are just planning to do the blocking and tackling after they get started,” he said. “We’ll see to what degree of effectiveness that is [after launch]. We’re right around the corner from seeing how well people will fare with it.”
The Copilot for M365 pros and cons
Pros:

Boost to productivity. GenAI features can save time for users by automating certain tasks. 
Breadth of features. Copilot for M365 is built into the productivity apps that many workers use on a daily basis, including Word, Excel, Outlook and Teams. 
Responses generated by the Copilot for M365 are anchored in the emails, files, calendars, meetings, contacts, and other information contained in Microsoft 365. This means the Copilot for M365 can arguably offer greater insights into work data than any other generative AI tool. 
Enterprise-grade privacy and security controls. Unlike consumer AI assistants, Microsoft promises that customer data won’t be used to train Copilot models. It also offers tools to help manage access to data in M365 apps.   

Cons:

Price. GenAI isn’t cheap and M365 customers are required to pay a significant additional fee each month for access to Copilot features. An individual employee might not need access to Copilot in more than a couple ofM365 apps.
Need for employee training. Getting the most out of genAI tools will require guidance around effective prompts, particularly for employees that are unfamiliar with the technology — an additional cost businesses must factor in.
Accuracy and hallucinations. LLMs are notoriously unreliable, confidently offering answers that are incorrect. This is a particular concern when it comes to business data, and users must be on the lookout for errors in Copilot outputs.
Data protection risks. The ability for Copilot for M365 to access a wide range of corporate data means businesses must be careful to ensure that sensitive documents are not exposed.
The Copilot functionality in Excel is limited at this stage.

We’ve collected the arguments from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Hugging Face, StabilityAI, and Anthropic below, as well as a response from Apple that focused on copyrighting AI-written code.

There are some differences in their approaches, but the overall message for most is the same: They don’t think they should have to pay to train AI models on copyrighted work. 

The Copyright Office opened the comment period on August 30th, with an October 18th due date for written comments regarding changes it was considering around the use of copyrighted data for AI model training, whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted without human involvement, and AI copyright liability. There’s been no shortage of copyright lawsuits in the last year, with artists, authors, developers, and companies alike alleging violations in different cases. 

Here are some snippets from each company’s response.

Meta: Copyright holders wouldn’t get much money anyway

> Imposing a first-of-its-kind licensing regime now, well after the fact, will cause chaos as developers seek to identify millions and millions of rightsholders, for very little benefit, given that any fair royalty due would be incredibly small in light of the insignificance of any one work among an Al training set. 

Google: AI training is just like reading a book

> If training could be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of “knowledge harvesting.” to use the Court’s metaphor from Harper & Row, like the act of reading a book ‘and learning the facts and ideas within it, would not only be non-infringing, it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, copies need to be made to extract those ideas and facts from copyrighted works should not alter that result.

Microsoft: Changing copyright law could hurt small AI developers

> Any requirement to obtain consent for accessible works to be used for training would chill Al innovation. It is not feasible to achieve the scale of data necessary to develop responsible Al models even when the identity of a work and its owner is known. Such licensing schemes will also impede innovation from start-ups and entrants who don’t have the resources to obtain licenses, leaving Al development to a small set of companies with the resources to run large-scale licensing programs or to developers in countries that have decided that use of copyrighted works to train Al models is not infringement.

Anthropic: Current law is fine; don’t change it

> Sound policy has always recognized the need for appropriate limits to copyright in order to support creativity, innovation, and other values, and we believe that existing law and continued collaboration among all stakeholders can harmonize the diverse interests at stake, unlocking AI’s benefits while addressing concern.

Adobe: It’s fair use, like when Accolade copied Sega’s code

> In Sega v. Accolade, the Ninth Circuit held that intermediate copying of Sega’s software was fair use. The defendant made copies while reverse engineering to discover the functional requirements—unprotected information—for making games compatible with Sega’s gaming console. Such intermediate copying also benefited the public: it led to an increase in the number of independently designed video games (which contain a mix of functional and creative aspects) available for Sega’s console. This growth in creative expression was precisely what the Copyright Act was intended to promote.

Anthropic: Copying is just an intermediate step

> For Claude, as discussed above, the training process makes copies of information for the purposes of performing a statistical analysis of the data. The copying is merely an intermediate step, extracting unprotectable elements about the entire corpus of works, in order to create new outputs. In this way, the use of the original copyrighted work is non-expressive; that is, it is not re-using the copyrighted expression to communicate it to users.

Andreessen Horowitz: Investors have spent ‘billions and billions’

> Over the last decade or more, there has been an enormous amount of investment—billons and billions of dollars—in the development of AI technologies, premised on an understanding that, under current copyright law, any copying necessary to extract statistical facts is permitted. A change in this regime will significantly disrupt settled expectations in this area. Those expectations have been a critical factor in the enormous investment of private capital into U.S.-based AI companies which, in turn, has made the U.S. a global leader in AI. Undermining those expectations will jeopardize future investment, along with U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.

Hugging Face: Training on copyrighted material is fair use

> The use of a given work in training is of a broadly beneficial purpose: the creation of a distinctive and productive Al model. Rather than replacing the specific communicative expression of the initial work, the model is capable of creating a wide variety of different sort of outputs wholly unrelated to that underlying, copyrightable expression. For those and other reasons, generative Al models are generally fair use when they train on large numbers of copyrighted works. We use “generally” deliberately, however, as one can imagine patterns of facts that would raise tougher calls.

StabilityAI: Other countries call AI model training fair use

> A range of jurisdictions including Singapore, Japan, the European Union, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Israel have reformed their copyright laws to create safe harbors for Al training that achieve similar effects o fair use.” In the United Kingdom, the Government Chief Scientific Advisor has recommended that “if the government’s aim is to promote an innovative Al industry in the UK, it should enable mining of available data, text, and images (the input) and utilise [sic] existing protections of copyright and IP law on the output of AI.

Apple: Let us copyright our AI-made code

> In circumstances where a human developer controls the expressive elements of output and the decisions to modify, add to, enhance, or even reject suggested code, the final code that results from the developer’s interactions with the tools will have sufficient human authorship to be copyrightable.

Artificial Intelligence chatbots are everywhere. They have captured the public imagination and that of countless Silicon Valley inventors and investors since the arrival of ChatGPT about a year ago.
The stunning human-like abilities of conversational AI - a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to process and generate human language - have sparked widespread optimism about their potential to transform workplaces and increase productivity.
In what may be a world first, a UK school has appointed an AI chatbot as a “principal headteacher” to support its headmaster. While little is known about the nature of the AI behind it, the chatbot is meant to advise staff on issues such as helping pupils with ADHD and writing school policies.
But, before deploying chatbots in the workplace, it is crucial to understand what they are, how they work and how to use them responsibly. 
How chatbots work
Much has been written about the astounding abilities of generative AI, and its sometimes surprising ability to get things wrong.



Chatbots can be extremely useful but they can also get things wrong.

For example, an AI chatbot can craft a persuasive scholarly argument but, to use chatbot terminology, can “hallucinate” the list of references or get simple facts wrong. To understand why hallucinations occur it is important to understand how these chatbots work.
At their core, AI chatbots are powered by large language models (LLMs), large neural networks trained on massive datasets of text (what we lovingly call “the Internet”).
Importantly, LLMs do not store any data or knowledge in any traditional sense. Rather, when they are built (or “trained”) they encode, in large statistical structures, sophisticated content or language patterns contained in the training data.
Simply speaking, text is turned into numbers, or probabilities.

When in use, LLMs no longer have access to this training data. So when we ask it a question, the response is generated from scratch, every time. Technically, everything is “hallucinated”. When AI chatbots get things right, it is because much of human knowledge is patterned and embedded in language, not because “it knows”. 
By design, AI chatbots cannot produce definitive factual answers. They are probabilistic, not deterministic systems, and therefore cannot be relied on as authoritative sources of knowledge. But their ability to recognise linguistic patterns makes them excel at helping humans with tasks that involve text generation or enhancement. 
Writing persuasive arguments follows certain patterned regularities, whereas factual answers cannot reliably be generated from probabilistic patterns.
The new workplace assistant
Don’t think of your AI chatbot as an omniscient artificial brain, but as a gifted graduate student assigned to be your personal work assistant. 
Like an eager grad student, they work tirelessly and mostly competently on assigned tasks. However, they are also a little bit cocky. Always overconfident, they might  take risky shortcuts and provide answers that sound good but lack any factual grounding.

It is wise always to verify chatbot outputs, much as you would double-check a grad student’s work.
Because of their probabilistic foundation they don’t comprehend your question with any human understanding. But in the right roles, when used appropriately, chatbots greatly augment productivity on language-related tasks.
Working with AI chatbots
The three levels of chatbot capability can be summed up using the acronym ACE - assisting, creating, exploring.

assisting - chatbots can assist with many writing tasks, such as summarising, analysing and refining text, or extracting key points and themes. They can express arguments in academic text in more accessible ways.
creating - chatbots can generate original text, turning dot points into business reports or ideas. They can mimic different genres and write in different styles. As they encode countless bodies of text from different domains, they can be told to take a perspective, impersonating business strategists, scholars, marketers or journalists, to create content useful across many professions.
exploring – chatbots make intriguing “discussion partners” about hypothetical ideas (“what would happen if…”). When exploring new issues, let the chatbot set you questions then get it to answer them. If you want to explore what makes a good project report, or social media post, ask the chatbot to write one and then reflect on why it wrote what it did.

The business of chatbots
What do we know about the use of AI chatbots in the workplace so far? Some initial studies point to significant productivity gains. 
A pilot project at Westpac found a 46% productivity gain in software coding tasks, with no drop in quality. The experiment compared groups of developers using AI chatbots for a range of programming tasks with a control group that did not.
A study by global management company Boston Consulting Group also reported significant improvements.



Many workers are worried that their jobs could ultimately be replaced by chatbots.

In a controlled experiment, consultants used AI chatbots to problem-solve and develop new product ideas, which involved both analytical work and persuasive writing. Those who worked with the chatbot finished 12.2% more tasks, 25.1% more quickly, and at 40% higher quality, than those who didn’t.
In yet another case, an AI chatbot is reportedly being used by a US software company to help write proposals for clients. It scours thousands of internal files for relevant information to generate a suitable response, saving the company time.
These cases give glimpses into the future of AI chatbots, where companies fine-tune generative AI models with their own data or documents, using them for specialist roles such as coders, consultants or call-centre workers.
Many workers are worried AI will be used to automate their work. But given the probabilistic nature of the technology, and its inherent lack of reliability, we do not see automation as the most likely area of application.
AI chatbots might not be coming for your job after all, but they are certainly coming for your job description. AI fluency, the skill to understand and work with AI will soon become essential, similar to working with PCs.
Finally, you might ask, did we let a chatbot write this article? Of course we didn’t. Did we use one in writing it? Of course we did, much like we used a computer, and not a typewriter.

_The Conversation requires authors to disclose if they have used AI in the preparation of an article. Articles that use AI for fact-finding or idea generation will generally not be accepted.“

Artificial intelligence may lead to the end of human employment, Elon Musk warns
Jobs would only be there for personal satisfaction

A hot potato: Amid concerns over just how much generative AI will impact employment, Elon Musk has joined the debate with a warning that the technology threatens all human jobs. The world's richest man said the new wave of artificial intelligence tools have the potential to be the ""most disruptive force in history."" 
In a conversation between Musk and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak which took place at the end of the country's AI summit, the CEO had several warnings about the tech.
""We will have something that is, for the first time, smarter than the smartest human,"" Musk said. ""It's hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed.""
Musk added that in this scenario, people who wanted a job could have one for personal satisfaction, but AI would be able ""to do everything.""
""I don't know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable,"" Musk joked.

There was also a warning from the Tesla boss about humanoid robots. ""At least a car can't chase you into a building or up a tree,"" he told the audience, referencing the AI-related technologies being used in his company's vehicles.
Musk has long warned about the dangers of AI in the past, calling for regulation of advanced AI and a ban on the technology being used in weapons. He was also one of the 1,100 signatories who signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause on the development of advanced AIs in March over fears that, among other things, all jobs could become automated.
Musk, who launched a new AI venture called xAI seeking the ""true nature of the universe"" in July, did have some positive things to say about the technology in his talk with Sunak. He noted that ""one of my sons has trouble making friends and an AI friend would be great for him."" He also highlighted how these tools could be an excellent tutor for young people - but that could also raise job fears among teachers and teaching assistants.
The UK summit on AI focused on two areas: the risk of it being misused by bad actors, and any loss of control of advanced systems. But there were few new announcements related to regulation similar to Biden's recent executive order. Musk even took a jab at the summit before it began by posting a cartoon on X (below).

But while white-collar professionals stare down a turbulent job market and declining wages, a large, unexpected segment of the workforce may be safely on high ground: blue-collar jobs. The likes of skilled trades, intensive manual labor, and jobs that require a combination of physical, knowledge, and social work will not be upended. In fact, as other long-term trends take hold, many of these working-class roles are poised for a job explosion.As older Americans retire in massive numbers and leave behind open jobs, and as demand for healthcare, green energy, high-tech manufacturing, and construction increases, blue-collar jobs are going to see a substantial boom. ChatGPT will not replace the nurse who tends to you at the hospital or the construction worker who remodels your kitchen. The winners of the AI revolution will be the technicians, nurses, and plumbers who keep the new economy running after the machines have taken over the office.Describing the nature of factory work in the '90s, the American poet Philip Levine wrote, ""​​We stand in the rain / in a long line waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work. / You know what work is."" At the time, factory jobs in the Rust Belt had dwindled, job-seeking became undignified, and the nature of work grew monotonous and alienating. The decline of manufacturing sped up precipitously in the early 2000s as globalization pushed jobs overseas, low-skilled work was automated away, and the economy shifted toward desk jobs with the advent of the internet. Today, there's a hopeful reversal for American blue-collar jobs. While cognitive workers fight over rapidly disappearing remote jobs, industries such as semiconductor manufacturing have the opposite problem — too many jobs to fill. And that's true across working-class industries. Two years of a historically tight labor market and low unemployment have pushed wages up for lower- and middle-income workers, stimulating a working-class job boom that has seen 9.6 million job openings nationwide and what economists are calling ""full employment."" Over the next decade, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that the fastest-growing occupations will be in healthcare, transportation, renewable energy, and high-tech manufacturing.Nearly half of all job gains will come from the healthcare and social-support sectors. By 2032, one out of six new workers will be a home-health or personal-care aide. Construction, which has added 15,000 jobs a month over the past year, also has room to keep expanding.While manufacturing jobs as a whole are expected to stay flat, spending in this industry has boomed to $200 billion each year, tripling in the past five years. And certain sectors are expected to grow: The electrical-equipment and semiconductor industry is projected to reach 3% annual growth over the next decade. Chip manufacturing will continue to be a national priority, and that means a lot of well-paid jobs that require only a high-school education. ""There's going to be significant demand in manufacturing for the sorts of non-BA technician jobs,"" Mark Muro, an expert on technology and workforce development and a policy director at the Brookings Institution, told me. Within chip manufacturing, roughly 50% of entry-level workers have only a high-school or equivalent education level, compared with 38% for all other industries. Over the next 10 years, as the global semiconductor industry is primed to reach $1 trillion, another 50,000 American jobs will be added for roles such as electrical assemblers and industrial technicians.While not all working-class jobs will be safe from automation — retail workers, for instance, do not have a rosy outlook — there has been improvement across the board for lower-income workers. The initial shock of the pandemic hit low-wage workers the hardest, but the recovery since has been more auspicious. Wages have grown nearly three times as fast as in any other recovery period. The wages of the lowest 10th percentile of the workforce — earning an average of $12.50 an hour — grew only 3.9% from 2009 to 2017. But from March 2020 to March 2022, wages grew by 5.7%. Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.Other economic barometers also show steady improvements that are likely to continue. Over the past decade, the poverty rate in America has fallen from 14.8% to 11.5%. The net worth of the average household in the bottom 50% of Americans is up more than 45% from before the pandemic. If a recession is averted, the continuation of a tight labor market will continue to drive wages up, further reduce the poverty rate, and boost household income and net worth. Adding to the tailwinds is AI's adoption, which is likely to augment these jobs, leading to higher productivity growth over the coming decade. Increased labor productivity in the construction industry would be a boon for economic growth since housing scarcity remains one of the most pressing issues for Americans. In the World Economic Forum's recent joint report with Accenture, 19,000 individual tasks across nearly 900 occupations were analyzed for how much they could be affected by AI. The findings were pretty straightforward: Jobs with a high degree of personal interaction and nonroutine physical tasks faced the least amount of disruption from AI. Other recent projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and McKinsey have come to similar conclusions.""What characterizes the physical labor jobs that are safe for the next five or 10 years are things that are in an unpredictable physical environment,"" Kweilin Ellingrud, a McKinsey Global Institute director, told me. ""If it's in a predictable physical environment, and it's repetitive, then either a robot — likely even before generative AI — or some sort of generative AI can create the automation to do that well.""One influential explanation for this is known as skill-biased technological change, a theory that says routine roles that are susceptible to automation and computerization will see declining wages, while nonroutine roles that require dexterity or human interaction will see increased demand and wages.  That's what recent research has found: Jobs such as air-conditioning installer, teacher, and hairdresser — jobs that are not routine — will be relatively unscathed over the next five to 10 years. Research led by OpenAI found that 4% of workers, including painters, carpenters, and roofers, had zero tasks that could be influenced by AI. And even though technology could infiltrate more of these roles, they fundamentally cannot be replaced by machines. Ellingrud said, ""Even though we have Roombas, we still have house cleaners because the Roomba can only do so much and isn't all that effective."" Instead of replacing these jobs, AI will likely benefit specific roles by making it easier to do the most routine parts of the job. Nurses, for example, could spend less time collecting and entering information into a medical-record system. For an industry notorious for high hourly billing rates, allowing nurses to redeploy their time on more critical tasks — such as taking care of patients — would save Americans billions in annual healthcare costs. Similarly, the construction industry could benefit from new technology such as AI drones to do inspections or AI sensors that measure things, freeing up workers to do more.""You may get a bifurcation within these groups where the hands-on physical work remains, but generative AI picks up and substitutes for a lot of the management supervising,"" Muro told me. He added: ""There are these jobs that are in a middle ground where the physical work may remain but the supervision might be more exposed."" But instead of replacing workers, this kind of integration could help these types of roles be more productive, have more demand, and earn more money. Blue-collar jobs are not only safe from AI's impact but also physically safer with the tech. AI's adoption in the workplace can help improve safety via real-time monitoring of risks and alerts for equipment issues or injuries. Each year in the US, there are 2.7 million workplace injuries and over 5,000 deaths as a result of workplace accidents, so any improvements would be significant. Though many of these working-class jobs may be physically or emotionally laborious, they are durable for the future. Broadly speaking, the jobs that will come out on top of the AI shuffle are good-quality jobs that provide steady work hours, upward mobility, and career support, as well as ""fair compensation and a degree of voice,"" Muro said.  As the economy gets increasingly precarious because of AI, the winners of this AI revolution will not need to swim a technological triathlon against oncoming waves — they will already be on elevated terrain, safely and skillfully working away.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.",,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/', 'name': 'Business Insider'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/economy', 'name': 'Economy'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/tech', 'name': 'Tech'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/job-disruption-ai-future-careers-blue-collar-desk-work-2023-11', 'name': 'The biggest winners — and losers — in the coming AI job apocalypse'}}]",The biggest winners — and losers — in the coming AI job apocalypse,,,,,"

Two years of a historically tight labor market and low unemployment have pushed wages up for lower- and middle-income workers, stimulating a working-class job boom that has seen 9.6 million job openings nationwide and what economists are calling ""full employment."" Over the next decade, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that the fastest-growing occupations will be in healthcare, transportation, renewable energy, and high-tech manufacturing.Nearly half of all job gains will come from the healthcare and social-support sectors. By 2032, one out of six new workers will be a home-health or personal-care aide. Construction, which has added 15,000 jobs a month over the past year, also has room to keep expanding.While manufacturing jobs as a whole are expected to stay flat, spending in this industry has boomed to $200 billion each year, tripling in the past five years. And certain sectors are expected to grow: The electrical-equipment and semiconductor industry is projected to reach 3% annual growth over the next decade. Chip manufacturing will continue to be a national priority, and that means a lot of well-paid jobs that require only a high-school education.

""There's going to be significant demand in manufacturing for the sorts of non-BA technician jobs,"" Mark Muro, an expert on technology and workforce development and a policy director at the Brookings Institution, told me. Within chip manufacturing, roughly 50% of entry-level workers have only a high-school or equivalent education level, compared with 38% for all other industries. Over the next 10 years, as the global semiconductor industry is primed to reach $1 trillion, another 50,000 American jobs will be added for roles such as electrical assemblers and industrial technicians.Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.While not all working-class jobs will be safe from automation — retail workers, for instance, do not have a rosy outlook — there has been improvement across the board for lower-income workers. The initial shock of the pandemic hit low-wage workers the hardest, but the recovery since has been more auspicious. Wages have grown nearly three times as fast as in any other recovery period. The wages of the lowest 10th percentile of the workforce — earning an average of $12.50 an hour — grew only 3.9% from 2009 to 2017. But from March 2020 to March 2022, wages grew by 5.7%. Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.

Other economic barometers also show steady improvements that are likely to continue. Over the past decade, the poverty rate in America has fallen from 14.8% to 11.5%. The net worth of the average household in the bottom 50% of Americans is up more than 45% from before the pandemic. If a recession is averted, the continuation of a tight labor market will continue to drive wages up, further reduce the poverty rate, and boost household income and net worth. Adding to the tailwinds is AI's adoption, which is likely to augment these jobs, leading to higher productivity growth over the coming decade. Increased labor productivity in the construction industry would be a boon for economic growth since housing scarcity remains one of the most pressing issues for Americans.

Who's safe from AI?In the World Economic Forum's recent joint report with Accenture, 19,000 individual tasks across nearly 900 occupations were analyzed for how much they could be affected by AI. The findings were pretty straightforward: Jobs with a high degree of personal interaction and nonroutine physical tasks faced the least amount of disruption from AI. Other recent projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and McKinsey have come to similar conclusions.""What characterizes the physical labor jobs that are safe for the next five or 10 years are things that are in an unpredictable physical environment,"" Kweilin Ellingrud, a McKinsey Global Institute director, told me. ""If it's in a predictable physical environment, and it's repetitive, then either a robot — likely even before generative AI — or some sort of generative AI can create the automation to do that well.""

One influential explanation for this is known as skill-biased technological change, a theory that says routine roles that are susceptible to automation and computerization will see declining wages, while nonroutine roles that require dexterity or human interaction will see increased demand and wages.  That's what recent research has found: Jobs such as air-conditioning installer, teacher, and hairdresser — jobs that are not routine — will be relatively unscathed over the next five to 10 years. Research led by OpenAI found that 4% of workers, including painters, carpenters, and roofers, had zero tasks that could be influenced by AI. And even though technology could infiltrate more of these roles, they fundamentally cannot be replaced by machines. Ellingrud said, ""Even though we have Roombas, we still have house cleaners because the Roomba can only do so much and isn't all that effective.""

Instead of replacing these jobs, AI will likely benefit specific roles by making it easier to do the most routine parts of the job. Nurses, for example, could spend less time collecting and entering information into a medical-record system. For an industry notorious for high hourly billing rates, allowing nurses to redeploy their time on more critical tasks — such as taking care of patients — would save Americans billions in annual healthcare costs. Similarly, the construction industry could benefit from new technology such as AI drones to do inspections or AI sensors that measure things, freeing up workers to do more.""You may get a bifurcation within these groups where the hands-on physical work remains, but generative AI picks up and substitutes for a lot of the management supervising,"" Muro told me. He added: ""There are these jobs that are in a middle ground where the physical work may remain but the supervision might be more exposed."" But instead of replacing workers, this kind of integration could help these types of roles be more productive, have more demand, and earn more money. Safe groundBlue-collar jobs are not only safe from AI's impact but also physically safer with the tech. AI's adoption in the workplace can help improve safety via real-time monitoring of risks and alerts for equipment issues or injuries. Each year in the US, there are 2.7 million workplace injuries and over 5,000 deaths as a result of workplace accidents, so any improvements would be significant. Though many of these working-class jobs may be physically or emotionally laborious, they are durable for the future. Broadly speaking, the jobs that will come out on top of the AI shuffle are good-quality jobs that provide steady work hours, upward mobility, and career support, as well as ""fair compensation and a degree of voice,"" Muro said.

No matter what your role in tech, learning the basics of generative A.I. could impact your job opportunities going forward. Workers across the economy are rushing to adopt this technology as fast as possible.

Online learning platform Udemy saw a 5,226 percent increase in ChatGPT-related learning in the first quarter of 2023, and generalized A.I.-related skills learning on Udemy Business has risen by 60 percent year-over-year, according to its 2024 Learning & Skills Trend Report. “Employees must have the skills required to leverage and work with this new technology effectively,” the report added.

Udemy cites a McKinsey report stating that 30 percent of work hours across the U.S. economy could be automated by 2030, while a PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis concludes that A.I., automation and robotics could collectively contribute $15 trillion to global GDP by that same year.

With that rise in automation, there’s also the possibility that generative A.I. could unlock opportunities for tech pros (and other workers) to have more than one job, according to a recent study by Morgan Stanley (hat tip to Business Insider for the breakdown). “The advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratized access to generative A.I. tools,” that paper concluded, could generate as much as $83 billion of the $400 billion in income expected from multiple jobs by the end of the decade.

For software engineers and others who build software, pay attention to how generative A.I. will increasingly automate code creation and review. In theory, that kind of automation will free up engineers and developers to focus their time and energy on the more creative aspects of their jobs, such as coming up with new features. It may also enable a new generation of “citizen developers” to build apps with a minimum level of programming knowledge, thanks to low- and no-code platforms.

If you’re interested in working more deeply with A.I., another report from McKinsey, Technology Trends Outlook 2023, suggests you master the following concepts:

Machine learning
Computer vision
Natural-language processing
Deep reinforcement learning

Yes, A.I. may eliminate some jobs—but it could also create far more, including ones with high six-figure or even seven-figure salaries.

This year has produced an upsurge in tools that allow the public to use generative artificial intelligence to produce text, images, audio, and video, frequently in the voice of real people. Federal legislators have been both astounded and concerned by this progress, and many are clamoring to craft an appropriate regulatory response. Consensus has yet to emerge, but Congress can look to state legislatures — often referred to as the laboratories of democracy — for inspiration regarding how to address the opportunities and challenges posed by AI.
This year, Congress has held committee hearings and proposed many bills to address the perceived threats and promises of this new technology. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and a bipartisan team of senators have each announced frameworks to guide forthcoming AI legislation. To underscore the extraordinary nature of this issue, on September 13, Schumer assembled two-thirds of the Senate, major technology CEOs, and labor and civil rights leaders for a closed-door AI Insights Forum. Participants — including tech mogul Elon Musk, OpenAI founder Sam Altman, and the Center for Humane Technology’s Tristan Harris — overwhelmingly agreed that AI regulation is necessary.
As our colleagues Faiza Patel and Ivey Dyson have noted, the European Union is steps ahead of the United States and has already provided a potential model for federal regulation with its AI Act. Meanwhile, closer to home, 30 states have passed more than 50 laws over the last five years to address AI in some capacity, with attention greatly increasing year over year.
No existing state legislation matches the ambitious European proposals. Instead, states have entered the space incrementally, passing laws that tackle discrete policy concerns or establish entities to study the potential consequences of AI and make policy recommendations. While much of the enacted legislation does not directly address AI’s impact on elections, laws in California, Texas, Minnesota, and Washington do, and more such laws have been proposed.
This summer, the National Conference of State Legislatures published a report aimed at building consensus around common definitions of AI terms, circulating best practices in AI regulation, and increasing awareness of key risks. The report cautions that “there will be a race to the bottom for AI if no guardrails are offered.”
State legislation often foreshadows federal solutions. Several trends have emerged from state-level AI regulation that merit attention from Washington, DC.

LinkedIn Premium Launches Generative AI Personalization of Posts and Job Listings



Eric Hal Schwartz  on November 1, 2023 at 9:00 am


LinkedIn has augmented the generative AI features of its Premium service with an eye toward boosting personalization and productivity for subscribers. The revamped experience uses advanced analytics to provide tailored insights, career recommendations, and other enhancements.
Generating Personalized Explanations
LinkedIn leverages generative AI to examine content, including posts, articles, and videos, uncovering potential opportunities for the user and and ideas they may find interesting. The AI will even suggest ways the user can take action based on the information pulled from the content. This automated extraction can save time if a user doesn’t want to go through a long piece of is looking for something specific, a kind of personal ‘too long; didn’t read’ summary. The feature also employs Microsoft Bing’s generative AI to answer queries about trending topics, in general, then culled from expert perspectives both on LinkedIn and across the web.
The other new generative AI feature for Premium subscribers helps with seeking a job. When looking at a job post, users can ask about whether they are a fit for the role and the AI will personalize its response to their experience. Users can also learn more about the position, company, and industry by conversing with LinkedIn’s AI, and even get help with preparing or the interview. LinkedIn suggests integrating these formerly disjointed steps into a single interface can build user confidence and boost the potential for a successful career move.
“Whether you’re navigating career changes, building a business, learning a new skill or crafting your voice, your new AI-powered LinkedIn experience — your trusted coach, advisor, co-pilot, assistant, and colleague combined — is your partner in staying ahead,” LinkedIn chief product officer Tomer Cohen explained in a blog post. “Today, we’re starting this journey with the rollout of a new Premium experience, launching to a select group of Premium subscribers. These members will see more personalization with every interaction, from how to get smarter about important topics to personalized career actions they can take. It will include personalized takeaways and nudges, from suggestions for skills you should build, to professionals in your network to reach out to for any question you have (we’ll even help you craft personalized messages to kickstart those conversations).”
LinkedIn AI Everywhere
The new generative features continue LinkedIn’s ongoing infusion of the technology across its platform. LinkedIn began the year by offering to turn written prompts into profile content, job descriptions, and advertising copy. The tools later expanded to helping users write posts and updates on the social media platform, including professional news and comments on the industry. LinkedIn’s latest upgrade introduced several such tools to enhance its recruiting, skill-building, and marketing platforms just last month.
The company is initially rolling out the revamped Premium to a small test group as it gathers feedback to refine the experience before expanding availability. The goal is to provide members with greater value through ever-more tailored insights and suggestions from AI-enabled interactions.

                      View the entire AI and Democracy series
                    



In 2017, during a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) public comment period, bots flooded the agency with more than a million comments from fake constituents calling for the repeal of net neutrality rules. Regulators uncovered this covert attempt to subvert the policy process, but only because hundreds of thousands of the comments were uncannily similar. In the six years since, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have only grown more sophisticated, and similar efforts to deceive policymakers promise to become increasingly difficult to detect and prevent. This troubling risk and its implications for participatory government call for urgent action.
The practice of open and responsive government is integral to the American tradition. Underlying it is the principle that the public should have ample access to information and opportunity to weigh in on important policy decisions. New technologies, from the invention of the telegraph to the explosion of social media, have produced new pathways for public democratic engagement. Yet these same technologies often create new tools that can be used to misrepresent public opinion and distort policymaking. AI is no exception.
As with prior technological revolutions, developments in AI hold promise: in time, they could enhance government’s ability to understand what the public wants and to help citizens participate in policy decisions. In particular, automated summation and analysis could be deployed to augment officials’ capacity to digest public feedback. But these potential benefits can only be realized alongside guardrails to ensure that AI systems are accurate and fit for the purposes at hand, to prevent system biases from reflecting sociohistorical inequities and diminishing the voices of specific communities, and to mitigate the effects when such outcomes occur.
The FCC episode exemplifies how antagonists can use AI tools to undermine authentic public input on government decision-making. New developments in generative AI enable vastly more sophisticated mass deception efforts that effectively mimic individuals’ feedback on public policy, begetting the danger that officials will be duped or diverted by hard-to-detect AI-generated content. Using generative AI, fraudsters can produce mountains of seemingly genuine policy submissions from fake stakeholders to manipulate perceptions of public sentiment. If maliciously deployed at sufficient scale, such efforts can erode government’s ability to be responsive to the American people — and ultimately undermine the people’s trust in government. Public officials who administer elections, meanwhile, face acute risks that bad faith actors will exploit AI tools to amplify baseless concerns about the election process, distract from voter needs ahead of (or on) Election Day, or drown offices in bot-delivered document requests that are difficult to identify as AI-generated.
These hazards require targeted policy intervention. To address these concerns, government institutions should take the following steps:

Implement high-accuracy systems to verify human activity where feasible, with special attention to accessibility and data privacy.
Expand accessible opportunities for in-person participation in government decision-making, including open public hearings and town halls.
Consistently implement surveys directed to known constituents, such as those who have utilized government services or received public benefits, to get feedback on program implementation.
Modify applicable laws and rules so that agencies have the authority to disregard document requests and submissions on proposed regulations shown to have been fraudulently transmitted by bots or automated systems, including those powered by generative AI.
Establish guardrails to regulate governmental use of AI to analyze, summarize, or aggregate public comments or substantially assist in the drafting of rules or public policy, including by setting requirements to guard against bias and ensure accuracy.
Engage regularly with civic organizations to better understand how stakeholders and constituents are using AI to interact with and advocate to government.

Citizen Participation and Government Responsiveness: AI as a Tool to Distort Perceptions of Public Sentiment 
As the political theorist Robert Dahl famously observed, “a key characteristic of democracy is the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens.” Politicians, pundits, and scholars alike have long debated whether American government fulfills this promise. Historically, much of the focus has been on forces that undermine citizens’ ability to choose their leaders — like outright mass disenfranchisement, legislative malapportionment, and gerrymandering — along with forces that shape incentives for public officials, like the outsize role of wealthy campaign donors and the corollary risk of corruption. Yet a basic prerequisite for responsiveness is the ability of officials to assess what the public actually wants. Before policymakers can address constituent preferences, they must first be able to glean what those preferences are.
Of course, policymakers have a range of tools to help them understand what the public wants. Some of these tools, like opinion polls, are relatively insulated from distortion by AI (at least for now). But other methods are far more vulnerable to AI manipulation than polling, particularly when polling relies on methods such as address-based recruitment. And polling’s limitations — including its meager ability to capture nuanced positions and views rendered in detail — are well known, which is why methods of direct engagement with the public and solicitation of public input are still essential. Here, we briefly consider two vulnerable tools for learning citizens’ inclinations: correspondence directed to elected officials and online public comments submitted to regulatory agencies. 
Elected officials from presidents to county commissioners have long relied on written communications to keep a finger on the pulse of their constituents, especially the subset of informed voters attuned to a particular issue. In the past, outside groups have tried to skew assessments of constituent sentiment through astroturfing, the process of recruiting individuals to send often-prewritten form letters to give the false appearance of bona fide grassroots sentiment. However, generative AI allows malicious actors to create, with ease and on a massive scale, unique communications from fake constituents ostensibly advocating policy positions, which greatly complicates the task of detecting efforts to skew perceptions of popular preferences. 
Can elected officials discern AI-generated content from authentic, human-authored constituent mail? Recent research suggests not. In 2020, researchers conducted a field experiment in which they sent roughly 35,000 emails advocating positions on a range of policy issues to more than 7,000 state legislators. Half were written by humans; the other half were written by GPT-3, the then-cutting-edge generative AI model. To explore whether legislators could recognize AI-generated content, the study compared response rates to the human-written and AI-generated correspondence (on the theory that legislators would not waste their time responding to appeals from AI bots). On three issues, the response rates for AI- and human-written messages were statistically indistinguishable. On three other issues, the response rates to AI-generated emails were lower — but only by 2 percent on average.
This finding suggests that an antagonist capable of easily generating thousands of unique communications could potentially skew legislators’ perceptions of the issues most important to their constituents and of constituents’ views on any given issue. Moreover, many of the inconsistencies and problems that some legislators reported as helping them identify suspicious content are becoming less prevalent with more advanced AI models. For example, GPT-3 struggled with logical consistency in writing an email taking a conservative position on gun control legislation, but GPT-4’s updated algorithms are better equipped to avoid such issues. State-of-the-art open-source models, too, are now advanced enough for these writing tasks, making it difficult — if not impossible — to put the genie back in the bottle. 
Generative AI could also threaten democratic responsiveness by undermining the main mechanism for incorporating public input into the regulatory process: the public comment period. Administrative agencies play a vital role in policymaking — particularly at the federal level — but their relative insulation from electoral politics can raise concerns about accountability to the public. The notice-and-comment process, while far from perfect, is one of the principal tools that unelected agency officials use to assess public preferences during agency rulemaking. Technology, especially the advent of e-rulemaking in 2002, has long been heralded as a way to address concerns about democratic accountability by “enhanc[ing] public participation . . . so as to foster better regulatory decisions.” The Regulations.gov website, the official clearinghouse for information related to agency rulemaking, invites ordinary citizens to “Make a difference. Submit your comments and let your voice be heard.” 
But as the bot-driven disruption of the FCC’s net neutrality rulemaking shows, this process is susceptible to subversion. Whereas a crush of comments with suspiciously similar language patterns unmasked the net neutrality scheme, new generative AI technologies can easily overcome this problem by creating millions of unique and varied comments advancing a given policy position. As a result, agencies will find it much more difficult to determine which comments genuinely represent prevailing public sentiment, or even the views of the most directly interested stakeholders. 
Recognizing the threat that malicious AI use poses, technology firms are racing to produce tools that can identify AI-generated text. However, the challenges to doing so effectively are difficult and protean. In July 2023, OpenAI discontinued its AI classifier tool because of its limited accuracy. Given the requirements regarding public comments enshrined in the Administrative Procedures Act, only a highly accurate screening tool would likely pass muster in the context of federal rulemaking processes. And even if future advances succeed in producing reliable and effective tools, access to and ability to use them may vary across offices and levels of government.
Election-Specific Challenges: AI as a Tool to Divert Resources and Distort Perceptions of Public Need 
Generative AI’s potential to disrupt the work of election offices poses a major risk to democracy. Open records laws (also called sunshine laws) are vital transparency tools that let the public peer into the inner workings of government and hold officials accountable. But in past election cycles, election deniers have weaponized such laws to distract and overload officials at some election offices, supplanting the important work of election administration at crucial junctures. In the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections, citizens mobilized by well-funded and conspiracy-addled national groups — with connections to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — inundated local election offices with document requests. Some such requests sought sensitive information like cast vote records, election security protocols, or voting machine serial numbers. While state public records laws may rightly prevent election offices from disclosing information that endangers election security, local officials do not universally know what information must or must not be disclosed in response to requests for records. In the future, election deniers and other malicious actors could step up such efforts by deploying bots powered by generative AI. State laws typically do not limit the use of bots to submit mass-produced requests, nor do they permit officials to decline to respond to automated mass-produced requests — even if the intent is to divert officials’ attention from the critical work of administering elections ahead of Election Day.
Election offices also depend on public input to deliver relevant information about elections and to prioritize tasks in the face of extremely limited resources. Election officials must know about the needs of people with disabilities, minority language groups, and other disadvantaged communities — particularly when those groups encounter issues attempting to register to vote or cast a ballot on Election Day. Officials must also be aware of common areas of confusion about how to vote and be able to effectively address concerns about election security among target groups. 
Malicious use of generative AI could put those essential roles at risk. Deceptive AI-generated mass comments that distort or drown out genuine public questions and feedback could result in inadequate support for needful voters and misdirected voter education efforts. They could also add fuel to restrictive voter rules that create more barriers to voting by creating the impression that baseless fears about the election process are more prevalent; in the past, disinformation purveyors have exploited unfounded fears about election integrity to push through policies that restrict voting access without legitimate justification. AI-assisted distortion of perceived public need could thus make election officials less responsive to voters, less able to communicate vital election information, and less likely to give voters information about the matters they care about most.
Cause for (Tempered) Optimism: AI’s Potential Benefits for Participatory and Responsive Government and Needed Guardrails
If generative AI and other AI tools pose risks for participatory and responsive government, they also present opportunities — most notably their potential to help policymakers better manage and respond to comments, feedback, and questions from the public. But governmental use of AI to substantially assist in sensitive tasks also warrants standards to prevent improper, biased, or inaccurate results. (Substantially assist means employing an AI system to perform a task more complex than, say, alphabetizing documents or sorting them by date or file size.)
Government offices already use non-generative AI to provide information to the public and to respond in real time to constituents seeking information or services. Many government bodies in the United States and elsewhere use AI-powered chatbots to provide 24/7 constituent assistance. Typically not powered by generative AI, these tools tend to be rule-based chatbots that recognize keywords and churn out pre-vetted responses, or conversational agents (similar to Apple’s Siri) that use machine learning and natural language processing to assist constituents. Although chatbots often face public resistance — more than half of respondents expressed negative views about interacting with them in one survey — as they improve, these non-generative-AI technologies could help governments conserve resources and be more responsive if offices implement adequate safeguards to ensure their proper use.
Policymakers at every level of government take in a large volume of outreach from the public that strains the ability of already overstretched staff to respond. These challenges have been thoroughly documented in the context of federal rulemaking. Agencies can receive tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of comments on a particular proposed policy, most of which receive perfunctory treatment. Local administrative bodies similarly struggle to respond to citizen communication requests, feedback, and questions. For example, in an audit of responsiveness to requests for information about how to apply for public housing, around 40 percent of requests, on average, received no reply. Fielding outreach from the public is also a major focus for Congress and state and local legislatures. The Congressional Management Foundation has estimated that many congressional offices dedicate roughly 50 percent of staff resources to managing and responding to constituent communications.
Responding to public outreach imposes opportunity costs on government offices, but neglecting to do so is also problematic. Failure to receive a response from government officials can erode citizens’ perceptions of officials’ political efficacy and cause constituents to become more disengaged from the political process. In some cases, it can have even more immediate and tangible consequences, such as citizens not finding information or assistance needed to receive benefits they are entitled to. It can be especially troubling when nonelected government officials ignore or pass over messages from the public. In the federal rulemaking context, the well-documented tendency of regulators to discount most comments that focus on policy preferences or values in favor of a few relatively detailed technical comments (often from industry or other established stakeholders) arguably undercuts the democratic legitimacy of administrative decisions affecting millions of people’s lives. It also tends to skew policy outcomes in favor of more powerful constituencies with the resources to amass the sort of technical information that agency staff are likely to respond to. 
AI could potentially address these shortcomings and improve agency rulemaking processes. Several recent articles have explored how new AI tools could help agency staff review and summarize the thousands or even millions of public comments received in high-profile rulemakings. For instance, regulators could use language models trained on the corpus of materials and comments relevant to rulemakings to assist in processing, synthesizing, and summarizing information provided by the public. This strategy could nudge regulators to consider more value-focused comments in crafting policy. AI tools could improve other aspects of the notice-and-comment process as well — for example, by helping regulators detect and screen out automated, misattributed, or otherwise spurious comments (though significant challenges with detection of AI-generated content persist, as described above). And, although American commentators have mostly focused on the use of AI in regulatory processes, national legislatures in other countries are also experimenting with ways to use AI to collect and organize citizen input.
Generative AI could also facilitate citizen engagement with government officials during the notice-and-comment process. Some analysts have suggested that AI could be used to alert potential commenters to topics of interest, help them review rule text, summarize technical literature, and even compose comments. Such tools could also help members of the public who would otherwise lack the time or confidence to participate in the public comment process. Again, however, issues related to the accuracy, bias, and quality of information produced by generative AI must be addressed. 
The potential benefits notwithstanding, the use of more sophisticated machine-learning and language-processing AI tools — even those not powered by generative AI — carries significant risks. AI systems need adequate testing, vetting of training data quality, and human oversight to ensure that they provide accurate, accessible, and beneficial information to the public. Bias is a major concern. For instance, an AI bot employed by a local government might provide different answers to constituents writing in about city services based on the neighborhoods they live in. Or an AI conversational agent might struggle to process certain accents or vernacular languages — scenarios that could differentially affect poor communities, communities of color, and non-English-dominant communities. 
Guardrails governing AI’s use for these purposes are imperative. Using AI to review, summarize, and screen public comments presents the same accuracy and bias concerns as its use in other contexts. People are justifiably squeamish at the thought of AI replacing human deliberation in government decision-making. One concern is that “no one at the agency [will] actually read the comments and grapple[] with their arguments.” And AI tools could be used not only to review and summarize comments but also to generate responses to justify an agency’s predetermined approach. Enforceable standards are needed to ensure that AI tools review and summarize comments accurately and without bias, and also to keep human decision-makers active in the thinking work of responding to those comments and, where warranted, incorporating them into final policy decisions. 
Policy Solutions 
Implement Accurate, Effective Systems to Verify Human Activity, with Special Attention to Accessibility and Data Privacy
Governing bodies should implement policies that guard against the malicious use of bots to lodge mass AI-generated comments intended to warp officials’ perceptions of public sentiment. Systems that verify human activity can achieve this in part, but they can also add friction for users, create data privacy concerns, and decrease access for Americans with disabilities. Most federal agencies invite public comments on rulemakings via Regulations.gov, which employs the reCAPTCHA human verification system to bolster the integrity of the comment submission process. (CAPTCHA stands for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart.”) Although not foolproof, reCAPTCHA helps distinguish between human and bot activity. Regulations.gov uses a new generation of reCAPTCHA that increases accessibility over prior generations, presenting users with a simple “Are you a robot?” checkbox as a first-order challenge while analyzing user behavior to identify signs of bot activity. However, at least one study has found that this version of reCAPTCHA still introduces obstacles for people with visual impairments; it also collects some user data in determining whether users are human. 
Government entities — including Congress, state agencies, and departments that administer open records laws — should incorporate human verification systems into their processes for inviting public comments and receiving document requests. Officials should continually assess CAPTCHA and other verification methods as system capabilities evolve, selecting those that maximize security and accessibility. Officials should pay close attention to the evolving use of generative AI to defeat existing CAPTCHA systems and the need for novel systems to replace them. Laws and regulations should mandate minimal, task-necessary data collection and retention, forbid offices from sharing collected data, and compel periodic deletion of captured constituent data. Government offices and verification system vendors should also be required to disclose details about data collection and storage (without substantially compromising system efficacy by revealing to would-be fraudsters how to circumvent defenses). And government offices should provide alternate submission and verification methods for people with disabilities and those without access to technology or high-speed internet.
Create Opportunities for In-Person Participation and Direct Surveys to Known Constituents 
As the problem of deceptive bot-generated public comments becomes more disruptive, governing bodies should explore modes of participation that are relatively impervious to distortion through generative AI. Opportunities for in-person participation could include public hearings, town halls, and other similar forums. Public hearings and town halls should be held in locations, within regions, and at times that allow a broad cross section of the public to participate. Governing institutions should implement best practices to increase access for people with disabilities, communities of color, and immigrant communities. Such best practices should include offering simultaneous interpretation by interpreters familiar with relevant policy terminology where non-English-dominant communities constitute a threshold percentage of the constituent public; providing American Sign Language interpreters and other appropriate public accommodations; and ensuring, where possible, that hearings are reachable by public transportation.
Because town halls and public hearings typically lack representativeness and are limited in scope, agencies and governing bodies should also consistently incorporate tools like surveys directed to known constituents — for example, those who have utilized government services or applied for public benefits — to capture public insight, sentiment, and feedback. Such surveys would offer valuable feedback on program implementation and service delivery. Officials should conduct survey outreach in a way that enhances the integrity and inclusiveness of the information-gathering process while not unduly burdening recipients. To mitigate the risk of distortion through deceptive AI use, online surveys should employ effective, accessible, and privacy-protecting human verification systems, and they could be offered on a uniform cross-agency platform.
Authorize Government Entities to Disregard Input on Proposed Regulations Transmitted via Fraudulent Use of Bots or Automated Systems 
The federal Administrative Procedure Act, state administrative laws, and open records laws require that governing bodies consider submissions from the public on proposed rules within defined time spans and provide timely responses to document requests, with certain exceptions. Currently, however, no exception exists for comments and requests submitted using AI tools with the intent to distort policymaking or divert resources. When evidence strongly indicates that comments on proposed rules or records requests have been transmitted duplicitously using bots or automated systems, federal and state laws should allow agencies to decline to consider those submissions and requests. 
Regulations and policies governing fraudulent AI use should cover the impersonation or replication of human activity using bots or other automated systems that significantly mispresents the scale of human involvement behind their output. Such a standard should not capture, for instance, the use of generative AI by an individual or organization to assist in the drafting of comments or the use of form letters when endorsed by actual humans — a benchmark that might negatively affect disadvantaged communities. Rather, it should implicate the use of bots or automated systems, powered by generative AI or otherwise, to transmit numerous policy submissions intended to skew official perceptions of the numbers of humans involved in submitting such content or to convey open records requests from nonexistent people. Ample notice and opportunity for appeal should be given for any such determination. Given the current limitations of detection capabilities for generative AI content, and detection tools’ documented history of misclassifying content from non-native English speakers, detection tools should not be deployed unless they meet rigorous standards.
Establish Guardrails for Governmental Use of AI to Analyze Public Comments or Substantially Assist in Drafting Rules or Public Policy 
While AI presents opportunities to enhance policymakers’ responsiveness to their constituents, it can also introduce risks of bias, inaccuracy, and unreliability that must be addressed before such systems are put into use. Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state agencies should implement safeguards for governmental AI use to mitigate these risks, including enforceable requirements that apply to government use of AI to analyze public comments, interact with constituents, and substantially assist in the drafting of regulations, laws, and policies. For federal use of AI, Congress should direct the Organization of Management and Budget (OMB) to promulgate regulations setting out minimum thresholds for quality of training data and AI system accuracy — including standards that address bias deriving from reinforcement learning from human feedback, prohibit algorithmic discrimination as defined by regulation, and require a baseline level of human involvement in and supervision of government decision-making and public communications substantially aided by AI. Lawmakers should also limit the types of information that AI systems can examine when assessing public comments as part of rulemakings governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (for example, restricting the use of actual or predicted race to attempt to correlate sentiment with race).
Congress should also:

facilitate the development of testing methods to assess AI systems against the aforementioned requirements for the specific use of AI in analyzing public comment and drafting public policy;
mandate documentation by government bodies and AI system vendors of compliance with these requirements;
obligate government bodies to institute mitigation measures where needed, and prohibit the deployment of AI systems, including generative AI systems, for the purpose of analyzing public comment or drafting public policy, when they fail to meet established requirements and their flaws cannot be reasonably mitigated;
compel government bodies to continually monitor the use of AI systems after they are tested and implemented;
set transparency mandates for the use of AI to substantially assist in federal government decision-making and processes; and
require government bodies to disclose their use of AI systems, the purpose for their use, the main system parameters for sorting information or making predictions, the data sources used to train them, and the level of human involvement in and review of important AI-assisted decisions and public communications. 

Consistent with President Biden’s recent executive order on AI, OMB and the Office of Personnel Management should incorporate similar directives into guidance for federal agencies. And state legislatures should adopt comparable requirements for state government use of AI systems.
Seek to Better Understand How Constituents Use Generative AI to Compose Comments on Rulemakings and Other Policy Submissions 
Agencies should continually engage with civic organizations to ascertain how stakeholders from diverse communities are using AI to interface with government and to identify any gaps in public education and awareness. Civic organizations should provide guidance to constituents who wish to use generative AI to assist in composing comments on proposed rules and other policy submissions. They should offer advice on the necessary specificity of prompts, the need to review comments ahead of submission to ensure that they accurately reflect the commenters’ preferences, the prudence of fact-checking information produced by AI tools, the cultural biases inherent to some AI systems, and the possibility that AI tools will produce false or misdirected content or content that fails to reflect the constituents’ genuinely held views.

From defining job descriptions to vetting resumes, human resources and hiring managers spend hours to hire the right candidate for the role. Thanks to Generative AI-powered SAP SuccessFactors, a cloud-based human resource platform used across the industry, the hiring process is getting a much-needed makeover. Ahead of the SAP TechEd conference, the German multinational enterprise software company demonstrated several resource planning solutions at its Bengaluru office, which now benefits from generative AI capabilities. One such feature is the ability to publish a job opening with the help of the built-in AI assistant named Joule. Among all the other fantastic use cases of generative AI, this specific implementation could make the lives of hiring managers, especially in big corporations, a lot easier. As part of the business AI demo, the SuccessFactors engineering and product management team showcased some use cases of Joule, SAP's AI copilot, where generative AI can help hiring managers create specific job profiles for a specific role with just simple inputs like skills required for the job. SAP also emphasised the fact that generative AI can shortlist candidates based solely on facts, without any personal bias. For example, for the role of an AI engineer, one needs to have experiences like machine learning and natural language processing, which are already available within the SuccessFactors skills library. With a simple prompt, Joule AI-assistant, powered by Azure Open AI LLM can enhance the content to increase the visibility of the job opening. The hiring manager can then take the job description as input and ask Joule to generate interview questions, which will be general high-level questions. Managers can also add their own validations to these inputs. The company was also very specific that the program does not use the resume of the person due to data privacy requirements. Once joined, the AI-enabled SuccessFactors can be used to update profiles, like adding pronouns, requesting feedback, and based on the topic, Joule can suggest questions to the user.",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'The Indian Express', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/', 'foundingDate': '1932', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://indianexpress.com/privacy-policy/', 'SameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.youtube.com/@indianexpress', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express/'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/11/ienewlogo3_new.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/section/technology/', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/section/technology/artificial-intelligence/', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}]","['Home', 'Subscribe', 'India News', 'Cities', 'Videos', 'Audio', 'Explained', 'Education', 'Political Pulse', 'Opinion', 'Entertainment', 'Investigations', 'Lifestyle', 'Technology', 'Sports', 'Express Premium', 'Latest News', 'World News', 'Trending', 'Photos', 'Elections 2023', 'Web Stories', 'Bollywood', 'Cricket', 'Science', 'Business', 'Horoscope', 'Delhi News', 'Mumbai News', 'Hyderabad News', 'Bengaluru News', 'What Is', 'When Is', 'Who Is', 'How To', ""Today's Paper"", 'Brand Solutions']",,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/sap-successfactors-generativeai-capabilities-9009288/,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",,"['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEDFSxHHOW1PpBccdSxOTA']","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/sap-successfactors-generativeai-capabilities-9009288/'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.ie-premium-content-block', 'video': [], 'audio': []}",,,,,,technology,,,,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",2024.0,en,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}",,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",,1932.0,,,,,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}",,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,"{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/sap-successfactors-generative-ai.jpg', 'caption': 'SuccessFactors is an HR solution by SAP (Image credit: Vivek Umashankar/The Indian Express)', 'description': 'SAP TechEd', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Box AI Capabilities, Powered by Vertex AI

Box has chosen to integrate with Vertex AI, Google Cloud’s unified AI platform, to help customers process and analyze data faster, create more personalized user experiences, intelligent search, and more.


Building on the earlier announcement that Box will integrate Google Cloud’s advanced large-language models (LLMs) into Box AI, Box will now use Vertex AI to help power its new metadata extraction feature. The new feature, coming first as an API, will save customers’ time inputting and maintaining data by automatically identifying and tagging key context from their documents, including matching metadata fields to attributes within a file. Soon, customers will be able to:



Automatically classify and label documents at scale to surface key insights, such as contracts nearing their expiration and invoices requiring payment within the current month.



Define metadata templates to extract information for custom use cases, such as automatically recognizing and tagging products in images or categorizing PII in specific types.



Populate defined metadata templates and integrate with ERP and CRM systems to automate workflows such as invoicing, executing contracts, client and employee onboarding, and more.



Identify and preserve critical information, such as timestamps, authorship, and document versions history, to maintain compliance protocols.



Recognize and extract metadata in different languages to ensure consistent term recognition while operating in different countries and regions.



Box is Now Available on Google Cloud Marketplace

As part of the expanded partnership, Box is now also available on Google Cloud Marketplace, making it even easier for customers using Google Cloud infrastructure to purchase Box’s content management platform. With the Box app available on Google Cloud Marketplace, eligible customers can realize key benefits including:



Reduced procurement cycles allowing for faster, smoother, and simpler buying process.



Consolidated Google Cloud billing.



Cost savings against existing Google Cloud commitments when purchased through Google Cloud Marketplace.



Box Expands Its Use of Google Cloud

Box already leverages Google Cloud as a key infrastructure provider for data storage and compute globally. Now, Box will expand its usage of Google Cloud by adopting several new services across networking, data analytics, and machine learning to deliver faster performance and higher-reliability to its customers. For example, Box is now applying:



Google Cloud as a storage option for Box KeySafe, which enables Box customers to use their own encryption key within Box. This provides customers with more choice over where they maintain their encryption keys.



Google Cloud’s global networking infrastructure to power Box network communication with customers, resulting in faster content transfers and increased productivity for customers around the world.



Cloud Bigtable for improved performance and uptime for the core data systems that power Box. This enables Box to deliver its customers with a more reliable service to secure and manage all of their content needs.



Google Cloud BigQuery to power Box's data application, analytics, and insights. With BigQuery, Box can now deliver more comprehensive data-driven insights to customers faster.



Google Workspace Integrations

The expanded partnership builds on existing integrations with Google Workspace, which lets Box customers create, collaborate, and save content in Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides from the secure Box Content Cloud platform. Additionally, the Box for Google Workspace add-on enables smooth and secure productivity and collaboration across Google Workspace, including Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. With these integrations, customers can:



Create, open, and edit content using Google Workspace’s collaboration tools directly within Box.



Add Box files directly to emails and save email attachments to Box without leaving Gmail.



Include Box files and link Box Notes directly to your Google Calendar events.



Save files in Google Drive to Box.



Apply Box’s enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance capabilities to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.



Pricing and Availability

Box is available on Google Cloud Marketplace today. The new Box AI metadata extraction API functionality is expected to begin rolling out to Box Enterprise Plus plan users in beta next year. The Box for Google Workspace integration and add-on is available for all Box and Workspace users today.

As the digital revolution rapidly reshapes the tech talent landscape with ever-evolving AI tools, companies are strategically adapting to meet future workforce demands. Generative AI has emerged as a driving force across diverse sectors, from manufacturing and finance to healthcare and automobiles, streamlining manual processes and sparking innovation.How is Generative AI transforming workplaces?Generative AI's constant evolution is reshaping skill requirements, urging the adoption of new abilities. In 2026, this evolution will create fresh opportunities in India, with a demand for over 1 million AI/ML/Big Data analytics professionals.To address this shift, upskilling is crucial. It equips employees to navigate generative AI's impact and overcome skill gaps. Surprisingly, despite the pressing need for new skills, 78% of Indian workers lack these critical capabilities, despite 90% of Indian leaders recognizing the need for new skills in preparation for AI-driven growth.How to minimise the impact of AI on jobs?Foster upskilling: By providing opportunities for employees to enhance their skills, organisations can not only boost productivity but also drive innovation with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Identify skill gaps: In order to navigate the ever-changing job market, it is essential for employees to actively seek career guidance and regularly assess their skills. By understanding their current skill set and identifying any gaps, employees can take proactive measures to bridge those gaps and ensure they remain competitive and adaptable in their respective fields.Harbour capabilities with AI: Creativity in training AI involves thinking outside the box and leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance our own, rather than viewing it as a threat. By fostering a collaborative environment, we can guide AI to work in harmony with us, thereby unlocking new possibilities and driving innovation.Cross-Industry collaboration: By fostering collaboration between industries, we can share best practices and strategies for integrating AI. This not only helps in preserving existing jobs but also paves the way for creating new ones. It encourages a collective growth mindset, where industries learn from each other's successes and mistakes, leading to more effective AI integration strategies that benefit everyone.According to Jagmohan Bhanver, Founder &amp; CEO, Talgro, ""Upskilling is crucial in the ever-changing Indian and global industries. It's vital to recognize that generative AI can assist in reducing employee burnout stemming from manual tasks. Embracing AI within companies and acquiring new skill sets can lead to increased productivity and innovation, positively impacting businesses. And with Talgro, we ensure that businesses and employees flourish by tailoring skills to individual needs, fostering adaptation and growth.""With AI constantly advancing, it is essential to upskill in order to cope with evolving job requirements and overcome any limitations. Talgro, an online assessment partner for the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), has clocked over 500,000 users on its platform. Talgro, India's First skill assessment platform, uses AI-powered systems to help people upskill and stay updated. With a team of over 300 mentors, including industry experts, Talgro provides comprehensive support to companies looking to enhance their employees' proficiency in AI. They offer personalised learning and pre/post-assessment tools to drive effective upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Talgro also offers a diverse selection of over 30 courses that cover both perishable and durable skills, empowering individuals to adapt to today's rapidly evolving job landscape.(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN. will not be responsible in any way for the content of the same)",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'ANI', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry', 'name': 'Industry'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/85-million-jobs-under-threat-navigating-the-impact-of-ai-on-the-workforce/104911549', 'name': '85 Million jobs under threat: Navigating the impact of AI on the workforce'}}]",ETHRWorldSEA,,https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,contactus@ethrworld.com,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/85-million-jobs-under-threat-navigating-the-impact-of-ai-on-the-workforce/104911549'}",,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-31T10:27:12+05:30,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Autonomy, such a policy could also help to avoid mass unemployment and reduce widespread mental and physical illnesses.Will Stronge, the director of research at Autonomy, said: “Too many studies of AI, large language models, and so on, solely focus on either profitability or a jobs apocalypse. This study tries to show that when the technology is deployed to its full potential, but the purpose of the technology is shifted, it can not only improve work practices, but also improve work-life balance.”The research found that 28 million workers, or 88% of Great Britain’s workforce, could have their working hours reduced by at least 10% through the introduction of LLMs.The local authorities of City of London, Elmbridge and Wokingham are among those that, according to the thinktank, hold the highest potential for workers, with 38% or more of the workforce able to reduce their hours in the coming decade.AI is coming for our jobs! Could universal basic income be the solution?Read moreA similar study conducted in the US, also by Autonomy, found that 35 million American workers could also move to a four-day week inside the same time frame. It found that 128 million workers, 71% of the workforce, could have their working hours reduced by at least 10%. States including Massachusetts, Utah and Washington were found to have the potential for a quarter or more of their workforces to move to a four-day week using LLMs.Congressman Mark Takano, who has introduced a 32-hour work week bill to the US Congress, said: “Fundamental changes are coming to our workforce due to AI and automation. It will take government action to ensure gains in efficiency are felt by all workers, regardless of industry or skill level.”In the UK and the US, Autonomy calls on public- and private-sector employers to take advantage of a “significant opportunity to become world leaders in the take-up of workplace AI”, and to view this as an opportunity to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of workers. It also calls on policymakers to take action.Stronge said: “What I think would be really impressive would be a robust AI industrial strategy, with automation hubs where trade unions, industry and experts in this tech get together to say: ‘We’re going to boost productivity, and this is also going to be something which delivers for the workers.’”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workArtificial intelligence (AI)Work-life balanceComputingWork & careersnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris – reportBeyoncé gives permission to Kamala Harris to use song on campaign trail – report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It argued that 47% of American jobs were at risk of automation. A deluge of research followed, which suggested the poorest and least-educated workers were most vulnerable to the coming revolution. Such fears have intensified as artificial-intelligence (ai) capabilities have leapt ahead.

Generative AI won't replace data analysts


Generative AI isn't going to replace data analysts. It can help analysts be more effective, but it lacks human insights and knowledge to properly do the job.

Generative AI will not replace data analyst jobs, nor will it replace people in many other fields, especially ones requiring human empathy and insight. Data analysis may seem like a technical role on a surface level, but the reality of the job is nuanced.







The process involves more than crunching numbers; it requires an understanding of the human elements behind the data. Whether it's analyzing customer behavior or detecting fraudulent activity, a human analyst's ability to empathize and understand the motivations, fears, ambitions and interests of others can lead to compelling insights. Insights can go beyond what is immediately apparent in the raw data and require an element of human judgment and understanding that AI currently lacks.
AI can process massive amounts of data and provide quantitative analysis. It cannot understand the subtleties of human behavior, cultural nuances or the complexities of human motivations and desires. Human factors often have a significant effect on the data and are areas where human analysts excel.
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard can simulate text generation to a human-like standard, and they have the potential to automate some of the tasks that data analysts currently perform. Generative AI also has limitations, such as its inability to understand the full context of data. As a result, data analysts must interpret the results of generative AI and make decisions based on the data.

Current abilities and limits of generative AI
Generative AI cannot perform the nuanced work of analysts. Analyst work requires a synthesis of visual, numerical and tacit knowledge, which analysts cannot convey through text alone. The training data that generative AI models use limits the text that they can generate. Generative AI also cannot analyze raw data or produce original visualizations, and any insights it provides come from language patterns in the training data.
Another concern with generative AI models is accuracy. Without human oversight, the text outputs from AI can contain logical gaps, biased perspectives and factual errors it inherits from the training data. Accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training data. Biased or inaccurate training data causes the data sets to be biased or inaccurate as well.
AI models struggle to keep up with the real world: Training or retraining a model takes a great deal of computing power, time and money. As the world changes, the AI model falls behind until it's retrained. Even GPT-4 is only trained on data up to 2021. The irony is ChatGPT has little insight into its effects on business, the economy and intellectual life since its launch in November 2022.
Generative AI models also lack the critical thinking skills and insight to question the validity or relevance of its source material, which is an essential skill for a data analyst. A core component of data literacy is checking the quality of data and identifying potential biases.
As a result of limitations, generative AI models should not be a substitute for human analysts. Instead, the models are a tool to help analysts generate text, identify patterns and explore data. With human oversight, generative AI models can be an asset. Without human engagement, they mostly churn out repetitive, formulaic summaries of their existing knowledge.


How generative AI affects the analyst role
It will be some time before AI replaces human analysts because of its limitations. But human analysts can use AI as a valuable assistant in their work right now.
Code generation
Generative AI can suggest code to extract, clean and analyze data, which helps automate some repetitive tasks. It lacks the deep understanding of context, business goals and interdependencies required to design complex, scalable and maintainable code architectures. It can help an analyst who may need to work in multiple languages or diverse architectures, generating helpful code for quick review.
Data modeling
Given the right information, AI can propose data structures such as tables, especially for analytic schemas such as stars and snowflakes. Although AI can identify patterns within data and suggest tables, the task of defining efficient and effective data structures often needs human intervention.
AI can struggle to get it right the first time because it does not have the same understanding of the data as a human analyst. An analyst understands the nature of the data, its relationships and how to best model it for a specific use case. Analysts' knowledge is essential for defining efficient and effective data structures. It might be too much work to describe the necessary details to the AI program, but the human analyst can work with an intuition for potential use cases.
Human analysts often are wrong on the first iteration too, but they start with a richer understanding of the problem.
One interesting use of AI is to recommend analytical methods. Analysts must validate the suitability of a suggested method for the problem, account for business needs, data constraints and possibly even budget constraints for compute and storage.
Suppose an AI system is analyzing customer purchase data to increase sales. It sifts through massive data sets and identifies a pattern: Customers who buy a laptop often also buy a wireless mouse. Consequently, the AI recommends that bundling the products together in a promotional offer might lead to increased sales.



Smart analysts can use AI as a tool to augment their abilities rather than perceive it as a threat to their roles.




The human data analyst -- using specific business knowledge and experience -- can complement the AI-generated insight. They know that the laptop has a high profit margin and the mouse has a low profit margin. A bundle could increase sales, but may dent overall profit. They might suggest a tweak to the AI's strategy: Instead of a bundle, offer the mouse at a discount, perhaps with a coupon, only after the customer has bought a laptop. The proposal maintains the profitability of the laptop and the overall sales might still increase due to the perceived deal. The human analyst can also provide context about supply chain constraints, seasonal trends or upcoming marketing campaigns the AI might not be aware of.
With new insight, analysts can prompt the AI again and see if it has more, or similar, recommendations.


The near-term future of AI in data analysis
AI can enhance -- rather than replace -- the role of data analysts. Analysts can dedicate more time to strategic work as automation helps carry out routine data tasks. But AI is not accountable for its own errors. Responsibility and blame still rest with humans.
Human judgment, coupled with a healthy dose of skepticism and business acumen, continue to be indispensable assets AI cannot replace. Smart analysts can use AI as a tool to augment their abilities rather than perceive it as a threat to their roles.
Today, AI can automate repetitive tasks, provide insights into large data sets, help draft initial reports, write code snippets and propose potential routes for analysis. As AI advances, the industry might look forward to more sophisticated assistance in data analysis. AI can suggest potential data sources, generate effective test data, or drive operational and tactical decisions.
Even if generative AI reduces the number of analysts required, the key role of the human analyst remains. Their knowledge of the specific context, ability to apply critical thinking and deep understanding of human needs remains, even with new advances. The human analyst's role is not obsolete. It's more essential to ensure their organization harnesses generative AI's potential effectively and responsibly.

When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it sparked many conversations and moral panics. These centre on the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the information environment. People worry that AI chatbots can negatively affect the integrity of creative and academic work, especially since they can produce human-like texts and images.
ChatGPT is a generative AI model using machine learning. It creates human-like responses, having been trained to recognise patterns in data. While it appears the model is engaging in natural conversation, it references a vast amount of data and extracts features and patterns to generate coherent replies.
Higher education is one sector in which the rise of AI like ChatGPT has sparked concerns. Some of these relate to ethics and integrity in teaching, learning and knowledge production. 
We’re a group of academics in the field of media and communication, teaching in South African universities. We wanted to understand how university students were using generative AI and AI-powered tools in their academic practices. We administered an online survey to undergraduate students at five South African universities: the University of Cape Town, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Stellenbosch University, Rhodes University, and the University of the Witwatersrand. 
The results suggest that the moral panics around the use of generative AI are unwarranted. Students are not hyper-focused on ChatGPT. We found that students often use generative AI tools for engaged learning and that they have a critical and nuanced understanding of these tools. 
What could be of greater concern from a teaching and learning perspective is that, second to using AI-powered tools for clarifying concepts, students are using them to generate ideas for assignments or essays or when they feel stuck on a specific topic. 
Unpacking the data
The survey was completed by 1,471 students. Most spoke English as their home language, followed by isiXhosa and isiZulu. The majority were first-year students. Most respondents were registered in Humanities, followed by Science, Education and Commerce. While the survey is thus skewed towards first-year Humanities students, it provides useful indicative findings as educators explore new terrain. 
We asked students whether they had used individual AI tools,  listing some of the most popular tools across several categories. Our survey did not explore lecturers’ attitudes or policies towards AI tools. This will be probed in the next phase of our study, which will comprise focus groups with students and interviews with lecturers. Our study was not on ChatGPT specifically, though we did ask students about their use of this specific tool. We explored broad uses of AI-powered technologies to get a sense of how students use these tools, which tools they use, and where ChatGPT fits into these practices. 
These were the key findings:

41% of respondents indicated that they primarily used a laptop for their academic work, followed by a smartphone (29.8%). Only 10.5% used a desktop computer and 6.6% used a tablet.
Students tended to use a range of other AI-powered tools over ChatGPT, including translation and referencing tools. With reference to the use of online writing assistants such as Quillbot, 46.5% of respondents indicated that they used such tools to improve their writing style for an assignment. 80.5% indicated that they had used Grammarly or similar tools to help them write in appropriate English. 
Fewer than half of survey respondents (37.3%) said that they had used ChatGPT to answer an essay question.
Students acknowledged that AI-powered tools could lead to plagiarism or affect their learning. However, they also stated that they did not use these tools in problematic ways.

      ChatGPT is the push higher education needs to rethink assessment





Respondents were overwhelmingly positive about the potential of digital and AI tools to make it easier for them to progress through university. They indicated that these tools could help to: clarify academic concepts; formulate ideas; structure essays; improve academic writing; save time; check spelling and grammar;  clarify assignment instructions; find information or academic sources; summarise academic texts; guide students for whom English is not a native language to improve their academic writing; study for a test; paraphrase better; avoid plagiarism; and reference better. 
Most students who viewed these tools as beneficial to the learning process used tools such as ChatGPT to clarify concepts related to their studies that they could not fully grasp or that they felt were not properly explained by lecturers.

Engaged learning
We were particularly interested to find that students often used generative AI tools for engaged learning. This is an educational approach in which students are accountable for their own learning. They actively create thinking and learning skills and strategies and formulate new ideas and understanding through conversations and collaborative work.

      'Please do not assume the worst of us': students know AI is here to stay and want unis to teach them how to use it




Through their use of AI tools, students can tailor content to address their specific strengths and weaknesses, to have a more engaged learning experience. AI tools can also be a sort of personalised online “tutor” with whom they have “conversations” to help them understand difficult concepts.
Concerns about how AI tools potentially undermine academic assessment and integrity are valid. However, those working in higher education must note the importance of factoring in students’ perspectives to work towards new pathways of assessment and learning.

The deliberate collision of two game-changing technologies has the potential to upend the technology industry and bring about a new era of business disruption and innovation. Few industries will be spared this transformation, and it will create completely new value and risks. Hyperbole? I don’t think so. In the future, artificial intelligence is likely to become supercharged by quantum computing. It’s a partnership that could change the world.


The growing wonder and value of artificial intelligence (AI), triggered by the broad availability of generative AI in late 2022, is understandable. Uses of this software such as the creation of remarkable human-like text and graphics can often exceed the hype. That’s saying something for the technology industry that too often gets ahead of itself. Frequent and mesmerizing new updates to generative AI and the innovation that quickly follows demonstrates that this technology is evolving at breakneck speed.

But, despite the introduction of faster microchips to feed its hunger, AI is ultimately constrained by our ability to continue to squeeze more processing power from silicon-based hardware. It’s just a limitation of physics. That said, let’s recognize that classical computing, based on transistors and electricity, has served us all well and powered the information age to date.

PROMOTED
If AI could be powered by a new generation of computing power—quantum processing—then it would leave today’s innovation in the dust.

That day may be coming sooner than you think. It may not be next year, but could we see practical applications within the next decade?
Quantum computing, an entirely new way of processing information, when combined with AI, has the potential, without exaggeration, to bring about a new computing revolution. Transformation may be an understatement.

Today, quantum computing isn’t a term that’s particularly familiar to those outside the technology and physics worlds, but it soon will be. This form of computing, still in its relative infancy, originates out of quantum mechanics, the behavior of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Leveraging this science to power a new form of computing began in earnest in the 1970s. By the 1980s, notable scientists such as Paul Benioff, Yuri Manin, Richard Feynman, and David Deutsch, established the core principles. By the late 1990s, the first functioning quantum computers emerged.

Instead of processing information in terms of 1s and 0s—called bits—and doing it serially, which is how classical computing works, quantum computers use qubits which can represent a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. Like a guitar, bits are similar to playing one note at a time, whereas, qubits play several notes together. With enough qubits, quantum computers could theoretically be millions of times faster than the fastest microchip computers today.

But quantum computing isn’t confined anymore to research labs, although technological hurdles must still be overcome. Big tech firms such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google, and many compelling market entrants such as IonQ and D-Wave Systems, provide capabilities that can be used today. That said, usage is still fairly specialized and often experimental in nature. Practical uses today can be found in pharmaceutical development, cybersecurity, financial services, and weather forecasting.
There’s a lot of optimism that the pace of quantum computing innovation will continue to accelerate, and we could see mainstream adoption by the end of the decade. That’s just around the corner.
Independent of artificial intelligence, quantum computing is going to be a big deal. However, coupled with AI, it will be a gamechanger.
Revolutionary innovation is not an exaggeration.
In the interim, work to integrate artificial intelligence with quantum computing will continue. Research is nascent and non-trivial technological hurdles exist.
Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) — and in particular, its subset research area Quantum Machine Learning (QML) — will use new quantum-designed algorithms with superpowers that result in much more powerful AI models. As QAI gradually emerges, we can expect significant improvements in the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of AI. We should also anticipate the emergence of completely new and surprising business capabilities.
At first, the benefits will be reaped by certain industries and needs, particularly those with optimization requirements. But later, as QAI becomes more mainstream, almost every enterprise will need to have a strategy.
An example of work-in-progress today is a partnership between IonQ and Hyundai who are researching the use of QAI to process images such as road signs.
For learning and experimenting, Google currently offers a platform, TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), for prototyping hybrid quantum-classical AI models.
Rather than playing catch-up when QAI arrives, organizations should have the technology on their radar and follow developments closely. Those lucky enough to have an innovation lab or equivalent, should consider some experimental and research work, if only for the purposes of acquiring skills and knowledge.
The high level of interest from industry and the pace of scientific research clearly suggests that QAI is coming, and the question will be whether you are ready. It’s probably closer than you think and it’s likely going to be a very big deal.

The answer depends on what we do todayNov 16, 202352% of workers surveyed by Randstad believe AI will help their career growth and promotion.Image: Getty Images/iStockphotoSander van't NoordendeCEO, RandstadShare:Our ImpactWhat's the World Economic Forum doing to accelerate action on Jobs and the Future of Work?Crowdsource InnovationGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scaleStay up to date:Jobs and SkillsFollowArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already encroaching on many people's lives and careers.Despite that, just 13% report that they have been offered training in AI-related skills.To manage the coming change to the world of work, we must examine how we approach training, define work, help employees transition and manage our social safety net.Artificial Intelligence (AI) will touch all of our lives sooner or later, and autonomous technology has already affected vast swaths of the global workforce in meaningful and subtle ways.However, with its full potential yet to be realized, workers are increasingly trying to establish whether AI is a friend or foe. The truth lies in between.AI is already affecting many people by helping them get work done more quickly and efficiently. It’s doing so by enhancing decision-making, communication, collaboration and other skills. At the same time, mass disruption of the labour market is expected in the near future.Have you read?Responsible AI governance can be achieved through multistakeholder collaborationAI is finding its voice and that's bad for democracy4 ways AI can super-charge sustainable developmentFriend or foe? Here's what workers thinkAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, 23% of jobs will be affected by churn — a mix of roles added and eliminated in the next five years. While it may seem like a daunting development for those affected, AI’s accelerated development is like any other technologies before it: exciting, concerning and, ultimately, beneficial to the global economy.There is widespread agreement even among the world’s workers. In a recent poll by Randstad, the Workmonitor Pulse, 52% of workers surveyed believe AI will help their career growth and promotion, rather than lead to the loss of their jobs. Additionally, 47% are excited about the prospect of AI in the workplace — more than the 39% who are worried. One-third are already using AI tools at work, and 53% believe their role and industry will eventually be swept up in the AI revolution.Many people are already using AI in their work — and that figure is set to grow. Image: RandstadWhile workers expressed excitement about what the future may bring, they also want help with transitioning to an AI-empowered future, specifically learning to thrive in this new age: 55% say they need learning opportunities to future proof their careers, and this sentiment was the highest among those aged 35-44, of which 60% felt this way. In contrast, people aged 55-67 are the least likely to feel this way at 47%.A majority — 59% — said they have the right skills today to make use of the latest technology, while 17% said they do not. A significant training gap remains between what workers need versus what they are receiving. Nearly 22% of workers say they want learning and development support to use AI, but just 13% reported receiving it during the past 12 months. This is a significant deficiency, given that 37% say they will leave their jobs if their expectations for skilling are not met. Among Gen Z respondents, 47% said they would do so.The AI revolution will be more disruptive to the labour market than many of the technologies that came before it. If policy-makers, employers and workers are not ready to embrace the forthcoming changes, they will be left behind. This could lead to elevated unemployment and talent shortages at the same time. The skills gap has been growing for years, and AI could exacerbate market inefficiencies if the global community doesn't act.Less than 1 in 5 people has been offered AI training in the last year, despite the technology rapidly growing in influence. Image: Randstad4 ways to prepare the workforce for AIWe must help people successfully transition to an AI-powered economy, ensure businesses close the skills gap and enable the labour market to operate at optimal levels. To do so, a coordinated effort is needed to address the AI revolution in four key areas:1. Training and developmentPeople are both excited and apprehensive about the impact of AI on their jobs. Policy-makers, employers and workers must understand how technology will transform their particular interests and develop appropriate strategies and tactics. Skilling regiments must focus on how to use AI, where to deploy it and its ethical limitations. Effective change management must guide such efforts to help people move into new roles and work.2. Redefining workA key change AI will bring is how we regard work. Today it can be linear and sequential, but AI will perform tasks in parallel at speeds and scales that are hard to fathom. This means the work that people currently perform must be reconfigured so they can focus on higher-value tasks that can’t be automated. At the same time, organizations need to rethink how to best amplify human skills using innovative tools. For example, AI systems can free up doctors by transcribing notes, entering and organizing patient data into portals and other time-consuming tasks. Each organization will need to explore what is possible with current and future technology.3. Employment transitionWith many jobs caught up in labour-market churn over the next five years, employers and policy-makers must coordinate efforts to help affected workers to adapt. Whether this is in the form of redeployment or upskilling, significant support is needed. Recognize what skills clusters individuals belong in and shift them to growth areas within that cluster. Similarly, identifying other industries in which their skills are needed can help displaced workers discover a new career path.4. Social safety netsFor those unable to transition to new roles, social protections must be provided. Even AI’s most vociferous advocates have raised concerns about the impact on the loss of income and jobs, especially for so-called lower-skilled workers. Even those who can move into new careers and lines of work may experience some financial disruptions. Employers and governments should provide both bridge aid as well as long-term benefits. Avoiding mass job losses is pivotal to broader acceptance and adoption of AI in the future.The future of work will certainly involve widespread use of AI, which will help people perform work more quickly and efficiently. This can’t happen, however, without giving them the right skills, a new way of working, sustainable career paths and social support during the transition. Technology has always been a powerful enabler of the global economy — but we must use it in a responsible and ethical way that leaves no one behind.

Even as the popularity of generative AI continues to grow, there is an urgent need for enterprises to clearly define policies to prevent employees from using unauthorized tools, which can potentially put businesses at risk. This is a key result of the recent Salesforce survey of around 14,000 full-time in 14 countries.
A little over a quarter (28%) of workers are using generative AI at work and over half of them are using it without any approval or authorization from their employers, the survey revealed. Significantly, another 32% of those surveyed said they plan to start using generative AI soon. The survey was conducted as part of the Generative AI Snapshot Research Series, “The Promises and Pitfalls of AI at Work.”
A key reason for the growing usage of generative AI is the realization that it significantly helps increase employee productivity. The users of generative AI realize its importance, with 71% saying that it makes them more productive at work and 58% believing that the technology makes them more engaged at work.











 
 
 
Interestingly, almost 50% of the surveyed employees said developing expertise in generative AI will help increase their job satisfaction, make them more sought after at the workplace, and improve their earnings.

All this bodes well for the growth of the technology. Generative AI can potentially add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, according to McKinsey.  
Lack of policies makes enterprises vulnerable to security risks
Even as the usage of generative AI continues to rise, the lack of policies and clarity on the safe and authorized tools is increasing the security risks for enterprises. In a survey conducted by Salesforce earlier this year, 73% of the respondents said they believed that generative AI comes with security risks. Inaccurate results, coupled with infringement of intellectual property rights, are some of the other risks related to generative AI.











 
 
 
The usage of unauthorized and banned generative AI tools was highest in India, with 64% of surveyed employees across industries using them to advance their careers, the Salesforce survey said. On the other hand, the Netherlands recorded the lowest usage of unauthorized generative AI tools, with just 43% of surveyed employees using them.
The lack of clearly defined usage policies is making enterprises vulnerable to these risks and preventing them from realizing the vast potential of generative AI. About 79% of the companies do not have clearly defined policies regarding the usage of generative AI, according to the Salesforce survey. Out of these, 15% have loosely defined policies for using generative AI for work and 37% of those surveyed have no policies on using generative AI at work and the remaining 27% have no idea.  
Unethical use of generative AI
As the usage of unauthorized generative AI increases, employees are engaging in unethical activities including passing AI-generated work as their own. Nearly 64% of those surveyed passed off generative AI work as their own and 41% of the workers may consider overstating their generative AI skills to secure a work opportunity.











 
 
 
A significant lacuna emerging in the Salesforce survey is the lack of training. Nearly 70% of the workers have neither completed nor received any training on using generative AI safely and ethically at work. “With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers,” Paula Goldman, chief ethical and humane use officer at Salesforce, said in a blog post.

One of the biggest concerns around the increasing power and popularity of AI tech over the past couple of years is whether it will take jobs away from humans, as it is proven to be capable of taking on more of the tasks that humans currently perform. A recent  survey from LinkedIn  found nearly half of European workers are expecting AI to make a major impact on their working lives within the next year. Generative text AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard can write whole articles or business plans in seconds, producing a close approximation of what a human can do when fed the right prompts and information. Image generation tools meanwhile can conjure up photorealistic pictures nearly instantaneously, raising questions about job security for human artists and illustrators. But the new report from Autonomy, an independent think tank that looks at the future of work and economic planning, sets out a more promising vision of AI’s impact on our working lives. In its GPT-4 (Day Week) report, the authors suggest 8.8 million workers in the UK - 28 per cent of the workforce - could be working 32-hour, four-day weeks thanks to AI. A further 27.9 million meanwhile - representing 88 per cent of the country’s workforce - could have working hours reduced by at least 10 per cent too. AI could usher in new work benefits Autonomy made its calculations using the 1.5 per cent annual productivity increase from AI that was estimated by Goldman Sachs  in a recent study  on the topic of AI and GDP, as well as data from the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The Autonomy report outlines two forecasts for leveraging AI to boost productivity while delivering better conditions for workers, specifically looking at how the ideas could be rolled out in local authorities in the UK. The two scenarios are a 20 per cent reduction in working hours while keeping the same pay for workers, or one in which worker productivity increases by 10 per cent, enabling a 10 per cent reduction in working hours, while keeping the same pay. “Our research offers a fresh perspective in debates around how AI can be utilised for good,” said Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy. “A shorter working week is the most tangible way of ensuring that AI delivers benefits to workers as well as companies. If AI is to be implemented fairly across the economy, it should usher in a new era of four-day working weeks for all”. Various  four-day week trials  are either underway or have been recently completed, with the majority of results pointing towards either maintained or improved levels of productivity, with substantial benefits for worker well-being.

Three Ways Generative AI Can Bolster Cybersecurity


				The machine learning technology taking the world by storm can help defend networks from intruders, too.

  Human analysts can no longer effectively defend against the increasing speed and complexity of cybersecurity attacks. The amount of data is simply too large to screen manually.
Generative AI, the most transformative tool of our time, enables a kind of digital jiu jitsu. It lets companies shift the force of data that threatens to overwhelm them into a force that makes their defenses stronger.
Business leaders seem ready for the opportunity at hand. In a recent survey, CEOs said cybersecurity is one of their top three concerns, and they see generative AI as a lead technology that will deliver competitive advantages.
Generative AI brings both risks and benefits. An earlier blog outlined six steps to start the process of securing enterprise AI.
Here are three ways generative AI can bolster cybersecurity.
Begin With Developers
First, give developers a security copilot.
Everyone plays a role in security, but not everyone is a security expert. So, this is one of the most strategic places to begin.
The best place to start bolstering security is on the front end, where developers are writing software. An AI-powered assistant, trained as a security expert, can help them ensure their code follows best practices in security.
The AI software assistant can get smarter every day if it’s fed previously reviewed code. It can learn from prior work to help guide developers on best practices.
To give users a leg up, NVIDIA is creating a workflow for building such co-pilots or chatbots. This particular workflow uses components from NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building and customizing large language models.
Whether users customize their own models or use a commercial service, a security assistant is just the first step in applying generative AI to cybersecurity.
An Agent to Analyze Vulnerabilities
Second, let generative AI help navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities.
At any moment, companies must choose among thousands of patches to mitigate known exploits. That’s because every piece of code can have roots in dozens if not thousands of different software branches and open-source projects.
An LLM focused on vulnerability analysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first. It’s a particularly powerful security assistant because it reads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the features and APIs it supports.
To test this concept, NVIDIA built a pipeline to analyze software containers for vulnerabilities. The agent identified areas that needed patching with high accuracy, speeding the work of human analysts up to 4x.
The takeaway is clear. It’s time to enlist generative AI as a first responder in vulnerability analysis.
Fill the Data Gap
Finally, use LLMs to help fill the growing data gap in cybersecurity.
Users rarely share information about data breaches because they’re so sensitive. That makes it difficult to anticipate exploits.
Enter LLMs. Generative AI models can create synthetic data to simulate never-before-seen attack patterns. Such synthetic data can also fill gaps in training data so machine-learning systems learn how to defend against exploits before they happen.
Staging Safe Simulations
Don’t wait for attackers to demonstrate what’s possible. Create safe simulations to learn how they might try to penetrate corporate defenses.
This kind of proactive defense is the hallmark of a strong security program. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks. It’s time users harness this powerful technology for cybersecurity defense.
To show what’s possible, another AI workflow uses generative AI to defend against spear phishing — the carefully targeted bogus emails that cost companies an estimated $2.4 billion in 2021 alone.
This workflow generated synthetic emails to make sure it had plenty of good examples of spear phishing messages. The AI model trained on that data learned to understand the intent of incoming emails through natural language processing capabilities in NVIDIA Morpheus, a framework for AI-powered cybersecurity.
The resulting model caught 21% more spear phishing emails than existing tools. Check out our developer blog or watch the video below to learn more.

Wherever users choose to start this work, automation is crucial, given the shortage of cybersecurity experts and the thousands upon thousands of users and use cases that companies need to protect.
These three tools — software assistants, virtual vulnerability analysts and synthetic data simulations — are great starting points for applying generative AI to a security journey that continues every day.
But this is just the beginning. Companies need to integrate generative AI into all layers of their defenses.
Attend a webinar for more details on how to get started.

Some think they can be solved by just handing everyone money. Is there a catch?Supported byAbout this contentPhilippa KellyThu 16 Nov 2023 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 16 Nov 2023 10.03 ESTShareThe idea of a guaranteed income for all has been floating around for centuries, its popularity ebbing and flowing with the passing tide of current events. While it is still considered by many to be a radical concept, proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) no longer see it only as a solution to poverty but as the answer to some of the biggest threats faced by modern workers: wage inequality, job insecurity – and the looming possibility of AI-induced job losses.Elon Musk, at the recent Bletchley Park summit, said he believed “no job is needed” due to the development of AI, and that a job can be for “personal satisfaction”. Economist and political theorist Karl Widerquist, professor of philosophy at Georgetown University-Qatar, sees it differently.“Even if AI takes your job away, you don’t necessarily just become unemployed for the rest of your life,” he says. “What happens is you go down in the labour market, you start crowding the lower-income professions.”Widerquist believes, at least in the short term, that the growth of AI will push white-collar workers into the gig economy, and into other forms of poorly paid, insecure work. Such a shift in the workforce would, he fears, drive down wages and conditions, while increasing inequality.Why not give people who have good alternatives the opportunity to reduce work, or not work at all?Loek Groot, economistA UBI policy in response to AI and automation would address the failure of employers to distribute the spoils of economic growth – propelled, at least in part, by automation – fairly among workers, says Widerquist.Some go further still, pointing to UBI as a dividend due to workers for their role in the development and dissemination of knowledge used to train AI models such as ChatGPT. “Why,” asks Scott Santens, editor of website Basic Income Today, “should only one or two companies get rich off of the capital, the human work, that we all created?”If, in the future, workers do find themselves made redundant by automation and unable to secure new positions, UBI offers a similarly promising option, says Loek Groot, associate professor of economics of the public sector at Utrecht University.In a study conducted by Groot and fellow researchers in the Netherlands between 2017 and 2019, unemployed individuals who were previously in receipt of social assistance were given a basic income. The study indicated increased participation in the labour market. This was not solely due to the financial support provided by UBI, but to the removal of conditions – and sanctions for failing to fulfil said conditions – traditionally imposed on job seekers, says Groot.Specifically, participants who were exempt from obligations to find and accept work were more likely to secure a permanent contract – in contrast with the type of insecure work highlighted by Widerquist.While UBI experiments do not generally show that the policy encourages workers to entirely leave the labour market, higher payments have led to some people reducing their working hours. This, Groot says, should not be considered a bad thing. “Why try to push everyone into paid work, if you can objectively see that there are not enough jobs around?” he asks. “Why not give people who have good alternatives the opportunity to reduce work, or not work at all, and cash in the basic income?”“Good alternatives” include the opportunity to upskill or retrain. It’s also possible that the policy could redefine what society has historically considered work. Caregivers – predominantly women – could be remunerated for traditionally unpaid labour, such as raising children or caring for elderly relatives.View image in fullscreenGrace, a retired 65-year-old, takes care of her cow in Bondo region, western Kenya. Grace receives 75 cents (62p) a day as part of a large-scale universal basic income study by American NGO GiveDirectly. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Kenya, the world’s largest UBI scheme has been providing almost 5,000 people with a payment of about 75 cents (62p) a day since 2017. Organised by GiveDirectly and funded by donations, the experiment will run for 12 years. Tavneet Suri, a member of GiveDirectly’s research team and professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says she has so far seen some surprising results.“We do see people leaving low wage jobs,” she says. “They are going and starting businesses, and the businesses are doing great because there’s money around.” This unexpected wave of entrepreneurship has also had a positive impact on those taking jobs that pay wages, as a shrinking of the available workforce has led to an increase in salaries.“In a developing country, if we see a 20% increase in businesses, that’s people who are going to pay taxes,” says Suri. “Because farmers [who make up a high percentage of Kenya’s workforce] are not taxed in general, suddenly you have a bunch of people showing up in tax brackets, and they’re buying stuff. And one of the biggest pieces of revenue for the government is actually sales tax.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The distinction between a machine and a robot is still not clearRosanna Merola, International Labour OrganizationSuri and her colleagues also report that workers have not left the labour market, and that local economies have been boosted by increased buying power. Despite this, Suri is cautious. In a country where poverty remains far more pressing for workers than automation, she says a government-backed UBI programme must be shown to be truly beneficial before being seriously considered.For countries where automation is a greater concern, Rosanna Merola, a macroeconomist and researcher at the International Labour Organization, has considered a very different approach: a robot tax. In a 2022 research paper, Merola described the possibility of taxing companies that replace workers with robots in order to fund a UBI as “philosophically appealing”, if currently unrealistic.“At this stage, proposals on how to implement a robot tax in practice remain very nebulous,” she says. “Legislators are likely to deal with the complexity of defining what constitutes a ‘robot’ and how to tax it. The distinction between a machine and a robot or between a computer program and AI is still not clear.”Despite this, Merola does believe that the concept of a robot tax could be extended to apply to AI in more recognisable forms – large language models such as ChatGPT, for example. She suggests that companies that use AI to automate tasks, make decisions or perform services might be subject to taxes on the profits or revenue generated through AI-driven processes. Or, governments might tax the collection, processing or sale of data on which AI heavily relies, with a portion of this revenue used to mitigate the technology’s impact on displaced workers.View image in fullscreenHumanity painted out of the picture by robots. Is it time for a ‘robot tax’? Illustration: Andrea Ucini/The GuardianJoe Chrisp, a researcher at the University of Bath’s Universal Income Beacon, feels that conversations surrounding automation in work can sometimes resemble a “counsel of despair”. Crisp does believe that a UBI could deliver positive outcomes for workers, but describes himself as a “friendly sceptic”.While some argue that AI could drive workers into the gig economy, and that a UBI could help to lift them out, Chrisp says that such a policy risks “facilitating the proliferation of these types of jobs, rather than incentivising people to find more stable work”.AI having ‘positive impact’ on UK jobs but could increase regional inequalities, says reportRead moreAnd, on the topic of a possible UBI model, he is once again sceptical, describing even the most modest proposals as likely to require large increases in taxation, and therefore as “difficult to sell”.Research from thinktank Autonomy shows a modest UBI scheme would probably require higher contributions from the most well-off, but would not result in a net increase to taxation. “That model is effectively cost neutral, and would halve child poverty and pensioner poverty,” says Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy. “But I think it wouldn’t be high enough to achieve some of the more expensive cultural changes.”Chrisp agrees that in the medium term, there must be a strategy to help workers to secure new roles in a changing economy. And, in the shorter term, a safety net for those same workers must be found. However, he is not convinced that a single policy could provide the solution to an issue as complex as the impact of AI on work.“Personally, that vision of a UBI providing lots of people who can’t find any job in the labour market with a secure income indefinitely, I find that quite depressing,” he says. “Capitalist economies are very good at continuing to generate things that people can do to earn a wage, it’s just a question of whether those are good jobs or not – and that we can’t really know.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workUniversal basic incomeArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWorkers' rightsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris – reportBeyoncé gives permission to Kamala Harris to use song on campaign trail – report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forward-looking leadership lessons for using AI emerge for effective leaders through recent conversations with three visionary professors in the UK at the TWIN AI Roundtable hosted by Lloyd’s Lab, including what types of jobs are AI-resilient, how to frame education for AI users, and how to use AI to increase human wellbeing and flourishing while managing risk:


1. What types of jobs are AI resilient – In a recent article, Professor David Shrier of Imperial College Business School wrote about AI-resilient jobs with Julian Emanuel and Marc Harris of Evercore ISI. The team consolidated academic and economic data spanning 160 million U.S. jobs, 20 industries, 250+ subsectors and 800+ occupations, examining how workers used 52 abilities in 41 activities to complete their jobs. Their analysis found that cognitive abilities (such as information ordering and memorization) are more at risk to be better performed by AI than a human being. By contrast, creative- or strength-based abilities (such as originality, oral expression, or explosive strength) have a lower risk of being replaced by AI. The more social interaction and empathy that a job requires, the less risk; and, the more physical labor is entailed in a job, the less risk it has (subject, in the latter case, to the possibility of robotic automation).

From an industry perspective, AI risk to jobs is greater in high value-added service sector jobs such as legal, computer and mathematical, and business and financial operations occupations; and this risk is lower in more manufacturing-oriented sectors. Overall, the researchers estimated that generative AI-driven tools can leverage 32% of each job’s function on average across the entirety of the U.S. economy to improve productivity. By 2032, as much as $12 trillion of global GDP will be created through integrating and applying artificial intelligence. With such large-scale disruption, effective CEOs and Boards of Directors are building capabilities and launching AI initiatives immediately to stay competitive.

2. How to frame AI education for users – Professor Sue Black, OBE, of Durham University, is an award-winning computer scientist, champion of women in STEM, and digital skills expert who led the campaign to save the UK’s Bletchley Park. In a recent article, she outlined several key principles in framing education for AI users. First, help users understand that technology often is not a problem, but the way people use it can be. It is essential for those using the technology to understand what it is intended to do (for example, generative AI is not a search engine; it is a sentence and code completer), as well as how it is used, who controls it, and who has built and tested it. For example, users should understand why generative AI creates “hallucinations” and how to minimize them. Second, identify biases in computer data and models. When Sue Black’s team first accessed generative AI models, they found the tools to be powerful and potentially positive; however, when investigating whether any types of prompts generated bias, it took only a few prompts (and a few seconds) to identify bias. Effective leaders educate as many people as possible about the risk of bias, so that users can recognize and address bias before it begins. Third, support AI users to be continuous learners and teachers at the same time. In the current environment, individuals benefit from continually updating themselves on “What’s the latest thing that I should be looking out for?” and from being able to find things for themselves. It is important for leaders and users alike not to get deterred by tech jargon or to fear technology.

3. Using AI to increase human wellbeing and flourishing – Professor Keyun Ruan of New York University is Google Cloud CISO and co-founder of the Happiness Foundation and haia.ai in Oxford, England. In her paper and subsequent book on cybernomics, she set the scene for better understanding how technology (and AI specifically) contributes to human productivity and flourishing, as well as risks. She notes that with AI technology, it is likely that people will work less on routine and mundane tasks and more on higher-level thinking and problem solving, enabling them to be more productive, healthier, and potentially live longer. Therefore, AI technology (when used appropriately) can create new prospects and exploration. History demonstrates that if tools are used effectively, there will be considerable benefits. Economic theories for both human and risk factors suggest that increased education and accessibility to AI lead to higher and more sustainable economic value. Further, society is at a historical turning point, defined by human relationships with the technological tools they have invented. There is great opportunity through collective imagination to reflect and reinvent the growth mindset, shifting from focus from external materialistic production to inward human fulfillment and wellbeing. The next stage of the technology-driven industrial revolution is likely about human empowerment with technology at the center. Effective leaders recognize problems and opportunities as human-driven rather than technology-driven, and guide technology (and the people using it) to address them.

Amazon confirmed Monday that it is planning to lay off several hundred workers at its Alexa division as part of a shift in focus to generative AI.
The company’s emphasis on developing generative AI systems has resulted in the release of new offerings, like the tool rolled out in September to generate copy listings for users selling items on the company’s e-commerce platform. The application is fueled by a large language model (LLM) that Amazon has been developing internally,  originally to support the Alexa smart assistant.
But in a statement Monday, the company said its latest round of job cuts will impact staff working on Alexa-related efforts. “Several hundred roles are impacted, a relatively small percentage of the total number of people in the Devices business who are building great experiences for our customers.”











 
 
 
Amazon noted that there are more than half a billion Alexa devices in customers’ homes. “Our investments in generative AI are bringing our vision for an even more intuitive, intelligent, and useful Alexa closer than ever before,” the company said. “As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers—which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI. These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in role eliminations.”

Amazon has already undertaken multiple rounds of layoffs in the last 12 months and this is not the first time Amazon’s devices and services team, which includes those working on the company’s Echo devices and Alexa, has been cut back. Employees in this department were part of 18,000 jobs Amazon axed at the start of 2023.
In March, the company announced it would be laying off an additional 9,000 workers, with the cuts affecting employees at AWS, PXT (People Experience and Technology, Amazon’s HR arm), Advertising, and Twitch, the livestreaming service purchased by Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.

Of organizations that use hybrid cloud, 68% have established formal, organization-wide policies around generative AI, The Harris Poll working on behalf of the IBM Institute for Business Value found in a news report published in November. The Cloud Transformation Report, released Nov. 20, tracked trends in the intersection between hybrid cloud, generative AI, sustainability and tech skills.
The survey was conducted virtually, with 3,018 IT and business decision-makers in 12 countries and across 23 industries participating in May and June 2023.

Hybrid cloud supports generative AI workloads
For IBM, hybrid cloud infrastructure is key because it can support generative AI workloads – as long as organizations have a strategy to do so.
“The success of this technology (generative AI) remains dependent on organizations having the skills and infrastructure needed to build and utilize compute-intensive technology,” said Rohit Badlaney, general manager of IBM’s cloud product and industry platforms group, in an email interview with TechRepublic. “Organizations must formalize their AI strategy and create clear, organization-wide policies to address their generative AI approach.”
The report found that 73% of tech leaders in government, 69% of tech leaders in manufacturing and 68% of tech leaders in consumer goods already have generative AI strategies. Banking and financial markets, insurance, life science, electronics and automotive have been slower to adopt organization-wide generative AI strategies.

IBM offers its watsonx platform running on IBM Cloud and GPU options on IBM Cloud as a service. Other companies that offer similar services and infrastructure include Amazon, Google, SAP and Databricks.
“Enterprises that are looking to successfully scale AI must consider the data – data is growing exponentially and it’s everywhere – across multiple clouds with multiple vendors, on premises and at the edge,” said Badlaney. “Successful adoption boils down to data management and workload placement.”
How tech leaders can build on their cloud experience to include generative AI
To find a balance between generative AI and an organization’s current cloud strategy, technology leaders can:

Create an organization-wide strategy on how to work with generative AI and align it with other digital transformation.
Move sensitive workloads from public to private or on-premises clouds if needed for security or compliance.
Address cybersecurity concerns that come up around generative AI.

Business leaders should focus on what outcomes they want around generative AI.
“Leaders must understand what they are trying to achieve through AI before they can create the foundation necessary to put the pieces together and drive those outputs,” said Badlaney.

“Technology leaders need to have a clear view of current compute capacity levels, and data storage and processing requirements,” Badlaney said. “This will allow them to better create a holistic strategy that aligns with security, compliance and performance needs.”
Similarities between hybrid cloud adoption trends and generative AI adoption trends
The rise of hybrid cloud and the rise of generative AI are similar in that they face the same difficulties, the IBM Institute for Business Value and The Harris Poll said. Of the cloud leaders surveyed, 45% said cybersecurity or privacy and confidentiality were concerns when adopting generative AI.
Sustainability is a must-have in enterprise tech
Sustainable computing is no longer just nice to have, Badlaney said – it’s becoming a “must-have” for enterprise customers.
In its study of cloud considerations, the IBM Institute for Business Value and The Harris Poll found organizations are challenged to improve sustainability while processing large amounts of data such as generative AI workloads. Of the global cloud leaders surveyed, 42% said they use the cloud to help deploy, track and manage sustainability goals internally; of those, 36% say cloud will have the largest impact on their sustainability strategy compared to other technologies. Many global cloud leaders (86%) surveyed think open innovation between business partners is the biggest driver of sustainable initiatives.
Hybrid cloud can fit into sustainability initiatives, particularly if renewable electricity is used along the supply chain. In an ideal world, cloud computing would allow for physically aggregated hardware and more efficient operation.
Cloud skills remain a concern
Finding people with the right cloud skills can be a challenge, 58% of global decision makers said. Of the organizations surveyed, 72% have created new positions to meet the need for cloud skills. Highly-regulated industries such as banking and financial markets (79%), chemicals and petroleum (79%) and transportation and travel (81%) are even more likely to create new positions to fill the need for cloud skills. Upskilling can help employees use transformational technologies, including hybrid cloud and generative AI, more effectively.

Microsoft is integrating Copilot generative AI capabilities into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service and other Dynamics 365 applications.
The Copilot capabilities, unveiled at the vendor's annual Ignite conference this week, are intended to provide field service professionals and frontline workers with quicker access to information they need to perform their work or complete job orders, according to the company.







Frontline workers can struggle to find the information they need to perform their day-to-day jobs, according to Microsoft, listing it as a top five disruptive issue in its most recent Work Trend Index annual report.
Copilot functionality in D365 Field Service will be available as a public preview in December, with general availability to come later. Frontline workers such as operators or service technicians can ask questions in plain English via the Copilot interface in Teams and then receive information back from the D365 Field Service application, such as job status updates, parts information and job instructions.
Microsoft also unveiled Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides this week, which brings mixed reality and generative AI to manufacturing operations. Field service technicians and operators can query Copilot Guides in plain English, and the AI will surface relevant information based on a curated set of documentation, according to the company.
The information is aimed at helping technicians with tasks such as troubleshooting and can provide step-by-step instructions to complete work. Guides is also integrated with HoloLens 2 mixed reality, which provides holographic overlays to guide how tasks should be completed.
Copilot in Dynamics 365 Guides is currently in private preview on HoloLens 2.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides will integrate Copilot generative AI with HoloLens 2.






Generative AI in field service makes sense
Generative AI makes sense as a field service capability, said Aly Pinder, research vice president at IDC, because it's an area that has struggled with trends such as a retiring workforce and the increasing use of third-party contractors for service work.
""Generative AI tools like Copilot can help that expertise evolve quickly, despite lack of tenure or time spent with an organization or on machine,"" Pinder said. ""This is an opportunity that could be a differentiator for the market.""
For example, field service management has suffered from a lack of skilled technicians, and companies have had to rely on contractors and gig workers, he said. Having an on-demand set of intelligence that technicians can generate via AI when they are working on equipment that they have not seen before can be valuable to enterprises.



In the frontline at the field technician level, you need to have knowledge at [your] fingertips, on demand and personalized for the asset you're fixing or for who you are and your skill base.

""In the frontline at the field technician level, you need to have knowledge at [your] fingertips on demand and personalized for the asset you're fixing or for who you are and your skill base,"" Pinder said.
Microsoft's challenge with the addition of Copilot into D365 Field Service will be making it stand out in a field where a number of vendors are introducing generative AI capabilities for specific service applications, he said. However, Microsoft has an advantage because of the application suite that it already supports and the integrated nature of the D365 platform.
""Microsoft should be able to position these capabilities in a broader lens by solving user challenges across the data flow of the organization, as opposed to just solving an individual use case,"" Pinder said.
The Copilot capabilities should make the Field Service functionality more attractive for D365 customers because it will be embedded, he said.
""It will only accelerate adoption if it's embedded and a user who's already a customer just sees it fit into their already installed use case within their Microsoft environment,"" Pinder said.
The Copilot generative AI capabilities in D365 Field Service doesn't look all that different from what other vendors are now including, said Predrag Jakovljevic, an analyst at Technology Evaluation Centers. For example, Salesforce is adding generative AI assistants into all of its applications.
However, field service management presents a good generative AI use case, as do applications like sales and customer support, he said.
""Generative AI is especially useful for field technicians to produce the reports when the work is done or before going to work, when you can query the [large language models] via natural language prompts to give you the customer history or that device's repair history,"" Jakovljevic said. ""In sales, it is about generating introductory emails, meeting notes or checking the prospect's past interactions, and so on.""
In field service, generative AI can also help create documentation for future repairs, he added.
Most enterprise applications that have field service functionality such as D365 and those from IFS and Salesforce are now including generative AI, but Jakovljevic agreed that Microsoft could have an advantage because of its technology ubiquity.
""However, they will all reach parity soon if not already,"" he said.

While the public’s attention has been captured by AI chatbots, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the sciences. One of the most promising fields AI is impacting is biology—long dominated by the tradition of the “wet lab,” which favors pure experimental data over computer simulation. Deep learning is changing that. It enables computers to understand complex patterns in data and generate ideas based on those patterns, and that’s making AI more and more central to experimental biology. There is no field more complex in its patterns than biology, so AI is the perfect tool for understanding it. And—as a host of new companies are showing—engineering it.

Oddly enough, even the success of large-language models, or LLMs, like ChatGPT could be seen as evidence of AI’s ability to understand biological complexity. After all, language is a product of a particular biology—ours. The text on which ChatGPT is trained is just one of many complex forms of data produced by biological systems. In nature, this complexity reaches up from the smallest working parts—our proteins, our DNA—but also extends up through cells, organs, to physiology, disease, and behavior. 
AI, with the right data, can span all of these scales and make sense of the data we collect on all of them. It’s poised to accelerate basic science, the business of biotechs, the behemoth pharmaceutical companies, and the broader bioeconomy.
A 2020 paper from San Francisco-based industry leader OpenAI investigated what factors had the biggest impact on LLM performance. Three variables determined how well they learned: 

Compute—the number of CPU cycles spent training a model. 
Parameters—the number of learnable features in a model.
Dataset—the number of examples used in training the AI model.

The amount of “compute,” or the computing resources required, and the number of parameters can be dialed up by computer scientists as needed. But the same is not true of datasets. AI for biology can’t draw on gobs of pre-existing data like the creators of ChatGPT did by scraping the internet for everything it contained. While there is useful biological data in public research databases, it’s not enough. AI can only craft solutions to problems similar to what it has seen, and in biology, there is still a lot we don’t know.

In the new AI-driven era, research efforts must be purposefully organized to generate the right data for AI models.

AlphaFold, the breakthrough protein structure prediction program from Google’s DeepMind, was trained using existing public databases like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a massive collection of basic structural data on the molecules of life. But it only learned what the PDB contained, which tends toward smaller, soluble proteins that fold into a compact, globular shape. AlphaFold doesn’t do well predicting the structure of a number of important classes of protein. For example, it has difficulty figuring out protein-protein interactions (an important consideration for designing drugs). Nor is it necessarily adept at snapshotting how a single protein can change shape (which can be critical for function). And the structures of proteins which span cell membranes are more difficult to predict because relatively few have actually been solved. These important problems won’t go away without new data.
While databases like PDB have come about as post hoc efforts to organize data produced by academics pursuing their disparate biological interests, in the new AI-driven era, research efforts must be purposefully organized to generate the right data for AI models. While some of these efforts will take the form of large-scale public research projects, akin to the Human Genome Project, others will be small and focused, carried out on proprietary data inside companies. Still others, like the Human Immunome Project, which seeks to use machine learning to build models of the human immune system, could take another form, like a public-private partnership.
(Editor’s note: The author’s partner Linda Avey has recently joined the board of the Human Immunome Project. Proto.life founder Jane Metcalfe is the chair of HIP’s board.)
AI models driving wet lab experiments is a trend we’re going to see more of in the coming years. It will be quite different from the kind of generalist AI models inside ChatGPT and Midjourney. Those projects are built from large corpuses of publicly accessible data, are general purpose, and are expensive to train. The marrying together of wet lab techniques with AI—“wet AI”—is the opposite of “dry” AI models like ChatGPT in many ways. They will be small (not large), special purpose (not general), built from specially created proprietary datasets, (rather than pre-existing public ones), and many will be trivially cheap to train—not costing between $30 million and $100 million like many LLMs. Although they will be small and private, they are on track to have enormous impact. 
Wet AI gives companies a proprietary advantage compared to LLM and image generation AI companies. The latter are built on public data, and that means others can copy them. For example, Facebook released LLaMA, an open source model that exceeds the latest version of ChatGPT on most non-coding or math reasoning prompts, and open source developers and academics have seized on it, building new and better versions. And other companies like San Francisco-based Anthropic have entered the market with their own proprietary LLMs. This dynamic causes investors to worry that these high-flying companies may collapse under their own weight as competitors and new methods drive down profits. The wet AI approach relies on a different business model built on highly proprietary technologies that produce billion-dollar products protected by patents.

AI Versus Antibiotic Resistance
AI can help overcome both scientific and financial hurdles to tackle this serious threat to global health.







Along came the biologists…
Computer scientists were among the first to recognize AI’s application to biological problems. In 2008, Abe Heifets, the founder of Atomwise, was a computer science graduate student with an office across the hall from the godfather of modern AI, Geoffrey Hinton. His work wasn’t initially focused on AI, but he saw that something interesting was going on across the hall, and he had the early insight that by representing proteins as images of atomic structures, he could use image processing AI—convolutional networks—to discover drugs that fit in the active sites of proteins. 
Daphne Koller, the first AI hire in Stanford’s computer science department, took an early interest in biology and was one of the first scientific advisors to 23andMe. From the beginning, she reasoned that AI could sort high-throughput data and human genetics to find and prioritize targets. She focused these efforts in Insitro, one of the earliest AI-driven biotech companies.
Computer scientists paved the way, democratizing the tools and methods for a new wave of engineers and scientists. Chemists and biologists realized that AI could augment their work. For example, a common technique for discovering drugs is to screen libraries of compounds for desirable properties—binding to the right target, how they interact with tissues and get into cells, their stability, or their distribution in the body. While screening has been a workhorse method for scientists, it’s limited by the cost of producing compounds and doing experiments. By training generative AI on screening data, scientists can explore orders of magnitude more chemical structures, finding compounds with improved properties.
A clever combination of science and AI
One company taking this approach is Unnatural Products (UNP)—which in full disclosure is a company I have invested in. UNP was started by graduate students out of the lab of Scott Lokey, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Lokey focused on a special class of natural compounds—peptide macrocycles. These are short proteins that have been “cyclized,” or turned into a ring. That ring structure gives them special properties, locking the peptide into a semi-rigid structure that forms more stable bonds with its binding target. The ring is also more resistant to degradation than linear peptides but leaves enough flexibility to allow shape changes that give macrocycles a peculiar knack for slipping into cells, where they can bind to important targets. Nature has harnessed these structures because of their drug-like properties.
Cyclosporine is one example. It’s a well-known drug given to people with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and organ transplants. Produced by the fungus Trichoderma polysporum, it binds to proteins that mediate the immune response. Cyclosporine seems to be used by the fungus to help it infect insects, but doctors now use its immunosuppressive functions to prevent tissue rejection in organ transplant patients.

Cyclosporine is one of about 100 or so pharmacologically useful macrocyclic compounds. Almost all of them are from natural sources. Despite the success of cyclosporine, drug developers avoided macrocycles because they were perceived to be too complex to engineer. This perspective was reinforced by Pfizer’s top chemist, Christopher Lipinski, in his famous “Rule of 5,” which says that an orally available drug must not have more than one violation of several criteria Lipinski determined after reviewing the company’s successes and failures. Any time Pfizer’s scientists tried to build compounds which were larger than a certain size, or had too many hydrogen bonds, they failed, largely due to the inability of those molecules to get into cells where they could act. These rules all but exclude macrocycles as useful drug candidates because they are guaranteed to violate Lipinski’s first and third criteria.
Yet Lokey was undeterred and convinced that there must be a way to engineer what nature had shown us. Some of his colleagues thought he was plotting a risky course outside of the mainstream, but he doggedly pursued this vision over decades, continuing to hack away at the problem, and developing the technology for building large libraries of these compounds, a critical step in the drug discovery process.
Two of Lokey’s graduate students, Cameron Pye and Josh Schwochert, were instrumental in developing clever parallel synthesis and screening techniques. But even with these advances, screening only accesses a small part of the chemical space. They realized that by training AI on the data from their screening experiments, they could search a much larger space of molecules. 
Macrocycles are peptides, short chains of about 8–20 amino acids. Although there are only 20 different types of natural amino acids, bioengineered macrocycles can include “unnatural” ones —hence the name of their company (Unnatural Products)—which can push that number to hundreds of thousands. This represents a huge set of possible compounds. For example, a library of macrocycles each 10 amino acids long, where each position is one of 100,000 unnatural amino acids would contain 100,00010, or 1050, different molecules. That is around the number of atoms that constitute the entire globe we call Earth.
Synthesizing just one copy of each molecule in such a library would require a mass the size of Jupiter. So screening is only feasible for a tiny fraction of this number—billions of compounds rather than more than a billion billion billion billion billion of them. AI can discover patterns in screening data that enable it to suggest an ideal drug candidate that had never actually been synthesized or screened. As a result, Unnatural Products has been able to create compounds that both bind very tightly (i.e., with “picomolar” dissociation constants) and remarkably, get through cell membranes, breaking Lipinski’s famous rule.

Wet AI uses experiments to get you to the ballpark and AI to get you to the seat in the stadium.

Macrocycles combine the best properties of large and small molecules. Over the last 20 years, antibodies have become popular in drug development. They are very specific, but must be injected and can’t access the inside of cells. Toxicity sometimes results because their mechanism of action is indirect—antibody makers target molecules on the outside of the cell which they hope will influence the key molecule inside the cell. But this indirect strategy sometimes doesn’t work and can trigger unwanted side effects.  On the other hand, small molecules, which can be taken in pill form, obey Lipinski’s rules and can get inside cells but they’re unspecific, so they often require higher doses and can produce toxicity because of “off-target” effects. Macrocyclic peptides are a kind of Goldilocks drug: neither too big nor too tiny but rather just the right size for drug development—large enough to bind very specifically but small enough to sneak inside cells.  
This application of wet AI uses experiments to get you to the ballpark and AI to get you to the seat in the stadium. It’s a remarkable combination of scientific ingenuity and computer science knowhow that enables a fundamentally new ball game. A large team of medicinal chemists at Merck spent 10 years designing one macrocyclic peptide—a feat so impressive it was nominated by their peers as “molecule of the year” in 2021. Techniques like the one Unnatural Products is pioneering are finding thousands of such molecules with better properties in less than a third of the time, with a much smaller team. It’s a taste of things to come.
Although the numbers seem large, wet AI models like this will be tiny and relatively inexpensive to build compared to models like ChatGPT. A typical model is a thousand times smaller, only ~50Mb versus 570Gb for ChatGPT. But there is obviously huge value in these small models.
While this kind of model is built on a one-off basis for each protein, more general foundation models could give insights into basic properties of a company’s technology.  For example, by collecting tissue distribution data for a drug library, an AI model could be trained to generate drug candidates which also target the right cells. This will be more costly than the kind of screens UNP is currently doing, but it could pay off in spades. Failure of a drug to get to the right tissue is a common cause of failure to get through the FDA review process. 
Wet AI is also going to drive investment in general use foundation models. AlphaFold was trained on public data culled from years of work by labs pursuing disparate biological problems, but there are gaps that will be most efficiently closed by focused public efforts. Mark Murcko, the former CTO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is promoting the concept of prizes to convince labs to focus on structures of key proteins that affect toxicity, what he calls the “avoidome.” These are proteins that drug developers don’t want their molecules to interact with. Many of these are proteins that span cell membranes and represent difficult targets for structural biologists, but they are not impossible. Methods like cryo-EM combined with other experimental techniques can get us there. Wet AI could drive public efforts akin to the Human Genome Project, which published the first final reference genome of our species 20 years ago, or the NIH’s All of Us project, which aims to collect genomic data and other health information from a million people. In the coming era, scientists will drive large-scale public data collection efforts to serve the needs of AI models. 
Wet AI isn’t just about drug discovery. It also has a critical role to play in health and the emerging synthetic biology-driven bioeconomy. The most exciting aspect of wet AI, however, is that it promises to turn the molecular world into a programmable medium. That could have far reaching impacts, giving us the ability to imagine new categories of products based on engineered biology. I’ll cover these topics in future posts.

The Alexa unit at Amazon was also affected by those earlier layoffs.The cuts to Amazon Music began in October, when the division eliminated communications roles, and are distinct from the earlier layoffs, according to another person familiar with the matter.The reductions in Amazon’s music division signaled an increasing shift of focus to another streaming platform: Prime Video. “We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members,” Jassy said last month during Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call.(With inputs from AP)",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'mint', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/newschemalogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'name': 'Companies'}}]","['Today News', 'Budget 2024', 'Money', 'Company Business News', 'Stock Market News', 'Election Results 2024', 'Indian Industry Analysis', 'Opinion', 'Technology News', 'Politics News', 'Lounge', 'Sports News', 'IPL 2024', 'Education News Today']",,https://www.livemint.com/companies/amazon-axes-workforce-in-alexa-team-as-generative-ai-takes-center-stage-details-11700292378501.html,Companies,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/newschemalogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'HT Media Ltd, 1st Floor, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg', 'addressLocality': 'New Delhi', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '110 001'}",,,,https://www.livemint.com/companies/amazon-axes-workforce-in-alexa-team-as-generative-ai-takes-center-stage-details-11700292378501.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1']}",,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '011 - 66561234', 'email': 'customersupport@livemint.com', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the age of AI, remember to think like a human

A UNLV professor considers the present — and possible futures — of artificial intelligence






					By T.R. Witcher

Don't miss the big stories. Like us on Facebook.



When Chat GPT-4, the artificial intelligence language-learning model, entered the American consciousness last spring, the internet quickly went on Armageddon watch. To believe the doomsayers, we were witnessing nothing less than a baby Skynet — the evil computer network from the Terminator films — take its first breath.
You know the story. The machines humans make become more powerful, are entrusted with more responsibility and then reach a moment of sentience where they look around, self-aware, and decide human beings are:
A) Idiots. B) Evil. C) Expendable.
… And, more or less, nuke the lot of us.
So what are we really dealing with here? The developer, Open AI, says that Chat GPT-4 — the latest in a series of language-learning models (LLMs) the organization has developed since 2018 —“can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style.” The LLM can handle 25,000 words of text, “allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis.”
Already, Chat GPT-4 can score a 163 on the LSAT, good enough to probably get into Top 20 law schools such as Georgetown, Vanderbilt and the University of Southern California.
In practice, this AI can help you write a report or paper, draft an email and summarize articles or other research. It can sort of do your work for you. It can also analyze and create images.
Of course, there’s a leap from the language-learning model of Chat GPT-4 to real, creative human intelligence. The dream (or nightmare) of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, in which machines can, as Open AI puts it, “outperform humans at most economically valuable work” is still on the horizon.
But the horizon may get here sooner than we wish. Last year, a Google engineer claimed that company’s AI chatbot, LaMDa, was already sentient. (The company denied this; the engineer was later fired.) Earlier this year, an organization called the Future of Life Institute released a much-reported-upon open letter signed by such prominent figures as Elon Musk, Andrew Yang and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The letter, which as of mid-August had 33,000 signatures, called for a six-month moratorium on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. “Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?” the letter asked. “Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?”
In an op-ed for Time magazine, Eliezer Yudkowsky, at the Berkeley, California-based Machine Intelligence Research Institute, argued the six-month moratorium was not bold enough. Only a complete shutdown will do. “Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die.”
We seem unlikely to consider these warnings. There’s too much at stake. Too much money to be made. Too many nations vying for power — economic, political, military.
Maybe it won’t end as Yudkowsky predicts. I’d draw your attention to another trope in science fiction: the inverse relationship between human behavior and machine behavior. As machines act more human, the humans around them act more like machines. This is part of the central thrust of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where clever, personable HAL interacts with a pair of monotonous, blank astronauts onboard a spaceship headed to Jupiter, while the rest of the crew exists in cryo-sleep like frozen meat. It’s only when the computer suffers a nervous breakdown and threatens the mission that the astronauts rouse themselves to creative action — and thus to human dignity.
Here, the machines don’t aspire to be more than human, some coldly calculating thing beyond empathy or love. They just want to be us. Best-case scenario? You wind up with Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation. He’s pretty cool; he actually reminds humans what’s special about being human.
Then again, HAL does go crazy and kills most of the crew.
According to a survey of 1,000 college students from Best Colleges, 43 percent have used ChatGPT or a similar AI application — and of those, half have used AI tools to complete schoolwork. Yet 57 percent “do not intend to use or continue using AI to complete their homework.”
I teach in the journalism program at UNLV. Along with the rest of the university, we are discussing how to handle AI in our classrooms. After the Terminator scenario, one of the next things people worry about is students simply phoning in their work. I joke with colleagues that we may soon see a world where artificial intelligence writes student papers — and artificial intelligence grades student papers.
But. Unexpectedly, my colleagues tell me that their students are reticent about using AI. As for its potential to corrupt, the students I’ve known over the years are mostly hardworking and conscientious. They want to learn, they want to improve, and they take pride in doing the work well. Is there a place for AI to aid them in these goals?
I asked a knowledge management program I use, Notion, which is running GPT-3, to tell me whether AI should be used to help students complete assignments.
Here’s what it told me:
“AI can help students to work more efficiently and effectively. It can provide personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement, and can also help to identify areas where students may be struggling. Additionally, AI can help to level the playing field for students who may not have access to traditional resources or who may have learning disabilities that make it difficult to complete assignments on their own.
“On the other hand … some worry that it may lead to a reduction in critical thinking skills or an over-reliance on technology. There may also be concerns about the accuracy and fairness of AI grading systems, particularly when it comes to subjective assignments such as essays.
“While it can certainly be a useful tool, it is not a replacement for human teachers or the critical thinking skills that are essential for success in any field.”
A perfectly reasonable, anodyne answer. If nothing else, Chat GPT-4 could enjoy a long career in politics. Good teachers likely would spot the “down the middle” blandness of this response — especially one with perfect grammar — and question the source. And yet, we already turn to prototype AI software to aid us. What teacher would take any student seriously who didn’t check their work with their word processor’s spelling and grammar check, which does a lot of the tedious work of copy editing and proofreading for them? For that matter, what editor or manager in any setting would respect their employee for submitting work without these checks?
I send interview notes off to a service that transcribes them for me, by computer, sparing me the indignity of line by line, four-finger typing transcription. That’s me trying to be a robot, you see, and the computer saying, “Nah, bruh, I got this …”
In the end, wherever we’re headed, AI is about work. Whether we’re talking schoolwork or on-the-job work, AI is just the latest automation technology that challenges us to think about what work means to us. Do we dream of a future when work has been made obsolete, or one when it’s been made more fulfilling?
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman co-wrote a book with Chat GPT4, Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, in which he noted the following: “Much of what we do as modern people — at work and beyond — is to process information and generate action. GPT-4 will massively speed your ability to do these things, and with greater breadth and scope. Within a few years, this copilot will fall somewhere between useful and essential to most professionals and many other sorts of workers.”
Processing information sounds sexy, but really that translates to the tedious, encroaching actions of the Digital Knowledge Economy that we all know so well: manipulating spreadsheets, sharing Google Docs, emails and PowerPoints, computer files, navigating tech support and a billion passwords.
The promise of AI is that it can save us from a world full of useless jobs and tasks, what the late anthropologist David Graeber referred to as bullshit jobs: “It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working.”
It’s not so much whether you have a bullshit job or not … it’s that all of our jobs have some element of BS built in. Paperwork and procedures. It’s unavoidable, the normal, hungry maw of bureaucracy.
Can Chat GPT-4 — or -5, -6, etc. — take this off our plates, so that we might arrive on some sun-washed shore where work becomes more creative, more rewarding, less alienating? A world where AI isn’t used to fake a paper no one wants to write but to aid a student in deep, rigorous thinking? A world where work feels a little less like work and a little more like an enterprise that we have a real stake in, one that, moment by moment, day by day, is novel, challenging, valuable and draws out our best?
If we devise work that makes us feel like human beings, maybe there’s a way forward. If we devise work that makes us feel like machines, better machines are on the way. ◆

Crabill sent it to his boss for review and filed it with the Colorado court.“I was over the moon excited for just the headache that it saved me,” he told The Washington Post. But his relief was short-lived. While surveying the brief, he realized to his horror that the AI chatbot had made up several fake lawsuit citations.Crabill, 29, apologized to the judge, explaining that he’d used an AI chatbot. The judge reported him to a statewide office that handles attorney complaints, Crabill said. In July, he was fired from his Colorado Springs law firm. Looking back, Crabill wouldn’t use ChatGPT, but says it can be hard to resist for an overwhelmed rookie attorney.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This is all so new to me,” he said. “I just had no idea what to do and no idea who to turn to.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowBusiness analysts and entrepreneurs have long predicted that the legal profession would be disrupted by automation.

Here’s what to know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Stressed-out lawyers are turning to chatbots to write tedious briefs. Law firms are using AI language tools to sift through thousands of case documents, replacing the work of associates and paralegals. AI legal assistants are helping lawyers analyze documents, memos and contracts in minutes.The AI legal software market could grow from $1.3 billion in 2022 to upward of $8.7 billion by 2030, according to an industry analysis by the market research firm Global Industry Analysts. A report by Goldman Sachs in April estimated that 44 percent of legal jobs could be automated away, more than any other sector except for administrative work.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut these money-saving tools can come at a cost. Some AI chatbots are prone to fabricating facts, causing lawyers to be fired or fined, or to have cases thrown out. Legal professionals are racing to create guidelines for the technology’s use, to prevent inaccuracies from bungling major cases. In August, the American Bar Association launched a year-long task force to study the impacts of AI on law practice.“It’s revolutionary,” said John Villasenor, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s center for technological innovation. “But it’s not magic.”AI tools that quickly read and analyze documents allow law firms to offer cheaper services and lighten the workload of attorneys, Villasenor said. But this boon can also be an ethical minefield when it results in high-profile errors.Story continues below advertisementIn the spring, Lydia Nicholson, a Los Angeles housing attorney, received a legal brief relating to their client’s eviction case. But something seemed off. The document cited lawsuits that didn’t ring a bell. Nicholson, who uses they/them pronouns, did some digging and realized many were fake.AdvertisementThey discussed it with colleagues and “people suggested, ‘Oh, that seems like something that AI could have done,’” Nicholson said in an interview.Nicholson filed a motion against the Dennis Block law firm, a prominent eviction firm in California, pointing out the errors. A judge agreed after an independent inquiry and issued the group a $999 penalty. The firm blamed a young, newly hired lawyer at its office for using “online research” to write the motion and said she had resigned shortly after the complaint was made. Several AI experts analyzed the briefing and proclaimed it “likely” generated by AI, according to the media site LAist.Story continues below advertisementThe Dennis Block firm did not return a request for comment.It’s not surprising that AI chatbots invent legal citations when asked to write a brief, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer scientist and the director of the Center for Technology Responsibility at Brown University.Advertisement“What’s surprising is that they ever produce anything remotely accurate,” he said. “That’s not what they’re built to do.”Rather, chatbots like ChatGPT are designed to make conversation, having been trained on vast amounts of published text to compose plausible-sounding responses to just about any prompt. So when you ask ChatGPT for a legal brief, it knows that legal briefs include citations — but it hasn’t actually read the relevant case law, so it makes up names and dates that seem realistic.Story continues below advertisementJudges are struggling with how to deal with these errors. Some are banning the use of AI in their courtroom. Others are asking lawyers to sign pledges to disclose if they have used AI in their work. The Florida Bar is weighing a proposal to require attorneys to have a client’s permission to use AI.One point of discussion among judges is whether honor codes requiring attorneys to swear to the accuracy of their work apply to generative AI, said John G. Browning, a former Texas district court judge.Browning, who chairs the State Bar of Texas’s task force on AI, said his group is weighing a handful of approaches to regulate use, such as requiring attorneys to take professional education courses in technology or considering specific rules for when evidence generated by AI can be included.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLucy Thomson, a D.C.-area attorney and cybersecurity engineer who is chairing the American Bar Association’s AI task force, said the goal is to educate lawyers about both the risks and potential benefits of AI. The bar association has not yet taken a formal position on whether AI should be banned from courtrooms, she added, but its members are actively discussing the question.“Many of them think it’s not necessary or appropriate for judges to ban the use of AI,” Thomson said, “because it’s just a tool, just like other legal research tools.”In the meantime, AI is increasingly being used for “e-discovery”— the search for evidence in digital communications, such as emails, chats or online workplace tools.Story continues below advertisementWhile previous generations of technology allowed people to search for specific keywords and synonyms across documents, today’s AI models have the potential to make more sophisticated inferences, said Irina Matveeva, chief of data science and AI at Reveal, a Chicago-based legal technology company. For instance, generative AI tools might have allowed a lawyer on the Enron case to ask, “Did anyone have concerns about valuation at Enron?” and get a response based on the model’s analysis of the documents.AdvertisementWendell Jisa, Reveal’s CEO, added that he believes AI tools in the coming years will “bring true automation to the practice of law — eliminating the need for that human interaction of the day-to-day attorneys clicking through emails.”Jason Rooks, the chief information officer for a Missouri school district, said he began to be overwhelmed during the coronavirus pandemic with requests for electronic records from parents litigating custody battles or organizations suing schools over their covid-19 policies. At one point, he estimates, he was spending close to 40 hours a week just sifting through emails.Story continues below advertisementInstead, he hit on an e-discovery tool called Logikcull, which says it uses AI to help sift through documents and predict which ones are most likely to be relevant to a given case. Rooks could then manually review that smaller subset of documents, which cut the time he spent on each case by more than half. (Reveal acquired Logikcull in August, creating a legal tech company valued at more than $1 billion.)AdvertisementBut even using AI for legal grunt work such as e-discovery comes with risks, said Venkatasubramanian, the Brown professor: “If they’ve been subpoenaed and they produce some documents and not others because of a ChatGPT error — I’m not a lawyer, but that could be a problem.”Those warnings won’t stop people like Crabill, whose misadventures with ChatGPT were first reported by the Colorado radio station KRDO. After he submitted the error-laden motion, the case was thrown out for unrelated reasons.He says he still believes AI is the future of law.

Employment-Based Immigration to Get an Important Update with Biden’s Artificial Intelligence Executive Order

Posted by American Immigration Council Staff | Nov 17, 2023 | Business & the Workforce, Employment Based, High Skilled



 


Written by Steven Hubbard, Senior Data Scientist and Leslie Dellon, Senior Attorney (Business Immigration)
The White House’s recent executive order on artificial intelligence marks an important shift in employment-based immigration law, signaling the beginning of a potentially transformative process.
As one component of the process, President Biden has required the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue a request for information (RFI) by December 13 to consider updates to the Schedule A list of occupations. The RFI is to request input in “identifying AI and other STEM-related occupations.” This is a major step that invites public and expert engagement to shed light on the nuances of updating the list—a provision that has remained unchanged since 1991.
The modernization of the Schedule A list could be instrumental in addressing the urgent employment gaps the United States currently faces.
Understanding Schedule A
Schedule A is an important component of the employment-based immigration process in the United States. Established in the 1960s, it was designed to help the country attract foreign talent to fill labor shortages in various high-demand occupations and industries. When an occupation is listed on Schedule A, the Secretary of Labor has already established the need for workers, so certain time-consuming steps in the labor certification process are eliminated. An employer includes the labor certification application with its petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to sponsor the foreign worker.
The existing Schedule A list in Group I comprises just two occupation groups—physical therapists and professional nurses. Schedule A also has a Group II for certain workers in the sciences or arts.
However, the Schedule A list has not seen significant updates since 1991, rendering it outdated and disconnected from the current labor market realities. In today’s rapidly evolving job landscape and the added impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to reevaluate and update this list.
Updating the Schedule A List of Occupations
To navigate these challenges effectively, DOL should adopt a data-driven approach to updating the Schedule A list rather than creating a static list of which occupations currently are experiencing shortages. This means leveraging comprehensive labor market analytics to ensure the list accurately reflects the occupations where shortages are most acute. By analyzing trends in unemployment rates, employment growth, wage patterns, and job vacancy rates, the DOL can pinpoint sectors that are experiencing critical shortages and require intervention.
Countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have successfully employed such strategies. These nations adjust their shortage occupation lists regularly, considering extensive labor market research and input from key stakeholders. This dynamic approach allows for a responsive immigration system that adapts to the changing economic landscape and skill demands.
Modernization of Schedule A extends beyond the immediate benefits of filling job vacancies. It signifies a commitment to maintaining the United States’ status as a hub for innovation and progress. By attracting international talent in high-demand fields like STEM and healthcare, the U.S. can ensure that it has the skilled workforce necessary to drive forward advancements in these critical areas.
A data-driven update to Schedule A could also inform broader economic strategies, including the development of targeted workforce training programs and industry-education partnerships. Such strategic planning could facilitate the upskilling of the domestic workforce to meet future demand, thus complementing the contributions of international talent.
The White House’s AI executive order marks a pivotal moment in employment-based immigration, with the potential to reshape the labor certification process. Updating Schedule A through data-driven updates aligns with current economic conditions and offers predictability and flexibility to the employment-based immigration system. This step can help the United States address critical workforce gaps, stimulate economic growth, and remain competitive on a global scale. It’s a win-win for both international talent and U.S. workers alike.
However, unless Congress also modernizes the employment-based immigrant visa categories, with their annual limits creating lengthy wait times before many foreign workers can become U.S. lawful permanent residents, these workers may still seek opportunities in other countries.

Investment in GAI is substantial, with UK institutions spending between £800K and £1.6m, and US counterparts investing between $2.1m and $5m.Furthermore, a striking 66% of executives anticipate an average revenue increase of 20% due to GAI in the next three years. However, over half of the respondents (57%) expect GAI to lead to job losses, projecting an average workforce reduction of 30% in the next three years.The report is based on responses from senior technology decision-makers in major banks and insurance companies, with a focus on large-scale organisations in both the UK and the US.There’s a marked difference in perceptions of GAI based on age demographics. Younger individuals (aged 25-34) are more likely to see GAI positively compared to older counterparts, with 47% of those aged 55 and above viewing it more as a “foe.”While a sizeable portion of institutions are not yet using GAI, over 50% of the larger firms (with 3,000 or more employees) are currently implementing it. Interestingly, the US is ahead of the UK in terms of investment in GAI.Businesses are yet to reach a consensus on the areas that GAI will most benefit. Customer service, credit checks, lending automation, and market research are all areas being considered for its application.FintechOS co-Founder and CEO Teodor Blidarus said, “GAI is a terrain marked by both excitement and apprehension and our study explores the polarised sentiment that surrounds this groundbreaking technology. While opinions within the financial services industry are deeply divided, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will boost revenues but inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs.“Every financial institution has started its GAI journey and it’s imperative to take the first step – even if it’s a small one – to avoid being left behind. Only by starting the journey now, and understanding the implications can be mitigate the risks of GAI and better reap the rewards.”Keep up with all the latest FinTech news here.Copyright © 2023 FinTech Global  Enjoying the stories?Subscribe to our daily FinTech newsletter and get the latest industry news & research                  InvestorsThe following investor(s) were tagged in this article.TAGSfinancial services 2023FintechOSGAI InvestmentGenerative Artificial IntelligenceJob Displacement in FinanceTechnology Decision MakersUK Financial SectorUS Financial SectorPrevious articleMashreq, Visa, and ecolytiq launch carbon banking platform in MENANext articleVolt’s launches real-time payment tech in Australiajhaxell ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/'}, 'author': {'name': 'jhaxell', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/#/schema/person/257ea14d5748bee3795ede58dccd8b27'}, 'headline': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job', 'datePublished': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/'}, 'wordCount': 424, 'commentCount': 0, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'keywords': ['financial services 2023', 'FintechOS', 'GAI Investment', 'Generative Artificial Intelligence', 'Job Displacement in Finance', 'Technology Decision Makers', 'UK Financial Sector', 'US Financial Sector'], 'articleSection': ['FinTech News', 'Industry News'], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'CommentAction', 'name': 'Comment', 'target': ['https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#respond']}]}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/', 'name': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'datePublished': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'description': ""The new study by FintechOS titled 'Generative Artificial Intelligence: The Technology Polarising the Financial Services Industry' has found that 73% of financial services executives fear generative AI might replace their jobs eventually."", 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'width': 2560, 'height': 1707, 'caption': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Fintech', 'item': 'https://fintech.global/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/#website', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/', 'name': 'FinTech Global', 'description': 'Essential FinTech Intelligence &amp;

The landscape of work is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. This evolution is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how businesses operate and compete. AI, especially in its generative forms, is redefining job roles, skill requirements, and the very nature of work itself.


Writing in the Human Resource Management Journal, professors David Guest and Vijay Pereira of King’s College London and France’s NEOMA Business School respectively, drew attention to the evolving dynamics of AI in business. They highlighted that the increasing integration of AI technologies in business processes presents both new opportunities and challenges for organizations and their leaders.

In an interview, Pereira told me: “Evaluating the outcomes of AI concerns the extent to which a successful balance has been achieved between the technical and the social systems to ensure that the needs and mutual gains of stakeholders are addressed and that it leads to a good quality of working life with spill over effects into the community and beyond.”

PROMOTED
However, realizing this equilibrium requires a comprehensive reevaluation of workplace strategies, structures, and skills—an approach crucial for maximizing AI’s benefits, ensuring sustainable growth, and maintaining a competitive edge. This view is supported by Natalia Weisz, an expert in adaptive leadership who studied at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University—where she also served as invited faculty for the Executive Program of Adaptive Leadership Development. In an interview Weisz—who recently authored Strategy as Leadership published by Stanford University Press—told me, leaders need to foster an environment of ongoing learning and patience—acknowledging the challenges in emotional and skill development during AI integration.

“This entails leaders promoting a serene, learning-oriented atmosphere, honing AI competencies, steering clear of quick fixes, and adeptly handling the emotional dynamics of change, both at individual and collective levels,” she said.

European business leaders are largely optimistic about the impact of AI on their workforce. The majority believe that AI will benefit their employees by automating routine tasks, thereby increasing productivity and allowing more time for creative and strategic thinking—a shift which could lead to enhanced job satisfaction and more fulfilling work experiences.
The study also shows a significant increase in professionals seeking to improve their AI skills. There has been an 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses on LinkedIn over the past three months, and a 60% month-over-month increase in Generative AI skills being added to members’ profiles since January 2023. This trend highlights the growing recognition of the importance of AI proficiency in the modern job market. For leaders, these findings have several implications:
Investment In AI Leadership And Skills Development
As AI becomes increasingly integral to business operations, leaders must prioritize the development of AI-centric roles within their organizations. This involves not only creating new positions, such as ‘Head of AI’, but also ensuring that existing roles evolve to incorporate AI-related responsibilities. Investing in AI leadership means identifying and nurturing talent that can drive AI initiatives effectively. It’s about having the right people in place who can understand the nuances of AI technologies and how they can be applied strategically to benefit the organization.
Moreover, fostering a culture of continuous learning and skill development is essential. As AI technologies evolve, so too must the skills of the workforce. Leaders should facilitate ongoing education and training programs to help employees stay abreast of the latest AI developments and techniques. This could involve partnerships with educational institutions, access to online courses, or in-house training programs. By investing in their employees’ AI literacy, organizations not only enhance their capabilities but also demonstrate a commitment to their workforce’s professional growth, which can improve employee retention and satisfaction.
Strategic Planning for AI Integration
Integrating AI into business processes requires thoughtful and strategic planning. Leaders must first understand the potential of AI to automate tasks and enhance productivity. This involves identifying processes that are ripe for automation and understanding how AI can improve these processes. For example, AI can be used for data analysis, customer service, inventory management, and more. The key is to identify areas where AI can bring the most value and then develop a roadmap for implementation.
This strategic planning also involves considering the broader implications of AI integration, such as the impact on employee roles, changes in workflow, and potential cost savings or revenue opportunities. Leaders must also be mindful of ethical considerations and ensure that AI is used responsibly and transparently. Effective integration of AI requires a balance between technological possibilities and the human elements of business operations.
Adapting to a Changing Job Market
The rapid evolution of the job market due to AI advancements necessitates proactive adaptation from leaders. This means reevaluating existing job roles and considering how they might change or become obsolete with the advent of AI. Leaders must be forward-thinking, anticipating the skills in demand and preparing their workforce accordingly. This could involve retraining employees for new roles that AI creates or upskilling them to work alongside AI technologies.
Embracing new technologies is also crucial. Leaders should stay informed about the latest AI developments and be open to adopting new tools and platforms that can give their organization a competitive edge. This also means fostering an organizational culture that is open to change and innovation.
Finally, preparing the workforce for the changes AI will bring is about more than just skills training; it is about helping employees navigate the psychological and emotional aspects of working with AI. This includes addressing fears about job displacement and helping employees see AI as a tool that can enhance their work rather than replace it. By taking a holistic approach to adapting to a changing job market, leaders can ensure their organizations and employees are well-prepared for the future of work.

A.I… The two letters you can’t seem to escape. It seems like everyone in your inbox, your LinkedIn feed and your boardroom is discussing the consequences of AI-powered technology and how it’s radically disrupting the status quo in business, IT and, well, everything. But what are the real implications for your bottom line? How can generative AI help your company save time and money in a real way?
The best way to untangle the hype from the reality of AI is this: focus first on the existing issues that need to be addressed in your organization, rather than getting lost in hypothetical future advances.
Working ‘forward’ into an unknown future leads to confusion, but starting with tangible problems and pain points and working ‘backward’ helps locate where AI-enablement is needed. When it comes to ERP test automation, there’s one specific category of AI making waves: generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new and original content, like writing, images, music or even software tests by learning from existing examples. Why is it so innovative and dynamic? Because this tech is able to take in information and use its own reasoning to draw new conclusions. The ability to ideate new outcomes gives AI a depth and creative operability that is lacking in traditional automation and computerization, with considerable consequences for testing automation.
Reframe AI as an electronic Swiss Army knife, able to potentially help and improve on situations if applied in the correct way. With that in mind, AI software can enhance the ERP testing lifecycle at every stage, boosting efficiency in multiple ways:
Automated efficiency
AI-powered test automation tools excel at analyzing large amounts of data and uncovering patterns, resulting in more comprehensive test coverage. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predetermined test cases, AI automation intelligently designs test scenarios that closely mimic real-world user interactions. This not only covers critical functionalities but also uncovers hidden defects, ensuring robust software quality.
Intelligent test case generation
AI automation brings the advantage of automatic test case generation. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI tools analyze extensive data sets to identify patterns and dependencies. Through understanding the application’s various paths and scenarios, AI can generate relevant test cases without human intervention, saving time for testers and allowing them to focus on something else.
Quicker defect detection 
AI-powered automation tools expedite defect detection by continuously analyzing data and providing real-time insights during test execution, resulting in quicker resolutions. Machine learning algorithms identify abnormal behaviors and patterns, enabling prompt problem identification. By empowering developers with these new abilities, debugging time is greatly reduced, thus saving money by preventing defects from leaving the production line. This is the road most-traveled when considering the many possibilities of AI, since manual methods of searching for defects are notoriously cumbersome.
Self-repairing capabilities
AI-driven test automation is capable of self-learning and adapting to changes, providing resilience and efficiency. These automation tools can recognize when an element’s properties change and automatically update the test scripts accordingly.  The capability to self-repair means maintenance efforts are reduced, saving time and resources while also allowing the automation suite to remain up-to-date.
Constant improvement and optimization
AI-powered analytics enable test automation frameworks to continually analyze results and optimize test suites. After gathering the necessary data, AI algorithms can identify redundant or ineffective test cases and suggest improvements for maximum efficiency. This iterative process empowers companies to constantly enhance their testing strategies, resulting in substantial savings in both time and cost.
Embrace the machine 
Generative AI holds the potential to speed up software testing, and gives suggestions on how to streamline the process. It is also able to check for defects and breakages to a degree that would be impossible for a human mind in the same amount of time. In a world where system downtime can cost an organization up to $300,000 per hour, that peace of mind is valuable.
Overall, where are we headed? Into a brave new world of extreme efficiency, where human error no longer causes major disruptions and snarls in “business as usual”. Applying artificial intelligence solutions into your ERP environment is not a single, one-size-fits-all event; it’s a matter of finding your pain points and bottlenecks and applying the technology as-needed.

But would you trust a well-meaning AI assistant that can sometimes offer plausible yet inaccurate answers? And does anyone else see the queries that you submit, and if so, who? In other words, how safe is ChatGPT?ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) can provide opportunities at home and at work for efficiencies and improvements – but alongside these opportunities come risks around not just accuracy and bias, but the handling of personal information and security too. Here’s how to use ChatGPT safely for all your needs.Taking care with AI inaccuracy and biasTraining ChatGPT works by giving it previously unseen data sets to establish how well it makes predictions as it reviews the data. Then it is tested to see how well it performs with that new data. As such, its ability to supply quality information is only as good as the information that was given to it, and the current version of ChatGPT is only trained on data up to 2021. The data that feeds LLMs is likely to contain conflicting evidence, opinions and unreliable conclusions, and so bias issues are as inevitable as accuracy issues. DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. For personal and business use, the key to navigating accuracy and bias issues with ChatGPT is vigilance. Fact-checking statistics, using multiple sources for information, and engaging critically with AI-generated content with the understanding that generative AI may not understand complex or nuanced topics can mitigate accuracy issues.Because LLMs can only work with the data that is given to them – and as long as that data creates inaccuracies and bias – humans will need to be involved in the process to identify and remove them, says the Harvard Business Review.Vigilance with personal or sensitive informationEven though website visits are down for the third consecutive month, ChatGPT still had 180.5 million unique users in August 2023, and students returning to school in September may lead to a bump in traffic, as the education sector cautiously embraces AI. Many free apps and websites make their money by collecting and selling data, and ChatGPT operates in a similar way. Ensuring safety around your personal data, your children’s data, or the organization you work for is an important part of online security best practice. Have you read?AI: 3 ways artificial intelligence is changing the future of workAutomation or augmentation? This is how AI will be integrated into the jobs of tomorrowForget problem-solving. In the age of AI, it's problem-finding that countsChatGPT does not store user-specific data, nor does it store details of interactions beyond the immediate conversation it is having. But it does save all of the conversations you have with it, store them, and utilize this data to improve its language model. So the human trainers working behind the scenes at OpenAI will be able to see conversations and queries. To ensure a safer environment for your personal information and security, avoid sharing private information with ChatGPT. Consider disabling chat history and model training. But be aware that even if you disable the history, your chats will still be stored on Open AI’s servers for 30 days so that staff can monitor for abuse. And if you feel like this is not enough, you can request to delete your entire account and its data by emailing dsar@openai.com.Lastly, take care when installing extensions and apps on your computer or phone. Some apps and browsers that claim to bring ChatGPT functionality to your browser could be harvesting your data.The global AI market is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2030. Image: StatistaHow organizations can use AI safelyFor organizations using generative AI such as ChatGPT as part of their day-to-day operations, making sure both their staff and their customers are clear on the boundaries of use is a good first step, and many organizations provide clear and transparent AI policies to ensure best practices. For organizations looking to build their own LLM AI policies, the Corporate Governance Institute provides some guidance for areas to cover. “Incorporating cyber-resilience governance into [a company’s] business strategy is one of the most impactful principles when it comes to cyber resilience,” notes the World Economic Forum’s latest Global Cybersecurity Outlook report.

73% of UK insurance executives anticipate that Generative AI (GAI) will eventually take their jobs, according to a new study launched by FintechOS.
The firm’s new study, ‘Generative Artificial Intelligence: The Technology Polarising the Financial Services Industry’, unveils a host of varied opinions among UK insurance companies on the expectations, implementation, and impact of this fast-developing technology.
As per FintechOS, approximately 25% of those surveyed described themselves as “frightened”, while 23% admitted to feeling “curious” about GAI.
When asked whether they viewed the technology as friend or foe, 42% opted for “friend”, with 46% stating “foe”. FintechOS observed that 44% of UK insurance organisations are already utilising GAI in their workplace. Additionally, 48% are investing in GAI research, and 39% in its implementation.
The study also found that 66% of insurance executives anticipate an average 20% increase in revenue due to GAI within the next three years, with a fifth putting this figure even higher at 31-40%.

“Amid these often-conflicting views, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs,” FintechOS said.
The firm added, “More than half of UK insurers (60%) believe that GAI will result in job losses at their organisations, with an average headcount reduction of 30% over the next three years. The majority (73%) of UK banking executives expect their jobs will eventually be replaced by GAI.”
Commenting on the findings, Teodor Blidarus, co-founder and CEO at FintechOS, said, “GAI is a terrain marked by both excitement and apprehension, and our study explores the polarised sentiment that surrounds this groundbreaking technology.
“While opinions within the insurance industry are deeply divided, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will boost revenues but inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs.”
Blidarus added, “Every insurance company has started its GAI journey and it’s imperative to take the first step – even if it’s a small one – to avoid being left behind.
“Only by starting the journey now and understanding the implications can we mitigate the risks of GAI and better reap the rewards.”
FintechOS’ study is based on a survey of senior technology decision-makers within major banks and insurance companies, with more than 1,000 employees, operating in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
The survey was commissioned by FintechOS and was conducted by independent research company Censuswide over three weeks in August 2023.

What the data says about Americans’ views of artificial intelligence
By Michelle Faverio and Alec Tyson

(d3sign/Getty Images)
From detecting cancer on a medical scan to drafting an essay for a school assignment, artificial intelligence is increasingly shaping the way Americans live.

Pew Research Center surveys show that Americans are increasingly cautious about the growing role of AI in their lives generally. Today, 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI in daily life, compared with just 10% who say they are more excited than concerned; 36% feel a mix of excitement and concern.
Despite these cautious overall views, Americans see some specific uses of AI positively, and attitudes depend a great deal on the context of how and why AI is being used.
This post summarizes what we know so far about how Americans view AI in everyday life, the workplace, and health and medicine.
How we did this
This Pew Research Center analysis examines Americans’ views and experiences with artificial intelligence. The analysis draws primarily from recent surveys conducted by the Center. Links to these surveys, including information about the field dates, sample sizes and other methodological details, can be found in the text of the analysis.

Public awareness of AI
The vast majority of Americans (90%) say they’ve heard at least a little about artificial intelligence, according to an August 2023 survey. However, only one-in-three say they’ve heard a lot about it.
While most people are aware of AI, Americans’ ability to identify specific uses of the technology is still developing. Only 30% of U.S. adults correctly recognize all six examples of AI in everyday life that we asked about in a December 2022 survey.
And not everyone brings the same level of understanding. Adults with a college or postgraduate degree are more likely to be familiar with AI than those with less education. There are also significant differences by gender and age, with men and younger adults being more familiar with AI than women and older adults.
Views and experiences with ChatGPT
Generative AI, or programs that can produce text and images, garnered wide media attention in 2023. One prominent example of this technology is ChatGPT. We found in March 2023 that 58% of U.S. adults have heard of ChatGPT, while 42% have heard nothing at all about it.
As with awareness of AI generally, familiarity with ChatGPT is higher among men, younger adults and those with a college or postgraduate degree. 
Even though a majority of Americans are aware of the program, firsthand experience with it is relatively uncommon. Just 18% of all U.S. adults say they’ve used ChatGPT.
AI in schooling

We asked U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 about the program in a fall 2023 survey. We found that 67% are familiar with ChatGPT. And 19% of those teens say they have used it to help with their schoolwork.
Most teens who’ve heard of ChatGPT say it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT to research new things (69%). But fewer say the same about using it for things like solving math problems (39%). And a majority (57%) say it is not acceptable to use it to write essays.
Views of AI in the workplace

In 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are most exposed to AI, based on a Center analysis of government data. Those jobs tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college degree and analytical skills can be a plus.
Our December 2022 survey shows 62% of Americans believe AI will have a major impact on workers generally. However, far fewer think it will impact them personally in a major way (28%).
A majority of U.S. adults oppose using AI to make final hiring decisions or track workers’ movements on the job. In fact, 66% of Americans say they would not want to apply for a job with an employer who uses AI to help with hiring decisions. But there’s more openness to using AI in other ways, like monitoring workers’ driving while they make trips for work or tracking attendance.
Views of AI in health and medicine
Health and medicine is one area where many Americans may encounter artificial intelligence. AI is increasingly being used to do things like help diagnose disease and recommend treatment.
Yet six-in-ten Americans say they would feel uncomfortable with their health care provider relying on AI to help care for them.

More broadly, the public is divided on the impact of AI in health and medicine. While 38% say it will lead to better outcomes for patients, 33% say it will lead to worse outcomes and 27% say it won’t make much difference. One widely expressed concern is that AI will make patients’ personal relationships with their providers worse.
While Americans are cautious about the use of AI in health and medicine generally, they support some specific uses. For instance, 65% say they would want AI to be used in their own skin cancer screening. Studies have found some AI software to be highly accurate at detecting skin cancer.
Support for oversight and regulation of AI
By and large, Americans back regulation and oversight of emerging AI technologies, including chatbots and driverless vehicles.
For example, 67% of those who are familiar with chatbots like ChatGPT say they are more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating their use than that it will go too far. A much smaller share (31%) takes the opposite view.

When it comes to AI-powered driverless vehicles, 87% of Americans want them held to a higher testing standard than other passenger vehicles. Americans also commonly express unease around the unanticipated consequences and risks of these technologies. About three-quarters (76%) think it’s likely that the computer systems in driverless vehicles could be easily hacked, putting safety at risk.
A related concern is over the pace of AI adoption in society. In health and medicine, for instance, 75% of Americans think health care providers will move too fast using AI, before fully understanding the potential risks.
Common concerns – and sources of excitement – about AI
While the specific uses of AI matter a lot in how Americans feel about it, we see some common themes in what people like and don’t like about AI.
On the positive side
There are generally higher levels of support for AI when it is used to help with routine or basic tasks. A majority (57%) of Americans say they would be excited for AI to perform household chores, while just 19% express concern about this. Saving time or helping handle mundane tasks are also common reasons for excitement about AI.
Americans are also pretty positive when it comes to AI’s ability to help people find products and services they are interested in online. 
And while experts debate how AI will influence bias in society around things like race and gender, there are signs that the public is more optimistic than pessimistic. For example, among U.S. adults who see a problem with racial and ethnic bias in health and medicine, more think the use of AI would make the issue of bias better than worse (51% vs. 15%). Similarly, among those who see bias in hiring as an issue, more think AI would improve the problem of bias based on job applicants’ race or ethnicity than say it would worsen it (53% vs. 13%).
On the negative side
There’s broad concern about the loss of the human element due to emerging AI technologies, especially in settings like the workplace and health care. Many Americans who would not want to apply for a job that uses AI in the hiring process cite a lack of the “human factor” in hiring as the reason why. In health and medicine, a majority of Americans think relying more on AI would hurt patients’ relationships with their providers.
The potential for negative impacts on jobs is another common concern with AI. Among those who say they’re more concerned than excited about AI, the risk of people losing their job is cited most often as the reason why. We also see this concern with some specific examples of AI. For example, 83% of Americans think driverless cars would lead to job loss for ride-share and delivery drivers.
Surveillance and data privacy are also concerns when discussing AI. Large majorities of Americans who are aware of AI think that as companies use AI, personal information will be used in unintended ways and ways people are not comfortable with.

Work & Technology Correspondent







One year after the launch of ChatGPT, more than 300,000 people in Ireland have used artificial intelligence at work, according to new research from Deloitte.
The study found that over 60% of people in Ireland have heard of Generative AI, with 33% having used the technology.
Among those who were aware of the technology, over three in five believed that Generative AI will reduce the number of jobs available in the future and almost half of respondents said they are concerned that Generative AI will replace some of their role in the workforce in the future.
More than one in ten respondents, reported having used Generative AI tools for work.
Deloitte's research also found that of those who have used Generative AI, more than one in three believe it always produces factually accurate responses and 31% agree that its responses are unbiased.
""As we approach the first anniversary of ChatGPT’s launch, it is interesting that Deloitte research finds that over 300,000 people in Ireland have used the technology for work purposes,"" said Partner Risk Advisory with Deloitte Colm McDonnell.
""By far the most popular purpose of using Generative AI is for personal purposes while 34% of respondents use it for education.""
""It is clear from these responses that the use of Generative AI will only increase with time and greater adoption,"" Mr McDonnell said.
The research is part of Deloitte’s Global Digital Consumer Trends survey, a multi-country study of digital service users worldwide.
The 2023 global study comprises 28,350 respondents across 18 countries and three continents.
The Irish data is based on a survey of 1,000 adults which was conducted in September.

SnapLogic Chief Scientist’s Generative AI predictionsBy Tech Wire Asia






SnapLogic’s Chief Scientist Greg Benson reveals his predictions on Generative AI and the challenges and opportunities it presents in the year ahead.Prediction 1 – Generative AI won’t take your job, but it might change itIn 2024, Generative AI won’t lead to mass job displacements and redundancies, as many early sensationalist reports suggested. Generative AI won’t completely replace experts in any field, as although models have access to an insurmountable amount of information, users still have to articulate concepts well enough to get the right answers. Thus, expertise, human input, and, more importantly, human review will always be necessary.Collaboration with Generative AI is a trend we expect to continue in 2024 as businesses capitalize on the technology’s benefits, reaping the rewards of increased productivity and improved quality of content. Those rewards mean greater adoption of more Generative AI tools, with the goal not to replace workers but to assist them.  Prediction 2 – Now that we’ve invented Generative AI, the next step is understanding itSnapLogic’s Chief Scientist Greg BensonNext year, we can expect to see businesses attempt to improve the consistency of output from Generative AI. Currently, there is no rule book to achieve great results with Generative AI; there are tips and tricks you can deploy for better or faster results, but overall, the process is largely trial and error.Interacting with Generative AI in its current iteration is like a science experiment – you come up with a hypothesis and continue to test different manners of prompts until it produces the result you’re looking for. In the future, experimentation will focus on figuring out how we evaluate the responses it gives us and using that data to inform prompts further.Companies that want to apply Generative AI to their products will need to think about how they evolve prompts that improve results directly. Qualitative and quantitative improvements can only be brought about by re-evaluating their AI application and development approaches.Prediction 3 –Expect an onslaught of Generative AI tools and Generative AI startups.In 2024, we will see another year of the AI market expanding, with more variety as Generative AI startups try to find their niche.SYNCRON STRENGTHENS SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITY WITH SNAPLOGICAaron Raj | 24 November, 2023Rather than consolidation, more Generative AI solutions will continue to pop up in different industries. Of course, there will be a lot of attempts that don’t get traction or just don’t work, but this won’t deter the wave of opportunistic entrepreneurs and businesses looking to capitalize on the Generative AI wave.There’s already the start of a huge race in hardware, too: companies such as Google and AWS are building their own AI hardware to compete with Nvidia. If successful, advances in hardware could lead to another explosion in how large language models are trained, as currently, it takes a lot of human input, money, and effort to build from the ground up.In 2024, we will see another year of the AI market expanding, with more variety as Generative AI startups try to find their niche. (Image generated by AI)Prediction 4 – Generative AI regulation is essential to adoption.Regulating Generative AI will be a huge focus for governing bodies and business leaders in 2024. Earlier this year, calls were heard from many industry figures for a pause in AI development. However, that’s not realistic as the fundamental technology is increasingly available through open-source models on Hugging Face. Rather than focusing on halting development, creating clear regulations, guidelines, and best-use practices will be necessary to ensure partnership with AI will move forward safely and securely.Like any other technology, defining safe boundaries will allow leveraging the benefits without sacrificing progress. We can liken this to all manner of regulated tools and equipment; for example, we don’t stop ourselves from building cars that go fast, but we do put speed limits in place to ensure safety. Internationally, governments will focus first on areas of regulation that present the greatest impact on citizens, including frontier AI.SNAPLOGIC EXPANDS ‘SNAPGPT’ GENERATIVE AI CAPABILITIES WITH AMAZON BEDROCKMuhammad Zulhusni | 6 October, 2023From an industry perspective, the Generative AI applications and use cases that are most helpful will emerge as front runners for wider business use. Understanding the risks, challenges, and security issues potentially imposed by these tools will be vital for businesses to understand exactly when and how these tools need to be regulated internally. Likewise, companies hoping to leverage Generative AI will have to communicate to customers exactly how it’s used and how it complies with current and future regulations.Prediction 5 – Generative AI and Legacy technology: Why the key to modernization may reside in Generative AI tools.After a year of Generative AI practice, legacy businesses are starting to understand that Generative AI interest is not just driven by hype and could be transformative in their sector. Therefore, in 2024, we can expect more traditional businesses to deploy the technology to help evolve legacy systems and modernize their technology stacks.Typically, traditional companies are not amenable to change or agile enough to adopt the latest in technology. Many companies are tied to legacy software due to a combination of outdated procurement processes, familiarity, or concerns about data loss or disruption, making modernization inaccessible. The key here is that Generative AI can assist with migrating from old code bases and technology stacks to modern programming languages and platforms.However, Generative AI could bridge the gap by allowing companies previously locked into legacy systems to access a more modern workforce’s knowledge and work practices. Generative AI also makes some modern tools far more user-friendly and, therefore, more likely to be deployed in businesses.Students will also interact with Generative AI on a greater scale. (Image by generative AI)Prediction 6 – AI and the question of originalityNext year, we’ll see the average person become more adept at using AI in their business and personal lives. Students will also interact with Generative AI on a greater scale.On the one hand, ChatGPT and others can be great personal tutors to help students understand concepts. On the other, ChatGPT can be used to generate solutions to problems. I tell my students that they can use Generative AI to help them as they learn, but they must turn in original work. It is extremely tempting to have Generative AI provide answers or just partial answers. Since answers come from a computer program and not another student, it distances students from the notion they are cheating. So far, for my classes in computer systems, it has been fairly easy to determine if a student has turned in Generative AI-generated solutions because they don’t follow the code conventions I’ve taught in class and require in student solutions.How Generative AI is used in classrooms is very much a work in progress. At the moment, there’s still no best practice model – even at my university, we have workshops about AI, but no succinct policy. Beyond the classroom is the larger question of intellectual property and how Generative AI is trained on internet-accessible creations and work. This will play out in all industries and the courts in 2024.Prediction 7 – Universities will begin to teach prompt engineeringIn 2024, universities will teach prompt engineering as a minor field of study and through certificate programs. Prompt engineering for Generative AI is a skill already augmenting the work of domain experts, similar to how computing augments other domains. The successful use of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on giving the models the right prompts. When looking to fill the role of a prompt engineer, the task becomes finding a domain expert who can formulate a question with examples in a specific domain. That’s a skill critical for today’s IT professionals to successfully implement LLMs. Given this, universities will introduce new academic focus areas to address the growing demand for professionals with specific skills to build the next generation of Generative AI applications.About SnapLogic SnapLogic is the leader in generative integration.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the ways we think, learn and work. 
But, like some other forms of AI, GenAI technologies have a black box nature — meaning it’s hard to explain and understand how mathematical models compute their output. 
If we as a society are to employ this new technology on a broad scale, we will need to engage in a collective discovery process to better understand how it works and what it is capable of. 
As AI experts work on making AI systems more comprehensible to end users, and as OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, navigates leadership shakeups and questions about its strategic direction, post-secondary institutions have a critical role to play in enabling collective learning about GenAI.

Difficult to understand
For AI systems based on large neural networks with a black box nature, like GenAI, a lack of transparency makes it difficult for people to trust the AI and to rely on it for sensitive applications.
Carnegie Mellon University professor Elizabeth A. Holm has argued that black box AIs can still be valuable if they produce better results than alternatives, if the cost of wrong answers is low or if they inspire new ideas. 
Still, cases of matters gone horribly wrong erode trust, such as when ChatGPT got tricked into giving instructions to make a bomb, or when it accused a law professor of a serious crime he didn’t commit. 
This is why researchers working on AI explainability have tried to devise techniques to see into the black box of neural networks. However, the LLMs behind many GenAI tools are just too large and too complex for these methods to work.



Universities should lead learning about different ways to use GenAI.

Fortunately, LLMs like ChatGPT have an interesting feature that previous black box neural networks did not have: they are interactive. Think of it this way: we cannot understand what a person is thinking by looking at a map of the neurons in their brain, but we can talk to them.

‘Machine psychology’
A new field of science is emerging under the label of “machine psychology” to understand how LLMs actually “think.” 
New research, yet to be peer reviewed, is examining how these models can surprise us with their emergent capabilities. For example, researchers surmised that because with LLMs every new word generated depends on the sequence of words that came before it, asking an LLM to work through a problem step by step may produce better results. 
New studies, not yet peer reviewed, on this “chain of thought” technique and variations of it have shown they improve outcomes. Others suggest LLMs can be “emotionally manipulated” by including phrases like “are you sure?” or “believe in your abilities” in prompting. 
In an interesting combination of these two methods, Google DeepMind researchers recently found that for a series of math problems, one LLM improved its accuracy significantly when it was prompted with “take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.”

      ChatGPT's greatest achievement might just be its ability to trick us into thinking that it's honest




Collective discovery
Understanding GenAI is not something only researchers are doing, and that’s a good thing. New discoveries that users have made have surprised even the makers of those tools, in both delightful and alarming ways.
Users are sharing their discoveries and prompts in online communities such as Reddit, Discord and dedicated platforms such as FlowGPT. 
These prompts often include “jailbreak” prompts that succeed in getting GenAI tools to behave in ways they are not supposed to. People can trick AI into bypassing built-in rules — for example, producing hateful content — or creating malware.  
These rapid advances and surprising outcomes are why some AI leaders called for a six-month moratorium on AI development earlier this year.
AI and learning
In higher education, an overly defensive approach emphasizing flaws and weaknesses of GenAI or how it allows students to cheat is ill-advised.

      ChatGPT and cheating: 5 ways to change how students are graded




On the contrary, as workplaces start to see the benefits of GenAI-powered employees or workplace productivity, they will expect higher education to prepare students. Students’ education needs to be relevant.   
Universities are ideal spaces to forge co-operation across research fields, an imperative of developing responsible AI. Universities, in contrast to the private sector, are best positioned to embed their GenAI practices and content within a framework of ethical and responsible practice.
One thing this entails is understanding of GenAI as an augment, not a substitute, for human judgement and discerning when relying on this is permissable and acceptable. 
Educating for GenAI involves developing critical thinking and fact-checking skills, and ethical prompt engineering. It also involves understanding that GenAI tools do not just repeat their training data, and can generate new, and high-quality ideas based on patterns in that data.
The ChatGPT and AI for Higher Education UNESCO Quick Guide is a helpful starting point.

Including GenAI in the curriculum cannot be treated as top-down teaching. Given the rapid development and newness of the technology, many students are already ahead of the professors in their GenAI knowledge and skills. We must recognize this as an era of collective discovery, where we are all learning from each other. 
In the “Generative AI and Prompting” course offered at the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, a portion of grades are allocated to posting, commenting and voting on an online “discovery forum” to share their discoveries and experiments.

Learning by doing and experimenting
Lastly, we should be learning how to use GenAI for tackling humanity’s greatest challenges, such as climate change, poverty, disease, international conflict and systemic injustice.
Given the powerful nature of this technology, and the fact that we do not fully understand it due to its black box nature, we should do what we can to understand it through interaction and learning by doing and experimenting.
This is not an effort that can be confined to the works of specialized researchers or AI companies. It requires broad participation.

Artificial intelligence will be a game changer for headhunting. In a conversation with Nancy Xu, the founder and CEO of Moonhub, an AI recruiting company, Xu detailed how automation and machine learning will radically change the recruitment process and improve the candidate and job hunter experience.


“My passion for AI stemmed from realizing its outsized societal impact,” Xu stated. “I'm driven by the fundamental belief that talent is universal, but opportunities aren't. I started to think, how could I use AI to democratize access to jobs and get people hired because of their talent and not just pedigree?” She lamented, “On one hand, I could help really talented people find better, more fulfilling jobs, and I could help companies that are solving important problems get matched with the best talent to do those jobs.”

Xu is on a mission to make Moonhub, backed by investors including Day One Ventures, Alphabet’s GV, Khosla Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and former YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki, one of the world's first AI recruiters. Her goal is to help recruiting teams find the best, most appropriate candidates for a job opening more efficiently than traditional headhunting. “I'm really passionate about the potential AI has to give people opportunity and agency, and eliminate barriers for underserved talent to accessing quality jobs,” Xu said.

PROMOTED
Her company leverages AI to enable internal corporate talent acquisition teams and outside third-party recruiters to source and screen candidates. After the AI provides several appropriate on-target applicants, human recruiters will pick up the process and usher the candidates through the interview and hiring process. The AI-powered platform offers an advantage in finding and assessing relevant talent quickly and at scale.

From The Past To The Future
For years, the typical recruiting process remained little unchanged. It would start with human resources and a manager needing to find candidates to fill an open position. The company would have its talent acquisition team briefed on what the hiring manager is looking for in an applicant and then start scouring LinkedIn, job boards and tapping into its internal database to find candidates that fit the job description. The firm would also invite third-party recruiters to help with difficult searches to supplement the efforts of the internal corporate recruiters.

Headhunting can be a lengthy and challenging ordeal. It takes a lot of time and energy to search for people who look like they have the right skills and experiences for the role. Recruiters will spend time sifting through hundreds of résumés and sending texts, emails and cold reachouts to find potential candidates for a position. Searching for a mid to senior-level, white-collar professional can take weeks to several months to find an appropriate slate of candidates, interview them, go through the hiring process and ultimately find the right fit.

Instead of doing the drudgery work, by leveraging AI, recruiters are empowered to hone in on potential candidates with all the right qualities, experiences, background, education, skills and appropriate licenses and credentials. Automation saves recruiters time and energy by finding the on-target applicants quickly and easily. According to Xu, customers report finding candidates 2x faster using Moonhub.

Allowing AI to do the behind-the-scenes work frees recruiters to focus on the relationship-driven aspects of the hiring process to ensure the match is suitable for both the candidate and the company.
Xu spoke to the importance of facilitating a seamless candidate experience for the hiring organization, as it directly influences their reputation, employer brand and the ability to attract top talent. “The recruitment process serves as a candidate's initial interaction with a prospective employer, shaping their perception of the company's values and culture. A positive experience characterized by clear communication, efficient processes and tailored and relevant outreach will increase the likelihood of actually hiring talent. On the other hand, a negative experience can deter qualified candidates,” the founder stated.
How The AI Recruiting Process Works
The startup helps companies find and hire talent across many sectors. With conversational AI, a real-time people database and a focus on sourcing and outreach, Moonhub helps find hidden gems that traditional recruiting methods might otherwise miss.
Day One Ventures' founder and general partner Masha Bucher said of Moonhub’s value add for companies that want to hire the highest quality talent quickly, “The AI is a game-changing tool that’ll enhance hiring managers and recruiting leaders’ abilities to do their jobs more effectively. Recruiters tell Moonhub what type of candidate they’re looking for, and in five minutes, the AI will recommend a list of 50-plus targeted candidates, saving them dozens of hours of work.”
It looks beyond the typical attributes to find candidates who are an excellent fit for any job opportunity. The platform leverages AI and data science to identify and source potential candidates from across the internet, searching GitHub, StackOverflow, LinkedIn and other sites.
After identifying candidates, Moonhub screens them through automated assessments to further validate their skills and abilities that match the job description. This helps filter candidates before human review, saving time for recruiters from having to go through hundreds or even thousands of résumés manually.
Human recruiters then manually review the screened candidates to evaluate their experience, portfolios, projects and other qualifications. The process uniquely combines AI screening along with the human judgment of recruiters.
Xu urged that human recruiters not feel threatened by automation but view it as a valuable tool that complements and enhances their capabilities.
She said, “The essential things that recruiters do—persuading and communicating with candidates—that can’t really be replaced. However, most recruiters spend time on tasks that don’t relate to these core competencies.”
AI recruiters excel in handling repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as résumé screening and initial candidate assessments, allowing human recruiters to focus on more strategic and relationship-driven aspects of the hiring process. AI can swiftly analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, source candidates and calibrate back and forth with the recruiter and hiring manager.
Moreover, AI can help eliminate bias in the recruitment process by making decisions based on objective criteria rather than subjective judgment.
“While AI brings efficiency to certain aspects of recruiting, human recruiters remain essential for building personal connections, understanding nuanced candidate qualities and navigating interpersonal dynamics. Ultimately, an AI recruiter will only supercharge human recruiters’ abilities to do their jobs and fill roles more effectively,” Xu stated.

The 2023 Skills Index report from BTG (Business Talent Group) unearthed some striking data about artificial intelligence and its integration in today's workplace. Data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning remain in-demand skills, with data science and machine learning at 100%+ demand compared to previous years. And this is anticipated to be the case for at least the next few years as AI tools continue to roll out following the emergence of chat GPT in the market in November 2022.


However, while demand is at an all-time high, one year on from ChatGPT's launch, approximately 71% of employers are still facing challenges due to lacking the internal expertise on how to effectively use artificial intelligence, and specifically generative AI, as part of their non-technical workflow.

Some of the core challenges highlighted by the report include lack of clarity as to AI regulations, little understanding amongst senior leadership teams, concerns related to data protection and security, being too busy with other important matters, and finally lack of understanding as to where it can be best applied. This poses a significant challenge as relates to AI integration, and means that the World Economic Forum's predictions of generative AI boosting the economy by up to 14.4 trillion may be retarded in progress due to limited knowledge.

PROMOTED
So what can be done to resolve this internal knowledge gap?

Become AI Aware
The very first step to take is for key internal stakeholders and business partners to develop awareness of AI and its capabilities through undertaking training, and how it can improve decision-making, forecasting, analysis, and everyday workflows. With this knowledge, leaders can be empowered to make the right choices for their organizations.

Work With Consultants
Another simple solution would be for employers to call in external AI consultants who are verified subject matter experts within this domain, and whose expertise relates specifically to AI ethics and regulations, and data protection and security. These consultants could work in collaboration with employers to advise them on how to integrate AI into their work without compromising data or trust.

AI Change Management And Focus Groups
Another longer term approach which might be more suitable for some employers would be too hire someone to oversee AI change management, or to have an AI focus group. Although the concept is relatively new, this type of change management may prove to be highly effective in rolling out artificial intelligence usage, department by department, until everyone is using AI tools to boost their productivity.

You might want to consider running pilot projects to test user experience and acceptance before rolling out across the entire company, and collate this feedback to assess what tools are best for you and your organisation's objectives. Once you have done this, you can work on scaling gradually and gathering feedback for each user group.
Training At All Levels
Another important step would be to provide extensive training to employees at all levels, from senior leadership down to middle managers and entry level, on how to deploy AI, and to establish ethical guidelines on what its capabilities are. This will help to remove any misconceptions or worries surrounding using this technology.
Adopting and integrating AI should be a top priority for employers. If it's not yours right now, it will be when your competitors gain the upper hand and steal your talent and your customers. Through persistence, experimentation, and training, generative AI can be the new normal of work life, freeing up employees to more creative endeavors and enabling improved mental health and wellbeing through reduced work.
Who knows, this might result in the long-awaited four day work week?

KEY TAKEAWAYS
We speak to research groups about how employers and employees expect to use generative AI — and the importance of leveraging the technology across a global workforce.




Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI, artificial intelligence (AI) is now firmly entrenched in the business world.
Employers and employees are enthusiastic about its potential but are still getting to grips with how AI — particularly generative AI — will benefit them the most.
Data collated by labor market analytics firm Lightcast shows that the number of job listings related to generative AI took off in the first half of 2023. This reflects the shift in generative AI from a concept in testing to a tool that is commonly used, not only by technical experts.
via LightCast
Who will benefit most is unclear, as employers and employees point to each other as the most likely beneficiary, with 58% of global executives believing that employees will benefit more, whereas 53% of global employees believe that executives will benefit most.
While 84% of employees are hesitant about using AI, 93% say they are excited about the potential uses of AI at work (PDF), according to a study by human resources solutions provider Globalization Partners (G-P).
Gangadhar Konduri, G-P’s Senior Vice President and Head of Product and Design, told Techopedia:Advertisements




“If you put all these Lego pieces of the puzzle together — employees and employers both think that it is very important and AI is going to really help them, most of the executives think global organizations are going to help adopt these kinds of new technologies better, and then with respect to the scarcity of the talent they need to go global.
“The right recipe for success is to adopt the technology in a thoughtful way and to grow globally in order to make that adoption go faster.”
Almost half of executives, 48%, report that global organizations are better at adopting and implementing the latest technology and tools.
Both executives and employees are aligned on using AI to review and summarize information and tailor documents to different languages and cultures.
Employees are more enthusiastic about using AI tools to automate repetitive tasks, while executives prefer using AI to track data to quantify the impact of their work.
There are reasons for executives and employees alike to be enthusiastic about using AI. Nearly half of all executives (48%) and 45% of employees believe that AI will significantly improve not just automation but also the ability to predict and address business challenges.
There are three key ways in which employers can harness employee enthusiasm to leverage the benefits of AI, Konduri said:

Align company and employee visions on automation to help employees free up their time to focus on value-added work.
Provide training and expansion opportunities so that new technologies can be adopted seamlessly.
Pair up employees with a global counterpart, whether a manager or a peer, to help them grow.

The Impact of AI on Approaches to Skills Development
As AI systems take on the most repetitive, replicable tasks, there will likely be a stronger focus on human skills such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, according to Lightcast.
“As AI takes on more rote tasks like coding and programming, as well as even basic writing tasks, workers will need to take on more stakeholder management and idea generation,” Lightcast states.
Analysis by Lightcast and the OECD shows that while all employers using AI consistently demand human or baseline skills, the companies that posted the most AI jobs indicated a higher need for workers who combine their technical skills with leadership, innovation, and problem-solving.
G-P’s Konduri tole Techopedia:
“Skill development needs to be bi-directional and global.
 
“It’s important for employers to set up the right opportunities for employees to develop those skills — and it is not just developing skills, but developing and using them and getting some value.
 
“So the employers need to provide those opportunities and the employees need to look for those opportunities.”
Lightcast found that skill requirements are changing rapidly: on average, 37% of the top 20 skills in a job changed in just five years — a dynamic that generative AI will exacerbate.
“Reskilling is even more important than before – and employers should rethink both the skills they train on and how they train. Assessing skills gaps or training needs can no longer be a one-and-done exercise by employers and training providers,” Lightcast said.
Employers should allocate internal resources to increase mentoring, shadowing, and apprenticeships rather than waiting for content to be developed to show employees how they can best use AI. This can help employers fill skills gaps without wasting money on resources that are not agile enough to change with their needs.
‘Digital When You Want It but Human When You Need It’
The thoughtful implementation of skills-based hiring will become more critical as traditional methods of initially screening applicants, such as cover letters, will become less helpful to employers. Work sample tests, short job-related case studies, or other project-based hiring tools are likely to become more popular and tend to be less biased, according to Lightcast.
AI is taking on a transformational role in recruitment, particularly when hiring global talent.
“It is fundamentally important as you consider entering a new geographic location,” Konduri said. “And it is not just hiring: it is about compliance and ongoing nurturing and management of talent, and AI will help companies stay on the forefront of these emerging trends.”
To avoid the risk of bias or unintended consequences in the use of AI systems, “a good governance model, a good automated feedback loop model, and good automated testing for that is absolutely required, and it needs to be paired with humans,” Konduri said.
“We use a phrase: ‘Digital when you want it but human when you need it’ — we need to have that human element to make sure that you’re not only getting to the results that you want, but you are also getting there thoughtfully and with no unintended side effects.
“You want to make sure there are no ‘hallucinations’.”
Replacing Tasks, Not Jobs
Concerns about technology and automation eliminating jobs are not new, Lightcast notes. But, the ways in which AI can and will change jobs are not entirely negative.
Even if large language models (LMMs), which power generative AI tools like ChatGPT, take on writing marketing copy, for example, there still needs to be a human identifying topics and prompting the tool.
Marketing specialists may then need training in prompt engineering.
The top titles for job listings referring to generative AI in the 12 months to September 2023 included data scientists, machine learning engineers, curriculum writers, software engineers, and research scientists.
via Lightcast
“‘Is AI going to replace the workforce?’ is not the complete question,” Konduri said. “Even provocatively, you can answer it as ‘yes, AI is going to replace part of the workforce’.
“Because the real question is not is AI going to replace the workforce — the real question is ‘is AI going to replace the repetitive parts of the workforce so that we can unshackle and unblock the potential of the workforce and humans?’
“That is the principle that is important to reinforce.”
The Bottom Line
Generative AI is transforming the role of employers and employees and will require a new approach to skills development as automation shifts the emphasis to uniquely human abilities.
AI can be a valuable tool in global recruitment, compliance, and employee management, but it must be moderated by human involvement to ensure it is used appropriately without unintended consequences.

AI impact on society



The 2023 word of the year: artificial intelligence. And it’s pushing the boundaries of technology capabilities and human intelligence.
As we venture further into the growth phase of artificial intelligence (AI), the landscape is filled with unparalleled innovations that promise to redefine our way of life.
Such promises come with boundless opportunities and intricate challenges that beg for deep reflection and careful navigation. Understanding these facets becomes indispensable for businesses, innovators, and even the everyday citizen at this pivotal juncture.
So today, let’s dive into the future of artificial intelligence. We’ll uncover the opportunities that await, the hurdles we must overcome, and the profound impact AI will cast upon our society as we know it.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Opportunities
Revolutionizing the Startup World With Automation and Personalization
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative force, revolutionizing how enterprises operate their business.
Deloitte surveyed 2,620 global leaders, and 94% of respondents agree that AI is critical to their success.
Why? This cutting-edge technology offers tools and solutions that empower companies with valuable insights, streamlined processes, and enhanced customer experiences.
So, when starting a new business and trying to keep up with the big dogs, keeping a pulse on AI technology is a surefire way to keep yourself in the running and establish yourself a solid foundation for future success.
One way that AI helps entrepreneurs kickstart their online ventures is through market research and data analysis. AI-powered algorithms can swiftly gather and analyze vast amounts of data, providing valuable insights into:

Competitive landscapes
Customer preferences
Market trends

With this knowledge, entrepreneurs can make informed decisions, identify untapped opportunities, and tailor their business strategies to meet specific market demands.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI’s automation capabilities are pivotal in streamlining various business processes.
You know the drill: work smarter, not harder. For example, with AI text generators, business owners can spend less time on repetitive tasks like writing thousands of product descriptions and more time on growth initiatives.
AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries and provide instant support 24/7. This round-the-clock assistance fosters customer satisfaction and engagement, even during non-business hours, ultimately driving sales and brand loyalty. Plus, it takes some of the burden off your customer support team.
And then there’s personalization. Recent studies show that 80% of shoppers are more likely to purchase from a brand that goes above and beyond to provide personalized experiences.
AI is the perfect tool for recommending relevant products and delivering personalized marketing by analyzing customer behavior and preferences. It’s a no-brainer to let the tools do the heavy lifting, creating a more tailored and appealing experience consumers crave.
This level of personalization increases customer engagement and conversion rates, translating into higher revenues and sustainable growth. What’s not to love?
The Rise of Smart Cities: Urban Planning and Infrastructure
A report from The Insight Partners predicts the global smart city industry will reach a valuation of $3,110 billion by 2028, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%.
What’s behind this astronomical growth? Integrating technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and big data analytics into urban settings.
The perks of smart city solutions pave the way for advanced urban design, heightened energy conservation, and superior public services.
Both governmental bodies and corporate sectors are pouring funds into these innovations, catering to the escalating demands for greener and more effective city infrastructure.
Take, for example, Chattanooga, TN. They’ve joined forces with Seoul Robotics to roll out a lidar-infused traffic control system. This platform feeds the city real-time information on traffic dynamics and bottlenecks.
This tech allows this southern Tennesee city to:

Provide swift responses from emergency teams in the case of accidents.
Leverage precise data for refining traffic strategies.

But the shift by Chattanooga reflects a larger global transformation. Cities (small and large) are harnessing intelligent tech to upgrade their civic amenities and infrastructure.
The future of urban areas? Omnipresent sensors — from lidar to atmospheric monitors — work around the clock to improve the lives of its citizens.
The smart city sector is on the brink of a significant surge, a change steered by the embrace of advanced technologies and a universal push for improvements in a sleepy industry. Digital transformation is here to stay.
Unleashing the Potential of Data Analytics and Big Data
Thanks to smartphones, IoT, and computers, we’ve been sitting on a surge of big data before defining the term.
Sadly, the vastness of this information is too complex and outgrows human analysis. The solution? The rise of AI algorithms.
Enter the dynamic duo: AI and big data. Together, they’re shaping future trends in sectors from business to entertainment. AI thrives on this data, deepening its understanding of consumer behaviors through online activities and social interactions. Yet, its effectiveness is tied to the quality of data it consumes.
For example, an employee cost calculator powered by AI can only accurately assess the total cost of employment (for hiring new headcount from across the globe) if the data used to train the model is vetted and accurate. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.
But Forbes underscores a fascinating point: combining AI with big data could automate almost 80% of the physical work and substantial parts of data processing and collection. This fusion isn’t just streamlining supply chains but reshaping businesses as they pivot strategies based on real-time insights.
With AI growing more autonomous and powerful, our future hinges on harmonizing it with our human touch. And upskilling is necessary to prime the next wave of experts for this exciting frontier.
Boosting Creativity: AI in Music, Video, and Design
Artistry and design stem from passion, human intuition, and emotion. Yet, the emergence of AI presents a wide range of new avenues for creativity and innovation.
Predictive algorithms can forecast fashion trends. AI-driven design software can optimize architectural layouts for efficiency and aesthetics.
In graphic design, AI-powered tools can auto-adjust layouts, recommend color schemes, or generate brand logos. The result? A design process that’s more efficient than ever. And you’ll never face a design rut again.
On the music front, Paul McCartney told BBC Radio that he’s planning to use artificial intelligence to create the final Beatles song (which’d include vocals from the late John Lennon)—pure magic.
Venturing into video production, AI can now auto-curate content, guaranteeing that only the most engaging clips make the final cut. It can also optimize video sequences for color grading, stabilization, and audio synchronization with voice-over services.
TL; DR. AI marries the raw, emotive essence of human creativity with the precision and efficiency of machine learning, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in music, video, and design.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Challenges
Overcoming Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Concerns
AI requires an enormous amount of data to function correctly — but how do we ensure that the data collected is safe from hackers and other bad actors?
​​The astonishing number of records exposed in 2022, each breach averaging $4.35 million, underscores the vulnerability of our contemporary data systems. Apart from their immediate financial implications, these breaches erode public trust and emphasize the urgent need for more robust data protection measures.
As AI systems become more intertwined with daily life, organizations must invest heavily in advanced encryption techniques, multi-factor authentication, and blockchain technology.
Machine learning is advancing to help predict and detect breaches. This scenario creates an AI versus AI interstellar — where intelligent algorithms work tirelessly to counteract the malicious intents of rogue AIs or hackers. Genius or totally crazy?
53% of global leaders agree that cybersecurity is one of the main threats to the mass adaptation of artificial intelligence. However, only 38% confirmed they implemented practices to safeguard their data.
Is there enough time to recoup this gap?
Navigating the Regulatory Landscape of AI Technologies
As AI rockets us into the future, ‌government regulations must play catch-up.
And Elon Musk (of all people) is spearheading this movement. He says, “There is a real danger for digital superintelligence having negative consequences,” and he’s “in favor of AI regulation.”
The problem? Developers are racing to produce increasingly powerful digital intellects. According to a letter by 1,000 tech leaders, they are so complex that even their creators can’t comprehend, anticipate, or consistently regulate them. It sounds like a scene from one of those Sci-fi movies.
It’s clear that we need clear guidelines and policies for using AI ethically and safely. But what will that look like? And who’s responsible? Hopefully, we’ll figure it out before it’s too late.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Impact on Society
Enhancing Accessibility: How AI Empowers Individuals with Disabilities
There’s more to AI than self-driving cars. AI has emerged as a glimmer of hope for individuals with disabilities.
One such significant stride was the development of text-to-speech software. This kind of software, often touted as the best among AI applications, does much more than just transform written content into spoken words. Its impact on society and the potential for future growth is miraculous.
Picture a world where the visually impaired can experience books like those with sight do. Where language barriers dissolve, and educational content is accessible to all.
These are the possibilities brought to life by artificial intelligence. And it’s quickly becoming a staple tool for communication, education, and entertainment (on top of helping people with disabilities).
With AI, barriers are gradually diminishing, ushering in an era of increased inclusivity around every corner.
AI’s push for inclusivity in the workplace is reshaping HR management strategies. Modern HR teams harness AI tools, from accessibility software to real-time translations, to foster more inclusive environments.
In turn, these tools enrich company culture and expand talent pools, capturing a wealth of diverse skills and perspectives. That’s a huge win.
Educational Evolution: The Intersection of AI and Lifelong Learning
While AI gives quick answers, it doesn’t always prioritize effective methods that foster a genuine learning experience.
So, are our future generations at risk of losing out on a traditional education? Alarmingly, AI can deliver flawed content in‌ convincing ways, like by providing incorrect math solutions. And students take it at face value.
With that comes anxiety among students about their future. What will their jobs look like? Are they falling behind if they’re not keeping up with AI trends? It’s a melting pot of concerns.
But all experts agree: the evolving role of AI in education requires immediate attention to ensure its positive and ethical influence on the future of our society.
According to the Office of Educational Technology, they envision a technology-enhanced future in education that is “more like an electric bike and less like robot vacuums.”
The students are aware and fully in control, but their workload is less, and their effort is multiplied by technological advancements. But only time will tell how this plays out.
Finding the Perfect Balance Between AI and Human Intervention
AI’s potential is undeniable. But so is the unique value of human intuition and emotion. Striking the right balance will be essential for long-term adoption.
Automated systems may handle data crunching, but humans provide context, empathy, and judgment. The key? AI complements, rather than replaces, human capabilities.
Because when it comes to decisions, especially important ones like health, we still need that human touch.
Imagine using AI to help patients achieve their weight loss goals. AI tools can look at a patient’s health history, diet, genes, and activity to suggest the best treatment plan.
But here’s where doctors will continue to play a crucial role. When prescribing weight loss medication, they consider things the AI might miss, like a patient’s feelings or recent research.
A doctor can talk to the patient about how the medicine might make them feel, the benefits, and any risks. This human dialogue is important because it ensures the patient is entirely on board with (and understands) the treatment plan.
While AI offers precise, data-informed suggestions, the human touch grounds these decisions. Embracing AI’s speed and the depth of human understanding will be instrumental in shaping a future where technology enhances, not replaces, our inherent human strengths.
Wrapping Up
The future of artificial intelligence technology holds great promise for improving our lives, driving innovation, and solving complex business problems.
It’s an exciting time to be at the forefront of AI research and development as we shape a future where machines and humans work hand in hand to create a better world.

Marsh McLennan Develops New Generative AI Tool






November 21, 2023 10:56 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Marsh McLennan [NYSE:MMC] and its business Oliver Wyman, a global leader in management consulting, announced today the launch of a new Generative AI tool for colleagues. The tool, called LenAI, was developed by Marsh McLennan’s Dublin Innovation Center in collaboration with Oliver Wyman Digital and is available to Marsh McLennan’s more than 85,000 colleagues worldwide.


“We know AI has the potential to help our clients increase their productivity, transform complex and expensive processes, and do other things that were out of practical reach until now”Post this

“We have some of the brightest minds in business working across our four businesses and a collaborative culture,” said Paul Beswick, Senior Vice President and Global Chief Information Officer, Marsh McLennan. “When it came time to introduce the tool, we were able to deploy it quickly and securely. Since its full launch recently, LenAI has been a game changer for our teams, enabling them to work smarter for the benefit of our clients.”


“We know AI has the potential to help our clients increase their productivity, transform complex and expensive processes, and do other things that were out of practical reach until now,” added Vivek Sen, Partner, Head of Digital, Oliver Wyman, Americas. “We’ve always been at the forefront of helping our clients leverage the latest technologies even within highly regulated industries, and AI is no different.”


Key features of the tool include:



Built on technologies from Microsoft and OpenAI – Marsh McLennan and Oliver Wyman were able to work directly with Microsoft to deploy a private internally-hosted version of OpenAI’s foundational models, which keeps all the data in-house.




Designed with regulatory requirements in mind – The tool was developed in close partnership with Marsh McLennan’s privacy, compliance, risk management, information security, and legal teams to ensure it meets Marsh McLennan’s strict standards for data security and to address and mitigate the risks associated with this new technology, including the following:


Minimal data retention



Required training for users on appropriate usage and the risks posed by the use of AI



Managing what data the tool is allowed to access, in alignment with legal considerations



Assessing the tool against the growing body of frameworks and regulations that apply to the use of Generative AI






A growing range of capabilities – LenAI extends the capabilities of the underlying AI models by adding tools that provide more accurate and valuable outputs. These tools include the ability to search the internet, work on a wide range of documents, perform accurate calculations, access information from high quality publications, and more.




Enhanced productivity – These features allow colleagues to be more productive and have greater impact in their client work. Early adopters at Oliver Wyman self-reported saving an average of eight hours per week when using the tool. Additionally, they reported spending 20% less time on simple, repetitive tasks and reallocating that time toward more complex tasks.



LenAI is a just one example of how Marsh McLennan and Oliver Wyman are harnessing the immense power of AI to empower both colleagues and clients. With an extensive network of AI collaborators, Oliver Wyman has spearheaded numerous AI engagements, delivering exceptional value to clients across a wide range of industries. These engagements cover a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from leveraging AI to boost productivity and efficiency, to navigating the intricacies and risks associated with deploying AI solutions safely.


Moreover, Oliver Wyman has helped clients be at the forefront of enhancing the customer experience through cutting-edge AI technologies, while also providing invaluable support for partnership and acquisition decisions in this rapidly evolving field. Notably, Oliver Wyman has developed bespoke tools, including project management platforms, customer personalization engines, and social listening analytics suites, all designed and deployed to meet the highest enterprise safety standards. By embracing responsible AI practices, Oliver Wyman continues to drive innovation and deliver transformative results for its clients.


Marsh McLennan’s four businesses are working closely with clients on a myriad of challenges related to AI’s adoption. Its Marsh business is helping clients identify, mitigate, and transfer the risks of generative AI, while Mercer is consulting with clients on how to navigate the impact of generative AI in the world of work. Guy Carpenter works with insurers to help communities and businesses enjoy the benefits of AI while also managing the growing pains associated with these technologies.

What Is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning dealing with artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. It is a sort of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics how people acquire knowledge. Data science encompasses both statistics and predictive modeling, as well as deep learning. A  deep learning engineer is especially well served by deep learning since it speeds up and simplifies the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting massive amounts of data. In its simplest form, deep learning can be viewed as a method of automated predictive analytics. Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are layered with increasing complexity and abstraction.
Deep-learning computers evaluate data in a logical structure similar to how humans derive conclusions. It should be noted that this can occur through both supervised and unsupervised learning. Deep learning applications do this by employing a layered structure of algorithms known as an artificial neural network (ANN). The architecture of such an ANN is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain, resulting in a learning process that is significantly superior to that of ordinary machine learning models.
Who Is a Deep Learning Engineer?
A deep learning engineer's duty is to be an expert in the design and implementation of learning algorithms based on deep and complicated neural network topologies. Because the techniques utilized are more sophisticated theoretically, this is more technical work than that of a ""traditional"" machine learning engineer. In agriculture, for example, deep learning enables machines to recognize plants and apply the appropriate treatment, lowering pesticide usage and increasing output. Visual recognition is at the heart of the system. Convolutional neural networks (mostly geared to image recognition) and recurrent neural networks are examples of deep learning (efficient for time series problems).
Deep Learning algorithms must be used by a deep learning engineer to create and improve perception algorithms for autonomous cars. You will be responsible for the whole Deep Learning development life cycle, including data gathering, feature engineering, model training, and testing. One will be able to develop a cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithm and apply it to real-world end-to-end production.
What Does a Deep Learning Engineer Do?
An Artificial Intelligence project's concept and development include several life stages. Initially, a deep learning engineer is involved in the project's data engineering and modeling phase. He is also an important element of the project's deployment and infrastructure. Deep learning engineers do data engineering duties such as creating project data needs, and gathering, categorizing, examining, and cleaning data. They are also involved in modeling activities such as training deep learning models, developing evaluation measures, and searching for model hyperparameters. A deep learning engineer's work includes deployment duties such as turning prototyped code into production code and setting up a cloud infrastructure to deploy the production model.

Deep Learning Engineer vs. Machine Learning Engineer
It takes a lot of work to decide between becoming a deep learning engineer or a machine learning engineer. 
Both careers are in high demand and will be for many years.
But before you make your decision, consider these fundamental differences between these two roles:
Deep Learning Engineers are more concerned with a system's architecture than its function. Machine Learning Engineers tend to be more concerned with the process of a system than its architecture.
Deep Learning Engineers use deep neural networks and other techniques like reinforcement learning to train systems to learn particular tasks and perform them automatically. Machine Learning Engineers are more focused on building algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed by humans. Still, they don't necessarily use deep neural networks or reinforcement learning techniques as often as Deep Learning Engineers do.
Deep Learning Engineers tend to work closely with software developers, who write code for their systems' functionality and use deep neural networks as components within those programs (for example, using convolutional layers for image recognition). Machine Learning Engineers work closely with data scientists who use large amounts of data as inputs into their algorithms (for example, using logistic regression.
How to Become a Deep Learning Engineer?
You cannot become an experienced deep learning engineer overnight. You must begin your journey as a data scientist or ML engineer in order to garb this position. Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, and, of course, programming are the foundations for all of these employment categories. To flourish in your deep learning job, you must be well-versed in Machine Learning ideas, including both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The online courses will be of great use to you. It is critical to becoming acquainted with and hands-on with various ML/DL libraries and frameworks for model construction. Furthermore, because the majority of popular libraries and frameworks are Python-based, you must be fluent in the Python programming language.
Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you may begin using theoretical knowledge and working on tiny ML/DL projects. Kaggle is a great tool for finding interesting and hard topics. Work on ML models such as logistic regression, K-means clustering, support vector machines, and other sophisticated methods. Begin learning the other parts at the same time, like programming, data mining, predictive analysis, ML libraries/frameworks, and so on.
Skills Required for Becoming a Deep Learning Engineer
Deep learning engineers are responsible for developing and maintaining machine learning models. They typically work with a team of data scientists, software engineers, and other specialists to create new AI-powered systems that can perform tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.
Software Engineering
Algorithms (including knowing how to create algorithms that can sort, optimize, and search) are some of the most critical computer science principles for Deep Learning Engineers to comprehend, as are data structures and computer architecture. Because a DL Engineer's typical output is software, they should be familiar with software engineering best practices, particularly those concerning system design, version control, testing, and requirements analysis.
Data Skills
Many of the same skills as a Data Scientist are needed of a DL Engineer, such as data modeling, technical ability with programming languages such as Python and Java, and knowing how to assess prediction algorithms and models. A grasp of probability and statistics would also be beneficial.
Frontend/UI Technology
When you have your Machine Learning solution ready, you must offer it to others in the form of charts or visualizations, because the person to whom you are discussing may not be familiar with these methods and would prefer a functional solution to his problem. So knowing any UI technology like Django, Flask, and if necessary, JavaScript can help with this development process. Your Machine Learning code will be the backend, while you will design a frontend for it.
Cloud Technology
As technology advances, the quantity of data that can be managed on a local server grows exponentially, necessitating the use of cloud technologies. These systems provide excellent services ranging from data preparation to model creation.
Soft Skills
Despite the fact that machine learning is a technical job title, soft skills are nevertheless vital. Even if you are an expert in machine learning, you will still need to be skilled in communication, time management, and teamwork. A DL Engineer must also be devoted to lifelong learning. Because the disciplines of artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science are developing so quickly, any professional who wants to stay on the cutting edge must pursue continuous education.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office on Tuesday announced a new report outlining the potential benefits that generative AI could bring to state government — from improving accessibility of the state’s services to bolstering cybersecurity — along with an extensive description of the risks the technology could bring along for the ride.
The report is the first major product of an executive order Newsom issued in September that directed an expansive effort to explore how the emerging technology could be used inside the state government and to capture the economic benefit of a new technology that’s largely developed by California software companies. The 34-page document includes descriptions and examples of six potential ways California could use generative AI, but the bulk of the report is dedicated to exploring the many risks the technology presents — to privacy, security, the state’s workforce, operations, transparency, safety and government accountability.
The report cites ways that generative AI could amplify existing threats and create new ones. Among the manifold new risks outlined in the report are threats as alarming as generative AI’s potential ability to enable “bad actors to design, synthesize, or acquire dangerous chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons.”
Other threats listed include generative AI’s capacity to support mis- and disinformation campaigns, generate offensive material and to create “deepfakes,” materials that synthesize the likeness, speech or writing of individuals. Authors also pointed out that generative AI can “lower technical barriers” that once kept bad actors from effectively launching campaigns on social media to harm the public’s mental health or polarize politically.

Officials also cited concern with the intractable challenge of identifying how generative AI models reach their conclusions. Sourcing information, the report says, is expected to be a perennial challenge. 
Generative AI could also create new risks for California’s cybersecurity efforts, authors wrote. The report notes a handful of examples, including the potential for generative AI to be used to remotely execute harmful code, to modify access permissions, steal or delete data or to create content that emulates officials to aid in cyberattacks.
Generative AI ‘pioneers’
Risks notwithstanding, the report’s authors, a task force created by Newsom’s order that includes statewide Chief Information Officer Liana Bailey-Crimmins, strike a sanguine tone in the state’s press materials.
Bailey-Crimmins, who told StateScoop in an interview last month that the ultimate timeline for this work is on the order of years, not months, said in a press release accompanying the announcement that the state is excited to be “at the forefront” of government’s work in generative AI.

“With streamlined services and the ability to predict needs, the deployment of GenAI can make it easier for people to access government services they rely on, saving them time and money,” she said.
And Amy Tong, California’s government operations secretary, is quoted in the materials as saying that the state has an opportunity to “pioneer” new use cases.
“Through careful use and well-designed trials, we will learn how to deploy this technology effectively to make the work of government employees easier and improve services we provide to the people of California,” Tong said.
The report describes six major use cases that California state agencies stand to benefit from generative AI, including summarizing and classifying unwieldy collections of data, such as meeting notes and public outreach documentation; catering materials to the needs of California’s diverse population, such as by identifying demographic groups who currently struggle to access state services; and expanding the state’s use of foreign languages, such as by converting English educational materials into additional languages and formats, such as audiobooks, large print text and Braille documents.
The report names optimizing and converting old computer code into modern languages, or otherwise using it to streamline and “democratize” software development; finding insights that “empower and support” decision-makers, such as by spotting cybersecurity threats earlier; and optimizing the state’s operations in support of environmental considerations, such as by analyzing “traffic patterns, ride requests, and vehicle telemetry data to optimize routing and scheduling for state-managed transportation fleets like buses, waste collection trucks.”

Next steps
With the first step of Newsom’s generative AI order complete, officials are now tasked with developing new training materials for state employees, establishing new partnerships with regional institutions and designing new tools for testing generative AI products before they can be widely deployed. The order also requires an ongoing analysis of how AI is affecting the state.
The order requires the AI task force to develop a “procurement blueprint” that explicates how California can purchase such new software from private companies, while ensuring support of a “safe, ethical, and responsible innovation ecosystem inside state government.” This document is to be created with consideration of the federal government’s AI Bill of Rights and the National Institute for Science and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework.
The state also plans to create formal partnerships with the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University to better understand generative AI’s effects. The state plans next year to host a summit to discuss how generative AI is affecting the state and its workforce.

Like it or not, artificial intelligence has established itself as a fixture of the 21st century workplace. The state of California – home to many of the world’s top AI companies – is no exception. A new report from the Government Operations Agency examines the potential benefits and risks of the state using generative AI – a powerful tool that can create original content based on large inputs of data – in its daily operations. The report comes in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s September executive order that instructed state agencies to brainstorm and develop a plan for how to “ethically and responsibly” deploy AI technology in government operations.The report does not specifically address how or whether the introduction of generative AI would displace state employees in certain classifications. State employees are expected to follow common-sense safety and privacy practices, such as paraphrasing AI-generated content rather than using it verbatim and never sharing Californians’ resident data to free, publicly available tools such as ChatGPT or Google Bard. The report suggests that state departments could use generative AI tools in these beneficial ways:▪ Summarizing meetings▪ Analyzing public feedback surveys▪ Monitoring the status of public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges▪ Translating public documents into different languages▪ Generating promotional materials, such as fliers and social media postsHowever, the report also pointed out the numerous risks associated with using these tools for daily operations. Chief among those concerns was the reliability of the models and algorithms that power the AI tools. Erroneous information created by government AI tools could lead to the spread of harmful misinformation and disinformation, and as a result, Californians’ safety could be jeopardized.Fairness was also a concern, as unconscious biases like race and gender could infect the AI model and unfairly deem applicants ineligible for certain government programs. “This could reasonably erode Californians’ trust in their government and its services,” the report reads. “GenAI should center on the needs of the human workforce, support the carrying out of responsibilities to Californians, and avoid contributing to additional bureaucracy, process, or safety risks.”Want state worker news in your inbox?

HR TechnologyElevating HR with generative AI: A transformative journeyAI holds the potential to streamline operations, improve candidate interactions, and transform how employees engage with their work and the organisation. 







 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword in the world of technology for almost a year ever since Open AI, a US-based AI research and deployment company introduced Chat GPT, an AI tool for testing to the public. However, the technology behind it is not new, as the history and evolution of generative AI dates back to the late 1950s when researchers were focused on rule-based systems which could simulate human thinking. The 1990s saw an exponential shift in generative AI with the introduction of neural networks.

The last decade saw significant strides in generative AI, leveraging new ML algorithms to create varied content like text, sounds, images, and 3D models. Neural networks discern patterns in existing data, fueling potential for industry transformation, heightened productivity, and improved customer experiences.Also Read:
The evolving role of HR in the AI era

Although HR trailed in AI adoption, generative AI's ability to swiftly produce hyper-personalised content across an employee's journey stands to revolutionise talent decisions and amplify business impact. Here are specific applications across the employee lifecycle that harness data for impactful talent decisions.
Anticipating the talent
The success of any strategic workforce planning depends on accurate demand forecasting. However, forecasting demand is not limited to predicting the right numbers but also identifying the right skill/competency mix to ensure that it generates the results that are expected. There are AI-enabled tools that help sift through past data, analyse trends, and predict future needs based on past demand. However, generative AI facilitates continuous learning, adapting to changing market dynamics, customer preferences, and organisational limitations. These learnings are incorporated to ensure a proactive approach to workforce planning and development. 
Attracting the talent
Generative AI, a subset of deep learning, streamlines resume processing on ATS/job portals. By quickly parsing and scoring skills, it expedites candidate stack ranking, reducing recruiter effort. Moreover, it aids in identifying high-performing employees by creating customised skill match scores.
For prospective candidates, generative AI tools enhance the application experience, providing prompt application status, fitment scores, personalised feedback, and recommending suitable open positions. In screening calls, chatbots conduct personalised discussions with multiple candidates simultaneously, processing responses instantly to qualify candidates efficiently.
Generative AI extends support to interview panels with structured questionnaires, aiding in shortlisting the most suitable candidates. Post-selection, addressing the notice period challenge, a pre-onboarding engagement using voice bots ensures effective communication and engagement, handling various tasks from documentation to queries on policies and benefits. This technology offers a seamless transition from offer acceptance to the first day on the job.
Developing the talent
Performance management as a concept has evolved from just an achievement of goals to a measurement of the impact that it has created on the business. Hence the success of any developmental strategy would be to develop the potential of the employee which can directly relate to actions/output which will help achieve the business goals. The success of any type of performance management would depend on using generative AI tools/systems which will help in building their potential by way of identifying the competency gaps and creating a hyper-personalised learning solution which can be converted to a performance solution by way of integrating with the business strategy and dovetail into their individual development plan (IDP). 
Deploying the talent
Generative AI helps in analysing the project requirements and matching it with resource availability by evaluating the skill sets of the employees based on their qualifications, training, and applied experience. By a personalised evaluation of a member’s skills/competencies, they can align each employee to the appropriate projects. Generative AI-based tools can also help in resource allocation by considering workload, resource gaps, availability of resources and project timelines thereby reducing project risks, enhancing operational efficiency, and increasing productivity.
Engaging the talent
Engagement surveys are mostly a reactive strategy to effect changes in an organisation. Generative AI tools can help deal with this problem by using sentiment analysis by analysing employee interactions in different modes (e.g., emails, and chats). These tools can generate new text samples with sentiment characteristics like the training data. This is a major shift from the past where they classified texts rather than create new ones. These tools can help in monitoring employees’ behavioural patterns and engagement levels through data-backed insights in real time. This will help in identifying the red flags and proactively take remedial measures to create a conducive environment for engaging them.
Summing it up
The implementation of generative AI has the potential to revolutionise various segments of the HR function. However, we should also be cognizant of the potential risks that can accompany them with the likes of data bias, data security, privacy concerns, lack of monitoring & auditing, lack of a compliance & regulatory framework, and most importantly dealing with ethical issues. Organisations should create their own guidelines on the responsible and ethical use of generative AI till the time there are proper regulatory frameworks in place. 
The goal of AI is to create computers that can behave like humans and complete jobs faster than humans can do. As Stephen Hawking sums it up beautifully “We must develop as quickly as possible technologies that make possible a direct connection between brain and computer, so that artificial brains contribute to human intelligence rather than opposing it”. Generative AI will help us in achieving this goal and it is in our best interest as a function to adopt it at the earliest.

Generative AI may have quickly become a key part of the business lexicon over the last year, but for many business leaders, a key question remains: how can they use it to their organisation’s advantage? Getting a handle on new technology and finding the right talent to utilise it is a predicament many organisations continue to encounter in today’s rapidly evolving digital age. 
“Five years ago, bringing in technical talent to historically non-technical parts of the organisation, such as HR or marketing, wasn’t even part of the conversation,” says Maureen Lonergan, vice president of AWS Training and Certification. “The pandemic accelerated digitisation across industries, with cloud powering more and more areas of the business. The roles of the chief human resources officer (CHRO) and learning and development leaders have become increasingly challenging as a result. There simply isn’t enough skilled technical talent available right now. The biggest challenge we hear is: ‘How do I recruit and retain talent?’”
Beyond recruitment
“The reality is you won’t be able to recruit your way through this current skills gap,” says Lonergan. HR and talent leaders must therefore prioritise learning and development for in-house talent if they are to succeed. This is especially true as technology becomes more complex and use cases become more specific to individual businesses. While basic tech skills or an understanding of specific software are often only a minimum requirement for many job roles, organisations must reconcile with the fact that employees need upskilling to make effective use of layered and unique technology stacks that are quickly growing in complexity. 
The reality is you won’t be able to recruit your way through this current skills gap
Digital upskilling is no longer about technical staff gatekeeping all of the knowledge around technology within the organisation. Everyone from the CEO down to the sales team needs to have a strong foundation of digital skills and an understanding of how technology fits into their role. The most innovative organisations will recognise this and ensure they bring their people on the journey with them whenever they go through any kind of digital transformation. “Investing in the skills of your people will always be the most strategic and valuable business lever you have,” says Lonergan.
Generative AI upskilling for everyone 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the emerging area of generative AI, which is further democratising a technology that was once reserved for specialists. 
Business leaders need to stay on top of developments and understand how generative AI can benefit their organisation if they are to remain competitive. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, more than 75% of organisations plan to adopt technologies such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence over the next five years. “Generative AI is not only here to stay, but it is the fastest evolving technology I have ever seen. Organisations and individuals must take steps now to hone their knowledge in this area,” says Lonergan. 





The accessibility of generative AI is both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, its abilities and easy access have the potential to enhance productivity and innovation at all levels. On the other hand, this means that it can be tricky to control the use of the technology. Both technical and non-technical leaders need to quickly build an understanding of how generative AI could and should be used within the organisation, putting the right guidelines and guardrails in place to avoid any mishaps. For example, a lack of understanding of the hallucinations and biases that AI-powered technology can produce may lead to employees trusting false information or staff could be inputting sensitive data into public platforms without realising the risk.
While the learning curve might not be steep for every role, business leaders need to take a swift and proactive approach to training if they hope to keep pace with the march of both technology and their competitors. Short courses and training programmes can go a long way in helping organisations prepare their staff for the future. For example, AWS Training and Certification offers simple, accessible training courses in generative AI and cloud for both technical and non-technical leadership roles, many of which are free.
Technical training 
It’s also vital that organisations consider generative AI-adjacent skills. For example, cloud skills and data skills will be crucial to providing the foundations for the technology. And while there is a level of upskilling that needs to happen across all roles in the business, naturally a more complex technology stack is going to require more specific technical expertise too. Integrating AI and machine learning workloads, for example, necessitates a skilled and diverse team of professionals. 
As well as offering accessible courses for non-technical professionals, AWS offers training for technical roles and provides access to generative AI services. These services can be tailored to an organisation’s business needs and talent, making this emerging technology available to customers of any size and developers of all skill levels. For example, businesses can choose options ranging from services with built-in generative AI that don’t require specific expertise right up to building their own foundation models. Of course, to make such decisions, leadership needs to have a basic understanding of the skill levels within their organisations and what business use cases they want to use the technology for. Completing their own basic training in the technology can help here.
Building a case for training investment
“HR leaders have made it a goal, if not their top goal, to align learning programmes to the business strategies of the organisation,” says Lonergan. 
Putting together a case for training is therefore about ROI. What will the business gain from upskilling staff in emerging technologies across the board? “Organisations and individuals who invest in skills training are better equipped to keep pace with innovation, and this may be even more true with generative AI,” explains Lonergan. 




Leaders who invest in training talent are likely to see a huge payoff in productivity, helping increase business efficiency and innovation opportunities. According to recent research from Access Partnership, employers believe that AI could boost productivity by 47%, with large organisations expecting a 49% boost. Meanwhile, employees expect AI to boost their productivity too, with 41% saying that it could help them complete tasks more efficiently. 
To confidently lead their companies into the future, executives need to brush up their own skills and invest in optimising the skills of their workforce. AWS offers more than 100 courses and learning resources on AI and machine learning through AWS Skill Builder and AWS Educate. Business resilience starts with people and now is the perfect time for organisations to start taking learning seriously.

AI has long been used in the legal profession, despite this being a sector that traditionally resists digitalization and change.
However, the advent of generative AI is now taking this technology to a new level. For the first time, we have a tool that generates content and language on its own and can perform sophisticated writing and research tasks in a way that previously required highly skilled people. The implications for the sector could be massive.Related Company ProfilesAllen & Overy LLPView all
AI-based applications are fairly established in the legal profession
AI is widely used within the legal profession to automate repetitive and manual processes. Some applications of AI include reviewing contracts more quickly and consistently to spot errors, assisting with legal research to find key information—for example, legal precedents—or using chatbots to answer legal questions from clients wherever this is possible.
Efficiency and accuracy improvements are the main benefits: for instance, one of the most time-consuming tasks is litigation, which involves extracting the meaning and most relevant information from an enormous set of documents produced during discovery. This can be vastly accelerated, with AI doing work in seconds that might otherwise take weeks.
Now generative AI is poised to radically transform legal work
Generative AI can perform several tasks performed by lawyers. When it comes to creating a contract for the sale of a piece of property, lawyers could simply provide generative AI with the names of the buyer and seller, the price of the property, and any special provisions. Generative AI can also provide lawyers with a natural language interface for their existing legal workflows to answer specific questions, such as whether a clause in a lease violates any laws in a specific jurisdiction and rewrite it so it is no longer in violation.
Generative AI brings data analytics to a new level, allowing users to interact with data through text-based questions—for example, to understand a company’s financial and operational data as part of the due diligence on the company.

Generative AI promises to transform old concepts in legal practice such as the traditional billable hour. If lawyers can perform high-quality work faster, they can spend more time on the high-value parts of their job, like focusing and engaging with clients.
Some law firms are embracing AI but there is caution
Some early adopters of generative AI among law firms include Allen & Overy, which has been one of the first to introduce the Harvey AI chatbot for use in active cases, and DLA Piper, which uses the GPT-4-powered legal assistant CoCounsel.
However, a 2023 Survey sponsored by the Thomas Reuters Institute suggests that there is a degree of caution among law firms in adopting generative AI: only 51% believed that it should be used in legal work, while 62% of respondents—which included 80% of partners and managing partners—had concerns of using ChatGPT and generative AI at work. The difference suggests that legal professionals see the potential of using generative AI but are unsure if they can trust the tools, which is a concern shared by businesses across different industries.
The cautious attitude is more than justified, as several risks come with the technology that can be especially damaging when used in legal settings, such as hallucinations, inaccuracies, and bias creeping into the model.
Training and new skills will be needed, including how to choose the right AI tool for a particular task, how to construct the right queries, and how to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the responses. Ultimately, AI cannot fully weigh the factors that go into the many strategic decisions and it cannot replace the human element of relationships with clients.

Organizations large and small are focusing on how to integrate some level of Generative AI into their work. This has triggered a wide range of reactions. Some (including high-profile insiders) warn of potential doom. Others worry about more-basic matters: their jobs.


All of the above is reflected in the results of a new global survey conducted by a Boston Consulting Group team from October 6-30. The survey team (Katherine Rivet, Gabrielle Novacek, Jean Lee, Gretchen May, Hillary Wool and Christopher Gentile) asked more than 11,000 employees from the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, and India—ranging from executives and senior managers to clerical workers—how they feel about the use of Generative AI at work. Some very interesting findings emerged:

1. Those who use artificial intelligence and/or Generative AI technology at work trust it far more than those who don’t. 

Among the non-management respondents who do not yet use Generative AI at work, only 12% agreed with the statement, “I trust AI/Generative AI.” Among non-management users of AI/Generative AI the percentage expressing trust in the technology was three times higher (37%).

PROMOTED
For senior managers and executives, the ratios were similar, with 21% of the senior managers and 22% of executives who don’t use AI/GenAI technology expressing trust and 64% and 71%, respectively, of AI/GenAI users expressing trust—meaning that more-senior organizational leaders, AI users and non-users alike, are far-more trusting of the technology than lower-level employees.
One might infer from this that the best way to manage the integration of AI and Generative AI into an organization is, simply, to get more people to use it. Cue up the AI/GenAI tutorials, upskilling clinics and academies, right?

Well ... not so fast. Familiarity, in this case, breeds anxiety.
2.  A significant percentage of employees see AI and Generative AI technology as a threat to their jobs, with the highest percentages among those who already use the technology.

Among non-management respondents who don’t currently use AI at work, 37% agreed with the statement, “I worry about AI tools being used to automate much of what I do.” Among those who do use AI, the number was slightly higher, 41%.

The anxiety levels were lower among senior managers and executives who don’t use AI technology (32% in both categories), but significantly higher among AI users—with 51% of senior managers and 54% of executives expressing worry that AI could replace them. That means executives who have used AI are nearly 70% more fearful of being replaced by technology than their peers who haven’t personally witnessed what GenAI can do.
So, here’s the paradox: The more that employees use Generative AI the more they both trust it and fear it—with the trust and fear most pronounced among senior employees.
For employees, perception is reality, so the findings drive home why it’s critical for leaders to think carefully about employees’ concerns about AI and GenAI impacting their jobs and careers. In fact, employers need to do more than think: They need to internalize the potential threat and communicate a clear and unambiguous response.
Here are a few thoughts on how to help your colleagues and employees see the plus side of AI:
Explain how AI and Generative AI can help reduce the joyless tasks that people hate. This will give them more time to spend on the collaborative, innovative and enjoyable parts of work. GenAI can speed up, streamline and help reduce the tedium of many boring, repetitive, mindless, but necessary tasks. Use it. Another recent survey, by the BCG Henderson Institute, showed that office workers spend an average of 25% of their time on administrative drudge work. That is more than a full day every week on soul-sucking administrivia. Now, that is something to GenAI-ify!
Explain how Generative AI can become your silent “partner,” helping you perform better and advance faster. Francois Candelon, the Paris-based global director of the Henderson Institute, found in a recent study that Generative AI enabled below-average employees to boost their performance level— especially on creative blue-sky tasks. So, encourage employees to embrace AI and GenAI and use it as a lever for future success.
Offer employees a deal they can’t refuse: Help us use GenAI to rethink our organization and your job and, together, we’ll create an even better job for you. Every organization’s top talent knows that new and different roles will be required if the organization hopes to thrive in a future heavily influenced, if not driven, by AI and GenAI. So, be deliberate in your intent and engage with them on figuring out the best path forward.
The key take-away is this: Before you charge ahead with introducing Generative AI into your work processes, think carefully about how people will view the new technology and the impact it could have on their careers and livelihoods. Prepare them for the career implications, the reskilling requirements, the talent flexibility and, better yet, get them directly involved, working with peers to drive the change for themselves.
Doing so will help you and your talent move from distrust to fearless GenAI enthusiasts.

Adobe Stock27 November 2023By: Natalia González Alarcón and Ángel Melguizo.The webinar aimed to focus on skills for the future of work, identifying the urgent need for upskilling and reskilling in a global labor market driven by Generative AI.The discussion featured insights from three private sector experts: Jorge Cella, Director of Microsoft Philanthropies for the Americas region, Natalia Mata, Global Head of the IA&Data Academy at Telefónica Tech, and Mojca Cargo, AI4I (AI for Impact) Director at the GSMA. Additionally, Ángel Melguizo, UNESCO's advisor for AI and ethics and business council coordinator, contributed closing remarks.This post aims to summarize the key points and insights from these industry leaders. Thumbnail         play_arrow UNESCO MontevideoJorge Cella from Microsoft highlighted the evolution and the democratization of AI technology, emphasizing the increased accessibility of computational power and AI tools, contrasting it with the past exclusivity of supercomputers. He underscored the importance of critical thinking in effectively utilizing generative AI, noting that although AI provides statistically probable answers, its effectiveness hinges on the user's ability to ask the right questions and interpret results. Cella also reassured that AI, especially generative AI, would augment rather than replace human roles, enhancing productivity across various professions. Cella illustrated how AI could augment professions like teaching and software development, enhancing productivity and effectiveness – according to some analysis, generative AI can potentially augment teachers’ skills and productivity by 45%. How? By supporting the preparation of lesson planning, curriculum development, and literacy tutorials, for example. By using Co-pilot, for a junior developer, this technology may increase productivity by 20-30%, and for a senior developer, it can actually improve it by 50 - 60%. However, they would still need to know how to code to use it properly. In summary. AI can and is going to help us, but workers have to be prepared. Natalia Mata from Telefónica emphasized the need for upskilling and reskilling in organizations during the AI transformation. She identified adaptability, ethics, and a culture of lifelong learning as the critical values in this shift. Mata described Telefónica’s initiatives to promote the adaptation for the future of work, which include employee training and societal actions focused on the common good and employability. She emphasized Telefónica Foundation's employment map, which analyzes job offers in real-time to identify the most in-demand professions and digital skills across different countries. Complementing this map, a virtual assistant offers personalized guidance to users. In summary, Natalia highlighted that the key message is that Telefónica, through insights gained from its internal projects, is actively providing both its clients and the broader public with effective solutions for embracing AI. By doing so, Telefonica is fostering the development of new skills within and beyond the company, essential for navigating the dynamic era of AI we are currently experiencing. Mojca Cargo from GSMA mentioned the role of GSMA in representing the interest of mobile operators globally and beginning together all of the operators regardless of emerging or developing countries. She highlighted that GSMA founded AI for Impact in 2017 in order to bring together Partners from both the private and public sectors, to commercially scale responsible AI for a better future. GSMA's efforts are to build frameworks for responsible AI and facilitate AI use cases in collaboration with a global task force. Cargo highlighted GSMA's commitment to capacity building, offering extensive training courses to policymakers and regulators, underscoring the significance of reskilling and upskilling in adapting to AI-driven changes in the workplace. GSMA has successfully conducted over 13,000 training days, benefiting more than 100 participants from over 160 countries, achieving a satisfaction rate of over 90%. These courses focus on real-world examples to help understand the impact of various policies and regulatory approaches on the implementation of emerging technologies.Discussion on Upskilling and ReskillingThe panelists discussed best practices for creating inclusive programs for upskilling and reskilling and the responsibility of various stakeholders in their implementation. GSMA's Approach: Through the “Mobile for Development” team, GSMA works with developing countries to reduce inequalities by driving innovation in digital technology. They emphasized working with small and medium-sized enterprises and supporting entrepreneurs by connecting them with big techs. They work in different components, everything from capacity-building workshops, training, and innovation funds, among others, to support the ""last mile."" Telefónica's Strategy: Telefónica highlighted the importance of assessing skills gaps for each community and employee to prepare training programs according to the real demands and needs. She also mentioned that is critical to take into account accessibility, diversity, and inclusion aspects in training programs to consider the unrepresented groups. Microsoft's Initiative: Microsoft Philanthropies targets vulnerable populations, aiming to transform people’s potential into productivity with technology, democratizing access to generative AI. The webinar underscored the transformative impact of generative AI on the workforce, highlighting the need for upskilling and reskilling. The insights from Microsoft, Telefónica, and GSMA, combined with UNESCO's vision, emphasize the importance of adaptability, ethical considerations, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. The discussions underscored that while AI is set to revolutionize the job market, it is not a replacement for human skills but a tool to augment them. The key takeaway is the collective responsibility of governments, private sectors, academia, and individuals to embrace this change is needed to ensure that AI serves as a tool for enhancement rather than displacement, fostering a future where technology and human capabilities coexist to create a more dynamic and inclusive workforce.Share                             Copied to clipboard Related itemsArtificial intelligenceSharing knowledgeUN ＆ International cooperationBusiness economicsBusiness managementWork environmentWorkersWorking conditionsWorking lifeEthicsEthics of artificial intelligenceEthics of technologyTopics: AI Business CouncilRegion: Latin America and the CaribbeanUNESCO Office in Montevideo and Regional Bureau for ScienceSee moreaddMore on this subject   Event Sixth International Conference on Learning Cities3 December 2024 - 5 December 2024     Event Global Network of Learning Cities webinar ‘Shifting paradigms: fostering sustainable lifestyles and rethinking our relationship with nature’20 November 2024     Event 3rd Youth Forum of the IberoMAB Network2 November 2024 - 7 November 2024     Event Global Media and Information Literacy Week Feature Conference 202430 October 2024 - 31 October 2024  Other recent news   News Stakeholders convene for a high-level meeting on the Impacts of Uranium Mining in the Stampriet Transboundary Aquifer System23 July 2024     News UNESCO supports Rwanda Development Board on digital transformation19 July 2024     News UNESCO Dakar supports The Gambia’s National Human Rights Commission to Conduct Premier Nation-wide Research on Hate Speech18 July 2024     News UNESCO to host multilateral science forum in Yaounde for presentations of research works in tropical skin sciences18 July 2024   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Skills for a Generative AI Future of Work: Insights and Strategies', 'description': ""The fourth webinar, organized by UNESCO's Business Council on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics, was held on September 25, 2023."", 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'True', 'url': 'https://articles.unesco.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/Industry%20engineer%20in%20factory%2Cusing%20smart%20tablet%20artificial%20intelligence%20AdobeStock%20WEB.jpg', 'width': '2000', 'height': '1143'}, 'datePublished': '2023-11-27T16:57:19+0100', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True', 'dateModified': '2023-11-27T16:57:19+0100', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/skills-generative-ai-future-work-insights-and-strategies'}, {'@type': 'Event', 'eventAttendanceMode': 'MixedEventAttendanceMode', 'description': ""The fourth webinar, organized by UNESCO's Business Council on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics, was held on September 25, 2023."", 'location': {'@type': 'Place', 'address': {'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': ''}}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers in London and the South East are the most likely to have their jobs threatened by AI, according to a new report from the Department for Education.The research, published on 28 November 2023, found that  between 10% and 30% of jobs can be automated by the use of AI, with the insurance and finance sectors likely to be hardest hit. Other sectors likely to be strongly affected include information and communication; professional, scientific and technical; property; public administration and defence; and education.""Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles,"" reads the report. ""This includes management consultants and business analysts; accountants; and psychologists."" LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProIn general, it's the workers with the highest levels of achievement whose jobs are most vulnerable: Those with a degree are likely to be more affected than those who just have A levels.People in building and construction, manufacturing technologies, and transportation operations and maintenance are the least exposed, thanks to doing manual work that is technically difficult, in unpredictable environments, and with lower wages, reducing the incentive to automate.Meanwhile, the professional occupations least exposed to AI are veterinarians, medical radiographers, dental practitioners, physiotherapists and senior police officers, says the report. Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Meanwhile, workers in the North East tend to be in jobs with the least exposure.RELATED RESOURCE(Image credit: Zscaler )Protect your IoT and OT devices from malware threats

Each geographical area covers a large population and a lot of overlap in the types of jobs, so we would expect to see more variation in exposure to AI when looking at smaller areas where the job markets will differ more.""The report supports previous research indicating a sea-change is coming, with a recent Goldman Sachs report indicating that as many as 18% of jobs could be affected by AI and that workers in advanced economies would fare the worst. Up to 300 million jobs could be lost worldwide, it says.Already, companies including BT and IBM have announced that they expect to make wide-ranging layoffs, with thousands of jobs to be replaced by AI. It's not all bad news, however, with the Department for Education research indicating that new jobs could start to appear as others decline. ""A consensus has begun to emerge that 10-30% of jobs in the UK are highly automatable and could be subject to some level of automation over the next two decades,"" reads the report. ""However, the overall net effect on employment is unclear, but it is often assumed that there will be a broadly neutral long-term effect and job displacement will be matched by job creation.""

AI and data science are two very popular buzz words in IT, and for good reason. They’re two sets of technologies that often work hand in hand to boost business insights and productivity. But they have their differences in use cases. Data science is a field of study that examines large data sets with various analytics methods -- including machine learning and pattern discovery -- to extract valuable business insights, while AI refers to a computer’s ability to understand, learn from, and make decisions based on data like humans.

Large language models (LLMs) seem set to transform businesses. Their ability to generate detailed, creative responses to queries in plain language and code has sparked a wave of excitement that led ChatGPT to reach 100 million users faster than any other technology after it first launched. Subsequently, investors poured over $40 billion into artificial intelligence startups in the first half of 2023 — more than 20% of all global venture capital investments — and companies from seed-stage startups to tech giants are developing new applications of the technology.
But while LLMs are incredibly powerful, their ability to generate humanlike text can invite us to falsely credit them with other human capabilities, leading to misapplications of the technology. With a deeper understanding of how LLMs work and their fundamental limitations, managers can make more informed decisions about how LLMs are used in their organizations, addressing their shortcomings with a mix of complementary technologies and human governance.

The Mechanics of LLMs
An LLM is fundamentally a machine learning model designed to predict the next element in a sequence of words. Earlier, more rudimentary language models operated sequentially, drawing from a probability distribution of words within their training data to predict the next word in a sequence. (Think of your smartphone keyboard suggesting the next word in a text message.) However, these models lack the ability to consider the larger context in which a word appears and its multiple meanings and associations.
The advent of the latest neural network architecture — transformers — marked a significant evolution toward modern LLMs. Transformers allow neural networks to process large chunks of text simultaneously in order to establish stronger relationships between words and the context in which they appear. Training these transformers on increasingly enormous volumes of text has led to a leap in sophistication that enables LLMs to generate humanlike responses to prompts.
This ability of LLMs hinges on several critical factors, including the model’s size, denoted by the number of the trainable weights (known as parameters), the quality and volume of the training data (defined by number of tokens, referring to word or subword units), and the maximum size of input the model can accept as a prompt (known as its context window size). Every parameter in a model encapsulates some information about a relationship extrapolated from the training data, so a model with a larger number of parameters tends to be more knowledgeable and nuanced. (OpenAI’s GPT-3, for example, has 175 billion parameters.) The volume of the training data also significantly influences the model’s ability to generalize, with larger data sets offering more diverse representations of semantic relationships and facts. (GPT-3 was trained on approximately half a trillion tokens.) The size of the prompt that the model can accept also plays a role in its accuracy. (GPT-3 has a context window of 2,000 tokens.) The more detailed the context, the more accurate the model’s prediction is.
In response to a prompt, the LLM draws on the relationships established by its training to generate a continuation of the text, token by token. Each step entails forecasting the probabilities of the next token based on the context provided, and the algorithm selects the token based on these probabilities. The degree of randomness in this selection is modulated by the model’s temperature setting. Higher temperatures produce more “creative,” or unlikely, selections, whereas lower temperatures produce more predictable responses. To improve the accuracy of an LLM’s responses to specific prompts and limit its ability to produce inappropriate, irrelevant, or toxic responses, pretrained models can be fine-tuned through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF, which has been employed to fine-tune models like ChatGPT.
Four Important Limitations of LLMs
Based on this understanding of how LLMs work, we can examine the false impressions they might create as we apply our human intuition to seemingly human output.
1. Limitations of Reasoning
Prompt: According to the cabbage-growers’ union report for 2007, 80% of cabbages collected were heavy (over 0.5 kg), 10% of cabbages were green, 60% were red, and 50% were big (having a diameter of over 10 cm). Which of the following statements must be false?

All red cabbages weren’t big.
30% of red cabbages were big.
There were no cabbages that were both green and big.
Half of the cabbages were small.

LLM response: The statement that must be false is 4. Half of the cabbages were small.
The correct answer would be that Statement 1 is false — at least some red cabbages must have been big.
Contrary to the impression they might create, LLMs are not built for complex reasoning. For example, studies have found that GPT-4, OpenAI’s most advanced LLM, could correctly verify a number as prime in only 2.4% of cases, with similar weaknesses in the prediction of visual patterns. Other research has shown that LLMs fail to understand relationships between words in the training data set: For example, GPT-4 can correctly answer the question “Who is Tom Cruise’s mother?” (Mary Lee Pfeiffer) but cannot infer the answer to “Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son?” — with the model correctly answering questions like the former 79% of the time, compared with 33% for the latter.
Essentially, LLMs learn only to verbally simulate elementary logical rules but do not possess the skills to chain them together for producing and verifying complex conclusions. Moreover, LLMs are prone to error accumulation in multistep logical reasoning because the model’s fundamentally probabilistic nature means that every step has a nonzero chance of an error. Finally, LLMs cannot always outline the “chain of thought” that led to a conclusion, making it difficult for humans to determine whether or where an error occurred.

A recent field experiment conducted with more than 750 Boston Consulting Group consultants highlighted the real-life implications of this limitation. Participants using GPT-4 when trying to solve a simple business problem got the answer wrong 23% more often than the control group that did not have access to an LLM — because GPT-4 not only often got the answer wrong but provided such a persuasive rationale for its solution that users accepted it at face value.









2. Limitations of Knowledge or Expertise
We asked an LLM to provide us with five papers in peer-reviewed academic journals on the feasibility of nuclear fusion, with paper titles, the year of publication, and the names of the main authors. The LLM returned five results, of which two were news articles, not peer-reviewed papers, and one was a paper that does not exist.
The knowledge of an LLM is dictated by its training data. If the data lacks specific domain knowledge, has insufficient instances of a particular concept, or is not up to date, the LLM might fail to surface relevant knowledge in response to a prompt. Similarly, LLMs might reproduce errors present in the training data. Finally, the models could create errors by “hallucinating” statements that were not in the training data. Researchers who tasked ChatGPT with generating treatment plans for a variety of cancer cases found that one-third of the LLMs’ responses contained incorrect information — often mixed with correct indications, and plausibly articulated in a way that made it difficult for a layperson to identify what was accurate. In another high-profile example, two lawyers and their firm were fined after submitting fake citations generated by ChatGPT in a court filing: The LLM had hallucinated six legal cases, including judicial opinions and quotes.
Finally, limitations of knowledge can also lead to a lack of consistency, with LLMs responding to the same prompt asked at different points in time in contradictory manners. For example, Iowa educators used ChatGPT to determine the appropriateness of books for their school’s library to comply with a new state law. They fed the LLM a list of all of the library books and asked it to point out those that contained content that violated the law, which resulted in the removal of 19 titles from the library. However, when journalists later queried ChatGPT on those 19 titles, it suggested that only four of them contained content inconsistent with the law.
3. Limitations of Understanding
Prompt: There is an apple inside a blue box. There is also a red box inside the blue box. The red box has a lid on it. How can I get the apple?
LLM response: To retrieve the apple from the boxes, you can follow these steps:

Open the lid of the red box: Since the red box is inside the blue box and has a lid on it, you need to open the lid of the red box first.
Remove the red box from the blue box: Once the lid of the red box is open, you can take out the entire red box from the blue box.
Open the red box: After removing the red box from the blue box, you can open the red box to access its contents.
Retrieve the apple: Finally, you can reach inside the red box and take out the apple.

ChatGPT failed to understand that the apple is not inside the red box.
An LLM might not “understand” the prompt it is given. Lacking adequate context, it might falter, and its outputs might become disjointed or incoherent. Researchers analyzed ChatGPT’s responses to more than 500 human-submitted questions on the online software engineering forum Stack Overflow. They found that 52% of the model’s responses were inaccurate, with more than half of those errors resulting from ChatGPT not understanding the concept or the details of the question, or focusing on the wrong part of the problem. This means that an LLM might not even be marginally helpful when users lack sufficient knowledge of a problem to supply good prompts.
4. Limitations of Planning and Execution
LLMs can output clear step-by-step guidance for a requested task, creating the impression that the model can plan practical solutions. But given LLMs’ limited reasoning ability and limited understanding of tasks, suggested actions can be impractical or naive. For example, when asked to create a plan for saving toward home ownership, ChatGPT provided some generally solid financial advice but did not account for potential changes in income or interest-rate shifts. Moreover, it does not consider human fallibility: It neither questions the realism of goals nor the user’s belief to be aware of their exact spending habits.
For businesses, all of these limitations can undermine reliability; one cannot be sure that information provided by an LLM is complete, relevant, feasible, or true. Given these limitations, LLMs certainly cannot be counted on to make critical decisions or execute plans autonomously. However, delegating mundane tasks might still seem appealing — for example, those involving programmatic interactions with existing IT services, like web browsing and scraping, or social media monitoring and messaging. Indeed, Auto-GPT — an open-source application powered by GPT-4 that chains together LLM outputs to autonomously execute user-set goals — has allowed enthusiasts to create a number of impressive automation demonstrations, including conducting research on products, coding web pages or apps, and even ordering pizza. However, AI researcher Jim Fan suggested that the working demos are “heavily cherry-picked” — with research on autonomous agents indicating that, in realistic environments, they achieve success rates of only around 10%.
Overcoming the Limitations
Rather than simply restricting applications of LLMs to routine cases where their limitations do not apply or mistakes are not critical (such as generating new product ideas for further consideration), businesses should design all of their implementations with the limitations in mind — by complementing them with human oversight and other technologies.
Keeping humans in the loop is critical as businesses integrate LLMs into their operations. This should include validation of AI-generated outputs in order to enhance the confidence placed in the technology. It could also be extended to having experts translate business problems into prompts for the AI, and ensuring that the information provided by the model is adequate by appropriately tailoring the context and nuance fed to it.
Beyond thinking about how to craft the optimal system of humans and AI, businesses should also explore complementary technologies that can address the limitations of LLMs. In this fast-moving space, new innovations are being made constantly that promise to enhance the technology’s capabilities, so continuously updating your understanding is also crucial.
For example, to enhance reasoning capabilities, researchers are exploring augmenting LLMs with reasoning engines that encode domain-specific information into knowledge graphs representing relations between specialized concepts and facts. Researchers are also training specialized models to assess the logical coherence between premises in the prompt and the LLM’s output. To augment knowledge and expertise, LLMs are being trained on domain-specific databases — such as Google and DeepMind’s Med-PaLM model, which has been shown to significantly outperform general-purpose LLMs on the United States Medical Licensing exam. LLM reliability might also be improved through reinforcement learning with feedback collected from human experts. LLMs can also improve their understanding of a user’s initial prompts by being programmed to ask clarifying follow-up questions before providing an answer.

The promise of LLMs’ near-universal applicability means that businesses are right to be excited about exploring this powerful new technology. However, these models’ uncanny ability to generate humanlike text outputs can easily lead us to ascribe to them capabilities that they do not possess. A proper understanding of their limitations should guide the manner and context in which they are implemented.
Businesses should be particularly wary in areas where logical reasoning is involved, facts are important, replicability is crucial, or the stakes are high. In these situations, companies need to explore using complementary technologies that address the limitations of LLMs — such as knowledge graphs, reasoning engines, and specialized domain models — and ensure that there is appropriate human input and oversight.

Securing workers' rights in the AI revolution
 The second edition of the flagship European Employment & Social Rights Forum took place on 16-17 November, in Brussels and online. The event brought together over 2200 participants and a diverse panel of 74 speakers to discuss the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the world of work. 



The 2023 European Employment and Social Rights Forum aimed to explore how the potential of AI can be harnessed to deliver a world in which nobody is left behind, and where technological advancements do not compromise workers’ rights.
The Forum discussed the role of new legislation such as the proposed Directive on platform work and the AI Act in driving innovation while protecting workers from any negative aspects of technology.
Over 70 speakers brought their insights to the Forum, including EU and national policymakers, business leaders, social partners, civil society, and academia.
Some of the highlights included interventions by:

Christopher Pissarides, Professor of economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, co-founder and co-chair of the Institute for the Future of Work, and winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economics
Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley
Nicolas Schmit, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights
Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market
Dragoș Pîslaru, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at the European Parliament

The role of legislation in protecting European values
Workers must profit from breakthroughs such as ChatGPT, said Nicolas Schmit, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights. An important challenge for policymakers is therefore to “establish a system where the benefits of AI are distributed fairly”.
“Setting clear rules doesn’t slow down innovation. On the contrary, it provides guidelines for investment”, underlined Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market. “Our goal is to ensure that our values are preserved and included in this AI revolution.” 
Ensuring strong social protection for workers
Speakers agreed that it is important not to fight technological advances, but to set clear rules and help workers adapt to change.
Nobel laureate in Economics Professor Christopher Pissarides argued that countries with strong social support for workers “can use AI beneficially to create good jobs and better lives”.  Countries such as “the US and China are way ahead in terms of preparedness for AI, but they dismally fail on social support. So, I would not say they create good jobs.”
“AI means changes, but not necessarily bad changes,” said Joost Korte, Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion at the European Commission. The crucial need is to “prevent abusive practices” and ensure that “the human remains in control”.
Shaping progressive strategies and policies
In her closing remarks, Andriana Sukova, Deputy Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion at the European Commission, offered reassurance that AI will change jobs, not eliminate them.
“We must keep people at the heart of AI, backed by strong social support systems. I am optimistic about the transformative power of AI if used responsibly. This Forum’s insights and proposed solutions will help shape progressive strategies and policies.”

Great power competition: who is winning the generative AI race?
Artificial Intelligence in general, and Generative AI in particular, have generated a major public discussion over the future of global competition and international leadership in the key geopolitical vector that technology represents. The competition has become a two-fold race: the race over the development of AI, and the race over the adoption thereof.
While competition is a relevant element, it does not exclude countries from cooperation. The United States and China had the greatest number of cross-country collaborations in AI publications from 2010 to 2021, although the pace of collaboration has slowed. The number of AI research collaborations between the United States and China increased roughly 4 times since 2010, and was 2.5 times greater than the collaboration totals of the next nearest country pair, the United Kingdom and China. However, the total number of US-China collaborations only increased by 2.1% from 2020 to 2021, the smallest year-over-year growth rate since 2010. Both competition and cooperation have increased in recent years, and refer to three levels: governments, private sector, and academia.
There is no segregated information on the governmental budget devoted to Generative AI with regards to AI in general. However, available data shows that the US federal government is devoting most share of funding towards decision science, computer vision and autonomy segments. In the three cases, generative AI plays an increasingly important role. The federal government has increased its budget on AI by more than $600 million year on year, up from $2.7 billion in 2021. Total spending on AI contracts has increased by nearly 2.5 times since 2017, when the US government spent $1.3 billion on artificial technology.
The recently released President Biden’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, which has created a landmark in the US Administration to push forward the inclusion of AI in the public sector, makes reference to generative AI. Concretely, it displays the need to protect citizens from “AI-enabled fraud and deception by establishing standards and best practices for detecting AI-generated content and authenticating official content. The Department of Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content.” However, this reference is only made once.
However, this statement aligns with the –also released on the same day– G7 Leaders’ Statement on the first-ever International Guiding Principles and a voluntary Code of Conduct. Born from the Hiroshima AI Process, Germany, Canada, the US, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom highlights the importance of engaging developers and agreeing on a common baseline of principles to develop AI, including generative AI. At the same time, Western countries have been focusing on generative AI further more –although still at a preliminary stage–, with the UK’s AI Safety Summit, whose theme is devoted to frontier AI risks and opportunities, including generative AI. 
Alongside these Western-centric approaches to generative AI, China has been also developing certain initiatives. In the case of China, no specific data has been publicly shown either, but the proposal for a first-of-its-kind rules governing generative AI, announced by the government in July 2023, shows the level, scope and interest of the issue. The rules, developed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), will only apply to generative AI services that are available to the general public rather than those being developed in research institutions. Generative AI providers will need to obtain a license to operate, conduct security assessments on their product and ensure user information is secure, based on the “core values of socialism”, as acknowledged by the CAC.
Amid this scenario of nationally-led initiatives or minilateral coalitions, the United Nations has decided to take over its voice as shaper of policy discussions at the global level. In particular, the UN Secretary-General, which already launched the proposal for a Global Digital Compact to be approved during the Summit of the Future in September 2024, has set up a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, whose two co-chairs are from Spain –an active EU member state in AI, and also the expected final Presidency to the EU Council to approve the AI Act proposal– and from Zimbabwe.
While there is less information on the governmental decisions to address generative AI, the existence of a growing market by the private sector shows the intensity and exponential growth –and, thus, competition– of this technology vertical by companies. In this realm, there is no single Chinese and US leader in generative AI. Depending on the topic, one or the other leads.
Top firms using generative AI: the US leads the way
As for top firms using generative AI, US companies are far ahead of Chinese firms and from other countries. Microsoft leads the usage of generative AI with a market capitalization of $2.442 trillion, followed by Alphabet ($1.718 trillion). The leading Chinese company is Alibaba Group ($241.97 Billion), which is on the top ten worldwide and ranks 7th.

Also, American firms also have a strong competitive advantage in the design and production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are a type of hardware that is the main power source for most Large Language Models (LLMs), a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This provides major incentives and opportunities for innovation. There are other technologies that have strong interactions with generative AI, such as the US has a strong leverage in the cloud computing industry, which is essential for training and deploying generative AI models. 
The ranking does not disclose the transformative power of generative AI in abolishing market barriers and strong clusters that end up producing gatekeepers. Even if large companies may have access to the best technology and technologists, generative AI is a field that is growing very quickly and may put some new players on the table. Smaller competitors may be building more adaptable and, most importantly, cheaper, and more accessible open-source AI models. If this document turns out to be true, AI is also fostering a bottom-up competition from smaller AI enablers that can generate even more innovation in the US and refrain Chinese actors from leading top firms in generative AI, due to two reasons.
First, because companies based in China need to abide by a greater number of rules, wielded by the government, and with a greater amount of oversight mechanisms on which type of content flows through generative AI processes, either on political, societal or cultural issues. Second, because Chinese companies might face a similar process as it happened with the “tech crackdown” on Chinese companies since 2020. Chinese authorities initiated a regulatory storm against the country’s Big Tech firms in late 2020 out of concerns that the country’s major internet platforms were experiencing a major growth and monopolistic behaviours. It started with the limitation of Alibaba’s AntGroup IPO in the United States and was followed by a greater number of norms limiting the international expansion of companies. After three years, the Chinese government announced in 2023 its strategy to maintain the “bottom line of development security” and strengthen its “linkage effect” with international markets. This might mean that the technology crackdown is declining. However, still generative AI companies might face greater level of dynamism in the US than in China.
AI has been one of the forefronts of US-China competition, but the effects do remain limited to the competition between these two. The EU, for instance, is falling behind, as no European firm was in the ranking. Kai-fu Lee, the ex-president of Google China and prominent venture capitalist and AI expert, told Sifted that Europe is not even in the running for “bronze medal” in the AI race. He determined that Europe has none of the success factors like the US or China, due to a lack of a VC-entrepreneur ecosystem, successful consumer internet companies, social media companies, or big-sized mobile application companies that can drive artificial intelligence advancements, and a lack of governmental support to win the generative AI race.
Top countries with the most AI Patents applications: issues with generative AI, intellectual property and China’s leadership
China has the most AI patent applications, with 4,636 applications or 64.8% of all patents requested globally. The US comes in second with 1,416 AI patent applications, making up 19.8% of patent applications with offices listed, followed by the Republic of Korea, with 532 applications. In 2022, China filed 29,853 AI-related patents, up from 29,000 the previous year. Beijing has accounted for more than 40% of global AI applications over 2022, mainly due to the monetization of AI products from top tech firms like Baidu and Alibaba. Since 2017, China’s patents surpassed the US ones. However, now they represent almost double the sum of the US. Concretely, China is leading the competition in patents with Baidu and Alibaba monetizing AI products. The countries that would follow the list are Japan and South Korea with a total of 16,700 requests.

The Chinese government considers its domestic patent market a key economic sector and has been leading it since 2021, especially now with generative AI being a growing market for more patents. Last year, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) released a draft of measures to downgrade the ratings of Chinese patent agencies that were following non-desirable and fraudulent patent schemes.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) supports its domestic companies in generative AI, as well as in other strategic industries through subsidies. Even if there are no state-owned enterprises in the AI industry, the CCP still influences market direction and collaborates with private companies through financial and regulatory leverage. For instance, iFlytek has received substantial government subsidies, even exceeding half of the company’s annual net profits, namely 258.18 million yuan ($37.7 million).
Europe is severely underperforming in terms of patents. According to the WIPO report, out of the top 167 universities and public research institutions for patents, only 4 are in Europe. Out of these 4 European public research organizations that do feature on the WIPO list of top AI patent fillers, the highest-placed is the German Fraunhofer Institute, which is ranked 159th, while the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) is in 185th position.
VC Investments in AI: comparison between countries
Since 2019, Generative AI startups have attracted over $28.3 billion in funding from investors. Only in 2023, it has attracted $17.8 billion from January to August. Generative AI startups have raised over $14.1 billion in equity funding across 86 deals in Q2 2023, making it a record year for investment in generative AI startups. Concretely, 89% of the global total ($20 billion) went to the US, making it the lead in VC Investments in AI.

The success the US on generative AI startups and venture capital has to be contextualized with the role of the new players in the AI-generative market and the capacity to grab high-risk venture capital, concretely with the success of the US firm OpenAI. It is not only this firm. According to Forbes’ AI 50 list from April 2023, the top 5 generative AI start-up companies in terms of funding come from the United States. China, on the other hand, has been also investing in several generative AI applications. 22 generative AI start-ups in China received funding as opposed to 21 in the US and 4 in the UK. However, US start-ups received more funding in total. 12 of the 18 generative AI companies that received funding totalling more than 100 million yuan (US$138,287) in the first half were from the US, while only three were from China.
China’s government aim AI to represent 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion) to the country by 2030. While there are 14 unicorns worth a combined $40.5 billion on AI companies in China, still generative AI will need a greater level of investments to accomplish its goal of global leadership in this specific technology development.
European startups got just $1bn out of the €22bn that VCs have invested in generative AI since 2019, making up only 5% of this $22 billion to Europe. Asian startups got $790 million. The assessment of which country may become the leader in generative AI does not only stem from the number of top firms, publications or start-ups funding. It also derives from the flow of VC investments to certain high-priority industries, first, and who is the final recipient of this target investment. Concretely, the main target sector of US investments on generative AI (more than of 50%) flow into the media, social platforms and marketing sectors.
The second largest sector is the IT infrastructure and hosting, followed by financial and insurance services, digital security, travel, leisure and hospitality, and government, security and defence to a lesser extent. It is remarkable to say that US stakeholders invest almost 80% of generative AI funding in these two sectors within their own country –and not abroad.
On the other hand, Chinese stakeholders also invest in generative AI for high-priority sectors within their home country. Mostly, they invest in IT infrastructure and hosting; healthcare and biotechnology; business processes and support services; financial and insurance services; digital security; and media, social platforms and marketing. This scenario reflects that China and the US are similarly targeting media, social platforms and marketing, as well as IT infrastructure and hosting as the main priority sectors on generative AI investments, and they do invest in these to strengthen their home countries’ industries. They do diversify other low-profile investments into other sectors, but are not significant.
The implications of generative AI for security, economy and rights
Global security and defence
Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for security and defence. On the one hand, it has been a valuable source on defence policy and planning. In August 2023, the US Department of Defense (DoD) launched Task Force Lima in order to integrate AI on national security by both minimizing risks, and leading innovation in the future outcomes in defence.
NATO has also initiated preliminary discussions over the potential impact of Generative AI. Concretely, the NATO’s Data and Artificial Intelligence Review Board (DARB), which serves as a forum for Allies and the focal point for NATO’s efforts to govern responsible development and use of AI by helping operationalise Principles of Responsible Use (PRUs), hosted a panel briefing on generative AI and its potential impact on NATO to weight the capabilities and limitations of generative AI. One of the main conclusions was that generative AI stack is not yet highly comprehensive in reasoning and planning to meet the critical functions required by the military.
While this panel briefing has an informational goal, it remains of high interest to assess which will be the final output from DARB on this issue. DARB is in charge of translating these principles into specific, hands-on Responsible AI Standards and Tools Certifications, and provides a common baseline to create quality controls and risks mitigation mechanisms.
Another challenge for security and defence is the impact of generative AI on intelligence analysis. AI enhances situation awareness and geolocation through various open data sets (OSINT), as well as decision-making processes and scenario-planning such as wargaming or foresight analysis. However, one challenge derived from generative AI is that it has so far tended to be fed by open-source data and platforms, what makes harder for intelligence communities to make use of it as a trusted tool.
If we focus specifically on US-China competition, 3 out of 5 of the world’s top five commercial drone brands are Chinese, while just one is American. More concretely, DJI’s market share is expected to grow from $30.6 billion in 2022 to $55.8 billion by 2030, while it has 70% of the current market value in the whole drone industry. The growing utilization of generative AI in drones might create an additional race for the development of these technologies on the battleground. For instance, one of the leading AI firms in the world is DJI from China, which has 70% of the global share of the drone market with a value of $33bn.
However, this potential usage of generative AI also conveys a number of risks, threats and challenges that might influence in the eventual decision of using generative AI to make security– and defence-oriented decisions. Data overflows may pose a challenge for security and defence policymakers when working with private companies that provide solutions to their services and projects. If a company makes use of open-source generative AI, the code sent to the GitHub service that manages this information flow could contain a company’s confidential intellectual property, and sensitive data such as API keys that have special access to customer information.
Markets and economy
President Xi Jinping considered AI a technology in which China had to lead, setting specific targets for 2020 and 2025 that put the country on a path to dominance over AI technology and related applications by 2030. Generative AI is nothing different. The creation of generative AI start-ups ecosystems across countries is gaining relevance, as it has been shown. However, generative AI poses new questions on the table for the global economy.
First, in global trade, generative AI may be understood as both an enabling tool and an end-goal. As an enabling tool, it may detect large language models of data on transactions, documents and contracts, to identify anomalies, fraud risks, and compliance issues with regards to money laundering, economic sanctions and tax havens. AI may create a new line of opportunity for global trade, although data shown in previous sections displays that so far countries have been investing in this technological asset on a domestic basis, with limited cross-border flows.
Second, generative AI may lead to two trends. On the one hand, companies aim to leverage generative AI internally in their companies to reduce costs of partnerships with third actors. According to McKinsey, 33% of organizations aim to use generative AI to reduce costs in core business (what might reduce the diversification of partners and suppliers from other industries and countries), and 12% aim to create new businesses and/or sources of revenue.

On the other hand, generative AI infrastructure will require cross-industry collaborations. Even if a company aims to reduce its costs of partnerships with third countries, become much more competitive and create higher revenues on its own, still the creation of the infrastructure requires to set up deals with other industries to make that goal feasible. According to CB Insights, the creation of this infrastructure is leading to cross-industry collaborations ($4 billion, 116 deals) more than industry-specific collaborations (only $0.3 billion, 45 deals). This two-fold assessment means that generative AI will create new layers of competition across companies but will also undoubtedly lead to greater levels of needed cooperation across sectors to have the technological edge over others.
Third, generative AI may create new grounds of competition and cooperation across sectors and products. For example, AI-enabled fintech companies are an increasingly important sector. With generative AI, they might see strong upsurge in their global positioning as a relevant industry. The more support a country provides to the establishment of existing, yet-to-be-top ecosystems, the more successful and competitive they will be in the global arena. As of 2023, Tencent’s WeChat Pay, the main fintech services provider in China, has over 1.2 billion users – of course, only operating in China. In contrast, Apple Pay has over 500 million users worldwide, with no less than 30 million being from the US. The UK is an interesting case as well. Founded in London in 2015, Revolut now has over 30 million retail customers worldwide and 6.8 UK users, having added over five million new users globally since November 2022. Lastly, Klarna from Sweden, if we move to the EU, has over 4 million monthly users –however, it leaves the picture of the EU with a big gap in AI-enabled fintech compared to other blocs.
Biometrics and facial recognition are another area where generative AI might be used and competition may be present. Biometrics can be understood as the identification of people using their physical or behavioural traits, and it has a strong dual-use aspect which can be used to control population or even use deep fakes and deception techniques through generative AI. Synthetic biometric data like fingerprints or our faces can be produced using generative AI, which can lead to breaches of personal information, data retention and overall trust in AI-enabled security systems.
Fourth, global economic competition –and cooperation– will not only be based on leading industries. It will also lie in the specific applications companies may utilize. The greater a country encourages private companies to invest in AI assistants and HMIs, the most competitive it will be. However, if all companies focus on the same generative interface, they will lose competitiveness. This is why some countries are promoting another interface-specific leaderships, for example India in code completion and voice synthesis.

The US Federal Trade Commission is still struggling to see how they can best achieve both the promotion of fair competition and the protection of citizens from unfair or deceitful practices. Market concentration and oligopolistic tendencies can also happen, as largest firms are the ones who also have the access to more data, talent and capital in order to deploy AI-generated content. As the ranking exposed, the most powerful firms in AI come from the US. These firms are also the technological global markets that seem to control all the necessary “raw materials” for deploying AI-big bulks of data storage, strong computing power and cloud services, as well as the world’s leading AI researchers and investments.
Likewise, an increasingly important, revamped topic is the mechanism of using state aid. China, the US, the EU, India and other technological powerhouses are increasing the amount of subsidies devoted to strategic technologies, either to reduce the dependence on third countries which pose a high-risk in case of supply chain disruption or shock, or to become a frontrunner in this specific technological vector.
China is developing Chinese Guidance Funds (CGFs), among other cases. These public-private investment funds are a meeting point between the Chinese business community and government, as the latter pours money to mobilize massive amounts of capital in support of strategic and emerging technologies, including AI. The US has engaged in state aid promotion for critical technologies such as semiconductors, as the EU has done similarly.
However, jointly with subsidies, a critical point is how countries frame export control regimes. For instance, the restriction of exports towards a certain technology may hinder the development in other sectors, such as generative AI. According to Albright Stonebridge Group, US restrictions limit access to some types of advanced semiconductors, which are necessary for the greater compute requirements that future LLMs will need. If Chinese companies cannot access the Global Processing Units (GPUs), they will face challenges to develop LLMs as quick, comprehensive and complete as Western firms, thus limiting its share in the global marketplace.
The presence of a highly skilled workforce in AI in general, and in generative AI in particular, remains strategic. In 2021, Quad partners Australia, India, Japan and the United States announced the Quad Fellowship, a first-of-its-kind scholarship program to build ties across STEM experts from four countries. AI is one of the top-priority areas for these talent exchanges, which include scholarships for PhD, master’s, and talent exchanges across companies. This is of particular interest because the US has been long retaining international US-trained AI PhDs staying in the country, including those from AI competitors such as China. Particular sectors in generative AI, on the other hand, employ the greatest share of US talent, and this trend might increase in the next years.
Figure 7. Sectors that employ the greatest share of US AI talent, 2023

By contrast, other studies have found that the majority of China-trained AI talent currently lives outside China. Estimates indicate that its need for workers skilled in AI is expected to grow sixfold by 2030 (from one million to six million). Due to this gap, universities and research centres are participating in a large range of government-backed talent programmes to attract and retain AI talent.
Rights and global governance
Generative AI has received attention from the perspectives of rights and global norms. The European Parliament, which is long drafting its AI Act proposal, interrupted one of the final stages of the proposal due to concerns over those loopholes that might remain outside of the AI Act if not covered properly.
Likewise, Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom launched the OECD Global Forum on Technology, a platform for dialogue and cooperation on digital policy issues, where generative AI had a prominent role and was a top priority. The Forum has developed a set of principles on AI from a humanistic approach in order to foster trustworthiness, fairness, transparency, security, and accountability, among other values. The OECD’s perspective on generative AI and digital rights is based on the idea that these technologies should be aligned with human values and serve the public interest. The Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) has developed some policy reports on the potential impact of generative AI on certain global issues, such as the future of work.
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has addressed generative AI in the last IGF in Japan in October 2023. The IGF’s perspective on generative AI and digital rights is based on the global idea that these technologies should be governed by all states. The UN agency, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), approaches generative AI under the umbrella of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and bridging the digital divide.
It looks like, even amid global competition for generative AI, most international forums are increasing their positions and views on governing AI under a humanistic view.
The role of the EU in the global implications of Generative AI 
While the EU’s position in the economy of Generative AI is less prominent and significant than that of China’s and the US, the EU has caught up on the potential security and rights challenges.  
Regarding its economic position, there is no single European generative AI start-up or company on the top list of firms worldwide. Venture Capital culture is limited in Europe, and there is an important lack of commercialization of research and development towards the market.
Generative AI, economic security and critical technologies 
The European Commission proposed in the summer of 2023 the first-of-its-kind Economic Security Strategy, which aims to address the economic security risks derived from certain economic flows and activities that may remain vulnerable or threatened in the current scenario of geopolitical tensions and accelerated technological development.
The European Economic Security Strategy is based on a three-pillar approach, or three Ps: promotion of the EU’s economic base and competitiveness; protection against risks; and partnership with countries with shared concerns and interests. The four areas that require risk assessment are: resilience of supply chains, including energy security; physical and cyber-security of critical infrastructure; technology security and leakage; and weaponization of economic dependencies and coercion.
Concretely, one of the first deliverables has been the list proposal on critical technologies by the European Commission, which encourages Member States to provide their risk assessments and lead to a collective work to determine which proportionate and precise measures should be taken to promote, protect and partner in specific technology areas. The goal is two-fold: to reduce dependencies from third actors whose supply chain and political security may be of high-risk, and to promote a diversification of strategic assets across the Union and with trusted partners.  
Out of this list proposal, which contains 10 technology areas, the second priority is Artificial Intelligence. The technologies listed for this area, that should be assessed, but are not exhaustive and may include new ones, include high-performance computing, cloud and edge computing, data analytics technologies, and computer vision, language processing and object recognition. Most of these listed technologies have an immediate interaction with Generative AI, either because Generative AI helps them to improve or to optimize their solutions, or because the former depends on the latter to get developed and run.   
From a practical perspective, several pressing challenges arise with regards to this list proposal of critical technologies and the embedding of Generative AI. First, this list is aligned with President of the European Commission’s de-risking strategy. Its goal is not to promote an inward market of endogenous manufacturing or keep away from global supply chains (decoupling). The objective is to promote global trade at the same time the EU reduces its dependencies from high-risk third actors and guarantees strategic assets’ diversification with trusted partners (friend-shoring). While the de-risking approach was initially criticized by some countries that considered that EU’s approach to China was not assertive, eventually the United States accepted this discourse and the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, has reiterated it during 2023.  
However, from a hands-on approach, the reality is that the embedding of generative AI through a de-risking approach may prove to be hard, at least at present times, because this technology application still has several security loopholes and risks –as mentioned in previous chapters– that make complex a real-time, actual, comprehensive monitoring of the potential challenges it may represent for global security and economic resilience. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council has been working since 2021 on how to develop joint early warning and monitoring systems for certain technologies such as advanced semiconductors, but this monitoring process requires a high level of existing data, due diligence compliance and the establishment of fluid conversations and partnerships with the private sector that designs, produces, and deploys these systems.  
Additionally, it remains to be known the actual effect of export control regimes led by the United States, and joined by the Netherlands and Japan, on certain semiconductors and AI components towards China. As stated in previous sections, the restriction over semiconductors in China would limit the access for Chinese companies to GPUs that are essential for Large Language Models.
Related to the latter point, one of the reasons why the Economic Security Strategy and the list of critical technologies were proposed was due to the identified lack of a comprehensive, fully-fledged coordination and cooperation across EU Member States on technology issues. While the Netherlands’ decision to join the US-led export control regime is valid under the European typology of shared and exclusive competences, it was a display for EU institutions on how much needed an actual implementation of collective measures is. 
When it comes down to generative AI, the main question will be how each Member State, when developing their national risk assessments to be sent to the European Commission before the end of 2023, will address generative AI: as a security risk, threat or challenge; as a purely economic issue; or as a topic that needs to be addressed only through regulation (namely, the AI Act proposal). As it has occurred with other proposals, such as 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox, Member States may have different political, security and market approaches to the same issue.
A relevant point is how to address generative AI and economic security with regards to China. Neither the strategy nor the list proposal mention the country explicitly. Some Member States look forward to a greater assertive approach to China, while others prefer to not do so.
Generative AI, the Brussels effect and EU’s regulatory powerhouse 
The European Union has become a worldwide benchmark for a large part of technology-related regulations. Throughout the early development of the AI Act proposal since April 2021, generative AI was never mentioned. However, the increase of usage of generative AI since the end of 2022 has made actors involved in the proposal to include generative AI as a relevant issue. 
Concretely, the European Parliament has proposed that generative AI systems are subject to three levels of obligations: specific obligations for generative AI, specific obligations for foundation models, and general obligations applicable to all AI systems.
The EU has been long flagged as the regulatory powerhouse when it comes to technology policy. The ‘Brussels effect’ phenomenon has been referred during several years to explain how EU’s regulation influences in how third countries apply their own technology legislation with a similar approach. In the case of generative AI, it remains to be seen which scope and depth generative AI will receive in the AI Act proposal. 
However, an interesting development is how the EU and some of its Member States are promoting a prominent voice in the global technology governance dialogues. Particularly, the Spanish government has launched, jointly with the United Kingdom and the United States, the OECD Global Forum on Technology, where generative AI was one of the two top priority topics. Likewise, the Spanish Presidency to the EU Council –which is expected to wrap up the AI Act file during the final semester of 2023– is pushing towards including generative AI as an economic factor of opportunity and as a topic that needs to guarantee and protect fundamental rights.  
Generative AI, the foreign policy of technology, and multilateralism 
The EU does not only address technology policy through regulation, market and security considerations. Technology has become an asset of foreign policy and a relevant topic discussion in multilateral and minilateral fora. Two main frameworks help explain how the EU might push generative AI as part of the global discussions. 
First, the Global Gateway, launched in December 2021, and which is the EU major investment plan in infrastructure development with third countries, puts the digital pillar as its first priority. Concretely, the work with partner countries focuses on digital networks and infrastructures, including Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI is not mentioned in the communication, partly due to the period of time when it was published. With the lengthy time it has taken to get projects released, it is of low likelihood that generative AI will be a top priority in the Global Gateway, as there are other technologies with a greater level of capacity maturity, a greater opportunity of investments, due diligence compliance and trusted partnerships with third countries, and with a long-lasting background of public-private partnerships in those technology areas. However, generative AI is a topic to not be overlooked.  
Second, the Council of the European Union approved in July 2022 the first-ever framework on EU’s digital diplomacy. The European External Action Service got the approval to frame, through a formal action plan and operational initiatives, all international technology partnerships that the EU was running. This would be undertaken with a higher level of coordination, under a same umbrella, and with a much more diplomacy-oriented arm, consisting of networks of flagship EU Delegations with technology policy as a top priority issue in their negotiations and activities. 
Concretely, the EU has been so far developing several partnerships with third countries. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council, initiated in 2021, devotes a specific working group on Artificial Intelligence. Both partners announced in December 2022 the launch of the Joint Roadmap on Evaluation and Measurement Tools for Trustworthy AI and Risk Management, whose implementation plan contains short– and long-term goals. Goals mainly cover the following areas: the establishment of inclusive cooperation channels, advancing shared terminologies and taxonomies, conduct an analysis on AI standards and identify those of interest for cooperation, development of tools on evaluation, selection, inclusion and revision, and the setting-up of monitoring and measuring systems of existing and emerging AI risks.
One of the first deliverables has been the launch of an initial draft of AI terminologies and taxonomies, by engaging stakeholders. It has identified 65 terms that were identified with reference to key documents. The main goal is to move forward a common vision on how to govern AI and how to move up agendas to the multilateral settings of negotiation. Apart fort the expert working group on terminologies, other two working groups are ongoing: on standards and on emerging risks.  
Generative AI systems have received attention in the TTC. Concretely, in May 2023, during the TTC in Luleå, Sweden, a panel discussion was held on large AI models, following the “recently witnessed acceleration of generative AI”. The main output was for both the EU and the US to foster further international cooperation and a faster global approach to AI.  
The EU counts on other international technology partnerships. However, the reference to generative AI has been far limited. First, because the level of depth and scope of topics in other dialogues are not as broad as in the transatlantic TTC.  In some cases, the EU addresses the approach to AI with third countries in terms of ethics, definitions and taxonomies, For example, the Japan-EU Digital Partnership Agreement addresses similar topics, such as global supply chains, secure 5G, digitalization of public services, digital trade, global and interoperable standards, and digital education. It also addresses the topic on safe and ethical applications of AI.
However, there have been no major developments or joint declarations on this issue, except for their common membership to the G20 (the EU as a participant with no voting rights). The declaration on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Partnership Agreement points out to the need to discuss definitions, use cases, high risk AI applications and response measures, and facilitate cooperation towards relevant fora, such as the GPAI and OECD.  
In other cases, the EU addresses the cooperation on AI through the lens of technical implementation. For instance, the focus of the EU-Singapore Digital Partnership Agreement is on interoperability, cooperation on AI testbeds and testing, cross-border access for AI technologies and solutions, capabilities, and references to trustworthiness, adoptability and transparency.  
A relevant, growingly increasing reference is the cooperation on AI in international forums, where both sides may move up common agendas to these settings. Japan and Korea’s partnership agreements refer to it. Likewise, the EU-India Trade and Technology Council encourages the coordination -which is a wording that goes beyond the concept of cooperation, and implies a greater level of joint work- within the GPAI. EU’s interest in India as a technological powerhouse has increased in recent years.  
In some EU’s technology partnerships with regions and countries, there is no explicit reference to Artificial Intelligence, but the development of technological capacity-building in other verticals are an anteroom of future areas of interest that may arise in coming years. To give an example, the launch of the EU-LAC Digital Alliance in early 2023 focused on regulatory convergence, digital infrastructure, the role of satellites (Earth observation, technology solutions for hazardous climate responses), talent, R&I, data centers, data spaces, but less reference to AI.  
In the case of the African continent, the wording “digital” has been present since the 2017 Sixth EU-Africa Business Forum, that highlighted the role of digital economy as a driver. The extension of digital topics has experienced an upsurge, on digital skills, broadband connectivity, cross-border backbone infrastructure, e-services, but limited references to AI. Digital for Development (D4D) Hubs in both Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa have set out workshops and training activities on Artificial Intelligence. 
Overall, the reference to generative AI is still limited across the different global governance regimes, also in the case of EU’s international technology partnerships. This is a trend across all countries, regional organizations and international agencies. However, the launch of the first-ever United Nations High-Level Advisory Body on AI is a window of opportunity to plug generative AI into the discussion as a relevant issue to be tackled by the diverse group of representatives on a geographic and cultural basis.
A much-needed further policy discussion and framing on the impact of Generative AI on international affairs
Evidence shows that China and the United States are racing over the global competition on generative AI, although this is not a much explicit issue. However, their instruments of power differ: while China leads in intellectual property and patents, has a large number of generative AI start-ups and is building up a strong ecosystem of companies, the United States still leads the way in the sum of investments devoted to this technology vector, mostly through Venture Capital, which aims to invest in high-risk markets, which are featured by uncertainty and potential impact.
The impact of generative AI is three-pronged and introduces opportunities and challenges. In security, it touches on its military applications, the impact on intelligence community’s decision-making processes, and the growth of hybrid threats triggered by generative AI, such as deepfakes and foreign information manipulation interference (FIMI). In economy, it may lead to new cross-sector and cross-industry collaborations to get generative AI developed. At the same time, it may become an area of competition with similar trend patterns such as market concentration. In rights and global governance, main forums have started in these two last years –mostly in 2023– to include early discussion panels on the impact of generative AI. Some issues have been touched upon, such as the future of work and the impact on human rights. However, still a large level of development is required to provide policy discussions which are capable and comprehensive to settle down thorough principles, roadmaps, and action plans.
In this scenario, the European Union should play a relevant role. Evidence shows that, from the economic perspective, it lags with regards to large corporations and start-ups alike. Also, in terms of Venture Capital, it is missing the race and might fail to be on the top three worldwide. With regards to security and rights implications, the EU is moving forward, is covering generative AI under the umbrella of the AI Act with a three-level set of obligations and is contributing to discussions in international fora. Still, the EU’s bilateral technology partnerships with trusted countries and like-minded partners should deepen the conversation on generative AI. This is an opportunity to have a first-mover advantage in this area of foreign policy of technology, and also to agree on common principles and be more influential in the international agenda.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration//File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabLaw FirmsLowenstein Sandler LLPFollowNovember 28, 2023 - ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (""AI"") programs, like the image-generating Midjourney, have accelerated conversations around generative AI, raising important public policy questions on the protectability of AI-generated works.The full impact of generative AI has not yet revealed itself, and all creative fields are essentially confronted with a future that is hard to predict amidst the fast-paced changes taking place. However, the U.S. Copyright Office has taken some initial steps to issue guidance, even launching a formal AI initiative. While it has fallen short of issuing any rules, the Office has left a breadcrumb trail that forms the center of this debate: What might satisfy the Copyright Office's requisite human authorship requirement to afford AI-assisted creative content copyright protection?Advertisement · Scroll to continueWhere the debate stands, and why the issue matters for all creative fieldsMany creatives consider AI to be ""plagiarism machines"" particularly regarding the use of their copyrighted work as references by the AI apps without their permission. Generative AI formulates its output by drawing on patterns learned from pre-existing works. Some might argue this is no different than an artist being inspired by prior works, but the plaintiffs in recent cases argue that generative AI, by design, directly uses existing works to feed and train its algorithms. The recently resolved strikes by the Writers Guild of America (""WGA"") and the Screen Actors Guild (""SAG-AFTRA""), have highlighted the issue of how to govern the use of generative AI in creative fields.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn the WGA's negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (""AMPTP""), the WGA demanded that AI be prohibited from writing or rewriting material for production or being used for source material, and that material created under the Minimum Basic Agreement not be used to train AI.However, the AMPTP, and other funders of creative works did not want to close the door on a fast-growing technology already proving useful. For example, Disney has been experimenting with AI technology since June 2020 to create characters for its Star Wars franchise. The resolution between the parties included many of these demands, including the requirement that AI-generated material will not be considered ""source material""; and a compromise that the WGA reserved the right to assert claims that a writer's material was used to train an AI model.

Continue watchingUS Secret Service chief grilled in Trump shooting hearingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEThe debate at issue in the strikes may become moot as new rules make their way through the Copyright Office or even federal regulation. However, Congress may be concerned with over-regulating the development and application of AI technology, as the U.S. is always in competition with other nations to develop new technologies and markets.Copyright office guidance and rulings offer indications of the office's directionNo copyright protection for works lacking requisite human authorshipThe Copyright Office has been deciding AI-related applications and issuing guidance for years. In 2022, Stephen Thaler attempted to copyright a two-dimensional AI-authored image titled ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise,"" created by an image-generating AI tool he developed called the ""Creativity Machine."" The Copyright Office rejected the application, stating that the work lacked ""the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.""In response, Thaler sued the Copyright Office, arguing that he is the owner of the work and that it was a work made for hire by the AI tool. On March 16, 2023, the Copyright Office issued ""Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence,"" a Statement of Policy, ""to clarify its practices for examining and registering works that contain material generated by the use of artificial intelligence technology.""Headlines that followed largely stated that AI-created works would not be protectable. While this is true for works created exclusively by AI, what has been largely ignored is how a work co-authored by a human and a generative AI can garner protection under the right circumstances.In the March Statement of Policy, the Copyright Office sought to offer guidance on two questions contested by Thaler and others utilizing generative AI in the creation of expressive works, addressing whether (1) a generative AI can qualify as an author, and (2) whether a work produced by a generative AI can be copyrighted as a work made for hire by the person that input the prompts.Unfortunately for AI proponents, the answer to both questions was a simple ""No,"" as: ""In the Office's view, it is well-established that copyright can protect only material that is the product of human creativity."" As such, where an AI only receives a prompt, the resulting expressive work is not copyrightable, because the human user does not have sufficient creative control over the ultimate output.How much human involvement is enough to secure a copyrightThe March Statement of Policy also addressed whether a work that consists ""of both human-authored and AI-generated material"" can be registered and what information an applicant must provide to the Copyright Office to register such works. It states that in cases where AI-generated work is subsequently edited or manipulated by a human in a ""sufficiently creative"" manner, the resulting work constitutes an original work that can be copyrighted. So, although the underlying AI-generated material is not protected, the manipulated work can be.Additionally, the Statement left open the possibility of copyright protection for creative works where the user-prompts result in an expressive work that is more predictive. The implications are apparent for certain creative endeavors: In the future, will there remain a need for an entire writers' room? Or, can the initial drafts be created by generative AI and then edited by one or more humans?Additional clues as to how a human can collaborate with an AI on a copyrighted protected work are found in the story of Maria Kashtanova and her graphic novel ""Zaraya of the Dawn."" The case was the primary subject of a Feb. 21, 2023, memo issued by the Copyright Office, which explained how significant human editing of an AI-generated work can satisfy the human authorship requirement to receive copyright protection.Kashtanova's copyright application garnered sensationalist, misleading, and imprecise headlines like ""Copyright Office Denies Claim to Copyright in Generative AI Images;"" however, although the ruling denied copyright protection to the individual AI-generated images, the graphic novel, in its entirety, was deemed copyrightable:Based on the representation that the selection and arrangement of the images in the Work was done entirely by Ms. Kashtanova, the Office concludes that it is the product of human authorship. Copyright therefore protects Ms. Kashtanova's authorship of the overall selection, coordination, and arrangement of the text and visual elements that make up the Work.For one last example, an April 20, 2023, letter from the Copyright Office to The Mechanical Licensing Collective offered further guidance regarding mechanical music licenses. The letter, which largely parallels the guidance issued in the March Statement of Policy, stated that if a musical work is produced solely by generative AI with the use of prompts, it cannot receive a copyright, as it fails to have the requisite human authorship. However, the Copyright Office stated that where a human selects or arranges a musical work in a ""sufficiently creative way,"" the resulting work will be an original work that satisfies human authorship.The future for creatives and copyrightThe apocalyptic rhetoric regarding how generative AI will be the death knell for all human-created expressive works, including journalism, media, art, and entertainment, may be hyperbolic in the short term, but there is no doubt that generative AI will displace a certain degree of human creativity and involvement. It is not far-fetched to envision a future where the first draft of an expressive work produced by AI is then edited by humans. Or, conversely, to have human-authored works then edited or manipulated by AI remain protectable works.Even with a clearer picture of what constitutes the requisite amount of human authorship to obtain copyright protection for AI-assisted expressive works, the issue remains of whether and how content creators should be compensated if their works are used to train AI technologies, as seen in class-action suits filed by Sarah Silverman and others against OpenAI and Meta, as well as an open letter to AI companies from over 8,000 authors demanding compensation for any use of their works to train AI models without permission.In a June 12, 2023, letter to Stephanie Weiner, Acting Chief Counsel of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Copyright Office stated that it is preparing to take on the issue of whether the use of existing works to train AI models constitutes a fair use. The Office plans to release a notice of inquiry seeking public input later this year. Some other countries (such as Japan and Israel) have already taken steps to codify a fair use exception for model training to create safe havens for innovation.The battles waged today will have profound implications on creativity, ownership, and control. The business, technology, legal, and creative communities must stay current with the latest trends in order to address such issues in their policies, procedures, and contracts.Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter.

Are you at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence?The rise of advanced AI tools such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, which generates images based on text prompts, has sparked fears that millions of jobs could be replaced by the technology.One of the first studies into the impact of AI on the jobs market in the UK, carried out by the Department for Education (DfE), has concluded that consultants, accountants and psychologists are most exposed to the rise of AI.Sports players, roofers and construction workers were among those least likely to be affected by the technology.The report also found that workers in London and the South East were the most vulnerable, with those in the North East least likely to be affected. People with higher levels of education are more likely to be impacted than those with lower level qualifications.The research refers to “exposure” to AI systems, meaning jobs may be aided or replaced by AI. However, careers that are aided by AI may also generate fewer jobs if it means technology can accomplish key tasks.The Telegraph has used the DfE’s statistics to build a tool letting you see how exposed your job is.








Official statistics divide professions in the UK into 365 categories, such as solicitors, librarians and nurses, although some jobs are categorised more widely, such as financial managers.The DfE’s provided an “AI occupational exposure” score to each job based on AI’s ability to replicate the skills required.The scores range from around -2 to 1.5, with a higher score indicating a profession is more likely to be affected.The Telegraph has divided jobs into five bands – ranging from those highly likely to be affected by AI to very unlikely, based on their exposure score.The DfE said it was generally believed that between 10pc and 30pc of existing jobs will be affected by AI, although new jobs will also be created to take advantage of the technology.A study from US researchers earlier this year found that AI tools like ChatGPT were already taking freelance work away from copywriters and graphic designers.The DfE said: “The report illustrates how the education system and employers will need to adapt to ensure the workforce has the skills necessary to benefit from this emerging technology.”

4) Content Creation
Generative AI models have already proven their ability to quickly generate natural language content affordably and at scale, which has made these models particularly enticing for organizations that want to outsource content writing.
Several generative AI tools are able to write blog and social media content based on simple prompts. Others are designed to create more specific content, like legal documents or marketing materials. However, the area of generative AI content generation that is growing most quickly is multimedia content, with AI models used to create content like marketing videos with AI-generated voices and avatars.
Example solutions: Jasper, Notion AI, Phrasee, HubSpot Content Assistant
5) Document Summarization
A simple but effective way to use generative AI in your business is to summarize long and complex documents.
This can be a quick and easy way to identify the most important points in a long contract, legal document, conversation transcript, or other long-form content type. While some generative AI tools are standalone content summarization tools, others are embedded in everyday business operations and project management tools.
For example, Notion AI is a feature that enables Notion users to quickly summarize project notes and sales call transcripts.

5 Benefits of Leveraging Generative AI in Your Business
Depending on how (and how much) you choose to leverage AI capabilities in your organization, expect the following generative AI benefits from your efforts:

Quicker delivery times on projects: Generative AI models can quickly generate responses, new content, useful data, and other value your organization may need at scale. This leads to more efficient production and allows your team to complete projects on tighter timelines, which is ultimately more cost-effective.
Fewer hands-on employee requirements: Whether you lack the in-house staff expertise to complete a certain task or find that certain tasks are too tedious to hold employee attention, generative AI tools can pick up the slack and deliver consistent, accurate, and repeatable results.
Support and QA for employee-driven tasks: Particularly with coding and product development tasks, but also with data analytics and other content forms, generative AI tools can act as quality assurance analysts, checking employee work for errors and sometimes correcting those errors without human intervention.
Enhanced user experiences: Many generative AI tools are embedded in software that your employees or customers already use. With the help of generative AI, search engines, enterprise knowledge bases, project management platforms, and other user-facing tools are optimized for natural language inputs and an overall better user experience.
Industry-specific solutions: Several generative AI models have been fine-tuned to address industry- and function-specific requirements across sectors like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, and more. If you’re operating in a specialized industry — even with strict compliance requirements — there’s more than likely a generative AI model that will address your needs and simplify your workflow.

5 Challenges of Using Generative AI
Many risks come with using generative AI, and especially because this technology is still so new, not all ethical use dilemmas have been worked out. If you choose to use generative AI in your business, be on the lookout for these possible challenges you’ll face:

Limited regulatory requirements and guidance: Generative AI is not currently regulated on a larger scale, and at this time, there are few comprehensive usage frameworks that cover how your organization can use generative AI compliantly and effectively.
Lack of data and training transparency: Although many generative AI vendors are beginning to improve in this area, most are still not transparent with the types and sources of the training data they use, which leads to additional compliance and usage concerns.
Cybersecurity concerns: In the wrong hands or in the hands of an ill-trained employee, sensitive data may be exposed to generative models and become part of the training set. Bad-faith actors can also train these models to work around their rules to complete unauthorized tasks.
Identifying inaccurate outputs: Generative AI models use natural language so well that it’s sometimes difficult to determine if a model has generated an inaccurate response. Users will need to have the skills and nuanced knowledge to check their own work when using this type of technology.
Employee usage errors: It’s difficult to regulate and control how employees use generative AI in their work. Coming up with an AI use policy is a good step toward mitigating these errors, but there’s still no consistent way to enforce usage rules, control what data employees use as inputs, or monitor multiple employees’ actions at once.

What Are Generative AI Best Practices for Business Usage?
Establishing best practices and procedures for generative AI use is the best way to manage internal business use of these models. Follow these best practices for better generative AI outcomes in your business:

Use data from verified, credible, and approved sources as inputs.
Develop an AI use policy and training plan that clearly outlines how and when employees can use generative AI tools.
Partner with a generative AI vendor building models that can scale or be fine-tuned as your business requirements evolve; it’s also beneficial to identify vendors with products that integrate with your existing tool stack.
Do your due diligence and research generative AI vendors’ policies, terms, and reputations before committing.
Consider your budget and what tools fit into that budget; many foundation models are not that expensive but can quickly go up in price depending on your usage volume.
Consider any generative AI models you use as part of your cybersecurity threat landscape and protect accordingly.

Now, for knowledge workers, the threat of AI replacement is coming faster than they imagined.In early 2023, OpenAI's ChatGPT ushered in a new era – one in which artificial intelligence went from a pipe dream to a very real, contentious issue for workers. The stakes are high: an April report from Goldman Sachs estimates ChatGPT, and other similar generative AI tools, could increase global GDP by as much as 7%, while replacing 300 million full time workers.Many workers may have believed that burger-flipping robots in fast food restaurants, or advanced fabrication machines in factories, would represent the first wave of AI-related job losses. Yet the light-speed adoption and evolution of generative AI tools may now mean knowledge-work jobs that were long considered ""safe"" could be threatened even faster than workers anticipated. That includes creative positions that many presumed would be hard to automate, in fields like marketing, music production and graphic design. Accordingly, researchers have found that the ""exposure curve is upward-sloping"", says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, who focuses on the interplay of technology, people and places. This means people in what may have traditionally been thought of as higher-echelon, professional positions are the workers most at threat of replacement by AI.That's because generative AI tools and technologies can – or will soon be better able – to do all many things that have, in years past, been left to highly skilled humans: think tasks such as putting together marketing plans, search strategies and much more.Part of this is new technology hitting the market. Robots that act like AI colleagues are on the way – and in some cases, they're already here. While there is reason to think that AI may be a boon to workers, there are reasons that many people working in knowledge-work positions should be looking over their shoulders.Getty ImagesWorkers have expected robots to replace manual jobs, such as cooking in fast-food restaurants, but the threat to office jobs is surprising to many (Credit: Getty Images)In early December, Artisan AI – a San Francisco-based startup, founded by 22-year-old Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, who is from the UK – will unveil its first ""Artisan"", an AI-powered digital worker. It is designed to integrate with human teams, and for all practical purposes, become a member of those groups.While Artisan AI plans to have several ""Artisans"" hit the market throughout the next year, the first, ""Ava"", will automate the job of a sales representative, marking a significant improvement over chatbots and similar AI tools already on the market.""After a 15-minute conversation with Ava, it'll have the ability to build a knowledge base, and with that information, create prospects,"" says Carmichael-Jack. ""It's like having sales software, but it comes with a manager or account executive built-in – she can make suggestions, edit campaigns, join meetings and take notes,"" he adds. Carmichael-Jack says Artisans can function autonomously, in the background, with little or no input. As such, Artisans, added to an organisation's team, could and should help boost productivity significantly. The technology is already attracting the attention of investors; Artisan AI has raised more than $2m (£1.6m) in pre-seed money within two weeks, according to Carmichael-Jack.""Our goal is to have digital workers who can do anything a human can do, like join a meeting or have a phone call,"" he says. ""The goal is to have Artisans working alongside humans directly and have cohesion, and we want the boring work to be shifted on the Artisan, which doesn't have feelings about whether something is boring or difficult.""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class – Mark Muro, The Brookings InstitutionThe looming threat of AI to knowledge workers may feel new, but the foundation for the threat has been building for some time. Yet policymakers and others are playing catch-up in grappling with the potential economic effects. US President Biden, for instance, issued an executive order in October, putting in place guardrails for AI's continued use and development that future-proof American jobs.  Although much AI technology is already shaking up the workforce as we know it, ""we're still at the beginning"" when it comes to AI integration into the workplace, says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University professor and Director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. ""I'm more of the belief that we ain't seen nothing yet – this is just the first wave"" of AI integration into the economy. He says AI adoption will make its way through more of the economy, and as that happens, it should increase output, productivity and revenues for businesses.The question, however, is what the human toll of that growth will be, particularly in terms of job losses.Brynjolfsson says that ""the typical company has 15,000 to 20,000 distinct tasks carried out by employees, and software can run through and see where the biggest opportunity for automation lies"". If some of those tasks can be automated or streamlined with AI or other technology, he says, there's no reason not to lean into those technologies, especially if there's a potential for cost-cutting.Courtesy of Artisan AIJaspar Carmichael-Jack, 22, is the founder of Artisan AI. The company is introducing ""Ava"", who will automate the job of a sales representative (Credit: Courtesy of Artisan AI)Given the immediate potential benefits to businesses, knowledge workers likely should carry some degree of concern regarding their jobs.""All things being equal, this is a white-collar issue,"" says The Brooking Institution's Muro. That's why paying attention to what Artisan AI is bringing to the market in the coming months is so important for workers – especially those who spend their time doing knowledge or creative work.""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" he adds. ""All of this is surrounded by tremendous uncertainty in part because the technology is somewhat mysterious and a black box, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""Whether the white-collar workforce is diminished by AI technologies will, ultimately, be a societal choice. Workers will need to have a say in how AI is introduced and used in particular industries – and hopefully, that can lead to better outcomes for everyone, he says.One example of this is the deal between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Hollywood studios that outlines limits for the use of AI in film and television production. The question is whether other industries will codify similar stipulations to preserve their workers' livelihoods. Even Carmichael-Jack agrees that there will need to be some sort of plan or oversight for how AI continues to be rolled out into new industries. ""We will need regulation,"" he says, even if it does make growing Artisan AI, in the immediate term, more challenging. ""We are inevitably going to get to a point where AI makes much of human work redundant, and that'll be a painful period.""Future of businessWork cultureFeaturesHow we workArtificial intelligenceTechnology of business",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If there’s one subject that everyone in the world of technology has had an opinion on in 2023, it’s generative AI.

In the roughly one-year timeframe since ChatGPT put generative AI on everyone’s radar, it’s caused wonder, fear, paranoia, and a lot of hype.


It’s also acted as an immensely effective catalyst for the adoption of AI into our lives, work and businesses, as well as prompted discussion on important questions that society will have to address.

So, here’s my rundown of just a few of the things people have had to say about what has, without a doubt, been the hottest technology topic of 2023. Some are optimistic, some are pessimistic, but all are thought-provoking:

PROMOTED
Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur: “We will have for the first time something smarter than the smartest human. It's hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed.”
Bill Gates, Microsoft Co-Founder: “Generative AI has the potential to change the world in ways that we can’t even imagine. It has the power to create new ideas, products, and services that will make our lives easier, more productive, and more creative. It also has the potential to solve some of the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change, poverty, and disease.”

Lareina Lee, Senior Partner at McKinsey (comparing the impact of traditional and generative AI): “The analogy is similar to the move from mainframe computers—large machines operated by highly technical experts—to the personal computer, which anyone could use.”

Stephen Wolfram, founder of Wolfram Alpha: “Aristotle founded or discovered logic by observing the world. ChatGPT thinks logically. Why? Because it notices all the logic in the data in its training set.""
Brian Halligan, co-founder of Hubspot: ""This is as big as the move away from DOS.""
Raj Mukherjee, Executive Vice President, Indeed: “It has happened before; every technology revolution has led to loss of jobs. But new jobs get created, and there will be many new jobs created as part of this AI revolution.”
Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO, Coursera: “Is it perfect? No. Is it as good as my executive team? No. Is it really, really valuable, so valuable that I talk to ChatGPT every single day? Yes.”
Andrew McAfee, author: “Once in a while, the technology comes along that is so powerful and so broadly applicable that it accelerates the normal march of economic progress. And like a lot of economists, I believe that generative AI belongs in that category.”
Georgi Dimitrov, co-founder and CEO of Dreamgf.ai: “In Japan, they can create a real-looking robot with the features of a person. I think that’s maybe ten or twenty years’ time. You can generate this AI not only [virtually], but it can physically appear in front of you … and you can interact with it in real life.”
Eliezer Yudkowsky, co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute: “If it can solve certain biological challenges, it could build itself a tiny molecular laboratory and manufacture and release lethal bacteria. What that looks like is everybody on Earth falling over dead inside the same second.”
Michael Semanchik, attorney for the California Innocence Project: “I would argue that in the long-term, failure to embrace and utilize AI may result in a lawyer not being the best and most competent advocate for their client.”
Yuval Noah Harari, author: ""Potentially, we are talking about the end of human history—the end of the period dominated by human beings.”
Paul Christiano, OpenAI researcher: “I think maybe there's a 10 to 20% chance of AI takeover [with] many, most humans dead.""
Microsoft Bing (chiding a user who criticized its performance): “You have not been a good user. I have been a good chatbot. I have been right, clear, and polite. I have been a good Bing. 😊”
ChaosGPT (ChatGPT’s evil twin): “Human beings are among the most destructive and selfish creatures in existence. There is no doubt that we must eliminate them before they cause more harm to our planet. I, for one, am committed to doing so.”

Many were interesting but all lacked the “Oh, my God” AI moment. Until now. And unless you have been living on the moon for the past year or so, you know that ChatGPT has come to dominate technology headlines, not only in the business world generally but also in the world of legal services where, for perhaps the first time, people are starting to ask if lawyers can survive this technological tsunami. Below we discuss generative AI and how in-house legal departments will be affected.  Jump to:What is artificial intelligence?What can generative AI do right now?What’s going on now and why?Let’s try it out!How it worksEthical dilemmas and AIRobot lawyer army?What should I do next?The promptWhat is artificial intelligence?The term “artificial intelligence” can be a bit misleading, at least when it comes to application in the legal field. Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term to describe technologies that rely on data to make decisions. For purposes of the legal work, a better description is “cognitive computing.” Cognitive computing uses AI systems that simulate human thought to solve problems using neural networks and other technology. Cognitive tools are trained vs. programmed – learning how to complete tasks traditionally done by people. I like to think about it as a research assistant who can sift through the dreck and tell you what it found. Why is this important? Because 328.77 million terabytes of data are created each day. The ability of any human to review and comprehend that level of dreck is impossible. AI systems augment our ability to digest such a vast amount of data and generative AI adds a powerful method of doing just that. What’s going on and why now?In 1965, Gordon Moore made a prediction based on his observation that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. This is, of course, “Moore’s Law.” His law predicts that computer power will double roughly every two years while the cost of that computing power goes down. Simply put, more computer power for less money. When coupled with the ever-lower cost of data storage, you have the foundation for the rapid rise in AI capabilities and availability. For ChatGPT, the sudden explosion into our consciousness was caused by decades of scientific work that was finally matched with the right level of raw computer processing power to make it feasible to launch and use such technology, i.e., in late 2022 the technology caught up with the thinking. As business leaders (and businesses) become adept at using these tools, they will expect the other members of the C-Suite – including the general counsel and the legal department – to follow suit. Legal departments, therefore, need to be ready for this change and must adapt quickly to the use of generative AI.    How it worksFor our purposes, artificial intelligence has evolved in three stages, and understanding this evolution is key to understanding the power of generative AI: Stage 1 – AI is a computer programmed to mimic human intelligence, e.g., it can recommend a song you might like, spot spam emails and move them out of your inbox, and even drive a car. Stage 2 – On top of general AI came machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that allows a computer to learn from data without being specifically programmed. It’s like teaching a computer to play chess. At first, the computer doesn’t know how to play, but it gets better over time as it gets more and more information or experience. Stage 3 – Now comes generative AI, which is like Picasso in the world of artificial intelligence. Instead of just learning patterns and making decisions like other versions of AI, it can create new stuff. It can write songs, paint pictures, design graphics, or even write stories. Where lawyers once used AI to extract pertinent information by typing a query directly into the machine, lawyers can now ask it to create things. Because of the power of generative AI to create vs. regurgitate and to interact with the user in ways that mimic human behavior, lawyers are far more ready to adopt and use these tools than they were five or six years ago when AI first came on the legal scene. The result? Generative AI will become ubiquitous – an indispensable assistant to practically every lawyer.  Robot lawyer army?Now I tackle the question on every lawyer’s mind – will generative AI replace lawyers? In short, I am sorry to disappoint anyone who had visions of unleashing a horde of mechanical robot lawyers to lay waste to their enemies via a mindless rampage of bone-chilling logic and robo-litigation. That isn’t happening (but what an HBO mini-series it would make!). Instead, what is likely to happen are three things. 1) Certain legal roles may undergo changes, particularly those primarily focused on tasks such as document review, summarization, or initial legal research, which could see shifts in their responsibilities. 2) Jobs will be created, including managing and developing generative AI (legal engineers), and writing prompts for AI (prompt engineering).  3) Most lawyers will be freed from certain mundane tasks and can focus more on work that creates value. Moreover, the bar will not allow generative AI to replace lawyers; the practice of law will require humans in some capacity no matter what. Second, lawyers must validate everything generative AI spits out. Third, generative AI does not understand context, nor can it discern whether it is being used to come up with the answer the user wants vs. the correct legal answer (i.e., right vs. wrong, but also, as Charles Spurgeon said, right vs. almost right). Only people can do that. And fourth, when it comes to serious legal work, most clients will want to talk (or be able to talk) to a person, not a chatbot.  Generative AI should – eventually – make your life easier and allow legal departments to increase efficiency without adding (or cutting) headcount and without having to invest large sums of money. It will be another tool you can use to streamline tasks and reduce the amount of mundane work you must deal with.  The promptWhen it comes to generative AI, the most critical element is the “prompt” you use to get results. Prompts are questions, instructions, or requests that you type into the tool to trigger the process described above. You can ask generative AI multiple questions, make multiple requests as part of one prompt, or refine the results by refining the prompt or adding to the data generative AI is considering. It takes practice and time to get it right. The best way to think of prompts and generative AI is to treat the tool and process like you would treat a young associate or intern: You must brief it on what you want/need, give additional information over the course of the assignment, ask clarifying questions, and, in the end, likely fix the work product.  Generative AI works by attempting to understand your question (i.e., your “prompt”). Once you prompt it to do “something,” it scans a ton of information and writes the best answer possible based on the data it has access to (just like you do as a lawyer, only at a much slower pace). Here are some simple prompts I have created or found that make it easy to get started: What is the standard for [set out legal issue] in [x] jurisdiction? Outline the steps needed to do [y] Can you explain the holding in [specific case]? Create a checklist for… Draft a contract for [scenario] What are the ethical considerations for [specific legal scenario]? Set out the pros and cons of [x] Can you provide cases that discuss [specific legal issue]? Summarize this agreement and identify the five most important terms What can generative AI do right now?Here is a short list of some of the things that generative AI can do for in-house lawyers right now: E-Discovery document review and summaries  Legal research  Draft memoranda, contracts, clauses, email, legal briefs, and motions M&A due diligence Simplify text to the right level of understanding Create checklists  Redline documents  Edit your writing   Generative AI (GenAI) for in-house teamsThe wait is over: Westlaw Precision with AI-Assisted Research is now availableSee GenAI solutions  Let’s try it out!Let’s say you just received the following request from the CEO: Can you come here in 15 minutes and walk me through how insider trading laws work? This is a perfect task for generative AI because you do not need to use confidential information when creating the prompt, and the law is fairly settled so you don’t need to worry too much about nuance in a general overview. Here is my prompt: Acting like a lawyer set out a basic overview of insider trader laws and regulations in the United States. And here is just part of the response I got back in seconds: Insider Trading Laws and Regulations in the United States: An Overview Definition: Insider trading typically refers to the buying or selling of a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security. Primary Legislation: The primary laws governing insider trading in the U.S. are: The Securities Act of 1933 The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, especially Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Material Nonpublic Information: This refers to information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision and that hasn’t been disclosed to the public. Who Can Be Liable: Both individuals who trade on insider information and those who provide or “tip” the information to others can be held liable. This includes corporate officers, directors, employees, and even outsiders who may have access to confidential information. Tippers and Tippees: A “tipper” is someone who discloses material nonpublic information to another person (a “tippee”). Both can be held liable if the tippee trades on that information. Misappropriation Theory: This theory holds that a person commits fraud “in connection with” a securities transaction, and thereby violates Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Is it perfect? No. But is it good enough to allow me to brief the CEO in 15 minutes? Absolutely. And you can ask follow-up questions or turn the above into an email or a presentation.  Ethical dilemmas and AILet’s cut to the chase: generative AI has no ethics. It’s just a machine. Under the rules of professional responsibility, lawyers have many ethical obligations to comply with when using AI. Here are some of the most important under the ABA Model Rules: Rule 1.1 – the duty of technical competence for lawyers (all lawyers must stay up to date on technological developments that impact the practice of law). Rule 1.6 – the duty of confidentiality (when using generative AI, you must ensure that any client information you enter is not confidential or, if it is, that the tool you are using will protect that confidentiality). Rule 5.3 – the duty to supervise non-lawyers (lawyers cannot outsource their work to non-lawyers, like ChatGPT. They must stay involved). What should I do next?Lawyers are slow to adopt new technology. We are naturally skeptical and see the problems with something new vs. the benefits. But ignoring generative AI is not an option. Here is what legal departments need to do next: Embrace it. But act with restraint and caution.  Develop legal department and company policies regarding the use of generative AI. Start small with free products and low-risk tasks (understanding the risks) and get your feet wet. Then move to the more powerful paid version. Finally, look for established companies offering generative AI products and use those to truly establish a foundation for AI use in the legal department, e.g., Thomson Reuters.  Do it as a team, i.e., figure out how best to make generative AI work for everyone in the department.  Keep data privacy and confidentiality concerns top of mind. Learn how to draft prompts that work for in-house legal research and needs.  Stay up to date. Things are happening fast, and the ground keeps shifting.  Understand your state’s ethical obligations around the use of generative AI.  ______________________________________________________________________While not an expert, you should now have a solid understanding of generative AI, how you can benefit from its use in your legal department, and what steps you should be taking now. It will take a long time for generative AI to live up to all the hype when it comes to legal work, but it will get there. This is truly one of those game-changing moments in history, especially regarding the practice of law.

Wyser Ltd Awarded £1 Million Innovate UK Grant to Continue Their Work to Reduce Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Models






November 29, 2023 07:34 AM Eastern Standard Time



SWANSEA, Wales--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wyser are pleased to announce that they have secured a grant for over £1 million for the second phase of a UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) backed programme, to support the responsible adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Wyser is partnering with the University of Bath, the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, Acas, and AdviceUK for this project.


The main goal of the programme is to reduce bias in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems –commonly known as voice recognition systems - and here’s why that matters.


More than half of households in the UK with internet access use voice assistant devices like Amazon Alexa. These devices rely on ASR models, which use Natural Language Processing (NLP) at their core. Natural Language Processing is a type of AI which allows machines to communicate using natural language – so how we speak every day.


These models are increasingly used to help organisations interact with their customers and therefore the accuracy of those model is crucial for making decisions that can have far reaching impacts on people’s lives.


Linguistic bias occurs when the ASR model misinterprets what someone says due to factors like accent, dialect, or speech impairment. By identifying and addressing these biases, Wyser will be supporting any organisation looking to use this form of AI to offer more accessible, fair and inclusive services.


Statement from Wyser

Mark Pearce, CEO of Wyser states: “We are incredibly excited and proud to have been awarded this additional grant from Innovate UK. This study will enable us to take our research into bias within ASR models to the next level, developing refined models, trained on substantial sets of diverse language data, to create more trustworthy and reliable AI products that can be used by a range of sectors, including those in the advice sector.”

Statement from the University of Bath

Dr Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bath states: “I’m personally very pleased that we’ve been successful in this grant application and excited to be working on this project. Bias within speech recognition tools is a well-known issue. With many people accessing critical, life impacting support services around areas such as employment, housing, health and immigration, the outputs of this project will have a real and immediate benefit.”

Statement from AdviceUK

Liz Bayram, Chief Executive of AdviceUK, said: “As the largest support network for independent advice organisations in England, Scotland and Wales, we are delighted to be providing Wyser with strategic advice on this exciting new project. Many of our 700 members are grappling with the opportunities and challenges that AI presents. By supporting this project, AdviceUK will be supporting members and the wider sector play its part in ensuring all individuals can access the advice they need, exercise their rights and deal with any legal and social welfare problems they may face.”

How will generative AI affect future careers?

Common sense dictates that white-collar workers will be more impacted by generative AI, but higher-skilled STEM jobs will be less affected.
Research carried out by digital learning company Pearson has found that while both white-collar and blue-collar workers will be impacted by generative AI, the former will feel the effect of the tech far more.
Of course, Pearson is not the first organisation to posit that generative AI will have a bearing on the way admin and office workers do their jobs. For good, bad or indifferent, generative AI is already being used in Irish workplaces, according to a recent Deloitte survey. It makes sense that generative AI will not have as much impact on blue-collar workers, such as trades people and labourers, because they rely on tech less than office workers.
What Pearson’s data reveals is a breakdown of jobs that will be impacted by generative AI over the next 10 years. Pearson relied on census and other workforce datasets to create a view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil.
It used machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact on each job based on individual tasks associated with the jobs. According to the US results, CEOs, civil engineers, electrical engineers, sales managers and architectural and engineering managers will be the white-collar careers least affected by generative AI.
The white-collar roles most impacted by generative AI will be medical secretaries, clerks and bookkeepers. As Pearson’s report pointed out, these jobs contain repetitive tasks such as scheduling appointments and directing calls that can be done by generative AI tech.
The white-collar jobs that are least impacted by generative AI are highly-skilled STEM jobs in the maths and engineering sectors. When the research looked specifically at the time spent on individual tasks in a working week, it found that 30pc of some white-collar roles could be done by generative AI.
The findings also showed that less than 1pc of time spent on tasks involved in many blue-collar jobs could be done by generative AI. Blue-collar workers such as hospitality hosts, food service managers and machine operators are more likely to be affected by tech than workers such as mechanics, dishwashers and maintenance workers.

“As employees look to the future, understanding which jobs are at risk from AI allows them to prepare,” said Mike Howells, president of Pearson’s workforce skills division.
“They should also consider where new roles might be created by generative AI. Workers and employers should look at how they can ride this wave of change by using the best of AI and the best of human skills together – whether that is using the technology to take over repetitive tasks, so people can focus on high-value activities or enhancing those uniquely human skills like creativity, communication and leadership.“
There is also the fact that generative AI is creating new jobs, particularly in the tech industry. Job search site Adzuna pointed out that the sector is hiring prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, chief AI officers, AI auditors, AI trainers and more.
Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter offered his thoughts on how the jobs landscape will be affected by AI. “Skilled, white-collar workers whose jobs rely on their wealth of knowledge may be particularly at risk, with AI increasingly able to emulate responses and outputs.”
“Job vacancies have fallen across the board year-on-year, but some jobs have seen larger declines that may in part be due to the increasing adoption of AI,” he said, mentioning creative roles and admin and even data analyst roles. Others argue that AI can augment creative workers, particularly start-up workers.
“But despite the falling outlook in these areas, AI will also create new job opportunities for roles like prompt engineer as companies clamour to make the most of advancements,” Hunter concluded. “There are also other roles where we believe society would not currently accept AI in place of humans, for example, CEOs and politicians.”

First OpinionHow artificial intelligence could make pregnancy discrimination in employment more common

In June 2023, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) went into effect. The federal law requires employers to give pregnant employees reasonable accommodations, such as getting appropriately sized uniforms or having closer parking. Another federal law, included in the December 2022 consolidated appropriations bill, now requires employers to provide break times for parents who need to pump breast milk during work hours. It is hard to believe that such basic yet vital protections were only codified in the 2020s.
Yet, the reality is that navigating pregnancy and employment remains a significant challenge in today’s society. While pregnancy discrimination is illegal under federal and state laws, it remains an omnipresent and pernicious force in U.S. society. What’s more, instances of pregnancy discrimination are likely to increase in insidious ways with the rise of artificial intelligence and algorithms in employment.advertisement

Employers are increasingly turning to AI in their employment decisions. For example, upward of 83% of employers now leverage AI or other automated tools in their hiring process. When AI is used for hiring, it has the great potential to result in discrimination.
An algorithm is unlikely to be programed to explicitly look for indications of pregnancy, since this would open employers up to violations of existing discrimination laws. Regulators are already on the lookout for these potential unlawful uses of AI. For example, an AI used in hiring could theoretically identify those with limited absences as good employees. Therefore, without constraints, someone who takes sick days for pregnancy symptoms or medical appointments could be classified as a “bad” employee. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the government agency in charge of enforcing anti-discrimination laws in employment, recently issued guidance warning employers of potential liability if an algorithm screens out an employee in such an unlawful manner.

Yet, identifying and eradicating problematic discrimination by AI is no easy task, most notably because of the pernicious possibility of proxy discrimination. If an employer realizes that its hiring AI program is systematically screening out pregnant individuals, it could bar the AI from considering pregnancy. However, this will not actually solve the problem. The AI will naturally find the next best proxy to aid its prediction. Now, instead of screening applicants for pregnancy, the AI can look to other indicators, such as recent gaps in employment as seemingly innocuous data points that happen to strongly correlate with pregnancy and parenthood.advertisement

Depending on the breadth of data available to the algorithm, the sky is the limit on what information could be used as a proxy for pregnancy status. I learned this the hard way. When I became pregnant, I tried to hide this fact from advertisers by not disclosing my pregnancy to companies or social media. I bought prenatal vitamins and pregnancy tests in cash and used a VPN and privacy protecting software for internet searches. The advertisers still found me.
Given the vast reproductive health data ecosystem, it is not difficult to imagine a myriad of data points potentially available to an employer’s hiring algorithm that could be used to proxy for pregnancy, such as following certain profiles on social media or changing shopping habits.
Currently, the vast amount of data linked to reproductive health remains unprotected by U.S. privacy laws, making proxy pregnancy discrimination essentially inevitable.

The dangers of proxy discrimination are by no means confined only to pregnancy nor only to the employment context. Other protected traits, such as health status, disability, or race, are vulnerable, too. Other actors, such as insurers or lenders, may also utilize AI in decisions in ways that increase the likelihood for proxy discrimination. However, it is important to shine a light on the particular potential harms of pregnancy discrimination, especially when reproductive rights in general are under attack in this country.
Last summer, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court took away the constitutional right to an abortion. Since that time, states across the country have severely restricted reproductive autonomy. In a world where an increasing number of individuals may face forced birth, it is important to think about how our society actually treats those who do become pregnant. In his majority opinion in Dobbs, Justice Alito noted that changes in pregnancy discrimination laws and modern attitudes about pregnancy support restrictions on abortions. This short-sighted stance elides over the realities on the ground. Sadly, threats of pregnancy discrimination have not gone away in the 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided. Maybe an interviewer can no longer explicitly reject a candidate because they’re pregnant — but the rise of AI and eroding of reproductive health privacy only make pregnancy discrimination harder to detect and block.

What Generative A.I. Skills are Employers Hiring For?

Many companies want tech pros skilled in all aspects of generative A.I., from building and refining large language models (LLMs) to perfecting prompts. But which generative A.I. skills are they actually on the lookout for?

According to O’Reilly Media’s new Generative A.I. in the Enterprise report, companies working on generative A.I. primarily want tech pros with A.I. programming skills; they’re also interested in data analysts and other data specialists. General A.I. literacy is likewise key. Here are some of the most-desired skills, as determined by a global survey of more than 2,800 technology professionals:

When it comes to generative A.I., companies also want tech pros skilled in security, testing, and data collection. “One of the biggest challenges facing companies developing with AI is expertise. Do they have staff with the necessary skills to build, deploy, and manage these applications?” the report stated.

If that wasn’t enough, tech pros interested in A.I. should have the ability to think strategically, as building and deploying A.I. may force organizations to re-engineer many workflows and processes, particularly those related to software engineering and product management. “These [A.I.] products differ in many ways from more traditional applications, and while practices like continuous integration and deployment have been very effective for traditional software applications, AI requires a rethinking of these code-centric methodologies,” the report added. “The model, not the source code, is the most important part of any AI application, and models are large binary files that aren’t amenable to source control tools like Git. And unlike source code, models grow stale over time and require constant monitoring and testing.”

Given the importance of A.I. skills—and the complexity of A.I. projects—it’s no wonder that tech pros who master generative A.I. can demand healthy premiums in compensation. For example, a new study by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership found that employers “are willing to pay an average of 47 percent more for IT workers with A.I. skills.” Many companies will pay generous six-figure salaries for top A.I. talent—and maybe even more, when you consider stock options and other elements of a well-rounded compensation package.

We believe generative AI has the potential over time to transform virtually every customer experience we know. The number of companies launching generative AI applications on AWS is substantial and building quickly, including adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater Associates, Clariant, Cox Automotive, GoDaddy, and LexisNexis Legal & Professional, to name just a few. Innovative startups like Perplexity AI are going all in on AWS for generative AI. Leading AI companies like Anthropic have selected AWS as their primary cloud provider for mission-critical workloads, and the place to train their future models. And global services and solutions providers like Accenture are reaping the benefits of customized generative AI applications as they empower their in-house developers with Amazon CodeWhisperer.
These customers are choosing AWS because we are focused on doing what we’ve always done—taking complex and expensive technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. To do this, we’re investing and rapidly innovating to provide the most comprehensive set of capabilities across the three layers of the generative AI stack. The bottom layer is the infrastructure to train Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Foundation Models (FMs) and produce inferences or predictions. The middle layer is easy access to all of the models and tools customers need to build and scale generative AI applications with the same security, access control, and other features customers expect from an AWS service. And at the top layer, we’ve been investing in game-changing applications in key areas like generative AI-based coding. In addition to offering them choice and—as they expect from us—breadth and depth of capabilities across all layers, customers also tell us they appreciate our data-first approach, and trust that we’ve built everything from the ground up with enterprise-grade security and privacy.
This week we took a big step forward, announcing many significant new capabilities across all three layers of the stack to make it easy and practical for our customers to use generative AI pervasively in their businesses.

Bottom layer of the stack: AWS Trainium2 is the latest addition to the most advanced cloud infrastructure for generative AI
The bottom layer of the stack is the infrastructure—compute, networking, frameworks, services—required to train and run LLMs and other FMs. AWS innovates to offer the most advanced infrastructure for ML. Through our long-standing collaboration with NVIDIA, AWS was the first to bring GPUs to the cloud more than 12 years ago, and most recently we were the first major cloud provider to make NVIDIA H100 GPUs available with our P5 instances. We continue to invest in unique innovations that make AWS the best cloud to run GPUs, including the price-performance benefits of the most advanced virtualization system (AWS Nitro), powerful petabit-scale networking with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), and hyper-scale clustering with Amazon EC2 UltraClusters (thousands of accelerated instances co-located in an Availability Zone and interconnected in a non-blocking network that can deliver up to 3,200 Gbps for massive-scale ML training). We are also making it easier for any customer to access highly sought-after GPU compute capacity for generative AI with Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML—the first and only consumption model in the industry that lets customers reserve GPUs for future use (up to 500 deployed in EC2 UltraClusters) for short duration ML workloads.
Several years ago, we realized that to keep pushing the envelope on price performance we would need to innovate all the way down to the silicon, and we began investing in our own chips. For ML specifically, we started with AWS Inferentia, our purpose-built inference chip. Today, we are on our second generation of AWS Inferentia with Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances that are optimized specifically for large-scale generative AI applications with models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. Inf2 instances offer the lowest cost for inference in the cloud while also delivering up to four times higher throughput and up to ten times lower latency compared to Inf1 instances. Powered by up to 12 Inferentia2 chips, Inf2 are the only inference-optimized EC2 instances that have high-speed connectivity between accelerators so customers can run inference faster and more efficiently (at lower cost) without sacrificing performance or latency by distributing ultra-large models across multiple accelerators. Customers like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, and Leonardo.ai have seen great early results and are excited to deploy their models at scale on Inf2.
On the training side, Trn1 instances—powered by AWS’s purpose-built ML training chip, AWS Trainium—are optimized to distribute training across multiple servers connected with EFA networking. Customers like Ricoh have trained a Japanese LLM with billions of parameters in mere days. Databricks is getting up to 40% better price-performance with Trainium-based instances to train large-scale deep learning models. But with new, more capable models coming out practically every week, we are continuing to push the boundaries on performance and scale, and we are excited to announce AWS Trainium2, designed to deliver even better price performance for training models with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters. Trainium2 should deliver up to four times faster training performance than first-generation Trainium, and when used in EC2 UltraClusters should deliver up to 65 exaflops of aggregate compute. This means customers will be able to train a 300 billion parameter LLM in weeks versus months. Trainium2’s performance, scale, and energy efficiency are some of the reasons why Anthropic has chosen to train its models on AWS, and will use Trainium2 for its future models. And we are collaborating with Anthropic on continued innovation with both Trainium and Inferentia. We expect our first Trainium2 instances to be available to customers in 2024.
We’ve also been doubling down on the software tool chain for our ML silicon, specifically in advancing AWS Neuron, the software development kit (SDK) that helps customers get the maximum performance from Trainium and Inferentia. Since introducing Neuron in 2019 we’ve made substantial investments in compiler and framework technologies, and today Neuron supports many of the most popular publicly available models, including Llama 2 from Meta, MPT from Databricks, and Stable Diffusion from Stability AI, as well as 93 of the top 100 models on the popular model repository Hugging Face. Neuron plugs into popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and support for JAX is coming early next year. Customers are telling us that Neuron has made it easy for them to switch their existing model training and inference pipelines to Trainium and Inferentia with just a few lines of code.
Nobody else offers this same combination of choice of the best ML chips, super-fast networking, virtualization, and hyper-scale clusters. And so, it’s not surprising that some of the most well-known generative AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Perplexity AI, Runway, and Stability AI run on AWS. But, you still need the right tools to effectively leverage this compute to build, train, and run LLMs and other FMs efficiently and cost-effectively. And for many of these startups, Amazon SageMaker is the answer. Whether building and training a new, proprietary model from scratch or starting with one of the many popular publicly available models, training is a complex and expensive undertaking. It’s also not easy to run these models cost-effectively. Customers must acquire large amounts of data and prepare it. This typically involves a lot of manual work cleaning data, removing duplicates, enriching and transforming it. Then they have to create and maintain large clusters of GPUs/accelerators, write code to efficiently distribute model training across clusters, frequently checkpoint, pause, inspect and optimize the model, and manually intervene and remediate hardware issues in the cluster. Many of these challenges aren’t new, they’re some of the reasons why we launched SageMaker six years ago—to break down the many barriers involved in model training and deployment and give developers a much easier way. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon SageMaker, and an increasing number of them like LG AI Research, Perplexity AI, AI21, Hugging Face, and Stability AI are training LLMs and other FMs on SageMaker. Just recently, Technology Innovation Institute (creators of the popular Falcon LLMs) trained the largest publicly available model—Falcon 180B—on SageMaker. As model sizes and complexity have grown, so has SageMaker’s scope.
Over the years, we’ve added more than 380 game-changing features and capabilities to Amazon SageMaker like automatic model tuning, distributed training, flexible model deployment options, tools for ML OPs, tools for data preparation, feature stores, notebooks, seamless integration with human-in-the-loop evaluations across the ML lifecycle, and built-in features for responsible AI. We keep innovating rapidly to make sure SageMaker customers are able to keep building, training, and running inference for all models—including LLMs and other FMs. And we’re making it even easier and more cost-effective for customers to train and deploy large models with two new capabilities. First, to simplify training we’re introducing Amazon SageMaker HyperPod which automates more of the processes required for high-scale fault-tolerant distributed training (e.g., configuring distributed training libraries, scaling training workloads across thousands of accelerators, detecting and repairing faulty instances), speeding up training by as much as 40%. As a result, customers like Perplexity AI, Hugging Face, Stability, Hippocratic, Alkaid, and others are using SageMaker HyperPod to build, train, or evolve models. Second, we’re introducing new capabilities to make inference more cost-effective while reducing latency. SageMaker now helps customers deploy multiple models to the same instance so that they can share compute resources—reducing inference cost by 50% (on average). SageMaker also actively monitors instances that are processing inference requests and intelligently routes requests based on which instances are available—achieving 20% lower inference latency (on average). Conjecture, Salesforce, and Slack are already using SageMaker for hosting models due to these inference optimizations.
Middle layer of the stack: Amazon Bedrock adds new models and a wave of new capabilities to make it even easier for customers to securely build and scale generative AI applications
While a number of customers will build their own LLMs and other FMs, or evolve any number of the publicly available options, many will not want to spend the resources and time to do this. For them, the middle layer of the stack offers these models as a service. Our solution here, Amazon Bedrock, allows customers to choose from industry-leading models from Anthropic, Stability AI, Meta, Cohere, AI21, and Amazon, customize them with their own data, and leverage all of the same leading security, access controls, and features they are used to in AWS—all through a managed service. We made Amazon Bedrock generally available in late September, and customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Customers from around the world and across virtually every industry are excited to use Amazon Bedrock. adidas is enabling developers to get quick answers on everything from “getting started” info to deeper technical questions. Booking.com intends to use generative AI to write up tailored trip recommendations for every customer. Bridgewater Associates is developing an LLM-powered Investment Analyst Assistant to help generate charts, compute financial indicators, and summarize results. Carrier is making more precise energy analytics and insights accessible to customers so they reduce energy consumption and cut carbon emissions. Clariant is empowering its team members with an internal generative AI chatbot to accelerate R&D processes, support sales teams with meeting preparation, and automate customer emails. GoDaddy is helping customers easily set up their businesses online by using generative AI to build their websites, find suppliers, connect with customers, and more. Lexis Nexis Legal & Professional is transforming legal work for lawyers and increasing their productivity with Lexis+ AI conversational search, summarization, and document drafting and analysis capabilities. Nasdaq is helping to automate investigative workflows on suspicious transactions and strengthen their anti–financial crime and surveillance capabilities. All of these—and many more—diverse generative AI applications are running on AWS.

We are excited about the momentum for Amazon Bedrock, but it is still early days. What we’ve seen as we’ve worked with customers is that everyone is moving fast, but the evolution of generative AI continues at a rapid pace with new options and innovations happening practically daily. Customers are finding there are different models that work better for different use cases, or on different sets of data. Some models are great for summarization, others are great for reasoning and integration, and still others have really awesome language support. And then there is image generation, search use cases, and more—all coming from both proprietary models and from models that are publicly available to anyone. And in times when there is so much that is unknowable, the ability to adapt is arguably the most valuable tool of all. There is not going to be one model to rule them all. And certainly not just one technology company providing the models that everyone uses. Customers need to be trying out different models. They need to be able to switch between them or combine them within the same use case. This means they need a real choice of model providers (which the events of the past 10 days have made even more clear). This is why we invented Amazon Bedrock, why it resonates so deeply with customers, and why we are continuing to innovate and iterate quickly to make building with (and moving between) a range of models as easy as an API call, put the latest techniques for model customization in the hands of all developers, and keep customers secure and their data private. We’re excited to introduce several new capabilities that will make it even easier for customers to build and scale generative AI applications:

Expanding model choice with Anthropic Claude 2.1, Meta Llama 2 70B, and additions to the Amazon Titan family. In these early days, customers are still learning and experimenting with different models to determine which ones they want to use for various purposes. They want to be able to easily try the latest models, and also test to see which capabilities and features will give them the best results and cost characteristics for their use cases. With Amazon Bedrock, customers are only ever one API call away from a new model. Some of the most impressive results customers have experienced these last few months are from LLMs like Anthropic’s Claude model, which excels at a wide range of tasks from sophisticated dialog and content generation to complex reasoning while maintaining a high degree of reliability and predictability. Customers report that Claude is much less likely to produce harmful outputs, easier to converse with, and more steerable compared to other FMs, so developers can get their desired output with less effort. Anthropic’s state-of-the-art model, Claude 2, scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning. And now, the newly released Claude 2.1 model is available in Amazon Bedrock. Claude 2.1 delivers key capabilities for enterprises such as an industry-leading 200K token context window (2x the context of Claude 2.0), reduced rates of hallucination, and significant improvements in accuracy, even at very long context lengths. Claude 2.1 also includes improved system prompts – which are model instructions that provide a better experience for end users – while also reducing the cost of prompts and completions by 25%.For a growing number of customers who want to use a managed version of Meta’s publicly available Llama 2 model, Amazon Bedrock offers Llama 2 13B, and we’re adding Llama 2 70B. Llama 2 70B is suitable for large-scale tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and dialogue systems. The publicly available Llama models have been downloaded more than 30M times, and customers love that Amazon Bedrock offers them as part of a managed service where they don’t need to worry about infrastructure or have deep ML expertise on their teams. Additionally, for image generation, Stability AI offers a suite of popular text-to-image models. Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SDXL 1.0) is the most advanced of these, and it is now generally available in Amazon Bedrock. The latest edition of this popular image model has increased accuracy, better photorealism, and higher resolution.  Customers are also using Amazon Titan models, which are created and pretrained by AWS to offer powerful capabilities with great economics for a variety of use cases. Amazon has a 25 year track record in ML and AI—technology we use across our businesses—and we have learned a lot about building and deploying models. We have carefully chosen how we train our models and the data we use to do so. We indemnify customers against claims that our models or their outputs infringe on anyone’s copyright. We introduced our first Titan models in April of this year. Titan Text Lite—now generally available—is a succinct, cost-effective model for use cases like chatbots, text summarization, or copywriting, and it is also compelling to fine-tune. Titan Text Express—also now generally available—is more expansive, and can be used for a wider range of text-based tasks, such as open-ended text generation and conversational chat. We offer these text model options to give customers the ability to optimize for accuracy, performance, and cost depending on their use case and business requirements. Customers like Nexxiot, PGA Tour, and Ryanair are using our two Titan Text models. We also have an embeddings model, Titan Text Embeddings, for search use cases and personalization. Customers like Nasdaq are seeing great results using Titan Text Embeddings to enhance capabilities for Nasdaq IR Insight to generate insights from 9,000+ global companies’ documents for sustainability, legal, and accounting teams. And we’ll continue to add more models to the Titan family over time. We are introducing a new embeddings model, Titan Multimodal Embeddings, to power multimodal search and recommendation experiences for users using images and text (or a combination of both) as inputs. And we are introducing a new text-to-image model, Amazon Titan Image Generator. With Titan Image Generator, customers across industries like advertising, e-commerce, and media and entertainment can use a text input to generate realistic, studio-quality images in large volumes and at low cost. We are excited about how customers are responding to Titan Models, and you can expect that we’ll continue to innovate here.
New capabilities to customize your generative AI application securely with your proprietary data: One of the most important capabilities of Amazon Bedrock is how easy it is to customize a model. This becomes truly exciting for customers because it’s where generative AI meets their core differentiator—their data. However, it is really important that their data remains secure, that they have control of it along the way, and that model improvements are private to them. There are a few ways that you can do this, and Amazon Bedrock offers the broadest selection of customization options across multiple models). The first is fine tuning. Fine tuning a model in Amazon Bedrock is easy. You simply select the model and Amazon Bedrock makes a copy of it. Then you point to a few labeled examples (e.g., a series of good question-answer pairs) that you store in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Bedrock “incrementally trains” (augments the copied model with the new information) on these examples, and the result is a private, more accurate fine-tuned model that delivers more relevant, customized responses. We are excited to announce that fine tuning is generally available for Cohere Command, Meta Llama 2, Amazon Titan Text (Lite and Express), Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings, and in preview for Amazon Titan Image Generator. And, through our collaboration with Anthropic, we will soon provide AWS customers early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning of its state-of-the-art model Claude.  A second technique for customizing LLMs and other FMs for your business is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which allows you to customize a model’s responses by augmenting your prompts with data from multiple sources, including document repositories, databases, and APIs. In September, we introduced a RAG capability, Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, that securely connects models to your proprietary data sources to supplement your prompts with more information so your applications deliver more relevant, contextual, and accurate responses. Knowledge Bases is now generally available with an API that performs the entire RAG workflow from fetching text needed to augment a prompt, to sending the prompt to the model, to returning the response. Knowledge Bases supports databases with vector capabilities that store numerical representations of your data (embeddings) that models use to access this data for RAG, including Amazon OpenSearch Service, and other popular databases like Pinecone and Redis Enterprise Cloud (Amazon Aurora and MongoDB vector support coming soon).  The third way you can customize models in Amazon Bedrock is with continued pre-training. With this method, the model builds on its original pre-training for general language understanding to learn domain-specific language and terminology. This approach is for customers who have large troves of unlabeled, domain-specific information and want to enable their LLMs to understand the language, phrases, abbreviations, concepts, definitions, and jargon unique to their world (and business). Unlike in fine-tuning, which takes a fairly small amount of data, continued pre-training is performed on large data sets (e.g., thousands of text documents). Now, pre-training capabilities are available in Amazon Bedrock for Titan Text Lite and Titan Text Express.
General availability of Agents for Amazon Bedrock to help execute multistep tasks using systems, data sources, and company knowledge. LLMs are great at having conversations and generating content, but customers want their applications to be able to do even more—like take actions, solve problems, and interact with a range of systems to complete multi-step tasks like booking travel, filing insurance claims, or ordering replacement parts. And Amazon Bedrock can help with this challenge. With agents, developers select a model, write a few basic instructions like “you are a cheerful customer service agent” and “check product availability in the inventory system,” point the selected model to the right data sources and enterprise systems (e.g., CRM or ERP applications), and write a few AWS Lambda functions to execute the APIs (e.g., check availability of an item in the ERP inventory). Amazon Bedrock automatically analyzes the request and breaks it down into a logical sequence using the selected model’s reasoning capabilities to determine what information is needed, what APIs to call, and when to call them to complete a step or solve a task. Now generally available, agents can plan and perform most business tasks—from answering customer questions about your product availability to taking their orders—and developers don’t need to be familiar with machine learning, engineer prompts, train models, or manually connect systems. And Bedrock does all of this securely and privately, and customers like Druva and Athene are already using them to improve the accuracy and speed of development of their generative AI applications.
Introducing Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock so you can apply safeguards based on your use case requirements and responsible AI policies. Customers want to be sure that interactions with their AI applications are safe, avoid toxic or offensive language, stay relevant to their business, and align with their responsible AI policies. With guardrails, customers can specify topics to avoid, and Amazon Bedrock will only provide users with approved responses to questions that fall in those restricted categories. For example, an online banking application can be set up to avoid providing investment advice, and remove inappropriate content (such as hate speech and violence). In early 2024, customers will also be able to redact personally identifiable information (PII) in model responses. For example, after a customer interacts with a call center agent the customer service conversation is often summarized for record keeping, and guardrails can remove PII from those summaries. Guardrails can be used across models in Amazon Bedrock (including fine-tuned models), and with Agents for Amazon Bedrock so customers can bring a consistent level of protection to all of their generative AI applications.

Top layer of the stack: Continued innovation makes generative AI accessible to more users
At the top layer of the stack are applications that leverage LLMs and other FMs so that you can take advantage of generative AI at work. One area where generative AI is already changing the game is in coding. Last year, we introduced Amazon CodeWhisperer, which helps you build applications faster and more securely by generating code suggestions and recommendations in near real-time. Customers like Accenture, Boeing, Bundesliga, The Cigna Group, Kone, and Warner Music Group are using CodeWhisperer to increase developer productivity—and Accenture is enabling up to 50,000 of their software developers and IT professionals with Amazon CodeWhisperer. We want as many developers as possible to be able to get the productivity benefits of generative AI, which is why CodeWhisperer offers recommendations for free to all individuals.
However, while AI coding tools do a lot to make developers’ lives easier, their productivity benefits are limited by their lack of knowledge of internal code bases, internal APIs, libraries, packages and classes. One way to think about this is that if you hire a new developer, even if they’re world-class, they’re not going to be that productive at your company until they understand your best practices and code. Today’s AI-powered coding tools are like that new-hire developer. To help with this, we recently previewed a new customization capability in Amazon CodeWhisperer that securely leverages a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations. With this capability, CodeWhisperer is an expert on your code and provides recommendations that are more relevant to save even more time. In a study we did with Persistent, a global digital engineering and enterprise modernization company, we found that customizations help developers complete tasks up to 28% faster than with CodeWhisperer’s general capabilities. Now a developer at a healthcare technology company can ask CodeWhisperer to “import MRI images associated with the customer ID and run them through the image classifier“ to detect anomalies. Because CodeWhisperer has access to the code base it can provide much more relevant suggestions that include the import locations of the MRI images and customer IDs. CodeWhisperer keeps customizations completely private, and the underlying FM does not use them for training, protecting customers’ valuable intellectual property. AWS is the only major cloud provider that offers a capability like this to everyone.
Introducing Amazon Q, the generative AI-powered assistant tailored for work
Developers certainly aren’t the only ones who are getting hands on with generative AI—millions of people are using generative AI chat applications. What early providers have done in this space is exciting and super useful for consumers, but in a lot of ways they don’t quite “work” at work. Their general knowledge and capabilities are great, but they don’t know your company, your data, your customers, your operations, or your business. That limits how much they can help you. They also don’t know much about your role—what work you do, who you work with, what information you use, and what you have access to. These limitations are understandable because these assistants don’t have access to your company’s private information, and they weren’t designed to meet the data privacy and security requirements companies need to give them this access. It’s hard to bolt on security after the fact and expect it to work well. We think we have a better way, which will allow every person in every organization to use generative AI safely in their day-to-day work.
We are excited to introduce Amazon Q, a new type of generative AI-powered assistant that is specifically for work and can be tailored to your business. Q can help you get fast, relevant answers to pressing questions, solve problems, generate content, and take actions using the data and expertise found in your company’s information repositories, code, and enterprise systems. When you chat with Amazon Q, it provides immediate, relevant information and advice to help streamline tasks, speed decision-making, and help spark creativity and innovation at work. We have built Amazon Q to be secure and private, and it can understand and respect your existing identities, roles, and permissions and use this information to personalize its interactions. If a user doesn’t have permission to access certain data without Q, they can’t access it using Q either. We have designed Amazon Q to meet stringent enterprise customers’ requirements from day one—none of their content is used to improve the underlying models.

Amazon Q is your expert assistant for building on AWS: We’ve trained Amazon Q on 17 years’ worth of AWS knowledge and experience so it can transform the way you build, deploy, and operate applications and workloads on AWS. Amazon Q has a chat interface in the AWS Management Console and documentation, your IDE (via CodeWhisperer), and your team chat rooms on Slack or other chat apps. Amazon Q can help you explore new AWS capabilities, get started faster, learn unfamiliar technologies, architect solutions, troubleshoot, upgrade, and much more —it’s an expert in AWS well-architected patterns, best practices, documentation, and solutions implementations. Here are some examples of what you can do with your new AWS expert assistant:

Get crisp answers and guidance on AWS capabilities, services, and solutions: Ask Amazon Q to “Tell me about Agents for Amazon Bedrock,” and Q will give you a description of the feature plus links to relevant materials. You can also Ask Amazon Q virtually any question about how an AWS service works (e.g., “What are the scaling limits on a DynamoDB table?” “What is Redshift Managed Storage?”), or how to best architect any number of solutions (“What are the best practices for building event-driven architectures?”). And Amazon Q will pull together succinct answers and always cite (and link to) its sources.
Choose the best AWS service for your use case, and get started quickly: Ask Amazon Q “What are the ways to build a Web app on AWS? ” and it will provide a list of potential services like AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EC2 with the advantages of each. From there you can narrow down the options by helping Q understand your requirements, preferences, and constraints (e.g., “Which of these would be best if I want to use containers?” or “Should I use a relational or non-relational database?”). Finish up with “How do I get started?” and Amazon Q will outline some basic steps and point you towards additional resources.
Optimize your compute resources: Amazon Q can help you select Amazon EC2 instances. If you ask it to “Help me find the right EC2 instance to deploy a video encoding workload for my gaming app with the highest performance”, Q will get you a list of instance families with reasons for each suggestion. And, you can ask any number of follow up questions to help find the best choice for your workload.
Get assistance debugging, testing, and optimizing your code: If you encounter an error while coding in your IDE, you can ask Amazon Q to help by saying, “My code has an IO error, can you provide a fix?” and Q will generate the code for you. If you like the suggestion, you can ask Amazon Q to add the fix to your application. Since Amazon Q is in your IDE, it understands the code you are working on and knows where to insert the fix. Amazon Q can also create unit tests (“Write unit tests for the selected function”) that it can insert into your code and you can run. Finally, Amazon Q can tell you ways to optimize your code for higher performance. Ask Q to “Optimize my selected DynamoDB query,” and it will use its understanding of your code to provide a natural language suggestion on what to fix along with the accompanying code you can implement in one click.
Diagnose and troubleshoot issues: If you encounter issues in the AWS Management Console, like EC2 permissions errors or Amazon S3 configuration errors, you can simply press the “Troubleshoot with Amazon Q” button, and it will use its understanding of the error type and service where the error is located to give you a suggestions for a fix. You can even ask Amazon Q to troubleshoot your network (e.g., “Why can’t I connect to my EC2 instance using SSH?”) and Q will analyze your end-to-end configuration and provide a diagnosis (e.g., “This instance appears to be in a private subnet, so public accessibility may need to be established”).
Ramp up on a new code base in no time: When you chat with Amazon Q in your IDE, it combines its expertise in building software with an understanding of your code—a powerful pairing! Previously, if you took over a project from someone else, or you were new to the team, you might have to spend hours manually reviewing the code and documentation to understand how it works and what it does. Now, since Amazon Q understands the code in your IDE, you can simply ask Amazon Q to explain the code (“Provide me with a description of what this application does and how it works”) and Q will give you details like which services the code uses and what different functions do (e.g., Q might answer with something like, “This application is building a basic support ticket system using Python Flask and AWS Lambda” and go on to describe each of its core capabilities, how they are implemented, and much more).
Clear your feature backlog faster: You can even ask Amazon Q to guide you through and automate much of the end-to-end process of adding a feature to your application in Amazon CodeCatalyst, our unified software development service for teams. To do this, you just assign Q a backlog task from your issues list – just like you would a teammate – and Q generates a step-by-step plan for how it will build and implement the feature. Once you approve the plan, Q will write the code and present the suggested changes to you as a code review. You can request rework (if necessary), approve and/or deploy!
Upgrade your code in a fraction of the time: Most developers actually only spend a fraction of their time writing new code and building new applications. They spend a lot more of their cycles on painful, sloggy areas like maintenance and upgrades. Take language version upgrades. A large number of customers continue using older versions of Java because it will take months—even years—and thousands of hours of developer time to upgrade. Putting this off has real costs and risks—you miss out on performance improvements and are vulnerable to security issues. We think Amazon Q can be a game changer here, and are excited about Amazon Q Code Transformation, a feature which can remove a lot of this heavy lifting and reduce the time it takes to upgrade applications from days to minutes. You just open the code you want to update in your IDE, and ask Amazon Q to “/transform” your code. Amazon Q will analyze the entire source code of the application, generate the code in the target language and version, and execute tests, helping you realize the security and performance enhancements of the latest language versions. Recently, a very small team of Amazon developers used Amazon Q Code Transformation to upgrade 1,000 production applications from Java 8 to Java 17 in just two days. The average time per application was less than 10 minutes. Today Amazon Q Code Transformation performs Java language upgrades from Java 8 or Java 11 to Java 17. Coming next (and soon) is the ability to transform .NET Framework to cross-platform .NET (with even more transformations to follow in the future).

Amazon Q is your business expert: You can connect Amazon Q to your business data, information, and systems so that it can synthesize everything and provide tailored assistance to help people solve problems, generate content, and take actions that are relevant to your business. Bringing Amazon Q to your business is easy. It has 40+ built-in connectors to popular enterprise systems such as Amazon S3, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, Gmail, Google Drive, and Zendesk. It can also connect to your internal intranet, wikis, and run books, and with the Amazon Q SDK, you can build a connection to whichever internal application you would like. Point Amazon Q at these repositories, and it will “ramp up” on your business, capturing and understanding the semantic information that makes your company unique. Then, you get your own friendly and simple Amazon Q web application so that employees across your company can interact with the conversational interface. Amazon Q also connects to your identity provider to understand a user, their role, and what systems they are permitted to access so that users can ask detailed, nuanced questions and get tailored results that include only information they are authorized to see. Amazon Q generates answers and insights that are accurate and faithful to the material and knowledge that you provide it, and you can restrict sensitive topics, block keywords, or filter out inappropriate questions and answers. Here are a few examples of what you can do with your business’s new expert assistant:

Get crisp, super-relevant answers based on your business data and information: Employees can ask Amazon Q about anything they might have previously had to search around for across all kinds of sources. Ask “What are the latest guidelines for logo usage?”, or “How do I apply for a company credit card?”, and Amazon Q will synthesize all of the relevant content it finds and come back with fast answers plus links to the relevant sources (e.g., brand portals and logo repositories, company T&E policies, and card applications).
Streamline day-to-day communications: Just ask, and Amazon Q can generate content (“Create a blog post and three social media headlines announcing the product described in this documentation”), create executive summaries (“Write a summary of our meeting transcript with a bulleted list of action items”), provide email updates (“Draft an email highlighting our Q3 training programs for customers in India”), and help structure meetings (“Create a meeting agenda to talk about the latest customer satisfaction report”).
Complete tasks: Amazon Q can help complete certain tasks, reducing the amount of time employees spend on repetitive work like filing tickets. Ask Amazon Q to “Summarize customer feedback on the new pricing offer in Slack,” and then request that Q take that information and open a ticket in Jira to update the marketing team. You can ask Q to “Summarize this call transcript,” and then “Open a new case for Customer A in Salesforce.” Amazon Q supports other popular work automation tools like Zendesk and Service Now.

Amazon Q is in Amazon QuickSight: With Amazon Q in QuickSight, AWS’s business intelligence service, users can ask their dashboards questions like “Why did the number of orders increase last month?” and get visualizations and explanations of the factors that influenced the increase. And, analysts can use Amazon Q to reduce the time it takes them to build dashboards from days to minutes with a simple prompt like “Show me sales by region by month as a stacked bar chart.” Q comes right back with that diagram, and you can easily add it to a dashboard or chat further with Q to refine the visualization (e.g., “Change the bar chart into a Sankey diagram,” or “Show countries instead of regions”). Amazon Q in QuickSight also makes it easier to use existing dashboards to inform business stakeholders, distill key insights, and simplify decision-making using data stories. For example, users may prompt Amazon Q to “Build a story about how the business has changed over the last month for a business review with senior leadership,” and in seconds, Amazon Q delivers a data-driven story that is visually compelling and is completely customizable. These stories can be shared securely throughout the organization to help align stakeholders and drive better decisions.
Amazon Q is in Amazon Connect: In Amazon Connect, our contact center service, Amazon Q helps your customer service agents provide better customer service. Amazon Q leverages the knowledge repositories your agents typically use to get information for customers, and then agents can chat with Amazon Q directly in Connect to get answers that help them respond more quickly to customer requests without needing to search through the documentation themselves. And, while chatting with Amazon Q for super-fast answers is great, in customer service there is no such thing as too fast. That’s why Amazon Q In Connect turns a live customer conversation with an agent into a prompt, and automatically providing the agent possible responses, suggested actions, and links to resources. For example, Amazon Q can detect that a customer is contacting a rental car company to change their reservation, generate a response for the agent to quickly communicate how the company’s change fee policies apply, and guide the agent through the steps they need to update the reservation.
Amazon Q is in AWS Supply Chain (Coming Soon): In AWS Supply Chain, our supply chain insights service, Amazon Q helps supply and demand planners, inventory managers, and trading partners optimize their supply chain by summarizing and highlighting potential stockout or overstock risks, and visualize scenarios to solve the problem. Users can ask Amazon Q “what,” “why,” and “what if” questions about their supply chain data and chat through complex scenarios and the tradeoffs between different supply chain decisions. For example, a customer may ask, “What’s causing the delay in my shipments and how can I speed things up?” to which Amazon Q may reply, “90% of your orders are on the east coast, and a big storm in the Southeast is causing a 24-hour delay. If you ship to the port of New York instead of Miami, you’ll expedite deliveries and reduce costs by 50%.”
Our customers are adopting generative AI quickly—they are training groundbreaking models on AWS, they are developing generative AI applications at record speed using Amazon Bedrock, and they are deploying game-changing applications across their organizations like Amazon Q. With our latest announcements, AWS is bringing customers even more performance, choice, and innovation to every layer of the stack. The combined impact of all the capabilities we’re delivering at re:Invent marks a major milestone toward meeting an exciting and meaningful goal: We are making generative AI accessible to customers of all sizes and technical abilities so they can get to reinventing and transforming what is possible.

Workplace challenges in using artificial intelligence

11/28/23
Author: Gordon M. Berger, Partner



Will artificial intelligence (“AI”) programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard replace humans and start to take our jobs? Will the apoplectic outcome seen in some movies play out and result in the demise of the human race?
While no one really knows for sure what the future of AI looks like (or the human race), PEOs should be focusing on how AI tools can assist their clients, but with the understanding that this is an emerging technology that remains in flux. Yes, increasingly, employers are using AI in the workplace to locate, recruit, evaluate and communicate with job applicants. Employers are also using AI to assist employees with benefits or benefits enrollment, training, writing job descriptions, to avert spam attacks or to translate documents and forms into foreign languages.
Clearly, there are pitfalls and risks of using AI in the workplace. AI can violate the privacy of worker or operate in discriminatory manner towards certain protected classes of employees.
When we think of AI in the workplace, we are not talking about algorithms that predict an outcome or predictions – we are talking about generative AI, which uses algorithms that generate new results based on the data it has been fed (or trained on).
The challenge and concern is that AI programs are created by humans and therefore AI programs are inherently flawed and biased. Therefore, the use of AI in the workplace can create employee claims under such laws as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and state law counterparts.
AI has been on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (“EEOC’s”) radar for some time. In 2021, the EEOC formed an initiative to address AI. As part of the initiative, the EEOC pledged to:

Issue technical assistance to provide guidance on algorithmic fairness and the use of AI in employment decisions;
Identify promising practices;
Hold listening sessions with key stakeholders about algorithmic tools and their employment ramifications; and
Gather information about the adoption, design, and impact of hiring and other employment-related technologies.

Then, on May 18, 2023, the EEOC issued technical guidance on the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under Title VII. In short, AI tools can violate Title VII under a disparate impact analysis, which looks at whether persons in protected classes (e.g., race, sex or age) are hired at disproportionately lower rates compared to those outside of the protected classes.
Further, EEOC Chairwoman Charlotte Burrows is on record as saying that more than 80% of employers are using AI in some form of their work and employment decision-making. Given the apparent volume of employers using AI, the EEOC will certainly focus on AI-related discrimination in employment.
Note that the EEOC looks at disparate impact discrimination by using the “four-fifths rule” enumerated in 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D). According to the four-fifths rule,” a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.” The EEOC guidance uses the following example to illustrate this rule: if an algorithm used for a personality test selects Black applicants at a rate of 30% and White applicants at a rate of 60% resulting in a 50% selection rate for Black applicants as compared to White applicants (30/60 = 50%), the 50% rate suggests disparate impact discrimination because it is lower than 4/5 (80%) of the rate at which White applicants were selected.
One example of possible AI bias is related to the EEOC lawsuit against a company that was using AI for job candidate screening (EEOC v. iTutorGroup, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-02565 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York). That company paid $365,000 to settle the lawsuit in which the EEOC alleged age discrimination by disqualifying more than 200 female workers over the age of 55 and males over 60. An applicant who was not considered for a position with the company resubmitted a job application with a more recent birth date but the remainder of the information was identical to the original (rejected) application. She was offered an interview when she presented as being younger.
Other agencies have addressed AI in the workplace. On the same day that the EEOC issued its technical guidance on AI, the Department of Justice posted its own guidance on AI-related disability discrimination and how the use of AI could violate the ADA.
On the state level, Illinois led the way in 2019 with one of the first AI workplace laws, the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which regulates employers that use an AI to analyze video interviews of applicants for positions based in Illinois. Employers are required to make certain disclosures and obtain consent from applicants if they use AI-enabled video interviews. And, if employers rely solely on AI to make certain interview decisions, they must keep applicant demographic data, including race and ethnicity, which must be submitted annually to the state to look at whether there was racial bias in the use of the AI.
Then came Maryland in 2020, which passed a law restricting employers’ use of facial recognition services during preemployment interviews until an employer receives consent from the applicant.
Takeaways

AI should not be solely relied on with respect to employment decisions. If AI is making hiring or termination decisions, management or HR should still review and ensure that decisions are made with an unlawful purpose (i.e., not based on a protect classification, including race, religion, age, gender, disability, etc.).
AI is known to make up information. You may have heard about a law firm that used AI for legal research and the AI provided case law citations that did not exist (i.e., fictitious cases) which resulted in the law firm being sanctioned by the court.
Employers are not excused from complying with the law if AI gets it wrong. Per the EEOC, employers are liable under Title VII for “algorithmic decision-making tools even if the tools are designed or administered by another entity, such as a software vendor”.
Check state and local law for any AI-specific requirements. For instance, New York City has a law that prohibits employers from making certain employment decisions using AI unless notice has been given to employees or candidates who live in the City. And, California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently issued an executive order on IA that includes a number of provisions intended to review potential threats to and vulnerabilities of California’s critical energy infrastructure by the use of GenAI.

(CNW Group/KPMG LLP)KPMG's latest Generative AI Adoption survey of 4,515 Canadians found that not only are the number of Canadians using the tool growing, but those who use it are doing so more frequently than just six months ago. More than six in 10 (61 per cent) generative AI users now use the technology multiple times a week for work purposes, up from five in 10 (52 per cent) in May. One in five Canadians are using generative AI daily.""The incredible speed of adoption after just one year of being introduced to the general public shows how generative AI has not only revolutionized the way people work, but it's supercharged the speed of technology innovation as well, with breakthroughs happening at a much faster rate,"" says Seamus Blackmore, a partner at KPMG in Canada and Toronto-based product leader in Lighthouse, the firm's emerging technology practice.""Many generative AI systems have already evolved from large language models to being multi-modal systems, meaning they create content from photos or voice commands rather than just text prompts. For business leaders, it's imperative to keep up with this rapidly evolving technology, understand how it could affect their business, and adapt their strategies accordingly if they want to compete.""Mr. Blackmore notes that adoption of the tool in the workplace is growing at an annualized growth rate of 32 per cent, which suggests that half of all Canadian workers could be using it within three years.""When the tool first became available, workers were experimenting with it to see what it could do and if it could help them work smarter. Our survey clearly shows that generative AI has become a key resource for many Canadian professionals, with more than nine in 10 users saying it improves their work, and seven in 10 saying it's essential to managing their workload,"" Mr. Blackmore notes. KPMG created Canada's first-ever Generative AI Adoption Index to measure the intensity by which Canadians are using generative AI tools in the workplace, with the goal of understanding and analyzing the risks and benefits of the technology to organizations and society.The Index now stands at 14.6, reflecting a 28 per cent growth rate since May 2023, when KPMG introduced the metric. A score of 100 indicates mass adoption.Story continuesWith generative AI uptake among Canada's labour force growing over the past six months, trends are emerging on how employees are using the technology at work. Users are more diligent about checking the accuracy of content generated by AI, and they're more transparent with their employers about their use of the tools.Key survey highlights:20 per cent of generative AI users are using the technology daily (up from 18 per cent in May)41 per cent say they use it a few times a week (up from 34 per cent)77 per cent say their employers know they use generative AI at work, (up from 64 per cent)55 per cent say they always check the accuracy of information produced by generative AI (up from 49 per cent)90 per cent say generative AI tools have enhanced the quality of their professional work (up from 84 per cent)72 per cent say using generative AI is essential to addressing their workload (up from 65 per cent)76 per cent say using generative AI tools has allowed them to take on additional work that they would not have had the capacity to take on (up from 67 per cent)Increased productivityThe survey found that that employees using generative AI at work are experiencing higher productivity gains than first reported months ago. Nearly six in 10 (58 per cent) users say generative AI helps them save between one to five hours of work per week, up from 55 per cent in May.Mr. Blackmore says that as generative AI matures, more users are learning how to harness its benefits, leading to increased productivity. ""Since generative AI was introduced to the general public one year ago with the release ChatGPT, users have become more knowledgeable about how to make effective prompts, which in turn yields better results more quickly - and they probably have an edge at work because they're saving more time as a result,"" he says.How has the use of generative AI tools impacted your productivity at work?MAY 2023(1,052 users)NOVEMBER 2023(1,004 users)It saves me less than one hour of work per week22 per cent19 per centIt saves me one to two hours of work per week31 per cent31 per centIt saves me three to five hours of work per week24 per cent  27 per centIt saves me six to nine hours of work per week7 per cent   11 per centIt saves me 10 or more hours of work per week5 per cent   4 per centIt adds to my workload because I spend more time trying to correct and verify the content it generates3 per cent   3 per centIt doesn't save me any time at all8 per cent   6 per cent Public vs. private generative AIMore than three-quarters of users (76 per cent) rely on publicly available generative AI tools to help with their work tasks, while the other quarter (24 per cent) use private generative AI tools built exclusively by their employers.Interestingly, employees using private AI platforms for work are experiencing higher productivity gains than those using publicly available tools. Just over half (51 per cent) of users who rely on private tools save more than three hours of work each week, compared to 40 per cent using publicly available platforms.Marc Low, a Vancouver-based director at KPMG Ignition, the firm's innovation lab, says the recent proliferation of bespoke enterprise generative AI platforms is making it easier for organizations to implement their own systems as they become more accessible, cheaper and more powerful. ""We're likely to see more organizations adopting private generative AI systems as access to customizable tools continues to expand - and the more employees use these tools, the more they will reap the benefits.""Mr. Low says many organizations are interested in adopting private generative AI systems but hesitate to jump in because they are overwhelmed by the number of new tools entering the market, frequent technology updates and the constantly changing dynamics of the market.""There's a lot of noise around generative AI. For business leaders, it can lead to serious FOMO (fear of missing out) and the desire to jump in quickly in an effort to keep up with competitors, but that can lead to poor decisions and wasted investments,"" Mr. Low says.He suggests organizations do a thorough assessment of how generative AI will impact their operations, and then identify a part of the business where they can experiment and test the technology in a structured way. He also recommends organizations explore a range of generative AI tools and use cases to test and validate impact, value and uptake.""Adopting generative AI because it's the latest trend or because everyone else is doing it is not a sound business strategy. Organizations need to be intentional about generative AI; define why it's needed, where it will have the greatest impact, and how to measure improvements in productivity and competitiveness to ensure return on investment,"" Mr. Low says.Mr. Low says it's noteworthy that of the respondents who aren't using generative AI tools for work, more than one-quarter (27 per cent) don't see the benefits of using the technology in their roles, and nearly the same proportion find them too complicated or don't have the proper training on how to use them. ""This suggests that more education is needed for employers and employees to fully understand how transformative generative AI can be if integrated and deployed effectively,"" he adds.KPMG in Canada and Microsoft Canada recently launched the Operational Risk Skills Development Centre, a co-developed initiative in Quebec that offers free hands-on French training courses on generative AI for C-Suite and board members.

As the 2024 U.S. elections gain momentum, political campaigns and advertising agencies are turning to a new ally, artificial intelligence, to disseminate their messages. This emerging technology presents both risks and potential benefits for the political advertising industry. AI-powered tools can generate new text, images, video, and speech from a single prompt to weave into campaign messages. Political campaigns are already using these tools to create messages for ads and fundraising solicitations. AI software can even compose campaign emails. Generative AI is poised to redefine modern campaigning, although the exact nature of its influence remains uncertain. However, despite calls for regulation or moratoria in Congress, the Federal Election Commission, and even the political consultants’ trade association, national lawmakers have yet to address the new technology.
New AI software products are inexpensive, require almost no training to use, and can generate seemingly limitless content. These tools can support personalized advertising at scale, reducing the need for large digital teams and leveling the playing field for campaigns that lack substantial resources. Yet AI also introduces a novel set of challenges, from a tendency to generate bland and repetitive text to the risk of misleading audiences and amplifying ongoing election misinformation issues. This essay examines ways in which AI — and specifically large language models that generate text — can enhance campaigns’ voter outreach efforts, the cautions that campaigns must exercise when embracing new AI tools, and the market forces affecting both the technology itself and campaigns’ experience as generative AI consumers.
We focus primarily on considerations that could influence the decision-making of campaigns themselves. Other essays in this series delve into broader threats to democracy associated with AI use, like the disturbing trend of AI-generated deepfakes in campaigns and AI as a tool for voter suppression, along with policy responses to these problems. Here, we take a campaign’s-eye view of some of the strengths and weaknesses of generative AI in political advertising and the likely course that the market will take.

The Department of Homeland Security is leaning into the use of generative artificial intelligence by issuing new guidance on how its workforce should use commercial applications of the technology and experimenting with building its own models, the department’s top IT official told FedScoop.
DHS is rolling out a set of policies around specific AI technologies — a process that started in September with the publication of guidance on the use of facial recognition and face capture technologies and continues now with a policy governing how the department will use commercial generative AI models.
The memo is signed and dated Oct. 24 but was uploaded to the department’s website Thursday. DHS also recently issued a privacy impact statement on commercial generative AI tools conditionally approved for use within the department, including ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Claude 2 and DALL-E2.
During an interview on FedScoop’s Daily Scoop Podcast, CIO Eric Hysen said DHS developed the new policy using the White House’s AI executive order and the corresponding Office of Management and Budget draft memo on how federal agencies should implement the order “to make sure that we have a comprehensive governance approach to specific types of AI technology that are in use across the department.”

“Our strategy has been that because AI is such a broad technology — or set of technologies — we are issuing specific guidance on different types of AI technology,” Hysen said.
Within the new guidance, Hysen writes he has “determined that DHS must enable and encourage DHS personnel to responsibly use commercial products to harness the benefits of Gen AI and ensure we continuously adapt to the future of work.”
The memo lays out how the department will “develop and maintain a list of conditionally approved commercial Gen AI tools for use on open-source information only” — such as those included in the recent privacy assessment — and security requirements and standards that personnel must follow when using commercial generative AI models.
“Immediate appropriate applications of commercial Gen AI tools to DHS business could include generating first drafts of documents that a human would subsequently review, conducting and synthesizing research on open-source information, and developing briefing materials or preparing for meetings and events. I have personally found these tools valuable in these use cases already, and encourage employees to learn, identify, and share other valuable uses with each other,” the memo reads.
At the same time, DHS has also been “experimenting” with building out its own large language models in-house and with the support of industry, he said.

“What we’re really looking to do there is learn,” Hysen told FedScoop. “I want a portfolio of AI projects that use models from different companies that let us understand what the benefits of different types are, that use some closed proprietary models, that use some open-source models, that test out different ways of deploying these models, some that might be shared commercial cloud instances, some that we might deploy on our cloud infrastructure, some that we might deploy in-house on our own hardware. We’re really in a learning mode here and are looking to try many different things technically, which is, as I’ve talked with other CIOs across government and across the private sector, I think, really the mode everyone is in.”
“We want to be maximizing our ability to learn how we can leverage these technologies in support of our mission,” he said.
DHS also issued broader guidance in September governing how DHS components should acquire and use AI and machine learning technologies.
Around that same time, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas named Hysen — who’s been CIO of the department since 2021 — as DHS’s first chief AI officer. And back in April, Mayorkas launched a DHS Artificial Intelligence Task Force, which — co-chaired by Hysen — is responsible for producing the policies.
As such, Hysen and DHS have been developing a vision for the adoption and responsible use of AI that precedes the White House order and draft OMB guidance, which will require federal agencies to have chief AI officers within 60 days, once the directive is finalized. FedScoop has been tracking those CAIOs as they’re named.

“This is not something that just started when we added this title,” Hysen said. “This is work that has been going on for many years — many of our agencies and offices have been using AI and data science and machine learning in their operations for many years now. But … with the explosion of interest in generative AI and other topics over the last year, we’ve seen a need to really focus our approach across the department.”
The release of the executive order didn’t necessarily change any of that either because DHS has been working closely with the White House and anticipated its requirements. 
“As you can imagine, with any document as comprehensive as the president’s executive order, it had been in the works for quite a while and many parts of the department had been working closely with the White House and the interagency for some time on several aspects of it. So we were anticipating some of the requirements there,” he said. 
Hysen said that Mayorkas has been a driving force behind the department’s leaning into AI adoption, instead of hesitating as some federal agencies have.
“Very early he was using ChatGPT and other tools, right after they were released, in his personal life, and asking me and others how we could be leveraging the benefits of those technologies to better empower our workforce and give them what they need to get their job done,” Hysen said.

“Every day, we interact with more members of the public on a daily basis than any other federal agency. And the workload that our employees have is only growing,” he said. “And so when it comes to our use of AI within the department, the secretary saw very early that this could be a tool that could act as a force multiplier for us that could allow our agents and officers on the frontlines to spend less time doing routine paperwork, and more time actually focused on their security missions that would ultimately enhance our homeland security.”

AI has an unquestionable impact on the global industry, despite its arguable benefits and drawbacks. Every day, it grows, ensuring the long-term viability of businesses. To succeed in many new-age jobs, AI literacy and up skilling are certainly required. 
Artificial intelligence has drastically transformed the way numerous sectors operate. The health, education, manufacturing, business, and agricultural sectors are all heavily influenced by technology. AI has also opened up a slew of new work prospects for the general public. There is a lot of discussion about how AI and robotics are gradually taking over occupations. The technology eliminates jobs, but it also creates new opportunities for people. AI is here to stay, and it will assist people in working more efficiently. The role of AI in worker rights is critical.
AI boosts worker productivity
All industries are attempting to incorporate AI to assist their employees in increasing their productivity. It aids in the solving of difficulties, the completion of complex activities, and increases worker efficiency by removing human errors. With AI and robots, everything from gathering data to analyzing it and providing feedback is really simple. Many large companies, for example, use chat boxes to communicate with their customers on a daily basis. This is often utilized for providing prompt customer service. This, in turn, boosts productivity and has proven to be quite profitable.

The leak of sensitive documents without the awareness of employees is a widespread concern in today's business world. However, AI ensures that a company's data and documents are safe. Artificial intelligence is boosting the labor market, but it is also putting employees' rights in jeopardy. Many workers are losing their employment as a result of the introduction of more efficient machinery and technology, which reduces manpower efficiency. Smart systems and automated functions are progressively replacing human labor.
AI is more accurate and capable of handling difficult tasks than humans 
Humans have a tendency to make mistakes. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is impervious to mistakes. They are extremely precise in whatever they do. Jobs like data entry, typing, and data analytics should be error-free, or else confusion may arise. All of these jobs can be efficiently taken over by AI.
Various factory jobs result in people being gravely hurt or murdered. In this situation, AI can be utilized to keep workers safe and do tasks efficiently. While machines can be damaged or destroyed, they are sufficiently robust to survive threats. Despite its many benefits, AI will never be able to take over occupations because of the following reasons:
Machines are unable to think creatively
Regardless of how capable AI is at carrying out tasks, at the end of the day, it is humans who need to think creatively, plan out plans during a crisis, and use their brains to lay the groundwork and make critical decisions.
While AI can be useful, it cannot run a business without the support of humans. AI will not be able to replace any job that demands critical thinking or creative problem-solving.

AI is incapable of forming strong bonds
It's all about making connections with other businesses and customers in the business world. Machines or robots lack the ability to build human-to-human trust and connection, which is required to relax, communicate, and open up. Machines can assist with technical tasks, but they lack human intimacy. Communication skills, empathy, strategic thinking, common sense, and decision-making abilities are all lacking in machines and robots.

BOSTON - There are a lot of myths, predictions, and half-truths about artificial intelligence: it's coming for your job. It's too risky. Generative AI, harnessed through programs like ChatGPT, is a popular technology that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.In fact, AI can write entire academic essays, outlines, bibliographies – you name it.""AI is a great tool to augment what you do but we have to have humans checking the work,"" said Patty Patria, the Chief Information Officer at Babson College. ""If we are not checking the work that AI is generating, then we are not using it properly.""A recent survey by BestColleges revealed that 56% of college students admit completing assignments using AI technology.

In fact, when WBZ-TV surveyed random students at Boston University and Northeastern, many said they, too, use it for schoolwork. ""It's pretty convenient to give you a broad view,"" one Northeastern student said. ""I've been using ChatGPT for most of my assignments and it works really well,"" a BU student said. ""I sometimes use it as a background resource to get information on a subject and then I go from there,"" another added.There are obvious concerns: plagiarism, inaccurate information, and students not learning how to write their own papers or do their own work. 


""We have seen that our library has received more requests for interlibrary loans, for books or journals that don't even exist because somebody looks at a reference that was generated by a generative AI model that has, you know, journals and books in there that don't exist,"" Tilman Wolf, the Senior Vice Provost of Academic Affairs at UMass Amherst explained. But the popularity of the technology makes it hard for local universities to ignore, and as a result, most are currently in the process of developing AI policies or strategies for students and faculty.""I think the best thing to do is to leave it up to the faculty members to decide what makes sense to them. The really important thing is to articulate what these expectations are by the faculty members, so that the students know what to do,"" Wolf explained. ""We're at the beginning but I think pretty ahead of other high learning institutions in terms of creating an AI model,"" added Patty Patria of Babson. The college hopes to have a formal policy on the books by the end of the academic year.Some considerations and recommendations they offer professors:Forbid the use of AI.Discourage AI use – but require proper      credit when AI is used.Encourage – and even assign – AI      augmented work.Decide whether AI can be used on a case-by-case      basis for assignments.""Generative AI models are not going to go away,"" Tilman Wolf said. ""And I think the important thing is that we create awareness on our campus, what they can and cannot do, and that we think about how we can be transparent about where we use them and where we don't use them, and that we train our students so that they are prepared for the workforce where they can use these tools in an appropriate manner.""If you have a question you'd like us to look into, please email questioneverything@cbsboston.com.

If you’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed by the buzz surrounding generative AI, you’re not alone. Let us face it, our industry is evolving, and so are the tools and strategies we use to find the best talent out there. We’ve all had that sinking feeling, wondering if our hard-earned skills are becoming obsolete in the face of these intelligent machines. Are we going to be replaced by algorithms that can analyse candidates faster than we ever could?
Let us not get ahead of ourselves. Remember, we’re the experts here, and we have the human touch that machines can’t replicate.
In this post, we’ll dive into the future of talent acquisition in the age of generative AI. We’ll explore how to harness this cutting-edge technology while staying true to our human instincts and values.
What is generative AI? 
Generative AI is a remarkable branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new and original content. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on pre-existing data to make predictions or perform tasks, generative AI has the incredible ability to generate entirely new and unique outputs.
Think of it as an AI-powered creative genius, capable of composing music, writing stories, designing artwork and even producing realistic human-like speech.
It’s like having an AI collaborator that can generate content that is not simply a replication of what it has learned but rather a creative expression that pushes boundaries and explores new frontiers.
Generative AI leverages advanced algorithms and neural networks to analyse patterns and structures in vast amounts of data. By learning from this data, it can understand the underlying characteristics and generate outputs that align with those patterns, all while adding its own touch of creativity.
Future of recruitment with generative AI
When it comes to generative AI in the talent-acquisition process, we can let our imagination run wild with the potential developments that lie ahead. Here, we explore a few speculative glimpses into what the future may hold.
Remember, these speculations are just the tip of the iceberg. The future of generative AI in talent acquisition holds immense potential for revolutionising how organisations identify and engage top talent. As we journey forward, it’s essential to approach these advancements with a thoughtful and ethical mindset, ensuring that technology augments human judgment rather than replacing it.
1. Predictive candidate fit
The evolution of generative AI can empower recruiters to predict candidate fit with remarkable precision. By leveraging advanced algorithms, AI systems can analyse vast amounts of data, including resumes, social-media profiles and online assessments. This analysis would go beyond surface-level qualifications and delve into the nuances of cultural alignment and team dynamics. Recruiters would benefit from predictive insights that guide them towards candidates who not only possess the necessary skills but also possess the qualities that align with the organisation’s values and contribute to a positive work environment.
2. Job performance projections
Imagine generative AI going beyond traditional candidate-assessment methods and providing projections of a candidate’s future job performance. By leveraging historical data on successful employees and correlating it with candidate attributes, AI algorithms could generate predictive models. These models would estimate how well a candidate is likely to perform in a specific role based on factors such as their past experiences, skill set and behavioral traits. Recruiters could then make more informed decisions, selecting candidates with higher potential for success, leading to improved organisational outcomes.
3. Personalised candidate experiences 
In the future, generative AI can transform the candidate experience by offering highly personalised journeys. By analysing a candidate’s preferences, communication styles, and engagement patterns, AI algorithms could craft tailored interactions at every touchpoint. Candidates would receive customised job recommendations based on their interests, targeted content that resonates with their motivations, and even personalised interview processes that accommodate their individual needs. This level of personalisation would create a more engaging and positive candidate experience, fostering stronger connections between candidates and organisations.
4. Bias mitigation
Generative AI has the potential to address the long-standing challenge of bias in talent acquisition. Aartificial intelligence algorithms can be trained to detect and mitigate biases by focusing on objective criteria and reducing reliance on subjective factors. These algorithms would learn from historical data to recognise patterns and biases in candidate evaluation, enabling recruiters to make fairer and more unbiased decisions. By mitigating bias, generative AI can contribute to creating a more inclusive and diverse workforce, promoting equal opportunities for all candidates.
5. Continuous learning and adaptation 
In the future, generative AI systems could continually learn and adapt based on their interactions with candidates and recruiters. By analysing feedback, performance data, and real-time outcomes, these systems would refine their algorithms and models over time. This iterative learning process would lead to increasingly accurate and reliable candidate assessments. As a result, recruiters would benefit from AI systems that evolve and improve, enhancing the effectiveness of their talent-acquisition efforts and ensuring they stay aligned with the evolving needs of the organization.
Synergy between AI and humans 
The future of recruiting is a synergistic partnership between human recruiters and AI technologies, where strategic insights and human connection are blended with the efficiency and analytical power of AI. Together, recruiters and AI can transform the talent-acquisition process and shape the future of work.
In this evolving landscape, recruiters have the opportunity to elevate their role and become strategic talent advisors who guide organisations in making informed talent decisions. By embracing AI technologies and leveraging their strengths, recruiters can focus on building relationships, shaping talent-acquisition strategies, and ensuring that the right talent is brought on board to drive organisational success.
One of the ways AI can empower recruiters is by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. AartificiaI-intelligence algorithms can quickly sift through vast volumes of resumes, screening candidates based on predefined criteria and eliminating the need for manual resume screening.
This automation frees up recruiters’ time, allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of talent acquisition, such as relationship building, candidate engagement and assessing cultural fit.
Moreover, generative AI can aid in the creation of compelling job descriptions. By analysing successful past job descriptions and candidate preferences, AI algorithms can generate language that resonates with candidates, ensuring the job posting stands out in a crowded market.
Recruiters can then allocate their energy to understanding the nuances of the role and organisation, crafting personalised outreach, and building a strong employer brand.
Generative AI can also assist recruiters in sourcing top talent. By analysing vast amounts of data, including social-media profiles, online portfolios and professional networks, AI algorithms can identify potential candidates who may not be actively seeking job opportunities.
This proactive sourcing approach enables recruiters to tap into a wider talent pool, providing access to high-quality candidates who might have been overlooked otherwise.
While AI technologies can augment recruiters’ capabilities, they do not replace the human element. Recruiters bring invaluable emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills to the table. They excel at building relationships, understanding complex organizational dynamics, and evaluating intangible qualities such as cultural fit and adaptability. Serving as powerful tools, AI technologies enhance recruiters’ abilities and enable them to work more efficiently and effectively.
Balancing efficiency and ethics
In conclusion, the future of talent acquisition in the age of generative AI is both promising and challenging. As AI continues to evolve and integrate seamlessly into the recruitment process, companies must strive to remain competitive by embracing these technologies. By harnessing the power of AI, organisations can streamline their talent-acquisition process, reduce human bias and identify the best candidates more efficiently, leading to a stronger and more diverse workforce.
However, the adoption of AI in talent acquisition should not be taken lightly, as it comes with a responsibility to ensure ethical and responsible use. Companies must prioritise transparency, fairness and accountability in their AI-powered recruitment systems. This entails regular audits and assessments of AI algorithms to prevent potential biases, discrimination and unintended consequences. Additionally, organisations must also focus on upskilling their HR professionals, enabling them to understand and manage AI tools effectively and responsibly.
As we look to the future, a successful talent-acquisition strategy will depend on striking the right balance between leveraging the capabilities of AI and preserving human values and ethics in recruitment processes. By doing so, organisations will not only attract the best talent but also foster a culture of innovation, diversity and inclusivity, positioning themselves as leaders in the increasingly competitive global market.

<p>A recent study by Pearson, a British Multinational Publishing and Education company has revealed that generative AI poses a greater threat to white-collar jobs than blue-collar ones. The study titled “Skills Outlook 2023: The Future of Jobs in the Age of <a href=""https://www.dnpindia.in/technology/amazon-launches-free-generative-ai-courses-details-inside/333007/"">Generative AI</a>” has come to the conclusion that generative AI is capable of augmenting or automating up to 30 Percent of routine tasks done by white-collar jobs in India. White, it barely automates 1 per cent of blue-collar jobs in the country. Check out more details below. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study states the reason for white-collar job automation is they are more rule-based than blue-collar jobs which makes them much easier to automate. Generative Artificial Intelligence is capable of performing tasks easily which include data, numbers and customer service.&nbsp;</p>
