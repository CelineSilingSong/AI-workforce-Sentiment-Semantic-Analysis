Many large enterprises use one form or another of a supply chain application to help manage their supply chains. Supply chain vendors have been touting their investments in artificial intelligence (AI) for the last several years. In the course of updating our annual research on the supply chain planning market, I talked to executives across the industry. Alex Pradhan, Product Strategy Leader John Galt Solutions, told me that “all planning vendors have bold marketing around AI.” But the trick is to find suppliers with “field-proven AI/ML algorithms” that “have been delivered at scale.”


Further, while artificial intelligence helps solve certain types of problems, Jay Muelhoefer - the chief marketing officer at Kinaxis pointed out - optimization and heuristics work better for other types of planning problems. This article, which is focused on the different types of artificial intelligence used and the types of problems they are solving, is aimed at helping practitioners cut through the hype.

Let’s start with a definition: any device that can perceive its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal is engaged in some form of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can refer to several different types of math. But, in the supply chain realm, machine learning (ML) is where most of the activity surrounding artificial intelligence has been focused.

PROMOTED
Garbage In, Garbage Out
It is also worth pointing out, that based on this definition, not all forms of machine learning are particularly complicated. Planning applications don’t work well if the master data they rely on is not accurate; this is known as the “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Artificial intelligence is beginning to be used to update the data. Lead times, for example, are a critical form of master data for planning purposes. Having an agent detect how long it takes to ship from a supplier site to a manufacturing facility, and then doing a running calculation on how the average lead time is changing, is trivial math. The agent technology is much more complicated than the math. Relying on humans to update this data has not worked at all well; people just don’t want to do it.

But sometimes fixing the bad data problem is complicated. In process industries the supply chain models used for optimization are much more complex than those used in other industries. The processing units in an oil refinery, for example, operate at high temperature and high pressure. These constraints need to be understood. So, models for heavy process industries often include first principle parameters. First principles reflect physical laws such as mass balance, energy balance, heat transfer relations, and reaction kinetics. The first principles are important to understand yields, as well as the energy requirements for running the equipment.

AspenTech has developed in a process simulator which is tuned with real plant operating data. During development, the models automatically perform thousands of permutations and perturbations of the first principles model to create a large data set to which AI algorithms applied. The AspenTech models combine the classic first principles approach with the modern pure data-driven approach. Starting with a first principles model, according to AspenTech, improves accuracy significantly. They tell me, the model with either a first principles or pure data plus AI, the model accuracy would be in the 90-97% range. But hybrid models that combine first principles, data-driven models, and AI, they have 99+% accuracy.

Demand Planning Models Really Can Learn
A supply chain planning model learns when the planning application takes an output, like a forecast, observes the accuracy of the output, and then updates its own model so that better outputs will occur in the future.

When you look at machine learning this way, artificial intelligence for supply chain planning is nothing new. Machine learning has been used to improve demand forecasting since the early 2000s. But machine learning for demand forecasting is much better than it used to be. There are far more forecasts being made in far more planning horizons and at a greater degree of specificity today than 20 years ago. For example, forecasting how much of a particular product will be sold in a particular store is far more intensive than forecasting how many products in a product family will be sold in a region. This explosion in the number of forecasts would not be possible without the latest generation of machine learning. There were only a few SCP suppliers with mature capabilities in this area a few years ago. Since then, virtually every supplier I talked to in the process of updating this year’s Supply Chain Planning Market Analysis Study has said they are investing in this area.
One example of the value of machine learning in demand planning comes from Mahindra & Mahindra. Aniruddh Srivastava, Head of Demand and Supply Planning at Mahindra & Mahindra, said at Blue Yonder’s Icon user conference that artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are the cornerstone of their strategy. Through their partnership with Blue Yonder, Mahindra & Mahindra was able to increase forecast accuracy by 10%. A better forecast leads to carrying less inventory while maintaining or even improving service levels. The improvement in forecasting contributed to an increase in service levels by 10% while reducing inventory investment by 20%.
But that was pre-COVID. But after the pandemic hit their safety stock was increased by 30%. “Post-COVID it was not about savings,” Mr. Srivastava explained. “The game changed to a global competition for the same set of raw materials.” This division makes automotive spare parts, so the competition was to secure semiconductor chips.
During the pandemic, forecasting accuracy was terrible. Forecasting is based on the presumption that history repeats itself. As an E2open forecasting benchmarking report pointed out, “for companies trying to predict demand in March of 2020 as the world was descending into lockdown and everything was being turned upside down, what happened in March of 2019 had little to no relevance.”
But if there was any silver lining it was that companies that made use of planning systems that combined demand sensing – the use of multiple, real-time signals (like sales in a particular store or shipments from a retailer’s warehouses to their stores) – and machine learning, had significantly less error. And the companies that used these solutions, saw their forecasts improve much more quickly than traditional solutions.
In making demand forecasts, one can look at product history. An alternative is to look at customer behavior surrounding how clusters of customers buy these products. QAD Dynasys is one of several suppliers investing here.
One thing that is difficult to forecast are new product introductions. The way this forecasting is done is through the use of attributes. If you are looking at a purse, attributes would include the material it is made of, size, color, and other things as well. To the extent that one product is like another, it may be easier to forecast. But which attributes matter? Infor is using machine learning looking at attributes and past launches to make this determination. Solvoyo and Lily AI are using another form of AI, image recognition, to tackle this problem. Getting merchandisers to enter the attributes has not worked well. Merchandisers see this as an unimportant, dull task and they just don’t take the time to do this properly.
Machine Learning and the Sustainability Feedback Loop
One real trend ARC has seen this year, is the increasing investment supply chain planning suppliers are making to improve the ability of SCP to help companies reach their sustainability goals. Cyrus Hadavi, the CEO of Adexa, provides a good explanation for how SCP solutions can calculate the carbon footprint associated with a plan. “The way this works is that every element in the supply chain is given a carbon index, absolute or relative. That is every machine, factory, DC, mode of transportation, supplier, product, material, etc. These indices then become attributes of these objects. Every time we plan and use any of these elements, the system can project the total carbon footprint of the projected plan. Additionally, we have embedded self-correcting algorithms - using ML - in building the model of the digital twin. For example, we learn the energy efficiency of the resource in the month of June vs. December.” In addition to carbon emissions, these attributes can be used for other forms environmental and governance goals as well.
So, a plan can be produced that predicts the emissions. After a plan is executed, the actual emissions that occurred can be measured, and it is possible to see how close the plan came to what occurred. Just as a demand planning solution compares the forecast to what actually sold and uses machine learning to improve the machines forecasting capabilities, a similar feedback loop can exist with sustainability.
AI is Also Used for Supply Planning
Artificial intelligence can also be used in supply and factory planning. But on the supply planning side it is not about using machine learning to select the right algorithms to improve the plans. When supply plans don’t pan out it is less about the model than it is about a data quality issue or an unexpected occurrence. An example of an input issue would be, “We thought it took 20 minutes to set up this machine to make product C, but it really takes 60 minutes when product A was made right before product C.” An example of an unexpected occurrence would be a critical piece of machinery breaking down.
Machine learning is being used to predict machine breakdowns. But very few vendors are taking those alerts and automatically feeding them into their manufacturing planning solutions. AspenTech has probably done the most in this area. AspenTech, for example, is using predictive analytic inputs on when key machinery in a refinery will break down to allow alternative production schedules to be generated in a more autonomous manner. AspenTech’s advantage is that they have both asset management (a solution that can use machine learning for the predictive maintenance alert) and the supply chain planning models those alerts can feed.
Natural Language Processing is Also Being Used
A less commonly used form of AI in supply chain applications is natural language processing (NLP). Google’s Alexa uses NLP to understand a person’s command and then play the music they want. There is a desire to use NLP to allow planners to tell a planning system what to do so they can focus more of their time on higher priority problems.
But Coupa and Oracle are also leveraging natural language processing for supplier risk assessment. Humans don’t speak with a clarity that machines can understand. A company can go bankrupt, and a machine could be programmed to understand that. But on social media someone might say that a company is about to go “belly up.” Machines don’t understand this type of “unstructured” data. NLP helps to make sense of these kinds of data. Oracle’s DataFox is accessing databases with important company information, but it also has web crawlers examining huge numbers of online news sites as well as social media to discover negative news about a company. That news could be an impending bankruptcy, unhappy customers, key executives leaving the company, or many other things. These “events” are turned into supplier scores, and if significant the score goes flagged in the Oracle procurement system. Now Oracle is working to connect these scores to the planning systems. At Coupa supplier risk is also flagged for single source or capacity constraints. This can then be leveraged by their supply chain design solution to improve risk mitigation.
AI Drives Autonomous Decision Making
Companies need to take machine learning driven demand-side predictions – which are particularly good at granular short-term forecasts - and adjust production accordingly. The closer in time a plan’s creation comes to the actual execution of an order, the more a planning system becomes an execution system. The idea is for supply planning application to digest a short horizon demand signals into meaningful plans by using machine learning to suggest courses of action for planners. These suggestions are based upon the way planners had previously solved the same kind of demand/supply disruption. However, this kind of AI does not work out of the box. The system observes planners’ actions over time and then learns to make the pertinent suggestions. QAD and Noodle.ai are among several suppliers working in this area.
In the last couple of years, RELEX Solutions has developed new capabilities for autonomous capacity balancing. In short, the AI algorithms can pull orders forward (for products with longer shelf-life) to level out the flow of goods into distribution centers and stores as well as to adhere to time-dependent capacity limits. Johanna Småros, Co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer at RELEX, points out “the current difficulties in finding staff have really raised awareness of the value of being able to plan ahead to ensure availability and efficient use of human resources as well as to plan around this availability when it becomes a bottleneck in the supply chain.”
Blue Yonder, in turn has developed a machine learning powered Dynamic Segmentation solution that automatically groups customers with similar fulfillment or procurement needs based on data changes, and then develops distinct supply chain operations to meet those specific requirements. This enables planners to provide differentiated service levels based on customer value and business parameters
While this article stemmed from research ARC is doing on the supply chain planning market, and most AI investments have been focused on planning applications, it is worth pointing out that AI investments are increasing in the supply chain execution realm as well. Companies like Oracle, Manhattan Associates, Koerber, and Blue Yonder, are all increasing the R&D in AI in their supply chain execution systems. A transportation system that applies machine learning to predict how long it will take a truck to make a delivery is one example of this. A warehouse management system that can digest a prediction of what ecommerce customers are apt to buy, and then drop the right work orders at the right time to the warehouse floor, is another example of this. 
Final Thoughts
To sum it up, Madhav Durbha – the vice president of supply chain strategy at Coupa Software – said that artificial intelligence is becoming much more widely adopted “due to progress occurring on several fronts at the same time. These include the development of new machine learning algorithms, “computing power, big data analytics, and acceptance by industry leaders.”
But remember, AI only fixes supply chains to a degree; this is not like waving a magic wand and seeing your supply chain problems suddenly vanish. Nevertheless, AI really is improving planning, and it is increasingly being used to improve order execution as well.

Generative AI is an innovative technology that helps generate artifacts that formerly relied on humans, offering inventive results without any biases resulting from human thoughts and experiences.
This new tech in AI determines the original pattern entered in the input to generate creative, authentic pieces that showcase the training data features. The MIT Technology Review stated Generate AI is a promising advancement in artificial intelligence.
Generative AI offers better quality results through self-learning from all datasets. It also reduces the challenges linked with a particular project, trains ML (machine learning) algorithms to avoid partiality, and allows bots to understand abstract concepts.
Gartner mentioned Generative AI in its lists of major trends of 2022 and highlighted that enterprises could use this innovative technology in two ways:
Enhancing current innovative workflows together with humans: Developing artifacts to aid better creative tasks performed by humans. For instance, game designers can utilize generative AI to create dungeons, highlighting what they prefer and don’t prefer about the content created in terms like “somewhat like this” or “little less like that.”Functioning as an artifact production unit: Generative AI can produce creative pieces in any quantity with little human involvement (apart from shaping the parameters of what they want to create). It only requires setting the context, and the results will be generated independently.

Benefits of Generative AI
Protection of your identity: The avatars produced by generative AI offer security to those who don’t wish to reveal their identities during interview sessions or work.Robotics control: Generative AI strengthens ML models, makes them less partial, and realizes more abstract concepts in imitating the real world.Healthcare: The technology has simple and easy detection of probable malice and develops efficient treatments against it. For instance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can calculate several angles of an X-ray picture to show the possibility of tumor expansion.

Challenges of Generative AI
Safety: It has been observed that malicious people use generative AI for scamming purposes.Highly estimated abilities: Generative AI algorithms need considerable training data to perform tasks like creating art; however, the images created are not wholly new. Instead, these models only mix and match what they know in the best possible ways.Unpredictable outcomes: In some models of generative AI, it is simple to handle their behavior, but sometimes, they may yield erroneous or unexpected results.Data Security: With the technology relying on data, sectors like healthcare and defense may face privacy concerns when leveraging generative AI applications.
Is Generative AI Just Supervised Training?
Generative AI is a semi-supervised training framework. This learning methodology involves manually marked training information for supervised training and unmarked data for unsupervised training methods. Here, unmarked data is used to develop models that can predict more than the marked training by enhancing the data quality.
Some of the key advantages of GANs, a semi-supervised framework of generative AI against supervised learning, are:
Overfitting: Generative AI models have lesser parameters, so it may be tougher to overfit. Also, generative models need a high quantity of data because of the training procedure, making them sturdier to obstructions.Human partiality: Human marks are not as evident as in the supervised learning methodology in generative AI modeling. The learning works on the data properties that permit the exclusion of bogus correlations.Model partiality: Generative models don’t generate results the same as the training data. Hence, the shape and texture problem disappears.

Applications of Generative AI
AI-generative NFTs
With sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) reaching $25 billion in 2021, the sector is currently one of the most lucrative markets in the crypto world. Art NFT, in particular, is creating a major impact.
While the most popular art NFTs are cartoons and memes, a new kind of NFT trend is emerging that leverages the power of AI and human imagination. Coined as AI-Generative Art, these non-fungible tokens use GANs to produce machine-based art images.
Art AI is one such example of an art gallery that showcases AI-generated paintings. It released a tool that transforms text into art and helps the creators sell their art pieces on NFT. Metascapes, on the other hand, combine images to generate a new photograph. It uses two learning models, and the output gets better every time. These art pieces are placed on sale online.
Identity security
Generative AI allows people to maintain privacy using avatars instead of images. In addition, it can also help companies opt for impartial recruitment practices and research to present unbiased results.
Image processing
AI is used in extraordinary ways to process low-resolution images and develop more precise, clearer, and detailed pictures. For example, Google published a blog post to let the world know they have created two models to turn low-resolution images into high-resolution images.
The upscale examples include photography of a woman from 64 x 64 input to 1024 x 1024 output. The process helps restore old images and movies and upscale them to 4K and more. It also helps to transform black and white movies into color.
Healthcare
Generative AI better identifies an ailment to help patients receive impactful treatment even during the early stages.
Audio synthesis
With Generative AI, it is possible to create voices that resemble humans. The computer-generated voice is helpful to develop video voiceovers, audible clips, and narrations for companies and individuals.
Design
Many businesses now use generative AI to create more advanced designs. For instance, Jacobs, an engineering company, used generative design algorithms to design a life-support backpack for NASA’s new spacesuits.
Client segmentation
AI allows users to acknowledge and differentiate target groups for promotional campaigns. It learns from the available data to estimate the response of a target group to advertisements and marketing campaigns.
Generative AI also helps develop customer relationships using data and gives marketing teams the power to enhance their upselling or cross-selling strategies.
Sentiment analysis
ML involves using text, pictures, and voice evaluation to grasp people’s emotions. For example, AI algorithms can learn from web activity and user data to interpret customers’ opinions towards a company and its products or services.
Detecting fraud
Several businesses already use automated fraud-detection practices that leverage the power of AI. These practices have helped them locate malicious and suspicious actions quickly and with superior accuracy. AI is now detecting illegal transactions through preset algorithms and rules and is making the detection of theft identification easier.
Trend evaluation
ML and artificial learning technology are helpful to predict the future. These technologies aid in providing valuable insights on the trends beyond conventional calculative analysis.
Software development
Generative AI has also influenced the software development sector by automating manual coding. Rather than coding the software completely, the IT professionals now have the flexibility to quickly develop a solution by explaining the AI model about what they are looking for.
For instance, a model-based tool GENIO can enhance a developer’s productivity multifold compared to a manual coder. The tool helps citizen developers, or non-coders, develop applications specific to their requirements and business processes and reduces their dependency on the IT department.
The Road Ahead for Generative AI Looks Promising
While generative AI is becoming a boon today for image production, restoration of movies, and 3D environment creation, the technology will soon have a significant impact on several other industry verticals. By empowering machines to do more than just replace manual labor and take on creative tasks, we will likely see a broader range of use cases and adoption of generative AI across different sectors.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems today are already transforming industries and becoming an indispensable part of our daily lives. Such systems, which leverage machines to process and analyse large amounts of data, have vastly changed how humans work and play, and are being used today in many sectors, from banking to energy to agriculture. But AI systems can be energy-intensive, and there is a pressing need for those working in the field of AI to address the potentially large environmental impacts. This is especially as demand for data and intelligent devices continues to proliferate. Singapore has committed itself to environmental sustainability, underlined by its ratification of the Paris Agreement and recent plans to reach net-zero by or around mid-century. Environmental criteria have also become a crucial performance measure for companies and industries. Rising interest in sustainable investing is a strong signal that corporations – including AI-dependent ones – will soon be held accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions.

The Environmental Impact Of Ai

The field of AI is progressing by leaps and bounds, driven by advances in hardware and an exponential increase in computing power. But the massive computation required to obtain these impressive technological feats comes at a price. Training AI models can incur substantial financial and environmental costs due to the energy needed to perform such computations. On top of the monetary costs of hardware, electricity and cloud compute time, powering such hardware for weeks and months at a time could also leave a huge carbon footprint.

Studies have found that Google’s AlphaGo Zero – the AI that plays the game of Go against itself to self-learn – generated a massive 96 tonnes of carbon dioxide over 40 days of research training. That is comparable to 1,000 hours of air travel, as well as the carbon footprint of about 10 average Singaporeans over an entire year.

In Singapore – a popular regional hub for data centres – there is growing concern over the increasing power consumption and widening carbon footprint of its data centre industry. A typical 20MW data centre on the island consumes the same amount of electricity a day as around 60,000 households – or about the energy usage size of Yishun town. With an estimated 60 data centres here accounting for about 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption in 2020, the carbon footprint is significant.

In 2019, a “temporary pause” was imposed on the building of new data centres in Singapore to assess the balance between environment sustainability and supporting business needs. New conditions have since been announced for new data centre applications from the second quarter of this year, and the Government will continue to evaluate its policies towards new data centres.

Globally, the carbon footprint for data centres is estimated at more than 2 per cent of global carbon emissions. This number is expected to rise to 3.2 per cent by 2025 and 14 per cent by 2040. This highlights the critical importance of having sustainable AI, which can address the issues of carbon footprint and resource utilisation.

Working towards greater data use efficiency is a three-year research programme led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in partnership with local institutes of higher learning such as the Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University and the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

Making Ai More Sustainable

Under the research programme, researchers in Singapore are working on different fronts to make AI more sustainable. For example, as much of the energy usage by AI models occurs during the so-called “training” phase, reducing the need for massive amounts of training data directly translates into energy savings. This is an area that scientists are currently looking into.

One approach involves selecting only the most relevant data for training, or efficiently adapting existing models for a new task, which significantly reduces the cost of training a model. In other words, instead of training the AI system on a massive web of information, researchers may choose to use only select articles relevant to what the system is being used for.

This can help to reduce defects, design time and downtime for advanced manufacturing and engineering environments. Another area that researchers are looking into under the programme relates to edge computing, which refers to computing or data storage that is performed at or near the source of the data.

Combining AI into edge devices – such as lightweight mobile devices or sensors that generate and record data within the infrastructure – reduces the reliance on cloud services for data processing, allowing such devices to deliver better data security, faster computing and insights, with greater efficiency.

Another promising area in AI and computing research is neuromorphic computing, which is inspired by the workings of the brain. The technology uses networks that mimic the workings of the human brain and nervous system.

By replicating the flexibility, resilience and energy efficiency of a human brain, neuromorphic architecture aims to overcome the energy-intensive nature of current models of computing and develop better AI.
Using Ai To Aid Sustainability Efforts

While the use of AI creates an increasingly large carbon footprint, AI itself can and has actually been used as part of sustainability efforts as well.

One area in which AI is projected to play a key role is energy use. AI applications can balance electricity supply and demand needs in real time, while optimising energy use and storage to reduce rates. In a green-energy future, renewable energy will come from a diversity of sources, such as microgrids, wind farms and solar panels. The energy generated by such sources is prone to uncertain fluctuations depending on prevailing weather conditions, unlike the more predictable outputs from gas or coal plants.

With such a decentralised global energy network, AI will play a crucial role in managing the complexity of deploying power to industrial facilities, office buildings, homes and wherever needed. Given the world’s destabilised climate and unpredictable weather conditions, shifting our current energy system to a smart one centred on AI will result in a more resilient and flexible grid when unforeseen meteorological events occur. Grid flexibility and resilience would also be required as the demand for electricity grows in booming digital economies in an increasingly connected world. 

Another area where AI is changing the game is agriculture. Modern agribusinesses can use AI to analyse their farms’ data for crop yield predictions or climate control. As agriculture is a labour-intensive industry, in space-starved Singapore, AI allows us to grow more food with fewer resources. Locally, one such step in that direction is A*STAR’s partnership with Archisen, an agri-tech firm based in Singapore that incorporated AI in the operations of its indoor farm.

The collaboration yielded a predictive model that statistically determined the key parameters which had the biggest influence on the yield and quality of the farm’s crops, allowing Archisen to produce up to 100 tonnes of vegetables a year.

By leveraging AI-driven innovations and technological breakthroughs to push the boundaries of resource efficiency, the aim is for AI to consume little power and be powerful in performance at the same time.

Overall, if the environmental impact of AI can be reduced, and more organisations start to use AI in their sustainability initiatives, then the use of AI as a whole may be able to attain a level close to carbon neutrality. To pave the way to a truly green digital revolution, we need to start making conscious choices to promote research of more computationally efficient algorithms as well as hardware that require less energy.

February 28, 2022













Resideo Technologies Inc. is applying artificial intelligence — AI — to the world of HVAC.The Honeywell spinoff is touting two data-dependent products in its new Pro-IQ line. One is designed to help HVAC professionals manage maintenance demands, and thus their time; the other helps technicians turn information about their customers’ indoor air quality (IAQ) into sales of IAQ products.The Pro-IQ line addresses two of the biggest current challenges in HVAC: time management, given the labor shortage in the industry, and increasing concerns about IAQ, according to Levi Bouwman, a Resideo sales manager. Pro-IQ products were prominently displayed at the Resideo booth.The Pro-IQ LifeWhere product allows contractors and technicians to remotely monitor their customers’ HVAC systems and, using predictive analytics, forecast a system’s problems and maintenance needs, allowing professionals to better schedule service calls and smooth out labor demands.LifeWhere “tells you if you're going to have a problem with your heat exchanger, if you’re going to have a problem with one of your igniters, you’re going to have a problem with the gas valve,” Bouwman said during the Expo. “It actually measures the energy current in the unit.” Based on how the energy signal changes, he said, LifeWhere can spot a problem months ahead of time.Bouwman referred to the typical winter deep chill in his home state, Minnesota, to explain how Pro-IQ LifeWhere might help contractors there save time and deploy workers in a way that better meets demand.“So we know, right, that you're going to have a lot of calls when it’s 35 below zero in Minnesota,” he said. “But if you knew that you were going to have a furnace issue, say in the next six months… you could then schedule that work to do when it’s, say, 45 degrees outside.”The other Pro-IQ product, AirCycle, is an air quality monitor that can analyze the air in a home and identify IAQ needs, such as humidification, dehumidification, or better filtration. Linking it to a smartphone, a laptop, or another internet-connected device, a technician can use the AirCycle monitor to illustrate to IAQ issues to the consumer and suggest solutions, Bouwman said.“So it's all about educating the homeowner,” Bouwman said. “And it's one thing to talk about temperature, because we all know what temperature is: I’m hot or I’m cold. But it's a different thing to talk about the number of particulates that you have in your air in order to sell better air filtration.”Resideo is also meeting the needs of HVACR professionals with the recent launch of Resideo Academy, a series of online training webinars. The webinars can be found on the Resideo website and can also be accessed through another HVAC company’s learning management system, if needed.“We want to do what we can to train the next generation of technicians,” Bouwman said.

The immediate requirement has turned to Understandable AI.As artificial intelligence technologies have gained popularity, creators and users have used and modified a variety of terms and phrases to describe and characterize their work. One may probably have heard terms like &quot;narrow AI&quot;, &quot;deep learning&quot;, &quot;neural networks&quot;, and other new descriptors being used to distinguish between distinct types and roles of AI, different sections of AI solutions, and so on. Another result of the rapid expansion of AI's availability and use has been the demand for &quot;explainable AI,&quot; or approaches and procedures that make Artificial Intelligence more accessible to all types of humans..And, while explainable AI is important, it's not really the answer always. The ambition to understand how computers make decisions is admirable, but XAI technologies or approaches will never be sufficient. Instead, we should be considering how to guarantee full confidence for these systems' conclusions by discussing how to deliver &quot;understandable AI&quot;..Why is XAI needed anyway?.From insurance claims and loans to medical diagnostics and employment, businesses are increasingly relying on AI and machine learning (ML) systems. Consumers, on the other hand, have grown increasingly suspicious of artificial intelligence..The concept of explainability in AI systems is nearly as ancient as the discipline itself. Many interesting XAI techniques have arisen from academic research in recent years, and many software businesses have surfaced to bring XAI tools to the consumer. The problem is that all of these methods regard explainability as a purely technical issue. In truth, the demand for Artificial Intelligence explainability and interpretability is a far wider economic and social issue that necessitates a more comprehensive answer than XAI can provide..But why do we need AI that can be explained? .Most crucially, the widespread availability of AI solutions has made them more accessible to workers with only rudimentary expertise in data science and artificial intelligence. Only people with technical competence could or would develop an AI solution in the past. Many of these solutions are ready to use right out of the box for someone like a department manager to deploy on their own, or you can download them straight to your phone. Artificial Intelligence currently has a significant impact on our lives on both a daily and a long-term basis. Today, Artificial Intelligence could prevent you from getting some tedious, time-consuming chores at work, and it could potentially make a life-saving diagnosis at a medical consultation..Two of the main reasons as to why XAI is required are.1. If someone wants to feel comfortable while using AI for their work, they have to first understand how it works, personalize it, choose the best solution from a variety of options, or tune it to operate more successfully for them..2. People have a right to know how Artificial Intelligence works for ethical reasons, as it is used to make choices in areas such as healthcare, law, finance, and other areas where moral and ethical limits are vitally important to most people. Explainability is a method of delving into what is commonly referred to as &quot;AI's black box&quot; and explaining solutions in words that are accessible to the general public. It also aids us in answering vital communal concerns such as &quot;How was this critical decision made?&quot; and &quot;Were there any other viable options?&quot;.Our solution's adoption hinged on its capacity to be explained more clearly. Explainable AI can only help us get closer to our objective of using AI to execute the tasks it's best at while humankind continues to innovate and progress. We can better spend our resources and generate tremendous efficiency on every level if we can identify when our Artificial Intelligence works when it fails, and why. The truth is that most &quot;explainable&quot; AI products can only be understood by someone with a sound knowledge of technology and a thorough understanding of how the model works..XAI is a crucial part of a technologist's toolset, but it isn't a realistic or scalable technique to &quot;explain&quot; AI and machine learning systems' judgments..Importance and Urgency of 'Understandable AI' instead of XAI .Transparency is the cornerstone of comprehension. Every decision taken by the model they supervise should be accessible to non-technical persons. They ought to be able to check a database based on important factors to assess judgments both individually and collectively. They should be able to do a counterfactual analysis of individual decisions, altering particular factors to see if the outcomes are as predicted..The greater environment in which the models' function must also be included in understandable Artificial Intelligence. Business owners should be able to see that human decision-making both preceded and accompanied a model throughout its lifecycle to develop trust..&quot;User-first&quot; approaches should be applied to AI-driven solutions. Understandable AI blends engineers' technical skills with UI/UX specialists' design usability understanding as well as product developers' people-centric design. People may participate in the decision-making procedure in an AI-driven organization if the AI is intelligible. The incorporation of non-data scientists into the creation and design of AI products is also crucial to the Understandable AI process, demonstrating the importance of workforce upskilling for the future AI economy..To assess whether a financial transaction is fraudulent, for example, an algorithm could be utilized. An algorithm is a logical solution to this challenge, given the millions of transactions that take place every day. AI can wrongly identify transactions as fraudulent (false positive) or miss a fraudulent activity (false negative) which carries the risk of losing a customer's confidence. For this Understandable AI needs to be in place..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial Intelligence is becoming a common topic of discussion in most occupation circles. We’ve heard many negatives and dire predictions about possible and probably job losses, but the facts are few and not easy to understand. Pierce Ivory, Marketing Director at Advance SystemsOpens a new window , explains how artificial intelligence will affect our careers, our work, and our economic outcomes
Your Opinion? Doesn’t Really Matter
Most of us have opinions as to whether Artificial Intelligence(AI) will ‘’make or break’’ us. This is especially true in the tech and policy arenas.
One side of the opinions declares that many or most of us will be out of jobs when Artificial Intelligence becomes smart enough to take over jobs.
The second side opinion declares that Artificial Intelligence will likely do away with many of the boring, redundant jobs since AI will be able to do those jobs much quicker, eliminate mistakes and ultimately save companies money through lack of salaries and benefits.
What’s your opinion? Know what? It really doesn’t matter. Artificial Intelligence is here to stay and will be used by companies. This leaves many employees with difficult decisions to make about their future and their careers.
The Future is Near
Artificial Intelligence is quickly changing the ‘’future of work,’’ and it will eliminate many aspects of most jobs. Even worse, as AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to overtake many of the difficult jobs.
Our ‘’future of work’’ can also be interpreted as meaning ‘’new and innovative ways of working’’ must be created and established since AI will be overtaking many of our current positions.
Could AI Train Humans?
One unique idea that has been circling innovative ideas is utilizing AI’s abilities to train humans. Is this really possible? Yes, it’s similar to many of the AI aids we now use, such as Google Maps. And, it’s possible that Artificial Intelligence could train humans. Why not take advantage of AI’s abilities since they are eliminating many of our human jobs? The training that AI can provide will result in humans learning more difficult and creative jobs.
A few companies are now on the path of making cloud-based training programs possible. They have done this by simply gathering massive amounts of data on one subject and categorized the data so that the data becomes a training tool.
This AI training is not done in a room with other students but is one that ‘’listens in’’ on conversations, such as sales and make recommendations to the ‘’student’’ about better words to use, suggests alternate tasks and makes other recommendation that will make sales more likely.
Is our future of work as humans making this training critical? Yes. Artificial intelligence will likely be able to do almost all current jobsOpens a new window  at some future point. The key to success as a human employee will be to have the skills that Artificial Intelligence has not yet conquered.
Artificial Intelligence Will Be Beneficial
There are many good points to Artificial Intelligence. Software startup expert Steve Ardire believes Artificial Intelligence will redesign the way organizations function. He says, “Human capital will start to shift from mundane tasks and transactions to higher-order and creative work. Along the way, we will see massive businesses where the technology transforms specific job functions.”
It’s important to remember that Artificial Intelligence does not have creative abilities and humans do. Many humans are very capable of creating and imagining many topics. According to Ardire, Artificial Intelligence will be about “people and machines working alongside each other to improve the way they work.”
If AI can work faster than humans and make fewer errors, it stands to reason that it will also help business growth. The world currently needs something to propel economic growth and Artificial Intelligence may be the answer. A very positive overall point is that AI will change how work is done while it also will help drive the knowledge level of humans in business.
Accenture believes that ‘’artificial intelligence could double annual economic growth rates in 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. This new relationship between man and machines could potentially impact businesses that results in increased labor productivity by up to 40 percent.’’
A significant portion of this increase is because people will be more efficient and need less time to create their work. Futurists believe that mundane tasks will be worked by artificial intelligence technologies and human will do what AI cannot do:  imagine, create and innovate.
Even though artificial intelligence will make some work outdated, there are many possible advantages for an improved economy. The end result will be the creation of more profitability for companies that can then increase wages for humans.
Artificial Intelligence Will Not Takeover an Entire Occupation
Better yet, artificial intelligence will seldom capture an entire occupation. There will be certain tasks that artificial intelligence can do quicker and better than humans, but most jobs will still need some human activities. In reality, business processes will be modified, and human jobs will be recharacterized.
Entire occupations will not be replaced by artificial intelligence, but it is likely that all occupations will be affected by AI. McKinsey Global Institute’s research predicts that 45% of human work activities could be replaced by automation. All occupations, including the most sophisticated, such as executives, physicians, and financial experts, now perform tasks and activities that could be done by artificial intelligence.
All companies in all industries should expect to re-evaluate all jobs and all processes that could be assisted by artificial intelligence. **Companies must take advantage of the potential improvements AI can provide. And, the advantages are much more than the money saved by utilizing artificial intelligence**. The benefits expected included increased production, with higher quality and better-quality reliability. Additionally, AI can perform tasks easily at extraordinarily high levels, while performing significantly below human labor costs. As a result, **movement of artificial intelligence into portions of most human jobs will become standard and those companies who can utilize the greatest amounts of AI will become the most profitable**.
Ultimately, artificial intelligence will become an important viable differentiator. Those companies who automate activities needed within industries and occupations and redefine the roles and process of each will be the most successful and profitable. And, those humans who are given opportunities to learn the more sophisticated skills that AI cannot learn, will be the most likely to move upwards quicker than artificial intelligence can learn to be more human.

It sounds like science fiction,” he told i. “Once that is possible it does not need me any more.”Similarly, Google made headlines around the world in 2015 when it showcased DeepDream, a neural network visualisation tool that generated nightmarish, psychedelic, hallucinogenic-like images from  ordinary pictures.",,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929'}, 'author': {'name': 'Rhiannon Williams', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/person/4aace2698e9f969a8fb5b61b1ad61fff', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/author/rhiannon-williams'}, 'headline': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine', 'datePublished': '2022-02-22T12:33:05+00:00', 'dateModified': '2022-02-22T12:34:12+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929'}, 'wordCount': 476, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#organization'}, 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/ImageObject/22bd05ff0ea994425d1f9ec9a5473ed11396ed31', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'width': 1024, 'height': 670}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'keywords': ['Art', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers', 'Copyright', 'Digital', 'Inventions'], 'articleSection': ['Arts', 'News', 'Technology'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929', 'name': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#website', 'type': 'WebSite'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'datePublished': '2022-02-22T12:33:05+00:00', 'dateModified': '2022-02-22T12:34:12+00:00', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'width': 2162, 'height': 1414, 'caption': 'A Recent Entrance to Paradise (""Work"") was made by the Creativitiy Machine (Photo: Steven Thaler/Creativity Machine)'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'News', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/category/news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Technology', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/category/news/technology'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'name': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk#website', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk', 'name': 'inews.co.uk', 'description': 'Latest UK and world news, politics, lifestyle and sport, with analysis and opinion from the i paper.

Can A.I.-Generated Art Receive Copyright Protection? U.S. Authorities Say No, Citing a Lack of ‘Human Authorship’
The copyright office has turned down an work of AI art for the second time.





Stephen Thaler has unsuccessfully sought copyright protection for the AI-created A Recent Entrance to Paradise.

The U.S. Copyright Office has once again rejected a request for copyright protection on a work created by artificial intelligence, affirming an earlier decision that found the work “lacks the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.”
The work in question, A Recent Entrance to Paradise, was put forth twice by Stephen Thaler on behalf of the “Creativity Machine,” the stated “author” of the work.
In his first application, made in November 2018, Thaler attached a note for the copyright office stating that the work “was autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine” and said he was “seeking to register this computer-generated work as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine.”
After it was rejected, Thaler subsequently requested that the office reconsider its decision by arguing that “the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law.”
But the office re-evaluated the claims and again concluded, in a decision dated February 14, that the work “lacked the required human authorship” and that Thaler had “provided no evidence on sufficient creative input or intervention by a human author in the work.” 
“​​We disagree with the Copyright Office’s decision and plan to appeal,” Thaler’s Los Angeles-based attorney Ryan Abbott told Artnet News. “AI is able to make functionally creative output in the absence of a traditional human author and protecting AI-generated works with copyright is vital to promoting the production of socially valuable content. Providing this protection is required under current legal frameworks.”
Thaler’s effort is “an academic project” seeking to test copyright standards, Abbott said. Thaler is currently making similar efforts with patents, which have been granted to A.I.-generated projects in some countries (Australia and South Africa), but not in others (the U.S. and U.K.)
A Recent Entrance to Paradise is part of a series Thaler has described as a “simulated near-death experience,” in which an algorithm uses pictures to create trippy images and an invented narrative about the afterlife, according to The Verge, which first reported the copyright office’s recent decision. 
Abbott expects this to become an even more important issue in coming years as AI continues to improve in generating human-competitive output.

 A U.S. copyright body has ruled that a work of art created by artificial intelligence can't be classified as intellectual property and get copyright protection. So now, there is no shortage of AI programs out there that can do everything from creating abstract art and doling out ethical advice to summarising research papers in a few lines and upscale images. Take, for example, The Dream, an AI-fueled app from a Canadian startup that can create stunning digital art of mythical warriors, space warfare and more. 






 But the biggest question is if these artistic products can be protected under copyright laws. One of the most hotly contested topics happens to be deepfakes generated by algorithms, which can either create an altogether new person or mimic the likeness of a living individual. In 2020, Hip-ho mogul Jay-Z filed for copyright strikes against a YouTube channel that deepfaked his signature voice to recite acts like Shakesperean dramas. Debates around AI copyrights have been raging on for a while, but there might finally be a decisive turn of events to settle it. 

 Related: Who Is QAnon? AI Might Have Just Figured It Out 






 Addressing a petition covering digital art created by an algorithm named Creativity Machine, the U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that the painting called ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" can not be granted copyright protection in the name of its AI creator. The court ruling notes that the country's copyright laws only protect ""the fruits of intellectual labor"" that ""are founded in the creative powers of the [human] mind."" One might argue that building an AI requires human intellect and effort, but as per the court, the process of creating artwork can not be fully automated to AI and still be covered under copyright laws. To simplify the ruling, it states that a work of art derived from a machine or an automated mechanical process that doesn't require ""any creative input or intervention from a human author"" won't qualify for copyright law protections. 


 A Human Touch For All Creations 
  

    

  






 The legal copyright argument is that a work of art must be original and should be a tangible expression of a human being's ideas. In the domain of art, this covers everything from literary work and paintings to photographs and digital art. Additionally, a work of art must originate from a human being to get copyright law recognition. The court adds that authorship is a crucial distinction here, and it must involve human endeavor. In 2020, the European Patent Office ruled that an AI can not copyright its creations, noting that an inventor must be a human and not the machine. Also, in 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office made it clear that only humans can be legally credited as inventors. In September last year, The England and Wales Court of Appeals also arrived at the decision that an AI can't be classified as the inventor of a patent. 






 But the laws are not hard-coded, and a lot depends on how the argument is presented. For example, if a person aims to copyright a device or creation made with the help of an AI, even if the human input happens to be minimal, the fact that human effort was made will slot in favorably with copyright laws. So how does the poetry composed by something like Sophia, the humanoid robot, fare in light of the U.S. court ruling? It most likely will fail the copyright test. But if the mind behind its inherent language processing algorithms argues that the robot's poetry is based on Dante's work and was not solely an ingenious AI creation, the debate will get confusing.

Both AI and robotic solutions make it possible to improve construction efficiency and reduce costs
The robotics market will expand to US$8 billion in 2030, with a projected CAGR of 32.5%
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction worker fatalities rose 5% in 2019, totaling 1,061 deaths

READ NEXTEmerging tech may allow robots to take over the world
The workplace is supposed to be a safe environment. However, industrial accidents still occur, due in part to the failure of employers and employees to take proper safety measures.
The construction sector, in particular, remains one of the most dangerous industries in the United States, accounting for a high percentage of workplace fatalities. With an increased number of large construction projects, safety concerns are on the rise too.     
Construction sites are dangerous, no matter how advanced the tools available to human workers. The machines and equipment used in construction work can be weighty and hard to handle, especially for humans who lack superhuman strength, coordination, and agility.
High construction fatalities in the US 
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction worker fatalities rose 5% in 2019, totaling 1,061 deaths – making this the highest number of worker deaths recorded since 2007.
Despite safety measures taken to prevent accidents, workers still sustain severe injuries. In 2019, there were 229,410 injuries due to contact with objects and equipment, severe enough that they resulted in time away from work. Meanwhile, 1,270 US workers died in work-related crashes involving motor vehicles (24% of all deaths).
Harnessing AI solutions
Artificial intelligence (AI) may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of construction, but it is a technology that could change the face of this often-treacherous industry. 
The application of artificial intelligence is spreading rapidly in the enterprise space, with AI solutions making it possible to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, the adoption rate of harnessing AI maintenance solutions is still growing at a snail’s pace. 
The implementation of AI solutions involves significant challenges. First and foremost, companies need to integrate the technology into their existing infrastructure. Legacy systems cannot support AI solutions in many cases, which requires organizations to replace outdated technologies with new ones.
Firms incorporate AI with robotic add-ons
While most companies are still trying to figure out how to incorporate AI into their businesses, others have already started using the technology for a wide range of purposes. 
Most recently, Construction Robotics announced its new cobot, a brand new addition to their line of robotic arms used for construction purposes. The main goal of these cobot arms is to improve safety on construction sites by reducing manual labor and saving time for both workers and managers. 
RinTinto uses artificial intelligence (AI) to extract actionable insights to improve the safety and efficiency of their mines. AI is harnessed to perform a variety of tasks – from generating orebody models to organizing equipment dispatch to predicting maintenance needs.
Robotic scene growing exponentially
In the next five to 10 years, robotics will become a key player in making buildings. According to a new report from advisory firm ABI Research, the cobot market, which had a global valuation of US$475 million in 2020, will expand to US$8 billion in 2030, with a projected CAGR of 32.5%.

The construction industry will reap the benefits of this growth, as more robots are deployed onto building sites. Construction robots, such as those from FBR, formerly known as Fastbrick Robotics, can significantly improve efficiency and safety in construction projects. 
Meanwhile, the BotX Welder developed by Hirebotics and utilized Universal Robots’ UR10e collaborative robot arm, debuted in 2019. The BotX enables manufacturers to automate arc welding on small batch runs not feasible for traditional automatons.
AI and robotic solutions are set to transform the construction industry for both better and worse. On one hand, these innovations can be used to automate repetitive tasks and minimize accidents — reducing workers’ injuries. On the other hand, many jobs in this industry require a high degree of creativity and hands-on skill that few AI and robotic applications have been able to master.  With so many lives at stake, it’s high time for big changes in the industry.

Dr Vivienne Ming is a world-renowned theoretical neuroscientist known for her amazing work developing and using artificial intelligence (AI). A tech-hacker, inventor and innovator, Vivienne uses her knowledge to enact positive change – such as by using AI to challenge norms and improve outcomes around mental wellbeing, diversity, and workplace development. 
We were lucky enough to spend an hour with Vivienne talking about the mind-boggling potential impacts of AI on the world of HR. Yet before we can properly delve into this topic, we must first understand what artificial intelligence is. For many of us, the first thing that may spring to mind is a dystopian Hollywood depiction – like the evil sentient AI ‘Skynet’ from the Terminator movies. This is far from the current reality: ‘AI is just a tool. It is not an intelligent being,’ Vivienne assures us. Rather, it’s when a computer or robot can perform tasks that are usually reserved for intelligent beings; for example, identifying images or patterns and trends in data. 
Done right, the possibilities are endless.
The opportunities
‘When we use AI, we can see so much of what’s going on in an organisation, yet still treat people as individuals,’ Vivienne enthuses. ‘If I want to build a team, I can fit people together through complementary diversity. There’s no way a person in HR could truly get to know all the individuals of an organisation, but it is possible for these systems to know two people would work well together, even though they’ve never met.’
An initiative like this involves significant initial investment as a large amount of multi-dimensional data is required. For instance, Vivienne collected information on staff members’ previous work experience, cultural upbringing and socio-economic background, as well as conducting psychometric testing and more. This data was then manipulated using specific algorithms to identify trends and other key findings.  
So armed, the AI Vivienne built to leverage complementary diversity consistently created teams that outperformed those put together by traditional methods. ‘When you look at complementary diversity, you find that those teams come up with new solutions to problems more quickly and more frequently. Using AI as a tool in finding good new connections is important,’ she says. ‘Take a team that’s worked together for a long time – say a highly prolific scientific team that writes major impactful papers. In time their publication rate slowly increases, but the uniqueness of their work goes down. But the moment a new person joins with complementary diversity to the others, their “impactfulness” jumps right up again.’
‘Imagine doing that for the Australian Government. It’s about mixing and remixing. You don’t want to disrupt a high-performing team, but if you shift the right person out and bring the right new person in, it gives the team whole new life.’
With continuous testing and adding ever-more data, the AI then helped identify qualities that were more likely to lead to high-performing teams. Interestingly, Vivienne found the two strongest predictors of a team’s collective intelligence were, firstly people’s average emotional intelligence, and secondly whether they had the ability to see things from other people’s perspectives. This combination led to psychological safety, building trust, and embracing various types of diversity which strengthened the team. Even something as simple as gender diversity can make a big difference. ‘Teams with similar balances of men and women always outperform teams that have an imbalance.’
In another role, AI helped Vivienne identify an issue where young women working in technical fields weren’t benefitting from mentorships with older males, and in fact were experiencing increased stress. ‘In aggregate numbers the employer couldn’t see it, but our systems could identify and reveal that by showing recurring similarities – like those between negative mentee experiences and the demographic information of mentors.’
Vivienne follows this with an example of work at a more personal level, looking at mobility – specifically, using someone’s phone to track the way they moved through physical space. This data and how it changed over time, in combination with analysis of online conversations, could predict an oncoming episode of manic depression. ‘When we analyse the data we can actually predict stress levels, absenteeism, heart levels, post-partum depression… Even day-to-day stress rates associated with individuals by looking at language and movement patterns.’ Vivienne is clearly motivated by the potential to support staff to more effectively manage and enhance their mental health outcomes.
The risks
Vivienne is not ignorant of the risks that such technology and information provides. ‘We should talk about the good and the bad of AI hand-in-hand, because they’re just reflections of each other.’
One pitfall is in the method the technology is used. Ideally, Vivienne explains, AI should be used for augmentation, not substitution. Outsourcing decisions to AI instead of using it as a tool is a recipe for disaster. ‘There’s an idea that these systems can’t be biased… they’re just as biased as we are, but in different ways. When we see the errors algorithms make, they’re often absurd.’
A second significant risk lies in the type, detail and volume of data collected – which can be deeply personal – and how employers will use it. ‘That’s a very reasonable fear,’ Vivienne agrees. 
‘Many, many companies are deeply invested in using data sets on their own employees to shift ideas about work – for example, unionisation. If they could detect people who are more likely to unionise, they may not hire those people in the first place. That’s scary. And it’s a genuine goal of many big companies.
‘I’m first trying to validate those fears… Employers have a huge power imbalance with respect to their employees. We need ways of balancing this out again. It would be wonderful if HR departments did that but, in the private sector at least, HR is often there to protect the company.’
Vivienne says there is definitely a role for government to look at issues of data and AI abuse. But ultimately, she wants to empower individuals and give them control of their own data – perhaps in a similar way to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
‘It’s something all organisations should be thinking about.’
The timeline
When asked when we’ll start seeing AI used more broadly in HR, Vivienne predicted that we’re more likely to see progress in areas that aren’t as heavily regulated by government. ‘Hiring has strong legal protections. But in health and stress management – that’s where we’re seeing faster adoptions by organisations.
‘AI is coming into HR on the edges, but it’s beginning to have more profound impacts. Progressively more work, particularly work done by university-educated professionals, is seeing automation eating away at it. A perfect example is a radiologist. This job is high-skill, high-training, but still routine. An AI can identify an abnormality on an x-ray. AI presents a really profound threat to a classically high-paying job.’
Anywhere that people are doing lots of routine labour is at risk of being overtaken by AI, Vivienne argued. But by the same token, wages and opportunities for creative labour are increasing. ‘If there’s one thing I can get across, it’s that AI is just a tool,’ Vivienne summarises. ‘It’s what we do with it that actually matters. There will always be a role for creative people. 
‘The line I often use is that “An artist without a tool is hobbled. But a tool without an artist is nothing”.’
For large organisations including government, HR needs to start planning for an AI-ready future. We should be looking to embrace the opportunities that AI presents, with eyes wide open to the risks – especially protecting the rights of our people.

Artificial intelligence based projects to shift towards employee productivity
By 2025, the market of artificial intelligence is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2 per cent over five years, with total revenues of $7.8 billion in India
As more companies realise the role artificial intelligence can play in providing a competitive advantage and in sculpting the future of work, the focus of artificial intelligence (AI) based projects in India will shift towards cost efficiencies and employee productivity, according to a Deloitte report.
The Deloitte 2022 Technology, Media and Entertainment and Telecom report showed that the convergence of computing processing, connectivity and artificial intelligence will bring about more engagement between businesses and customers.
Currently, most applications of artificial intelligence are in areas where there is a strong human element, like human resources, or where efficiencies can be gained, like contact centres, said P N Sudarshan, partner and TMT industry leader, Deloitte India.
There is a shift underway to extend this to areas like education to try and accelerate the learning process. By 2025, the market of artificial intelligence is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2 per cent over five years, with total revenues of $7.8 billion in India, predicts International Data Corporation (IDC).
Globally, the priorities around AI are shifting towards regulation and securing emerging technologies like AI, said Duncan Stewart, director of TMT Research, Deloitte Canada.
Homomorphic encryption and federated learning are among the set of privacy enhancing technologies that are being deployed towards solving the problem of how artificial intelligence tasks can be performed more privately and securely.
India is well poised to latch on to non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, among other trends. Entertainment and sport NFTs could potentially disrupt the industry if regulation is favourable. The market is likely to be more volume focused, driven by fractional NFTs, which would also lower the entry barrier, it said.
The ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips means India has the potential to tap into its domestic market and set up domestic semiconductor and electronics manufacturing facilities in the next three-five years.
“As the ecosystem matures in the medium to long term, we expect India to emerge as a strong regional hub in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing”, Sudarshan said.
“The government’s recent announcement on the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries has the potential to create an end-to-end ecosystem for manufacturing electronic products. We expect the broader shift to digital to continue in 2022 and drive the industry growth in the future”, he added.
When it comes to addressing the top three challenges for at-scale treatment of mental health in India – awareness and stigma, access to medical professionals, and cost-effective treatment, Technology will also play a significant role, and this will gain more widespread applications in the next few years.

One decision about your workforce can have a massive impact on your business—whom to hire, whom to promote, and when to cut back—can be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful business venture. With so much pressure to make the right workforce decisions, HR teams are starting to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide decision-making processes in order to increase accuracy and efficiency, while decreasing the risk of error.
For example, AI can be used within an HR department to identify a pool of applicants that are most qualified for a job, without letting biases about a person’s age, gender, ethnicity, or background influence the decision. Or it can analyze payrolls within an organization to spot salary discrepancies to help close the gender pay gap.
And while AI systems can identify a solution faster than the human brain, how much of the decision-making process should be delegated to AI? Are there some decisions that should always be reserved for humans? My father Earl Hunt did pioneering work in AI and noted, “We discovered pretty quickly that computers aren’t very good at mimicking how the human brain actually works. But they are very good at solving complex problems that the human brain could never solve.”
So this all begs the question: What’s the difference between letting a computer or a human call the shots? Well, let’s take a look at what those differences might be, and what they could mean for your business:
What kind of problems we’re looking at
Let me start off by saying, AI renders numerable benefits—like tackling the complex problems my father described, but humans have one thing that AI doesn’t: adaptability.  We’re naturally good at identifying problems worth solving, and there is no problem we cannot meaningfully think about even if we cannot always solve it. In contrast, AI can only solve problems that it is told to solve by humans. More importantly, it can only effectively address problems that meet certain specific conditions, which are, interestingly enough, the kinds of problems that humans commonly struggle to solve.
How and why both approach problems differently
AI and humans not only solve different kinds of problems, but they also approach solving them very uniquely as well. Humans are adept at developing solutions without fully defining the problem, which makes us amazingly flexible and considerably prone to errors. For AI it is the opposite because the first requirement for the use of AI is to have a precise empirical definition of what you are trying to model, identify, or predict. For example, in order to use AI to predict employee performance, you must first define what you mean by “performance” in highly measurable terms.
That would never happen if a human being were to look at a problem. That’s because humans are comfortable making decisions based on very small amounts of data, since we find it hard to process large amounts of it. Sometimes, we can take that small amount of data and make intuitive impressions that are amazingly accurate, while other times they are totally wrong. In contrast, most AI methods require very large datasets containing matched pairs of “predictor data” and “criteria data.” For example, to model work characteristics causing employee stress, you would need predictor data that measured characteristics that might cause stress, as well as criteria data on these same employees that measured stress levels. Not to mention, you’ll probably need data on thousands of employees for an AI program to create an accurate model.
AI is very effective at sorting through large datasets to find small bits of meaningful information, but it cannot find meaningful information unless it is reflected in mathematical patterns in the data. Of course, AI is amazingly good at finding treasures of useful information in massive piles of garbage data, but it can’t find treasures in data that is entirely composed of garbage.
AI is also a powerful problem-solving method for situations where outcomes have precise empirical definitions, there is access to large matched predictor-criteria datasets, and small but meaningful relationships exist between predictor and criteria data. Thanks to the amount of data made available through human capital management (HCM) technology, we are finding more and more situations that meet these conditions.  Examples include modeling relationships between applicant characteristics and post-hire retention, job characteristics and employee turnover, and employee work characteristics and absenteeism and healthcare costs. But there are many HCM situations that do not meet and may never meet these conditions; for example, using AI to predict notoriously poorly defined outcomes like performance and potential.
It is important to know when AI is likely to work and when it will not work. The kinds of problems AI is good at solving are usually the kinds of problems humans find difficult or impossible to solve, and vice-versa. AI should be positioned as a tool to support better decision making, but it cannot be a replacement for human intelligence.
Why it’s important to define a difference between the two
Anyone who has read science fiction knows the danger of turning over too much power to machines. Though both man and machine solve problems in different ways and offer unique benefits when it comes to problem-solving, many people harbor concern about computers making decisions that determine what they can do in life. This includes decisions that impact our employment and careers. Saying a company is making HCM decisions using AI could create anxiety for many employees and candidates, so it’s important to draw a distinction between the two, and show the value each bring to the decision-making process. Start by avoiding using words like AI that people associate with science fiction, and instead used terms that are more boring yet more accurate such as “mathematically developed models.”
Manage expectations around artificial intelligence in HCM
AI is about using complex mathematical techniques to address specific types of HCM problems that impact organizational performance. These mathematic models do not work everywhere, and sometimes there’s just nothing that can replace the human touch, but in the right situations, they work extremely well. So, in order to be able to successfully leverage by AI and human thinking during the decision-making process, it’s important that you first and foremost set expectations. Avoid hyping up AI, and focus on educating your business on how to combine complex math, sophisticated computer programming, large data sets, and of course, the human brain, to improve certain types of HCM practices. That way, both resources can be used to their potential, and you can make the best decisions possible for your business.

Is it against women even in the digital world?.Even though the first person to write an algorithm was a woman in the 19th century, Artificial Intelligence may now be discriminating against women. Artificial intelligence may inherit, or even amplify, the biases of its creators. and most AI hasn't heard about the global feminist movement. artificial intelligence has issued a stark warning against the use of race- and gender-biased algorithms for making critical decisions.AI bias occurs when results cannot be generalized widely. We often think of bias resulting from preferences or exclusions in training data, but bias can also be introduced by how data is obtained, how algorithms are designed, and how AI outputs are interpreted. In 2018, researchers discovered that popular facial recognition services from Microsoft, IBM, and Face++ can discriminate based on gender and race. Microsoft was unable to detect darker-skinned females 21% of the time, while IBM and Face++ wouldn't work on darker-skinned females in roughly 35% of cases. There are so many AI gender biases happening now, this impact on the daily life of all women: from job searches to security checkpoints at airports..How do AI algorithms discriminate against women?.An employer was advertising for a job opening in a male-dominated industry via a social media platform. The platform's ad algorithm pushed jobs to only men to maximize returns on the number and quality of applicantsA white man who goes to an airport, he will quickly pass, but a woman with dark skin will be waiting in a long line.&quot;In job recruitment processing industry is male-dominated, the majority of the resumes used to teach the AI were from men, which ultimately led the AI to discriminate against recommending womenFacebook posted ads for better-paid jobs to white men, while women and people of color were shown ads for less well-paid jobs.Face-analysis AI programs display gender and racial bias, if you are a woman with dark skin, it will work worse. demonstrating low errors for determining the gender of lighter-skinned men but high errors in determining gender for darker-skinned womenVoice-activated technology in cars systems is tone-deaf to women's voices.Google searches for 'black girls' to produced sexist and pornographic results..Amazon AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women:.One of the best-known cases of discrimination based on the use of Artificial Intelligence was Amazon's attempt at automating their recruitment system. their new recruiting engine did not like women. Amazon's experimental recruiting engine followed the same pattern as Top U.S. tech companies that have yet to close the gender gap in hiring. Amazon's algorithm penalized resumes that included words related to the female gender, even in the hobbies of the candidates. In 2018, it came to light that the American multinational had discarded its AI tool, with which it had been selecting candidates applying for jobs for four years because it was sexist..That is because Amazon's computer models had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over 10 years. Most of these resumes were men's, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry, creating a machine-learned bias that favored male applicants..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

As Google continues to leverage more artificial intelligence and machine learning in Google Search, one may wonder in what ways does AI and machine learning help Google Search perform its daily tasks. Since 2015, when Google introduced its first AI into search named RankBrain, Google has continued to deploy AI systems to better understand language and thus improve the search results Google presents to its searches.
Several months ago we sent Google a number of questions around how Google uses its AI in search, including RankBrain, neural matching, BERT and Google’s latest AI breakthrough – MUM. We’ve come up with more of an understanding of when Google uses AI, which AI does what in Google Search, how these various AI algorithms may work together, how they have changed over the years and what, if anything, search marketers need to know when it comes to how Google uses AI in search.
We spoke with Danny Sullivan, the Public Liaison for Google Search, to help with the answers to many of these questions. In short, RankBrain, neural matching and BERT are used in Google’s ranking system across many, if not most, queries and look at understanding the language of both the query and content it is ranking. However, MUM is not currently used for ranking purposes, it is currently only used for COVID vaccine naming and powers the related topics in videos results.
It starts by writing content for humans
You hear it all the time from Google representatives and from many SEOs: write content for humans. In the older days of SEO, when the algorithms were maybe simpler, you would have many SEOs who would craft content for each and every search engine (back then there were dozens of different search engines). Now, there is primarily Google, with a little bit of Bing and some ruffling from DuckDuckGo – but the algorithms are much more complex and with machine learning and AI, the algorithms understand language more like a human would understand language.
So the advice Google has given is write for humans, and that you can’t optimize your site for BERT or any AI. If you write content that humans understand, then the algorithms and AI search engines use will also understand it. In short, this article is not aimed at trying to give you SEO tips on how to optimize your sites for any specific AI, but rather to communicate how Google uses AI in Google Search.
Overview of AI used in Google Search
RankBrain. It starts with RankBrain, Google’s first attempt at using AI in search dates back to 2015. Google told us RankBrain helps Google understand how words are related to concepts and can take a broad query and better define how that query relates to real-world concepts. While it launched in 2015 and was used in 15% of queries, Google said it is now, in 2022, widely used in many queries and in all languages and regions. RankBrain does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2015Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languagesVery commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how RankBrain is used, if you search for “what’s the title of the consumer at the highest level of a food chain,” Google’s systems learn from seeing those words on various pages that the concept of a food chain may have to do with animals, and not human consumers. By understanding and matching these words to their related concepts, RankBrain helps Google understand that you’re looking for what’s commonly referred to as an “apex predator.”
Neural matching. Neural matching was the next AI Google released for search, it was released in 2018 and then expanded to the local search results in 2019. In fact, we have an article explaining the differences between RankBrain and neural matching over here. Google told us neural matching helps Google understand how queries relate to pages by looking at the entire query or content on the page and understanding it within the context of that page or query. Today, neural matching is used in many, if not most, queries, for all languages, in all regions, across most verticals of search. Neural matching does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2018Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languagesVery commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how neural matching is used, if you search for “insights how to manage a green,” for example. Google said “if a friend asked you this, you’d probably be stumped.” “But with neural matching, we’re able to make sense of this quizzical search. By looking at the broader representations of concepts in the query — management, leadership, personality and more — neural matching can decipher that this searcher is looking for management tips based on a popular, color-based personality guide,” Google told us.
BERT. BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, came in 2019, it is a neural network-based technique for natural language processing pre-training. Google told us BERT helps Google understand how combinations of words express different meanings and intents, including looking at the sequence of words on a page, so even seemingly unimportant words in your queries are counted for. When BERT launched, it was used in 10% of all English queries but expanded to more languages and used in almost all English queries early on. Today it is used in most queries and is supported in all languages. BERT does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2019Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languages but Google said BERT “plays critical role in almost every English query”Very commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how BERT is used, if you search for “if you search for “can you get medicine for someone pharmacy,” BERT helps us understand that you’re trying to figure out if you can pick up medicine for someone else. Before BERT, we took that short preposition for granted, mostly surfacing results about how to fill a prescription,” Google told us.
MUM. MUM, Multitask Unified Model, is Google’s most recent AI in search. MUM was introduced in 2021 and then expanded again at the end of 2021 for more applications, with a lot of promising uses for it in the future. Google told us that MUM helps Google not just with understanding languages but also generating languages, so it can be used to understand variations in new terms and languages. MUM is not used for any ranking purposes right now in Google Search but does support all languages and regions.
Year Launched: 2021Used For Ranking: NoNot query or languages specificWorks for all languages but Google not used for ranking purposes todayUsed for a limited number of purposes
Currently, MUM is used to improve searches for COVID-19 vaccine information, and Google said it is “looking forward to offering more intuitive ways to search using a combination of both text and images in Google Lens in the coming months.”
AI used together in search but may be specialized for search verticals
Danny Sullivan from Google also explained that while these are individual AI-based algorithms, they often work together to help with ranking and understanding the same query. 
Google told us that all of these AI systems “are used to understand language including the query and potentially relevant results,” adding that “they are not designed to act in isolation to analyze just a query or a page.” Previously, it may have been assumed and understood that one AI system may have looked more at understanding the query and not the content on the page, but that is not the case, at least not in 2022.
Google also confirmed that in 2022 RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are used globally, in all languages that Google Search operates in.
And when it comes to web search versus local search versus images, shopping and other verticals, Google explained that RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are used for web search. Other modes or verticals of Google Search such as images or shopping mode use separate, specialized AI systems, according to Google.
What about core updates and AI
As explained above, Google uses RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT in most queries you enter into Google Search, but Google also has core updates. The Google broad core updates that Google rolls out a few times per year is often noticed by site owners, publishers, and SEOs more than when Google releases these larger AI-based systems.
But Google said these all can work together, with core updates. Google said these three, RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are the larger AI systems they have. But they have many AI systems within search and some within the core updates that Google rolls out.
Google told us they do have other machine learning systems in Google Search. “RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are just some of our more powerful and prominent systems,” Google said. Google added, “there are other AI elements that can impact core updates that don’t pertain to those specific three AI systems.”

Every significant technology disruption has led to fundamental changes in how businesses are run, what products and services are sold, and how customers engage with enterprises. Personal computers and the Internet propelled new business models and value chains, while smartphones and cloud computing enabled a shift toward more mobile, on-demand services.


Technology also enabled us as humans to connect in new ways, often with little or no regard for our differences in a physical location. We are on the cusp of another era of disruption, based on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotic process automation (RPA) that promises to reshape further the nature of work and how we collaborate.

Each technology wave has brought tremendous opportunity to those who understand how to leverage these new capabilities. This time around is no different: businesses that master this digitization trend will better serve customers, lower costs and drive revenue.

PROMOTED
As digital technology infiltrates every corner of the business, companies must shift focus from simply automating existing processes to fully digitizing their operations and elevating the role of the Chief Digital Officer. That means not only transforming how they engage with customers but also fundamentally changing the way they operate internally by adopting new technologies that help employees work more effectively and collaboratively.

Natural language processing, computer vision, AI engineering, autonomic systems, Generative AI, and workforce augmentation are some of the new trends Gartner emphasized. Those technologies help make sense of information generated by employees, customers, machines and things to support better decision-making across industries.  The IoT makes it possible to connect physical objects into the digital world through embedded sensors that allow real-time operations visibility. Mobile and wearable devices enable workers and customers to communicate and transact anytime, anywhere.

These disruptive technologies can help companies acquire and retain customers, create new business models and drive revenue growth — but only if they are implemented correctly.  Businesses need systems that connect across internal functions and the customer experience. They need solutions that collaborate with other enterprise applications to provide the correct information to the right people at the right time. And they need security that can keep up with employees' increasing demands for mobility and collaboration. This article will create a roadmap at how end-to-end digital automation and autonomy bring together business strategy, scalable operating models and the right mix of tools and technologies to help companies achieve impact with digital transformation.

Extreme Customer Experience 
Customers no longer tolerate substandard or cookie-cutter services. They desire intuitive, seamless, and personal interactions. This is where integration and orchestration come in handy. 
This next generation of automation uses machine learning and data science tools to deliver extreme personalization and customer experiences. It provides conversational interfaces powered by advanced knowledge graphs, text-to-speech and deep learning systems.
According to the CEO of the Everest Group, Peter Bendor-Samuel, “ Automating a process is the most cost-effective approach to labor and yields the maximum amount of savings. Implementing a Voice Response Unit (VRU) system is at the heart of this approach. VRUs connect to IVR (interactive voice response) systems for customers to make choices or direct a transaction. The system gives a customer a set of alternatives from which to narrow down the reason for the call so the system can funnel the customer to the right person in the company.”
Moreover, cognitive and virtual assistants like Amelia, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, or Microsoft Cortana are taking center stage in this new world where customer experience is everything. They make interactions more straightforward and personalized through intelligent, context-sensitive interactions.
Business Leaders are responsible for Transformation
Previously, IT leaders and CIOs handled routine automation, eventually implemented in other business units areas. The invention of low-code development platforms that don't require heavy programming knowledge has revolutionized how automation is implemented.
Business leaders can now use automation to build multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder cross-functional teams that can turn data into insight and action at speed by partnering with us. Business leaders always link their investments to business value creation back to business advantages — they understand how automation will benefit all stakeholders of an organization, including its consumers and staff.
It's  also essential that an organization has sound execution capabilities and the ability to change rapidly — which we refer to as ""agility."" Open-source frameworks like Agile, Cloud Foundry and Microservices are part of hyper-agility trends.
Lastly, CDOs, CIOs and business leaders can use advanced automation tools to create repeatable, agile architectural models. According to CDO Trends, Data Enrichment is at the top of many CIO's priority lists for two reasons: The first is that it takes human beings out of the data acquisition process. This leads to the second reason: increasing automation increases accuracy and speed. ""When enrichment data is combined with source system data, the resulting data model can now include a complete picture of the data being mastered as seen by a subject matter expert. Enrichment data make sure you have enough data for effective mastering.""
As an organization builds capabilities with the help of CDOs, CIOs and IT leaders, those organizations must have a solid foundation to initiate from which they can support those new initiatives.  The essential function of enterprise architecture (EA) is to provide a blueprint of the critical importance of the technical and organizational components necessary to support business strategy and deliver value to customers and other stakeholders.

 Managing Talent Retention 
Talent management has become a key differentiator for enterprises. All of this needs to be supported and will need to be backed by world-class recruiting and retention approaches and strategies that foster subject matter expertise, diversity, inclusivity, and lifelong learning culture. The market has never been more competitive for people with Digital and AI skillset, and this trend is likely to continue for many years.
Automation accelerates employee happiness by allowing them to devote more time to higher-value collaborative and creative activities. Employees are more willing to stick around and assist in recruiting future talent when they feel recognized and supported.The concept image of handwriting HYPER AUTOMATION in white colour by chalk on rough blackboad from ...

Hyper automation 
Hyper automation is the process of automating the entire business ecosystem, with collaboration between machines and humans.  This platform focuses on driving operational excellence with digital technologies like robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Executives should stop seeing automation as composed of siloed units and independent elements. Instead, automation technologies should become pieces of the same puzzle that different areas of the enterprise leverage at the same time.  Moreover,  as digital technologies such as AI and RPA continue to mature, we'll see more intelligent automation — or ""hyper-automation"" — that provides context around the tasks being completed.  It's a business-driven framework for businesses and IT to identify, vet, and automate enterprise operations as possible.
By 2025, Gartner expects the market for this software to be worth nearly $860 billion. Hype automation will remain the driving force behind digital transformation in 2022 to increase accuracy and productivity.
AI will lead the way to hyper-automation, which involves many automated activities. Some of these activities include 


Process mining
Robotic process automation (RPA)
Low-code workflow platforms
Intelligent agents 
Intelligent document processing
Artificial intelligence (AI)


 
For example, American Fidelity, an insurance firm, has discovered tremendous time savings thanks to UiPath's RPA solutions despite some early resistance.  Employees were encouraged to playfully utilize the project slogan ""Drop the Drudgery"" to recognize that they could use RPA to complete tasks they probably didn't want to do in the first place. Employees used to read each email, tag it, and route it to the correct channel by hand, but thanks to RPA and machine learning, processing speeds were reduced from 45 hours to 3 seconds.
In addition, according to the CIO Magazine, “RPA is also replacing grunt work at immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP, which has seen a sharp uptick in business thanks to tech clients scrambling to hire staff on H-1B visas. The firm uses UiPath’s software to collect information, including wage data, as well as resumes and passports, from government websites such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor, Vince DiMascio, the firm’s CIO, told CIO.com at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium in May.
 
Agility MattersA businessman selecting a button on a futuristic display with a Agility  concept written on it.getty
To stay ahead of the curve, leaders must pick the proper machine learning tools pre-trained to deliver a return on investment to stay ahead of the curve.
To stay competitive, businesses must move fast. Enterprise officials may begin by assessing their automation maturity to ensure that the company automates intelligently and appropriately for their enterprise.
For example, it's essential to know where automation can have the most significant impact instead of automating every process. By prioritizing processes for automation, organizations can gain a better return on their investment while delivering better customer experiences at the same time.
Data Fabric 
A data fabric is a network of linked data sources connected to business objectives and KPIs, and it may be used to provide critical insights throughout the organization. According to MarketWatch, this market is anticipated to expand by more than 25% by 2025. 
For example, The MapR Data Management platform binds together “real-time, dead, and batch” data for collective analysis. The MapR data fabric enables the user to grant access to both existing applications or tools and new tools like Apache Drill. This platform enables access to “data in all forms” across “all locations.” The basic objective of MapR data fabric is to break down data silos for just-in-time access to all types of data, according to The Modern Data Fabric — What It Means to Your Business.
Not only is data fabric highly flexible and scalable, but it's also adaptable to more sophisticated applications. Machine learning (ML) models in data fabric systems allow better accessibility of the prepared data across models and applications while reducing data preparation time. Data fabric provisions “controlled access” to secure data, allowing for more efficient ML procedures when data is dispersed across an organization — on the cloud, on-premise, or at the Edge. When the proper data is fed to ML models at the right time, they can learn much more effectively.

In 2022, many enterprises will begin to use AI-driven applications in the metaverse. The metaverse is defined as an immersive, networked, 3D, virtual environment where people can socialize and access information. This exciting area includes virtual worlds and augmented reality experiences. Meta will significantly impact next-generation automation. Instead of interacting with different systems, customers will experience a cohesive end-to-end service in the metaverse due to the full scale of integration and orchestration capabilities.
The metaverse is forcing the development of digital ecology in which various software and portals interact, engage, and collaborate in an alternative Second world. Meta will construct a single, unified online experience for customers in 2022. 
For example, Meta and Microsoft are positioning themselves as leaders in the metaverse. Given that Facebook has renamed itself to reflect the metaverse trend, Meta may appear to be all-in on the metaverse phenomenon. That commitment to the subject and its Oculus Quest 2 VR headsets is proof of a more thorough dedication than simply changing names. Meanwhile, Microsoft is also focused on the metaverse, but it has made a total commitment to that end only relatively recently. Its latest purchase of Activision Blizzard shows that commitment. In the future, we can expect to see the cohesion of a digital virtual world with the proliferation of VR/AR headsets.
Edge Computing  Intelligencetechnology and innovation conceptgetty
This is another critical trend that businesses must prepare for now.
Edge  Computing intelligence in enterprises establishes closed-loop actions for managing company operations in the most optimized way. Edge computing intelligence helps continuously assess and predict potential risks in creating a solution and eliminating threats.
Essentially, edge intelligence accelerates products and services at the edge to resolve resolutions of problems faster. This particular integration helps eliminate the usage of third-party tools. 
The Way Forward
While the trends mentioned above will undoubtedly impact enterprises and businesses, they're not going to happen overnight.
As these technologies become more widely adopted, organizations must start preparing by developing the skills and competencies that their employees need to work in a digital workplace environment where AI agents and automated systems collaborate to provide customers with an exceptional end-to-end service experience. Digital learning platforms can simulate real-life scenarios and provide employees with a realistic work environment that's more cost-effective and accessible.
Integrating and orchestrating artificial intelligence capabilities will help eliminate third-party tools and expedite market new products.
Elevating the role of the CDO will help in this regard by providing a single point of accountability to oversee the digital transformation, including future trends in AI and automation.

AI in banking is maturing, bringing the potential for higher-complexity solutions that generate positive ROI across business segments. Adoption of AI solutions in banking has become more mainstream: A majority of financial services companies say they've implemented the technology in business domains like risk management (56%) and revenue generation through new products and processes (52%), per the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum. As AI gains popularity in banking, financial institutions (FIs) are building on their existing solutions to solve increasingly complex challenges.

Most banks (80%) are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI and machine learing, per an OpenText survey of financial services professionals. In fact, many banks are planning to deploy solutions enabled by AI: 75% of respondents at banks with over $100 billion in assets say they're currently implementing AI strategies, compared with 46% at banks with less than $100 billion in assets, per a UBS Evidence Lab report seen by Insider Intelligence. Certain AI use cases have already gained prominence across banks' operations, with chatbots in the front office and anti-payments fraud in the middle office the most mature. Banks can use AI to transform the customer experience by enabling frictionless, 24/7 customer service interactions — but AI in banking applications isn't just limited to retail banking services. The back and middle offices of investmentbanking and all other financial services for that matter could also benefit from AI.Applications of AI in BankingThe three main channels where banks can use artificial intelligence to save on costs are front office (conversational banking), middle office (fraud detection and risk management) and back office (underwriting).In this report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies the most meaningful AI and machine learning applications across banks' front and middle offices. We also discuss the winning AI strategies used by fintechs and legacy financial institutions so far, as well as provide recommendations for how banks can best approach an AI-enabled digital transformation.The companies mentioned in this report are: Capital One, Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Personetics, Quantexa, and U.S. Bank

Several professionals and companies across the globe today have understood that the adoption of smart technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) is actively changing workplaces. There are many applications of AI throughout nearly every profession and industry, and human resources careers are no exception.
A recent survey conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace found that human resources professionals believe AI in HR, can present opportunities for mastering new skills and acquiring more free time, offering human resource management professionals to expand their current roles in order to be more strategic within their firms. Among HR leaders who participated in the survey, however, 81 percent said that they find it challenging to keep up with the gradual changes of technological changes at work.
In this article let’s explore what artificial intelligence entails, and it’s applications to the world of human resources.
Automating the repetitive tasks
Several business activities usually consist of repetitive tasks,the human resource management and project resource management department is no exception. By using AI in HR applications, one can automate most of those repetitive works, giving the organization to save time and resources.
Artificial Intelligence is better than other machines because it is capable of taking intelligent decisions, which they can’t. For instance, one can use it to automate the management of employee benefits. Or, one can use it to handle the general queries of the team. Another excellent example of automation with AI is during the onboarding of a new employee. HR professionals don’t have to worry about provisioning a device, allocating the space and other relevant tasks when there is already a solution that can work it out.
More and better employee experience
Employee experience is necessary for their engagement. A company where the employees aren’t engaged is open to several costly risks. For instance, it costs a firm around USD 4,000 (in the US) to recruit new talent and an additional USD 1,000 for onboarding. Firms with higher employee engagement have a 21 percent higher profitability. That’s a considerable difference. Due to these reasons and many others, companies try multiple methods to advance like using machine learning in their employees’ experience.
Adoption of Chatbots
More and more businesses are adopting the AI-powered chatbots for numerous tasks. The AI in human resources, chatbots can be used to answer online queries, thus offering the HR professionals more time to focus on other essential jobs. Chatbots with this technology can also be used to support contact with potential job candidates and help augment internal operations.
Chatbots can perform short interviews with prospective candidates and come up with ways of enhancing the team performance. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, in the coming future one can expect chatbots to become even more capable of handling numerous tasks to save human beings time and also to create more efficient systems.
Data Aggregation
In the current world it is very tough for the HR professionals to simply look at resumes and conduct interviews. They also demand to scour the internet to see what candidates’ social media profiles are like and whether any red flags are being raised.
With AI-powered data aggregation in human resources, it is simple and quick to automatically scan through the endless repositories on social media platforms and other internet sites. Many firms like eBay and IBM already use this tech to scrape through countless sources and collect data about potential job candidates and analyze the experience and market value of each.
Employee Referrals
AI is also enabling human resources departments to better understand employee referrals. By analyzing the types of employees that are being referred and gaining insights into which ones are successful at being accepted for new roles, it is easier and quicker to ensure the best referrals are hired. AI tools can also analyze data from previous referrals and identify candidates who are similar to successful employees, too.
Learning and Development
The future of learning and development is sure to be fueled by these technological advancements over the coming years. With technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning, employee training and development will become more agile to meet employees’ individual requirements. Learning will become more personalized, taking a wide range of things into account, such as an individual worker’s existing skills and future goals and proactively addressing any skill gaps. Content matching and recommendations can then be based on the relevancy of individual employee requirements.

You might recall around the end of 2016, when seemingly overnight, the business media went from never having talked about artificial intelligence in business to ubiquitous coverage of its applications in marketing.


A small Israeli-born artificial intelligence company named Albert had suddenly emerged as a driving force behind this conversation, getting in before Salesforce had a chance to utter the word “Einstein” at its annual Dreamforce conference and AI was still a sparkle in Oracle’s eye. Behind Albert was New York City-based PR and Communications agency Channel V Media.

I spoke with Kieran Powell, partner at Channel V Media, about how Channel V Media has carved out a niche by focusing on companies’ narratives as a first step to transforming them into vocal market influencers.

PROMOTED
Gary Drenik: How can the messages a company puts out into the market have such a large influence on its standing in its industry?

Kieran Powell: Any message that a company puts out needs to be carefully curated before it’s shared with the wider market. By ‘curated,’ I don’t mean that it should be fake or fabricated; I mean that it should live at the intersection of what a company wants to say about itself and what its target audiences need to hear in order to care about it. The right message has the ability to grow a company’s standing and validate it in its market. The wrong message can cause indifference at best and confusion at worst. Most of the companies that come to us don’t realize that the upfront work to develop their narrative–or, how they want to be seen in the market and what they need to be out there saying–is just as important as the press exposure they come to us for.
Our process for determining what a company’s target market needs to hear starts with a few key questions we ask while in this process:


What are the company’s business goals? Any narrative that a company goes out with should support its business goals. The right message will attract new business and opportunities, which can be leveraged to create more awareness and an ongoing stream of attention.
How does the company want to be seen in the market? How the company wants to be seen influences what it needs to be talking about. We typically take clients through a messaging exercise that talks through its market and competitors, the problems the company solves for and its differentiators and core values. All of this helps us to determine what they should be saying in the market.
What are the current gaps in the market? What people want and need to hear, that the current market isn’t addressing, is a good place to start when creating a narrative. Rather than simply adding to what’s already being said, we figure out where the gaps are in the market – and fill them.
How can the company say what it needs to say–in layman’s terms? This alone will differentiate a company, especially in the B2B space where companies tend to speak in terms of features and functions. Instead, companies’ messaging should speak to the pain points and needs of users, which will then open the door to a conversation about products.

Powell: One of the challenges we run into repeatedly with international companies is that they underestimate the size of the U.S. market and media and overestimate the press’s natural interest in them. The latter is especially true if they’re the media and consumer darling in their own country. The U.S. market is a completely different hurdle for companies to overcome — and many international companies don’t recognize that they have to demonstrate why media should care before they actually do care.

We also see many international companies that want to break into the U.S. before they have any adoption in the States. We always recommend that international companies have U.S. validation in the form of users or clients before they start PR. They see this as a chicken-or-the-egg scenario, where they want to leverage PR to get their initial clients, but without this validation, it can be an uphill battle to break through into U.S. media in a meaningful way. This becomes even more important for international companies that are going up against competitors that already have an established U.S. following or name in the market.
Drenik: Why do companies choose to go against market leaders that have a large part of the market share and engaged followings?
Powell: Emerging companies go against market leaders because they believe they have a product that provides different value than what’s already out there.
Market leaders can have a large part of the market share because they’re currently the best option–but their users can have unsolved problems that they don’t even know about yet. And just because their following is engaged doesn’t mean it’s always loyal. These audiences can quickly become early adopters of emerging companies’ products because they’re naturally interested in what they’re selling.
For example, when UK plant-based meat company Meatless Farm entered the U.S., its two dominant competitors, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, still had their first‑movers advantage. There were also a number of other U.S. brands that were gearing up to introduce their plant-based meat alternatives to American audiences–and more and more people were gearing up to try them. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, 7% of Adults 18+ are buying more meatless products, foods, or meals and 4% of adults are buying more plant-based meat products. Our work made Meatless Farm synonymous with the two market creators and one of the go-to plant-based meat choices among a large group of competitors.Prosper - Doing Regarding Your HealthProsper Insights & Analytics
We did this by distinguishing Meatless Farm from its competitors, who positioned themselves as meaty technological marvels, and by differentiating its products based on a taste profile that lends to any recipe that would traditionally use meat.
It’s no easy feat for companies to go up against the ‘Goliaths’ of their industry, but they have an advantage that their first-mover competitors do not: they’re entering an already existing market. This means they’ll spend less time laying the foundation and educating the market, and more time focused on getting their product in the hands of customers.
Drenik: Would you advise companies to create new categories instead of trying to fit into existing crowded categories? What is PR and marketing’s role in category creation if they go this route?
Powell: There’s not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Companies have to consider factors like their product, its differentiators, and the current market, but the most important part of this process is honesty. Companies have to ask themselves–and be honest about–whether their product is so different from what’s out there that it belongs in a category of its own.
There are definite pros and cons of category creation. The pros? By creating a new category, companies can claim to be the first to market and leverage this fact to define their growth trajectory. It also establishes a company as a fresh alternative to legacy options it’s going against, which is necessary if a company is truly one of a kind.
On the other hand, it’s very expensive to educate the market on a new category. This includes educating analysts on the category, teaching prospects where the company fits into their budget, and engaging potential newcomers to the category. The latter is extremely important because there’s no validation of the category until other companies join it. And perhaps the biggest con of creating a new category is the time it takes – it can take years for a category to become widely recognized by the industry.
If companies decide to create a category, PR and marketing will be critical to educating the market and defining what the new category is and how it’s different. We do this through a series of tactics: releasing reports and content about the category, showcasing expertise through thought leadership, and working with the analysts that specialize in relevant categories and market landscapes.
Drenik: According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, it pays to be in the media. Twenty-five percent (25%) of Adults 18+ say that the internet influences their purchase, and 12% say that articles on a product specifically influences their purchase.Prosper - Media Influence On PurchasesProsper Insights & Analytics

The National Institute of Standards and Technology brought on Mark Latonero as senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday.
Latonero will coordinate with international policymakers and standards organizations to advise on the risks and impacts of AI.
The White House launched both the National AI Research Resource Task Force and National AI Advisory Committee in 2021 to strengthen the U.S.’s competitive position globally, but less attention has been paid to the problems with the technology.
“Engaging with social+technical experts along with diverse stakeholders will be central to this work,” Latonero wrote, in a LinkedIn post.

Latonero is also a research professor at Georgetown University and previously worked as a senior consultant to the U.N. Executive Office of the Secretary General, developing policy guidance on human rights due diligence for digital technology use. At the same time he was senior policy advisor at the Partnership on AI.
Latonero has a doctorate in communication, specializing in social science and emerging technology, from the University of Southern California.

Smart traffic light technology controlled using Artificial Intelligence

Researchers utilise Artificial Intelligence to produce smart traffic light technology to reduce congested traffic.
At the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB, researchers in the institute branch for industrial automation INA, in Lemgo, are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable smart traffic light control as part of the ‘KI4LSA’ and ‘KI4PED’ projects to reduce traffic jams. In the future, self-learning algorithms combined with new sensors should ensure better traffic flow and shorter waiting times, while providing improved safety for pedestrians at crossings.
The project partners are Stührenberg GmbH, Cichon Automatisierungstechnik GmbH, Stadtwerke Lemgo GmbH, the city of Lemgo (associated) and Straßen NRW (associated). The German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) is funding the project, which ends in summer 2022.
Conventional traffic lights
Conventional traffic lights utilise rule-based controls, but this rigid approach does not work for all traffic situations. In addition, the sensors currently in use — induction loop technology embedded in the road surface — provide only a rough impression of the actual traffic situation. The researchers at Fraunhofer IOSB-INA are working to address these problems.
Instead of conventional sensors, they are employing high-resolution cameras and radar sensors to more precisely capture the actual traffic situation. This allows the number of vehicles waiting at a junction to be determined accurately in real time.
Employing high-resolution cameras and radar sensors
The technology also detects the average speed of the cars and the waiting times at any current moment. The real-time sensors are combined with AI, which replaces the usual rigid control rules. The AI uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, a method of machine learning that focuses on finding intelligent solutions to complex control problems.
“We used a junction in Lemgo, where our testing is carried out, to build a realistic simulation and trained the AI on countless iterations within this model, explained Arthur Müller, project manager and scientist at the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. “Prior to running the simulation, we added the traffic volume measured during rush hour into the model, enabling the AI to work with real data. This resulted in an agent trained using deep reinforcement learning: a neural network that represents the lights control.”
The algorithms trained in this way calculate the optimum switching behaviour for the traffic lights and the best phase sequence to shorten waiting times at the junction, reduce journey times and thus lower the noise and CO2 pollution caused by queuing traffic. A main advantage of the algorithms is that they can be tested, used and scaled up to include neighbouring lights that form a wider network.
Big impact when scaled up
The simulation phases carried out on the congested Lemgo junction, fitted with intelligent lights, demonstrated that the use of AI could improve traffic flow by 10% to 15%. Over the coming months, the trained agent will now take to the streets for further evaluation in a real-life laboratory. This testing will also consider the influence of the traffic metrics on parameters such as noise pollution and emissions.
However, the unavoidable ‘simulation to reality gap’ presents a challenge. “The assumptions about traffic behaviour that were used in the simulation are not a 1:1 representation of reality. So, the agent will need to be adjusted accordingly,” Müller explained. “If this is successful, the effects of scaling up will be huge. Just think of the large number of traffic lights even in a small town like Lemgo.”
The EU estimates that traffic jams cause economic damage totalling to $100bn per year for its member states. According to Müller, AI traffic lights provide an opportunity to use our existing infrastructure more efficiently. “We are the first team in the world to test deep reinforcement learning for traffic light control under real-world conditions. And we hope that our project will inspire others to similar endeavours,” added Müller.
Intelligent traffic signal systems for pedestrians
The ‘KI4PED’ project focuses on pedestrians rather than vehicles. In a project scheduled to run until the end of July 2022, Fraunhofer IOSB-INA is working together with Stührenberg GmbH and associated partners Straßen NRW, in the city of Lemgo and the city of Bielefeld to develop an innovative approach for the needs-based control of pedestrian signals.
This is estimated to be particularly beneficial for vulnerable people, such as older people or those with disabilities. The aim is to reduce waiting times and improve safety at pedestrian crosswalks by enabling longer crossing times. According to current studies, the ‘walk’ times are too short for these groups of people. The buttons currently in use, generally in small yellow boxes, do not deliver any information about the number or age of crossers, or indeed their other needs.
The project partners want to use AI in combination with high-resolution LiDAR sensors to automate the process and automatically adjust and increment the crossing times according to the needs of the pedestrians. The AI performs person detection and tracking based on data from LiDAR sensors and applies it in an embedded system in real time.
Smart traffic light technology data analysis
“For data-protection purposes, we are using LiDAR sensors rather than camera-based systems,” explained Dr Dennis Sprute, project manager and scientist at Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. “These present the pedestrians as 3D point-clouds, meaning that they cannot be individually identified.”
LiDAR sensors (light detection and ranging) emit pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment, which bounce off nearby objects and return to the sensor. The sensor measures the time it takes for the light to return to calculate the distance it travelled to the object, in this case, the person.
These sensors are also resistant to the influences of light, reflections, and weather. A feasibility study will be carried out to determine the optimum positions and alignment at the crossing. The AI algorithms will initially be trained for a week at two stoplight crossings in Lemgo and Bielefeld. Sensors tests are also planned on the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA site using various simulated light conditions to determine the detection capabilities.
By using a needs-based control concept adapted to the individual situation, the research partners hope to reduce the waiting times when there are lots of people waiting by 30%. They also aim to reduce the number of incidents of jaywalking by around 25%.

Artificial intelligence involved jobs accounts to around 10-12% of the total functionalities in the industry..Machine-Written Articles: AI can help human reporters in more complex work, such as long-form articles, in-depth analyses and investigative journalism. AI-written articles are currently limited to simple and formulaic topics including stock market results, sports game scores, etc..Transcribing Audio and Video Interviews: AI can save reporters valuable time by transcribing audio and video interviews. It converts audio data into text so that journalists can focus on deriving insights rather than transcribing audio or video interviews..Flagging Alerts: AI can examine large databases and send journalists alerts as soon as a trend or anomaly emerges from big data. It can provide content producers and publisher's tools to identify fake news and lessen their impact on their readership..Powering Journalistic Processes: AI systems can improve journalistic processes and workflows. It can help organizations streamline their distributed processes for gleaning information, contacting sources and backend operations like dealing with the advertisers..Controls bias: Bias is a global issue and news media have no escape from it. However, AI assists in reducing the subjective interpretation of the data of the human as its machine learning algorithms are trained to consider accuracy..Robot as news reporters: Despite invading manufacturing, healthcare and marketing industry, robots are now in newsrooms as well.

  Recent strides in the efficacy of AI, the adoption of IoT devices and the power of edge computing have come together to unlock the power of edge AI.
This has opened new opportunities for edge AI that were previously unimaginable — from helping radiologists identify pathologies in the hospital, to driving cars down the freeway, to helping us pollinate plants.
Countless analysts and businesses are talking about and implementing edge computing, which traces its origins to the 1990s, when content delivery networks were created to serve web and video content from edge servers deployed close to users.
Today, almost every business has job functions that can benefit from the adoption of edge AI. In fact, edge applications are driving the next wave of AI computing in ways that improve our lives at home, at work, in school and in transit.
Learn more about what edge AI is, its benefits and how it works, examples of edge AI use cases, and the relationship between edge computing and cloud computing.
What Is Edge AI? 
Edge AI is the deployment of AI applications in devices throughout the physical world. It’s called “edge AI” because the AI computation is done near the user at the edge of the network, close to where the data is located, rather than centrally in a cloud computing facility or private data center.
Since the internet has global reach, the edge of the network can connote any location. It can be a retail store, factory, hospital or devices all around us, like traffic lights, autonomous machines and phones.
Edge AI: Why Now? 
Organizations from every industry are looking to increase automation to improve processes, efficiency and safety.
To help them, computer programs need to recognize patterns and execute tasks repeatedly and safely. But the world is unstructured and the range of tasks that humans perform covers infinite circumstances that are impossible to fully describe in programs and rules.
Advances in edge AI have opened opportunities for machines and devices, wherever they may be, to operate with the “intelligence” of human cognition. AI-enabled smart applications learn to perform similar tasks under different circumstances, much like real life.
The efficacy of deploying AI models at the edge arises from three recent innovations.

Maturation of neural networks: Neural networks and related AI infrastructure have finally developed to the point of allowing for generalized machine learning. Organizations are learning how to successfully train AI models and deploy them in production at the edge.
Advances in compute infrastructure: Powerful distributed computational power is required to run AI at the edge. Recent advances in highly parallel GPUs have been adapted to execute neural networks.
Adoption of IoT devices: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things has fueled the explosion of big data. With the sudden ability to collect data in every aspect of a business — from industrial sensors, smart cameras, robots and more — we now have the data and devices necessary to deploy AI models at the edge. Moreover, 5G is providing IoT a boost with faster, more stable and secure connectivity.

Why Deploy AI at the Edge? What Are the Benefits of Edge AI? 
Since AI algorithms are capable of understanding language, sights, sounds, smells, temperature, faces and other analog forms of unstructured information, they’re particularly useful in places occupied by end users with real-world problems. These AI applications would be impractical or even impossible to deploy in a centralized cloud or enterprise data center due to issues related to latency, bandwidth and privacy.
The benefits of edge AI include:

Intelligence: AI applications are more powerful and flexible than conventional applications that can respond only to inputs that the programmer had anticipated. In contrast, an AI neural network is not trained how to answer a specific question, but rather how to answer a particular type of question, even if the question itself is new. Without AI, applications couldn’t possibly process infinitely diverse inputs like texts, spoken words or video.
Real-time insights: Since edge technology analyzes data locally rather than in a faraway cloud delayed by long-distance communications, it responds to users’ needs in real time.
Reduced cost: By bringing processing power closer to the edge, applications need less internet bandwidth, greatly reducing networking costs.
Increased privacy: AI can analyze real-world information without ever exposing it to a human being, greatly increasing privacy for anyone whose appearance, voice, medical image or any other personal information needs to be analyzed. Edge AI further enhances privacy by containing that data locally, uploading only the analysis and insights to the cloud. Even if some of the data is uploaded for training purposes, it can be anonymized to protect user identities. By preserving privacy, edge AI simplifies the challenges associated with data regulatory compliance.
High availability: Decentralization and offline capabilities make edge AI more robust since internet access is not required for processing data. This results in higher availability and reliability for mission-critical, production-grade AI applications.
Persistent improvement: AI models grow increasingly accurate as they train on more data. When an edge AI application confronts data that it cannot accurately or confidently process, it typically uploads it so that the AI can retrain and learn from it. So the longer a model is in production at the edge, the more accurate the model will be.

How Does Edge AI Technology Work?
Lifecycle of an edge AI application.
For machines to see, perform object detection, drive cars, understand speech, speak, walk or otherwise emulate human skills, they need to functionally replicate human intelligence.
AI employs a data structure called a deep neural network to replicate human cognition. These DNNs are trained to answer specific types of questions by being shown many examples of that type of question along with correct answers.
This training process, known as “deep learning,” often runs in a data center or the cloud due to the vast amount of data required to train an accurate model, and the need for data scientists to collaborate on configuring the model. After training, the model graduates to become an “inference engine” that can answer real-world questions.
In edge AI deployments, the inference engine runs on some kind of computer or device in far-flung locations such as factories, hospitals, cars, satellites and homes. When the AI stumbles on a problem, the troublesome data is commonly uploaded to the cloud for further training of the original AI model, which at some point replaces the inference engine at the edge. This feedback loop plays a significant role in boosting model performance; once edge AI models are deployed, they only get smarter and smarter.
What Are Examples of Edge AI Use Cases? 
AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We’re now at a time where AI is revolutionizing the world’s largest industries.
Across manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, transportation, energy and more, edge AI is driving new business outcomes in every sector, including:

Intelligent forecasting in energy: For critical industries such as energy, in which discontinuous supply can threaten the health and welfare of the general population, intelligent forecasting is key. Edge AI models help to combine historical data, weather patterns, grid health and other information to create complex simulations that inform more efficient generation, distribution and management of energy resources to customers.
Predictive maintenance in manufacturing: Sensor data can be used to detect anomalies early and predict when a machine will fail. Sensors on equipment scan for flaws and alert management if a machine needs a repair so the issue can be addressed early, avoiding costly downtime.
AI-powered instruments in healthcare: Modern medical instruments at the edge are becoming AI-enabled with devices that use ultra-low-latency streaming of surgical video to allow for minimally invasive surgeries and insights on demand.
Smart virtual assistants in retail: Retailers are looking to improve the digital customer experience by introducing voice ordering to replace text-based searches with voice commands. With voice ordering, shoppers can easily search for items, ask for product information and place online orders using smart speakers or other intelligent mobile devices.

What Role Does Cloud Computing Play in Edge Computing? 
AI applications can run in a data center like those in public clouds, or out in the field at the network’s edge, near the user. Cloud computing and edge computing each offer benefits that can be combined when deploying edge AI.
The cloud offers benefits related to infrastructure cost, scalability, high utilization, resilience from server failure, and collaboration. Edge computing offers faster response times, lower bandwidth costs and resilience from network failure.
There are several ways in which cloud computing can support an edge AI deployment:

The cloud can run the model during its training period.
The cloud continues to run the model as it is retrained with data that comes from the edge.
The cloud can run AI inference engines that supplement the models in the field when high compute power is more important than response time. For example, a voice assistant might respond to its name, but send complex requests back to the cloud for parsing.
The cloud serves up the latest versions of the AI model and application.
The same edge AI often runs across a fleet of devices in the field with software in the cloud

The Future of Edge AI 
Thanks to the commercial maturation of neural networks, proliferation of IoT devices, advances in parallel computation and 5G, there is now robust infrastructure for generalized machine learning. This is allowing enterprises to capitalize on the colossal opportunity to bring AI into their places of business and act upon real-time insights, all while decreasing costs and increasing privacy.
We are only in the early innings of edge AI, and still the possible applications seem endless.

Plasma inside the TCV fusion reactor in SwitzerlandCurdin Wüthrich/SPC/EPFL
Fusion reactors promise cheap, abundant and relatively clean energy – if we can get them to work. Now, thanks to artificial intelligence firm DeepMind, fusion researchers are one step closer to extracting power from plasma hotter than the surface of the sun.
DeepMind worked with scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, to create a neural network capable of controlling the magnetic fields within EPFL’s Variable Configuration Tokamak (TCV) fusion reactor.
These magnetic fields are essential for keeping the plasma generated by the reactor safely contained. If the plasma touches the walls of the reactor it rapidly cools, stifling the reaction and potentially causing significant damage.Advertisement
Join us for a mind-blowing festival of ideas and experiences. New Scientist Live is going hybrid, with a live in-person event in Manchester, UK, that you can also enjoy from the comfort of your own home, from 12 to 14 March 2022. Find out more.
Researchers at the TCV previously used 19 magnetic coils, each controlled by a separate algorithm that monitored the interior of the reactor thousands of times a second with a host of sensors. DeepMind instead created a single neural network to control all the coils at once, automatically learning which voltages needed to be supplied to them to best contain the plasma.
The team trained the AI on a precise digital simulation of the reactor before conducting experiments on the real machine. Ultimately, it was able to successfully contain the plasma for around 2 seconds, which is approaching the limits of the reactor – TCV can only sustain the plasma in a single experiment for up to 3 seconds, after which it needs 15 minutes to cool down. The record for fusion reactors is only 5 seconds, set recently by the Joint European Torus in the UK.
As well as controlling the plasma, the AI was able to shape it and move it around within the reactor. New plasma shapes may bring efficiency or stability improvements in new fusion reactors such as ITER, which is currently being built in France and will be the world’s largest tokamak when complete in 2025. The AI even demonstrated the ability to control two separate beams of plasma at once.
Several plasma configurations sculpted by Deepmind’s learning algorithmDeepMind & SPC/EPFL
Federico Felici at EPFL says that although there are many theoretical approaches that could be used to contain the plasma with a magnetic coil, scientists have tried-and-tested strategies. But the AI surprised the team with its novel approach to forming those same plasma shapes with the coils.
“This AI algorithm, the reinforcement learning, chose to use the TCV coils in a completely different way, which still more or less generates the same magnetic field,” says Felici. “So it was still creating the same plasma as we had expected, but it just used the magnetic cores in a completely different way because it had complete freedom to explore the whole operational space. So people were looking at these experimental results about how the coil currents evolve and they were pretty surprised.”

Gianluca Sarri at Queen’s University Belfast, UK, says that AI is key to the future of control systems for fusion reactors, which have yet to sustain a reaction that produces more power than is consumed.
“Once this is done, this is not the end of the story. Then you have to make it a power plant,” he says. “And this AI is, in my opinion, the only way forward. There are so many variables, and a small change in one of them can cause a big change in the final output. If you try to do it manually, it’s a very lengthy process.”
To make fusion reactors efficient, practical power sources, physicists need to increase the ratio between the pressure of the plasma and the power of the magnetic fields containing it, a value called beta, says Howard Wilson at the University of York, UK.
“The plasma writhes and wiggles and tries to escape the clutches of the magnetic fields, and as one is pushing up that beta parameter, one is having to work harder and harder to get the control that one needs to just hold the plasma there,” he says. “The further you push the plasma, the more chance you just suddenly lose it.”
Wilson believes these AI experiments show promise for containing plasma in “extreme geometries”, which paves the way for experiments with different plasma shapes that might yield improvements in stability or efficiency. “It makes the risky parameter space less risky to operate in, but also opens up new parameter space that we can go into and explore,” he says.

When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little scribbles, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called AARON to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then set it loose making art.
Not far behind was the composer David Cope, who coined the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope once told me that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to painstakingly draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially tinkered with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.


To celebrate our 100th anniversary, we’re highlighting some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. To see more from the series, visit Century of Science.

Cohen and Cope were among a handful of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-nascent field of AI had its focus set squarely on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers balked at the notion of creative machines.
Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope cranked out a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing cohort of researchers and eventually its own journal and annual event.
The robotic artist AARON produced this sketch in 1985, which was hand-colored by AARON-creator Harold Cohen.Harold Cohen, AARON
Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to mirror the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.
Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the Painting Fool. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the sentiment and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).
The Painting Fool, an AI artist created by Simon Colton, generated collages based on text analysis and Flickr searches.The Painting Fool/thepaitingfool.com
Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating ANGELINA — which made simple games based on news articles from The Guardian, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.
During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on mimicry, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.

But many in the field, as well as onlookers, wondered if these AIs really showed creativity. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge” in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs converged toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.

In order to make the step to true creativity, Dahlstedt suggested, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”
True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.
In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But he wonders whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.
If an AI lacks the self-awareness to reflect on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?
Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” writes philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”

Foundation Fellow Nathan Safir is happiest when working on a complicated problem


As Nathan Safir was finishing up his master’s in artificial intelligence at the University of Georgia, he had a big decision to make: Did he want to accept the Marshall Scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science in England or accept an offer to start work at Google this summer?
Safir, a Foundation Fellow, applied his problem-solving brain to the decision.
“Mostly I tried to simplify it into a decision of ‘Am I more excited to work now or am I more excited to go to grad school now?’” said Safir, who has a B.S. in computer science with a minor in geography.

Google was the winner. For now. Safir hopes to get his Ph.D. in artificial intelligence sometime in the future.
Whatever way he gets there, the end goal is the same – he wants to work in artificial intelligence. “Whether it’s working on a new cool application, existing AI methods, or actually doing the research, I’d really love to work somewhere in that space,” said Safir.
This flexibility will serve Safir well at Google, because he doesn’t yet know what he’ll be doing at the company when he arrives in California this August. “They’ll start team matching closer to my start date,” said Safir. “All I know is that I’ll be in the Bay Area and possibly working on the Google Ads team.”
During a Google internship in summer 2021, he worked with the Cloud AI team.
UGA has helped him find his passion for AI in several ways. One was a difficult math class his first year in college. “I was a super eager freshman, so I took Math 3500. It’s notorious for being very tough, and it was. I was glad I took it, but I realized I was less interested in the proof-based rigorous mathematics.”

He decided to pick up machine learning instead. “It presented an interesting way to use mathematical thinking and be able to think creatively.”
Also helpful in guiding his path was UGA’s Foundation Fellowship, a merit-based scholarship based in the Jere W. Morehead Honors College that is awarded to between 20-25 high school seniors out of 1,200 applicants. It’s the reason Safir, who grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, ultimately chose UGA out of his ranked list of 13 potential schools.
He said he most appreciates the travel opportunities, although they’ve been a bit truncated during the COVID years, and the people he’s met along the way. “The network of people you can talk to about careers or cool places you could work – that type of thing was super helpful for me trying to imagine what I wanted to do in the future.” Safir said he interacts with staff, peers and friends from the Fellowship on a daily basis.
Safir’s gateway into programming was a documentary he saw in middle school on Mark Zuckerberg. “It said he learned C++ from a book when he was about my age so I checked out the same C++ book from the library. I don’t think I picked it up as quickly as he did, but that was the beginning of me trying to learn programming.”
“I’ve been into math and quantitative problem solving since I was really young. Programming was just an extension of that logical problem-solving,” he said.
Safir is a down-to-earth, well-rounded person who can move between playing in local Monday pick-up hockey games, coaching Athens Youth Hockey and working on his tennis game, to high-level problem-solving. But he’s happiest when he has a tough question to work on.
“My thesis is working on a theoretical problem of how to extend an architecture called variational autoencoders to work with both labeled and unlabeled data,” he said. “My lab, led by Dr. Quinn of the CS department, is at the intersection of biomedical imaging and artificial intelligence. It’s a theoretical problem inspired by a real-world problem. It’s an especially open field—I feel like there are a million different things you can work on. I’m just happy I can be a part of it.”

Three professors in the Department of Physics, Computer Science and Engineering have been awarded a grant from Virginia's Commonwealth Cyber Initiative to overhaul lab space in Luter Hall that supports the cybersecurity major.
Christopher Kreider, Michael Lapke and Nazli Siasi are leading the project, which will see the beloved Hunter Creech Lab receive major upgrades to its capabilities over the next year.
The planned enhancements will enable Christopher Newport students to pursue the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning in preparation for careers in the fast-growing field of cybersecurity. The grant includes funding for new high-performance computer workstations, cloud-based software applications and other resources to power the new technologies.
""Enabling students to do hands-on work in these areas is extremely important from a learning perspective,"" Kreider said. ""Lab environments that enable us to work in safe virtual environments will greatly enhance both our teaching and independent exploration for students.""
Installation of the new resources will begin this summer and be ready for use by students and faculty in fall 2022.

Operations like research recommendations and folder analysis are currently done with the help of AI. DISCO is a cutting-edge legal technology company developing legal services products backed by AI. Analytics Insight has engaged in an exclusive interview with Alan Lockett, VP of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DISCO..Can you tell me about DISCO, your role, and your responsibilities?.DISCO is a cutting-edge legal technology company developing legal services products backed by AI. I am the Vice President of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In that role, I coordinate DISCO's technical approach to AI across products and lead a team of researchers and developers that implement our AI methods..How does AI in legal practice actually work? .Good AI technologies for legal remove obstacles and enable the lawyer to focus on the tasks that require their legal skills. There are two key ways this happens. First, AI channels the flood of digital information into comprehensible streams. In doing so, AI allows lawyers to keep up with the rapid pace of increase in digital information that lawyers have to review as part of their jobs, including emails, spreadsheets, chats, images, video, and audio. Second, AI integrates data from diverse sources such as documentary evidence, depositions, legal precedents, regulations, and statutes to help lawyers attain a cohesive understanding of the key issues for their clients..Do we need to fear the Robo lawyer? .AI technologies as they exist today are not competent to make decisions that require sophisticated legal judgment, but they give back time to the lawyer to make those judgment calls.  Misconceptions and fears about AI's role in the legal industry are misplaced and in some cases may prevent legal practitioners from adopting technology that could streamline their work. Technological innovation has changed the practice of law but not in the ways many might expect. Autonomous cyborgs are far from replacing the uniquely human aspects of legal reasoning. AI in the legal revolution will augment human intelligence––not replace it..Should AI be exciting to someone with a law degree? Why? .Absolutely. Law school graduates at every level of their careers should be excited about AI. Lawyers that do not embrace AI technology will not be able to compete with lawyers that do. The sheer amount of data involved in many legal cases make it unrealistic to practice law without the benefit of advanced technology. Once tasks such as documentation or reviews that don't require legal judgment are automated, lawyers can dedicate more of their time to practicing law. In the end, by allowing lawyers to focus on serious legal questions, AI can help lawyers to deliver more just and equitable outcomes..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

With the new instructions and some reliefs announced by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the union budget Hospitality Sector 2022-23. Now the industry is all set to perform its best to realigned its outline. After the pandemic and with the new instructions and regulations, the game plan for the industry has changed now. The current trend that has become famous in the Hospitality industry is Cloud Kitchen and it has been more than two years of the covid 19 pandemic we have seen the cloud kitchen is on the top list when talking about the growth &amp; overall hospitality sector.Cloud kitchens are also known as ghost kitchens. It is like a viable kitchen space that is only used to prepare meals for the online deliveries and takeout. These commercial kitchens are used for the facilities and services needed to make the food items. The dine-in facility is not available in the cloud-based kitchen models. It is worth expressive that cloud kitchens have some great recompense.Cloud kitchen has a massive scale and now it primarily focuses on delivering online food and reaching a larger audience. This way cloud kitchen reinforces its brand and increases greater exposure. They generally provide food within 10 km and that too in 20-30 minutes. Online food delivery has increased by 150% in the past two years due to the pandemic and the work-from-home culture.If we look at our past two years we can witness that number of students and migrants or those who were working outside their cities were stuck due to the covid restrictions and regulations implemented by the government of India. Hence it results in most of the people have adapted work from home culture instead of regular office for too long and the only problem the country was facing is no further involvement &amp; engagement in outside activities like parties, travel &amp; tourism, hangouts, etc.The Cloud- kitchens trends come up in the high spot when people got bored with the restrictions and work from home culture pressurized them with zero involvement in outdoor activities. they start to order food online from cloud kitchens as per their taste and cuisine because that was the only way to taste the food &amp; dishes and now cloud kitchens have become a trend in the overall hospitality sector.Artificial IntelligenceThe support of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning in this sector is giving cloud kitchens the platform for being more effective and restructuring their operations magnificently. The 21st century is observing rapid growth in terms of technology. There have been countless useful inventions and advanced innovative tech that are helping figure out the future of the country. One such invention is AI. everything these days is based on AI and Machine learning the latest ones to join this flourishing tech are restaurateurs.Online food delivery businesses have been running magnificently with this technology for a very long time now but with people getting more happy dining at home, the impression of cloud kitchens is on an all-time rise and AI is only adding to the profits of these kitchens. AI supports cloud kitchens finding out the right cuisines, identifying the menu mix, managing inventory, and dealing with customer feedback. Machine learning has played an enormous role in the way restaurants are doing business.Effective Cloud KitchensTraditional restaurants receive less profit as compared to the ones that have a cloud kitchen because they need a viable space, large staff with waiters, electricity costs, etc. On the other hand, a ghost kitchen can run in a basement or even in a parking lot. They don&rsquo;t need much administer and hence the revenue margin is big as compared to traditional restaurants.It takes a decent amount of money to start a restaurant by leasing a building rather than expensive construction according to the restaurant&rsquo;s needs. Cloud or virtual kitchens save money by leasing a commercial kitchen and it helps in reducing the cost. If you are planning to open your own ghost kitchen-based food chain, all you need is a decent space and some great chefs.At present-day, cloud kitchens are fulfilling the needs of consumers with their satisfaction of providing the facility of the dining experience at home rather than traditional kitchens and AI-based models has big support towards them in focusing on the quality of food, administrative tasks of the kitchen like health, property taxes, security monitoring, utility bills, and the needs of the consumer instead of other problems. The cloud kitchen ensures uniform taste along with the high-quality production of food. The upcoming future of cloud kitchen has incredible scope for the and it can reconstruct the whole figure of Hospitality Sector.Manjari Singh is the Co-founder of The Chhaunk",,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564125-et-hospitality-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,contactus@ethospitalityworld.com,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hospitality.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,

Please visit the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/planning-to-study/study-artificial-intelligence-and-data-science-as-a-postgraduate/"" class=""govuk-link"">Office for Student’s website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The UK has a long and exceptional history in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, from codebreaker Alan Turing’s early work through to London-based powerhouse DeepMind’s pioneering research which will enable quicker and more advanced drug discovery.</p>

<p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> underpins the apps which help us navigate around cities, stop online banking fraud and communicate with smart speakers.</p>

<p>The UK is ranked third in the world for private venture capital investment into <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> companies (2019 investment into the UK reached almost £2.5 billion) and is home to a third of Europe’s total <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> companies.</p>

<p>The new scholarships will ensure more people can build successful careers in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, create and develop new and bigger businesses, and will improve the diversity of this growing and innovative sector.  </p>

<p><abbr title=""Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport"">DCMS</abbr> Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy Chris Philp said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK is already a world leader in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>. Today we’re investing millions to ensure people from all parts of society can access the opportunities and benefits <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is creating in this country.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We are doubling the number of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> scholarships previously available to underrepresented groups to build a diverse and inclusive workforce fit for the future of tech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science Minister George Freeman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK is one of the world’s most advanced <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> economies, with <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> already playing a key role in everything from climate science and medical diagnostics to factory robotics and smart cities.</p>

  <p>It is therefore essential that we continue to equip our workforce with the skills they need in this important technology, while also making the industry accessible to talented people from all backgrounds.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">That’s why today’s significant funding award is so important, which will see underrepresented groups trained up to build successful careers in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, supporting the growth and diversity of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the UK.</p>

<p>UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Council Chair Tabitha Goldstaub said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ensuring there is a diverse talent pool furthering <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> developments is vital for the success of the technology and society.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">These masters conversion courses welcoming people from non-STEM degrees attract a less homogeneous group which means the UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> ecosystem benefits from graduates with different backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obum Ekeke OBE, Head of Education Partnerships, DeepMind said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next generation of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> researchers must be representative of the world around us if <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is to benefit the whole of society.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">These scholarships will help to build a stronger and more diverse <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> community in the UK, and bring a wider range of experiences - as well as valuable multidisciplinary expertise - to the field.</p>

<p>An independent organisation, to be announced later this year, will be responsible for encouraging industry participation and investment into the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Scholarships scheme.</p>

<p>First round of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> courses a roaring success</p>

<p>The first stage of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science conversion courses in 2019, delivered by the Office for Students, supported 28 universities in England to set up and provide degree conversion courses in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/185-million-to-boost-diversity-in-ai-tech-roles-and-innovation-in-online-training-for-adults"" class=""govuk-link"">£13.5 million <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Scholarship programme</a> enabled a diverse group of students to study <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science, as 76 per cent of scholarship students were women, whereas only 30 per cent of masters students on traditional computing courses are women. Nearly half, 45 per cent, of the scholarship students were black and 24 per cent had disabilities, boosting representation on the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science courses.</p>

<p>The first phase of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> courses also attracted tech talent outside of London and the South East, with 70 per cent of the total students and 84 per cent of the scholarship students based outside of these areas in England, levelling up <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science skills.</p>

<p>The programme is part of the government’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Strategy</a>, which commits to investing in and planning for the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> ecosystem over the next ten years, to boost the UK’s leadership as a global science and <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> superpower.</p>

<p>The new scholarships follow on from the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/next-generation-of-artificial-intelligence-talent-to-be-trained-at-uk-universities"" class=""govuk-link"">Industrial Funded <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Masters programme</a> supported by the government since 2019 to increase <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> skills across the UK with industry investment.</p>

<p>John Blake, Director for Fair and Access and Participation at the Office for Students said:</p>

<blockquote>

While these technologies certainly hold the potential to vastly improve the quality of operations in the corporate sector, they also stand to disrupt many existing markets.
AI can easily be extended, adapted, and applied to different business operations. When considering that AI is just a computer program, we can begin to see the potential scope of the technology. The reason that AI is being adopted on such a large scale is due to its capacity to bring intelligence to tasks that previously did not have it.
This, coupled with the technology’s ability to automate repetitive processes with intelligence, makes it a highly disruptive power in various sectors. Keeping this in mind, we explored some of the industries that are most likely to be impacted by the widespread adoption of AI technology. Let us see why companies are so eager to adopt artificial intelligence.

Why AI Is a Disruptive Force
To look at the capabilities of AI, we must first look at what AI is. In simple terms, artificial intelligence is a computer program that can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence. Instead of simply following commands given to it, AI employs intelligent strategies and heuristics to bring a human-like intelligence to solving problems like any other computer program.
1. Improvement Through Machine Learning
Machine learning programs form a subset of AI that has the ability to learn from the data fed to them, even after being deployed. This gives a utility factor to companies adopting ML algorithms, as maintenance and upgrade costs are reduced. Moreover, the self-improving nature of ML allows solutions to dynamically develop according to the needs of the problems at hand.
The capabilities of AI range far and wide in an enterprise setting, but one of the biggest things to note is that clean data makes AI better. Hence, such algorithms are well-suited to businesses, where there is an established data workflow with a large volume of data. Today, data collection and data storage have become a norm, but sectors which have maintained long-standing data banks, such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, will stand to benefit the most from an AI solution.
While the capabilities of AI are varied and different from deployment to deployment, some characteristics exist across all kinds of AI. Primarily, they can utilize large amounts of data to iterate towards better solutions. This is a huge draw for companies that have collected large amounts of data. They can simply train an AI to solve a certain problem using this data and deploy a solution explicitly suited to their needs.
AI can be deployed and improved upon with minimal effort and can also be tailored to a company’s requirements using data. This close fit of solutions for the problem at hand is one of the biggest reasons companies are flocking to AI solutions. This, combined with the capability of machine learning algorithms to improve upon themselves with additional data, makes AI an easy buy for enterprises.
2. Reduced Expenses
Another unique selling proposition of artificial intelligence solutions is that they are not only orders of magnitude faster than human labor, but also considerably cheaper. This softens the blow for companies looking to explore AI as a solution, as the potential monetary gains are much higher than the initial investment.
Cloud computing and the vast variety of cloud service providers are also helping in AI adoption. Not only is the cloud deployment of AI cheaper than an on-premise solution, but it also comes with plug-and-play tools. The pricing is flexible, which further decreases the initial investment that companies have to make in order to try an AI solution.
3. Predictive Advantage
Predictive analytics, a branch of AI, is very useful across industries. Using machine learning algorithms and predictive models, a program can be trained to find the relationship between various variables. The program then uses this information to predict what the relationship between the variables will be like in the future.
For example, a predictive algorithm employed in a supply chain scenario will be trained using the data of the shipments. The quantity, supply, and demand of each item will be ingested by the algorithm, among other data. Then, the program can accurately predict the required quantity to be shipped by looking at past relationships between supply and demand.
As one can imagine, predictive analytics can optimize processes vastly, cutting down on warehousing costs and overheads. This is especially useful in retail, supply chain, and logistics markets. Predictive analytics is simply indicative of another useful characteristic of complex AI programs; pattern recognition.
By utilizing concepts from statistics and computer science, an ML program can be trained to recognize patterns. This not only includes patterns in the harvested data but also in areas, such as image and video recognition. This gives it considerable use in healthcare, defense, and customer service.
Let’s delve deeper into industries that are most likely to be disrupted by AI and ML solutions.

Industries That Will Get Disrupted by AI
Artificial intelligence has entered various industries over the past five years. With the enterprise adoption of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, many existing sectors have seen widespread disruption by the new technology. Let’s take a look at the ten industries that will get disrupted by AI the most.
1. Healthcare
AI’s adoption in the healthcare sector promises to bring a lot of benefits to adopters. Primarily, the healthcare sector as a whole has been geared towards collecting accurate and relevant data about patients and those who come into care. This makes AI a good fit for the data-rich world of healthcare. Secondarily, AI can find a variety of use-cases in the healthcare sector.
The introduction of AI can enable the widespread deployment of predictive healthcare. Using the power of predictive analytics, AI can help doctors make proactive moves towards ensuring their patients’ health. This is a much better approach to healthcare than the reactive approach taken today. With the rise of IoT-enabled embedded devices, doctors can remotely monitor the health of patients, and can also be informed in case a patient is in an emergency.
Apart from predictive healthcare, AI can also enable an easier analysis of scan results through image recognition. This has already been used to help doctors diagnose symptoms at a much higher rate, as AI can comb through multiple scans much faster than humans. Health chatbots are also being developed. These bots will allow doctors to collect preliminary data regarding the symptoms of the patient.
industry conducts mission-critical operations.
2. Customer Service and Experience
AI has already begun to disrupt customer service. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have found their way into customer-facing helplines in the form of chatbots. These chatbots can collect information about a customer’s issues and enable customer support executives to work more efficiently. In certain cases, they are also able to resolve the customer’s issues on their own, only escalating to human executives if necessary.
Due to their ability to accurately understand what the customer is saying, sufficiently advanced NLP algorithms may replace customer support executives altogether. Instead of being a statically assigned algorithm with a set of predefined responses, the chatbot can dynamically adapt itself to any issue the customer is facing. Moreover, as the customer does not need to wait to get connected with a support executive, the waiting time is reduced, thereby improving customer experience.
Apart from chatbots and customer helplines, recommendation engines can also prove beneficial. Amazon is an excellent example of this. The website dynamically generates a distinct homepage for all of its customers based on their browsing habits. Netflix also utilizes recommendation engines to a great extent, thus enhancing customer experience by providing tailored recommendations for each user.
3. Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)
AI and the financial sector are a great fit for each other. Similar to healthcare, BFSI companies have been collecting, collating, and organizing data for many decades, making AI a natural addition to the field. The technology has been used to detect the chance of an individual conducting a fraudulent transaction.
Banking is a sector where paperwork and documentation are ever-present. AI can also automate processes that were previously done manually, such as paperwork and documentation. This will not only decrease the time required to solve issues but also enable banks to serve customers better.
Moreover, predictive analysis has also found great success in the BFSI sector. Banks can identify high-value customers using predictive analytics through data mining and parsing text online. They can also retain customers longer by providing additional services based on their spending and financial activities.
By looking at the customer’s credit history, an AI can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan. This streamlines the process of onboarding new customers while reducing the likelihood of non-payment.

4. Logistics
AI in logistics holds the potential to drastically change operations. Predictive analytics can accurately predict the inventory required by a vendor and optimize routes to minimize overhead costs.
Ab InBev, the worldwide distributor for beverages like Budweiser and Corona, has used AI to optimize logistics to a great extent. Using predictive analytics, the organization was not only able to brew the optimal amount of each beverage, but also accurately predict the demand of a certain product. This allowed them to cut down the warehousing expenses and overhead costs significantly.
Shipping companies also stand to benefit greatly from implementing AI. Usually, document checks at customs stations hold up the shipping process. Today, it takes multiple working days for a ship to get clearance to ship all its goods. Image recognition algorithms and intelligent automation can help customs officials conduct checks more seamlessly by scanning the documents involved, transitioning it into a digital realm.
This data can then be used to accurately keep track of shipments while cutting down on time spent at ports. Due to the technology’s benefits, the worldwide shipping industry has also adopted AI, especially predictive analytics, to optimize supply chain economics.
5. Retail
Retail analytics is already seeing widespread adoption among retailers. Apart from optimizing the supply chain, retailers are also able to accurately predict how much to stock in their supermarkets. Moreover, by collecting data about the way that customers access the store, they are able to arrange the products according to customer preferences, thereby increasing the overall sales.
Retail is also set to be disrupted by AI in the form of self-shop stores. Amazon has already demonstrated a proof-of-concept for completely autonomous shopping. Amazon Go has already opened several stores all over the United States. It utilizes machine learning, deep learning, image recognition, and smart automation to allow customers to walk in and walk out with the products of their choice.
Apart from brick-and-mortar establishments, Amazon has cemented its leadership role in online marketplaces through retail analytics. By analyzing the customer browsing patterns and their purchases on the site, Amazon is able to accurately predict similar products, thus maximizing sales.
6. Cybersecurity
AI in cybersecurity can work with vast databases that most cybersecurity companies maintain to check for virus attacks. The technology is also being adopted by antivirus companies to provide a proactive method of combating cyberattacks.
Due to a large amount of existing data on the kinds of cyber-attacks, malware, and attack vectors, AI can be trained to exhibit reasoning. This will allow companies to employ set-it-and-forget-it AI solutions that will continually monitor the network for any suspicious activity. If an out-of-place activity is detected, the algorithm can immediately patch the hole in security or notify human handlers of the problem. This reduces the time required to solve the problem, thus minimizing risk and loss of information.
In addition to this, long-term cyberattacks on high-profile targets, such as multinational enterprises, can also be detected sooner by AI solutions. AI actively monitors the networks for malicious activities, thus allowing a company to detect an attack a lot sooner. This is integral in reducing damage and protecting the company from financial and data losses.
7. Transportation
Autonomous driving is considered as one of the most revolutionary uses of AI in the real world. Self-driving cars have already made their way into the mainstream due to companies like Tesla, and even Uber is looking into deploying autonomous vehicles. Giants like Google are also creating self-driving technology.
Apart from this, autonomous driving can also be used for goods transportation. Self-driving trucks will enable quicker deliveries and more efficient spending, as they will not require rest stops and will cost lesser than human drivers. An example of this is Tesla’s Semi automobile. This truck has safety features that are made possible by AI algorithms. These image processing algorithms can determine if a collision is imminent based on the speed of the vehicle and the perceived depth of other vehicles on the road.
Soon, this technology will advance enough to allow humans to take the position of a supervisor, who will only be required to monitor the AI. Driving will become autonomous in such circumstances, thereby reducing the strain on human drivers and cutting down the expenses for companies.

8. Marketing
The marketing industry will benefit from AI in two main ways. The first is more personalized messaging, and the second is better targeting. Other smaller benefits, such as intelligent automation and AI-based tools, have already begun surfacing and are being adopted.
AI marketing solutions can also determine the most effective messaging for a company based on customer preferences. For example, if a customer orders a pair of shoes, the algorithm sends out a notification to the customer for similar products, thereby increasing the likelihood of the customer buying another product.
AI will enable marketing departments to reach customers more easily, as targeted advertising using neural networks becomes more widespread. Services like Google and Facebook ads have already started using AI technology for better targeting. Recommendation engines can also be used for personalized advertisements on a user-to-user basis.
9. Defense
Even though the advancement of autonomous weapons has been regulated heavily, this sector is sure to develop with the amount of capital being poured into it. Ethical consequences of creating autonomous weapons have also been considered, but AI-powered weapons are said to be indicative of the next arms race.
Apart from autonomous weapons, image recognition and video recognition may be used for surveillance of the general population. By building upon existing databases with biometric and facial scans, a citizen can be identified using facial recognition algorithms in surveillance networks. This increases the general security of the nation while reducing human intervention.
Ethical discussions about the use of this technology have also emerged, as it can be misused to enforce an authoritarian style of rule. Such technology has already seen deployment in China, where widespread facial recognition algorithms are being used to create a social credit system. Citizens are graded, based on their actions, which are logged using AI-based cameras.
10. Lifestyle
AI will also lead to several lifestyle changes, such as smart homes and integrated living. Devices such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa have become popular all over the world, and chatbots might see more representation in the coming years across industries.
Such devices have already seen widespread use among the general populace. Along with the rise of the internet of things, predictive algorithms can enable an automated way of living for adopters. For example, a fridge can use image recognition algorithms to detect if it is running low on vegetables. It can then place an order at a nearby grocery store and have the groceries delivered to the user’s doorstep through a robot.
This method of living will extend into an everyday household undertaking. Moreover, the overall disruption brought about by AI will fundamentally change life as we know it.
Expert Insights
Talking about the industries that will get disrupted by AI the most, Michael BeckleyOpens a new window , CTO and founder, AppianOpens a new window , says, “Stories about AI Disruption used to center around fintech startups or truck drivers getting replaced by autonomous vehicles. That all changed on September 14, 2019, when a swarm of 19 AI-powered drones crippled Saudi Arabia’s oil production and disrupted the national security industry forever.
Multi-billion dollar air defenses, Patriot missiles, satellites, and fifth-generation fighters are virtually powerless to stop inexpensive, easy to produce, drones and missiles powered by today’s readily available, commercial-grade AI technology. We are just beginning to process the consequences for global security, let alone the disruption to the defense industrial base. Nothing less than a revolution in speed and agility in procuring and fielding new technology and doctrine is required.”
Talking about the ones that will be the last to be disrupted by AI, he says, “Highly regulated industries are proving especially resilient to AI disruption. You need to be able to explain to financial regulators why you turned someone down for a mortgage, and that is difficult or even impossible with today’s deep learning technology.
While we work on inventing explainable AI, financial services firms are using AI and RPA with Low-Code platforms to augment human decisions rather than replace them. AI-powered image recognition, document classification, entity extraction, and translation services can make humans far more efficient without fundamentally disrupting the way humans process claims and make decisions.”
Jeff DenworthOpens a new window , VP products and co-founder, VAST DataOpens a new window , says, “I think the transportation and logistics industry is going to be severely disrupted as the machines that warehouse and move goods through our economy become smart enough to make their human operators obsolete.
The AI driving a truck from the port of Long Beach to Chicago doesn’t have to stop for legally required meal and sleep breaks, doesn’t drive off the road because it didn’t get a good night’s sleep, and doesn’t need health insurance or a pension.
Unfortunately, this will create real disruption in people’s lives as all the drivers have to make the transition from the king of the open road to finding new professions in mid-life.
He further adds, “The industries that will be the most resistant to AI are those based on some combination of personal service and creativity. As AI becomes “smart” enough to take over mundane tasks, people will start valuing the human touch.
Sure, you can order your drinks from a tablet, and they can be delivered by a simple robot, but a human bartender does more than just mixing gin with tonic. People will still want to talk to their bartender and barber, and even more importantly, when things go wrong, they want to talk to a human being who can both listen and do something about the problem.
If we’re lucky, as automation and AI take over ordinary tasks, some company in a service industry like an airline or hotel chain will realize that granting their humans more authority to deal with the failures of AI will lead to greater customer loyalty and therefore profits rather than having the AIs treat humans like more AIs.”
Stan ChristiaensOpens a new window , CTO and co-founder, CollibraOpens a new window , has more to add. He shares, “Before I tackle the industry disruptions, I want to unpack AI a little bit to provide context for my choices:

AI automates decision making. When a human gets incoming data – such as a report – they make a handful of decisions. Per minute? Per hour? Per day? AI can process a lot more incoming data while producing a lot more decisions much faster. From a disruption perspective, this means industries with a large workforce spending over 80% of their time making medium complexity decisions.
AI is only as meaningful as the data available to feed the machine. From a disruption perspective, this means industries that access to a wide variety and volume of data, or where innovative ways to quickly and economically collect data can exist.

Media has already been disrupted by AI as their advertising based business models were hijacked by platforms with AI-driven bidding markets and audience targeting. The reason third party platform players have been able to do this is because they found a scalable, economic way to collect the data that powers their AI (e.g., web searches or social network interactions). Banks and insurance are clear candidates for similar disruption.
Talking about the industries that will be the last to be disrupted by AI, he says, “At first glance it would seem that healthcare has a lot of opportunity for disruption (e.g., scan analysis, patient monitoring, etc.) but its legacy and regulatory environments create a barrier on the required data which will slow down the disruption.
Industries that strongly depend on physical activity such as mining or steel would be very hard to disrupt as well. Sure, AI can optimize where you have to mine or how to better process steel, but the optimization would have to be very significant (10x) to make disruption possible.
If I can only give one answer to the question who will be the last to be disrupted by AI, it would be Strategic Consulting. AI has a long way to go before it can reach the levels of complex decision making and creativity required.”
Closing Thoughts for Techies
While artificial intelligence is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, its effects on existing markets are yet to be seen. We are at the beginning of the adoption curve for AI and its accompanying technologies, and the long-term benefits will soon be witnessed.
With that being said, the current capabilities of AI make it clear that we are nowhere near discovering its full potential or impact on society. From lifestyle changes to behind-the-scenes improvements in normal societal institutions, AI is changing the way every industry conducts mission-critical operations.

In a company using AI for data analysis-related tasks, roles are split between the various methods of handling data. These include data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. These roles involve using AI as a tool, with most of the focus being handling and wrangling data to derive knowledge known as ‘insights’.
However, in the AI field as a whole, individuals specialize in creating algorithms, researching the capabilities of AI technologies, and organizing solutions for use on a larger scale. These are AI developers, researchers, and architects, respectively. This approach of creating specific designations for each part of an AI algorithm’s workflow allows companies to scale quickly by hiring specific talent.
One of the most prominent roles in the market is that of the machine learning engineer. The responsibilities of machine learning engineers include the responsibilities of data scientists and software engineers, with a special focus on using and managing machine learning algorithms.
AI Job Roles
Here’s how you can plan your career path for some of the most prominent roles in the AI domain.
How to Become an AI Developer?
AI developers are hired to provide solutions to various issues using AI and programming. AI developers are responsible for designing, developing, and deploying AI-based systems. This includes keeping up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and coming up with new ways to improve existing infrastructures.
AI developers are expected to have an intrinsic understanding of AI concepts, statistics, and mathematics, along with expertise in programming languages, such as Python. They are also required to build the accompanying infrastructure of AI models, such as ingesting data, transforming data, and creating data lakes.
This requires AI developers to develop their knowledge of a specific skill set under AI-based skills, especially Python and R programming languages. These languages make up the core of many AI systems. Under Python, knowledge of libraries, such as TensorFlow, SciKit Learn, and Keras are heavily sought-after.
Aspirants are also required to have a working knowledge of the fundamental concepts and principles behind machine learning. Expertise in fields, such as text mining, data pre-processing, and data cleaning is another must-have.
How to Become an AI Architect?
The role of AI architect requires professionals to have a big-picture outlook of AI operations of an organization. The AI architect is in charge of the AI platform, thus providing services for customers while evolving the product according to the changing requirements of the company.
AI architects are responsible for putting AI systems in operation and managing them. This includes creating the required infrastructure and managing the compute needs of the systems. They are also responsible for looking at the data-to-insight-to-action loop closely, thus requiring a bigger outlook of the general state of the company’s operations.
AI architects are also responsible for ensuring secondary objectives, such as the security of the solution, stability of the product in general, and how easy it is to use. Owing to the higher skill level required for this job, aspirants are expected to have experience in other AI-related roles before considering the role of an AI architect. It is recommended to have over five years of experience in a job of the same domain.

How to Become a Machine Learning Engineer?
Machine learning engineers are expected to be subject matter experts in their sub-field as well as in devising AI solutions and applying the right solution to a problem. This is more of a generalist approach that requires a professional to have a working knowledge of various fields of AI.
Since this is a mid-level role, individuals can transition from similar roles to this one. Machine learning engineers can also consider a more generalized role in an environment where various concepts of AI can be used in conjunction with each other. The actual problems that organizations face are rarely solved with the help of one specialization.
Knowledge in fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, deep learning, and visualization, is required for the role of a machine learning engineer. As with any AI role, expertise in data wrangling software, such as Hadoop and Spark and statistical languages like R are also common requirements.
Knowledge of machine learning concepts also comes with the ability to work with Python and C++ efficiently. Depending on the requirements of the job, specialized knowledge in programming libraries relating to specific sub-fields may also be required.
How to Become a Data Analyst?
Data analysts are discrete from machine learning and AI-related roles, as they directly focus on deriving insights from data using machine learning as a tool. Machine learning-related roles focus on the AI solution instead. In a nutshell, data analysts have the capability to transition an ordinary business into a data-driven one.
Data analysts focus on providing data to the individuals that require it and are tasked with analyzing the data and determining its importance. By doing so, they aim to gauge its impact on the larger scheme of a company’s functioning. Overall, they take data and use it to supercharge operations for more efficient decision-making.
Their primary role is to perform data analysis and present the results in a way that is easy for stakeholders to perceive. Using this analysis, data analysts provide information regarding any changes in the company’s market, along with a potential solution to maximize adaptiveness. This makes communication skills one of the must-have skills for a data analyst.
Along with in-depth knowledge of statistics and data management methods, data analysts must make use of effective communication skills to convey information accurately. It has to be done in a way that is easy for non-technical professionals to understand. This makes data analysts the bridge between AI-powered solutions and business decision-makers.

How to Become a Data Scientist?
Termed “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” by the Harvard Business Review, data scientist roles are one of the most sought-after in the AI/ML domain. Data scientists use machine learning as one of the tools in their vast arsenal, with the end goal of deriving useful insights from data and providing them to the company.
Along with cleaning and organizing big data, data scientists make heavy use of statistics to identify patterns in collected datasets. Descriptive statistics and analysis are also a big part of data science roles, as they have to use these to derive actionable insights for companies.
Data scientists use ML and deep learning (DL) models to solve a business need for the company. This requires them to have a specialization in programming languages, such as Python and Java. Machine learning is used by data scientists as a tool for smart automation and as a means to derive helpful insights from large datasets.
Communication is an important part of a data scientist’s role, as they are required to communicate insights to the stakeholders of the company. Data scientists are also required to be familiar with software, such as Tableau, R, and MatLab for data wrangling and visualization needs.
When asked about the most lucrative job role in artificial intelligence, Ryan FoltzOpens a new window , PhD., data scientist, ExabeamOpens a new window , says, “Academia is attractive for a lot of reasons, but it’s a field where it can be extremely challenging to forge a career. That helps to explain why over the last 10 years approximately 60% of new physics PhDs end up taking jobs in areas of industry, such as engineering, computer software and hardware, business, and non-STEM.
As a former astrophysicist and current data scientist in cybersecurity, I’ve seen the overlap within the fields, and it is substantial at a fundamental level.
Emerging technical fields like data science offer an exciting, innovative way to apply the software, math and statistics skills learned from non-traditional sources like astrophysics to make real contributions to the field, which is moving rapidly.
Data scientists have the opportunity to apply cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world, difficult problems. And those studying non-traditionally tech-related subjects possess the core skills needed to solve those problems creatively, proficiently, and efficiently.”
Talking about the talent shortage in the field, Sergey KolychevOpens a new window , distinguished engineer, WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , says, “Research scientist is the most lucrative role and the one that is facing most shortage at present and for a good reason.
It’s quite easy and not time-consuming to become a machine learning engineer because current ML applications and libraries are well documented, easy to use, there’s a lot of examples on how to create an ML model, how to deploy it to production, how to prepare the data, and so on.
So, the ML engineer role has a pretty low barrier for entry. Consequently, there is a lot of proposition in the market, reducing earning potential and shortage. Data scientist is a second in the food chain and has more of earning potential but requires longer time spent on education and work experience, excellent grasp on statistics, and data preparation.
However, one can still be pretty successful in this role by only utilizing off the shelf solutions, libraries, and techniques. But due to a considerable time investment required, potential shortage for this type is more acute than for an ML engineer.
Most lucrative (if this person works in industry and not in academia) role is a research scientist, a role that certainly requires a PhD and multiple published papers in respected journals. Such individuals are able to lead ML teams, develop novel ML techniques from scratch, according to unique client needs.
To become a research scientist, one will require a considerable raw talent and a significant time investment. There are not a lot of these people and as far as I know they are compensated extremely well in the right places.”
Closing Thoughts for Techies
The ML/AI field has various specializations for aspirants, which means that the pay scale and job responsibilities for each of these roles must factor into their decision. The examples listed here are just a few compared to all the different roles that companies offer today. Specializations definitely make for better market value and experience.
That being said, these specializations must not be a hasty decision. Owing to the varied technology stack and requirements for these jobs, aspirants must choose a job role that they feel comfortable with. There are various online courses for AI specializations so that aspirants can choose something that they are interested in.
In addition to pursuing the right certificate courses, job seekers must also aim to execute a project relevant to their area of expertise. This is listed as a requirement for many job listings and allows employers to determine the quality of an aspirant’s work. Those willing to get into the AI domain must also decide whether they have the required soft skills for the job.

And there is still plenty of opportunity to do so; a US Census Bureau study shows that AI technologies have yet to catch on in most industries. The study of nearly 600,000 US businesses shows that only a few percent were using advanced AI technologies like machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and others.Even if its capabilities are currently limited, AI can have a significant impact among businesses that use it. An Accenture study shows that the top ten percent of companies that adopted AI and cloud-based strategies grew revenue during a three year period by 25% over competitors who did not aggressively implement those technologies. And that&#x27;s just with the limited AI capabilities available today.The benefits of those limited capabilities are available right now &amp;ndash; and businesses should be taking advantage of them, even if the benefits they can realize now are limited. It&#x27;s not just about this quarter&#x27;s profits &amp;ndash; it&#x27;s about preparing for the day in the very near future when AI technology will be a centerpiece of successful businesses. That preparation &amp;ndash; including building infrastructure that will enable the organization to easily implement AI technologies, guiding customers on how that infrastructure will work, and developing work habits and procedures to accommodate AI technologies &amp;ndash; needs to begin now, while AI is still evolving, before the revolution has really gotten underway.A good example of this process at work is in the insurance inspection business, where adjusters are increasingly turning to AI in order to work more quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Inspections are, by their nature, time-consuming, and even experienced adjusters can make mistakes. In addition, because each inspector and inspection system is different, it&#x27;s difficult to achieve real objectivity; &amp;ldquo;damage&amp;rdquo; is often labeled as such based on the subjective impression of the adjustor, instead of an objective standard.Home inspections can also greatly benefit from AI &amp;ndash; especially roof inspections, considered by many to be the weak link in an inspection. Roofs are difficult to access - safety issues such as climbing on ladders and working on pitched roofs abound - and roof damage is often hidden beneath tiles or other coverings. In recent years, insurers have begun using drones to take photos of roofs, but those who go a step farther &amp;ndash; analyzing those images using machine learning and other AI-based technologies &amp;ndash; will be able to realize more extensive benefits.Using machine learning, AI systems can compare between thousands of images, with the system honing in on imperfections or anomalies that could indicate hidden damage, similar to systems being developed in other areas, like medical imaging. Inspections based on such analysis would be more objective and efficient. The system could analyze images based on a machine learning-powered engine that could quickly determine an objective standard for damage. AdvertisementAnother area where AI can be an important addition is vehicle inspection. Here, too, &amp;ldquo;damage&amp;rdquo; is often a subjective call by the adjustor &amp;ndash; but with AI, objective standards can be implemented. AI would help make the vehicle inspection process much more efficient; for example, if a manual inspection takes 45 minutes, an AI-based one could take 10 minutes. While some early systems are indeed available, they are not widely used &amp;ndash; generally still requiring a professional rather than a consumer who can simply use their phone &amp;mdash; and the full range of benefits are still not attainable. But they will be in the near future &amp;ndash; and businesses that want to remain ahead of the curve and benefit from the changes AI will bring need to get on the bandwagon right now.The key is for potential beneficiaries of these technologies to realize that the slight incremental improvement they can see now will soon be a significant improvement &amp;ndash; but if they don&#x27;t begin implementing these systems now and guiding customers &amp;ndash; as well as their own personnel &amp;ndash; in how to use them, they will be riding the coattails of the revolution, when it inevitably breaks out. Then they will be playing catch-up to companies that did have the vision to move forward when AI was still evolutionary &amp;ndash; and often, companies never do catch up from that innovation lag.

When most people hear “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence,” the last thing that comes to mind is a technology that requires human interaction. Usually, it’s the opposite. More computers and more technology mean fewer humans need to be involved.
Machine learning can, however, improve the daily lives of humans in industries of all natures, particularly in construction.
While machine learning in construction may appear to be a distant concept decades away from becoming a reality, the technology’s future is closer than you think. In reality, machine learning has been gaining traction in the construction business for years and, simply put, rather than removing humans from the equation, it allows individuals to accomplish their jobs more efficiently.

Driving Forces: Why Isn’t the Construction Industry Further Along in Adopting New Technology?
Because the construction industry has been slower to adopt the level of technological advancements applied in other industries, the job of constructing buildings has become increasingly difficult for its workers.
However, finding the resources to incorporate new technology while staying on track with building projects is difficult. Machine learning has the potential to propel the construction sector forward, improving conditions and productivity for workers, contracting organizations, and clients on a daily basis.
What Is Machine Learning and How Does It Work?
Before we delve too far into the topic, let’s make sure we cover the basics, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the notion. The definition of machine learning provided by the book Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach centers on the definition of what it means to be intelligent: “the ability to learn is one of the most fundamental aspects of intelligent behaviour.”
With machine learning, machines essentially have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. So machines can self-learn and forecast outcomes based on what statistically significant patterns they discover in the data they are receiving. Instead of having a human program them, they employ software with algorithms that enable them to make predictions based on data analysis. A machine, for example, can alert you to the need for preventative maintenance based on data it collects from the equipment it’s monitoring.
Machine learning is now considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It sounds like science fiction, but it has many technical and practical uses.
3 Ways Machine Learning Can Be Useful in Construction
There are plenty of ways in which machine learning can be used to help humans in the construction workplace, and it covers a range of different niches and considerations. Some of the most important include:
1. Improving Design Quality
Machine learning has the potential to improve the overall design of a building for its occupants. Workspace businesses (WeWork, for example) use the technology to better analyze and estimate the frequency of use for meeting rooms, allowing companies to optimize the design of those spaces before construction begins.
Machine learning can also assist workers in identifying potential design flaws and omissions before proceeding with construction.
2. Creating a Safer Workplace
Of course, safety on building jobsites is a top priority, and machine learning can help. Consider the testing of VINNIE [Very Intelligent Neural Network for Insight and Evaluation] artificial intelligence as reported by Engineering News-Record in 2016:
“VINNIE detected safety hazards, such as a person who was not wearing a hard hat, far more quickly and accurately than the human team. In comparison, a team of human specialists took over 4.5 hours to review over 1,000 entries, whereas VINNIE took less than 10 minutes. The human team correctly identified 414 photographs with persons, while VINNIE correctly identified 446.” 
At the end of the day, a safer work environment benefits the entire workforce.
3. Assessing and Reducing Risk
Hand in hand with the above example is one of the most wonderful aspects of machine learning: its ability to predict dangers before they occur. For instance, using predictive analytics, machine learning can help you identify hazards, quantify their impact, and reduce or avoid them.

What Does the Future of Machine Learning in Construction Look Like?
Machine learning requires enormous subsets of data to be effective and accurate. Lack of sufficient data is what’s currently preventing many small and medium-size construction firms from using this technology. Increasing the amount of data available and integrating it will help the entire sector progress to a better, more efficient, and more productive future, creating a critical mass of construction firms that can benefit from machine learning … especially if technological systems are integrated. 
But lack of integration is one of the current hurdles construction faces because even if you have a large amount of digitized data available, unless technology platforms are adequately integrated, data will remain separated. That’s the case now in the construction industry overall and also within many building companies, which use multiple unintegrated platforms within their business. This will be something that needs to be addressed over time.
However, this is a challenge many businesses in a wide range of industries face, and is therefore a problem best solved collectively.
Conclusion: Machine Learning Works
Machine learning and AI in construction share an intriguing future together, starting right now. But while machine learning is expected to have an impact on the future of construction, this doesn’t mean machines and technology will take away human jobs.
Construction is and always will be a human endeavor. To win the future, we need our workers’ talents, competence, and invention to remain, we just need to optimize it. Machine learning can be used as yet another instrument to showcase our industry’s expertise and growth.

Over the years, the further evolution of AI into a more advanced form has changed our outlook on everything. Quite similarly, AI has a drastic impact on software development and testing. Experts are anticipating the increased use of artificial intelligence for software development so that it can increase the efficiency of the software development lifecycle. Currently, maximum software enterprises are adopting emerging AI technologies in software development to stay abreast in the competition. The technology is poised to alter basic development fundamentals through acute means, but many believe that it will bring serious challenges to the traditional methods of software development. But if AI is fully capable of augmenting the development lifecycle and automating the entire procedure, what will be the role of programmers and developers? .Well, tech and market analysts are quite worried about the impact of AI on their job roles. With challenges to the traditional working environments, developers and programmers are worried that they will face acute job losses and layoffs soon. With the rapid development of such advanced technologies, it is quite obvious that companies would like to cut costs of human labour and reduce errors. Nevertheless, this is a huge step for AI and companies alike that can help progress the reach of AI into various other domains, including software development and programming. .LEVERAGING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO SOLVE UI/UX DESIGN ISSUES IN 2021HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INFLUENCE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY?ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN JOURNALISM: WHERE IS MEDIA HEADED? .Is AI code writing and development possible?.Recent reports on AI and its developments have revealed that the advancements of this technology along with its adjoining solutions will be responsible for writing better software codes, and they will do it faster than the best human developers and programmers in the global industry. Experts warn that software developers and programmers might get computerized with the advances in machine learning algorithms. The optimization of safety-critical areas in software development tasks by AI solutions is also one of the major reasons why businesses are thinking about deploying AI in software development, testing and programming tasks. The technology can ensure that the code quality is high and delivers all the functional requirements. .Besides, intelligent programming and development assistance from AI can cut down on the workload in terms of automating the creation of code and identifying faults in the code manually. Artificial intelligence can be used to develop advanced business concepts for huge projects that are labour-intensive and time-consuming. .Enterprises are continually evolving, along with the ever-changing landscape of technology. Transformation of legacy applications and large-scale refactoring is essential with critical necessities, and deploying machine learning algorithms and frameworks will analyze codes and automatically optimize them for interoperability and higher performance. .What else can AI do in software development and programming?.Software development often involves exceeding the assigned budgets and misses deadlines. But it is also critical to understand the context, map resources, and understand the strengths of the implementation team. Machine learning can correlate data from past projects regarding user experiences, estimate the accurate budget, and ensure proper planning for more efficiency. AI solutions help prioritize products and features, as well as provide near-perfect details about the different complexities that give the business leaders and managers enough time to identify the methods that help maximize profit and minimize risks. The technology is also turning around testing and maintenance which is also an integral part of the software development lifecycle. AI in software testing allows IT companies to completely transform software testing into a robust automated process reuniting minimal intervention of humans.  .So, will AI really replace developers?.A simple answer to this immensely critical question is a big 'NO' for now. AI will not be replacing developers or programmers anytime soon but might perform coding and developing tasks in the future. Researchers and AI scientists believe that it will take time for AI to be able to create actual production-worthy and usable code that spans more than a few lines. AI is not yet poised to replace developers or programmers but will be essentially designed to help developers understand their options. It is for human professionals to decide how to optimize the AI and ML solutions for their own benefit..Developers will also use AI as a coding pair to develop better software and applications. AI will not replace the true value of developers, instead, help them become more efficient. The industry will employ more such developers who will efficiently deploy such advanced technologies for better results and maximized revenues. It will take longer for AI to interpret the business value of each feature, so developers will always remain valuable for enterprises. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial Intelligence is defined as the capability to which a machine can exhibit intelligent characteristics. To determine the type and scope of their intelligence, they have been classified into three types.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has certainly started to affect our lives in significant ways, making it essential to stay ahead of the curve. The types of artificial intelligence are a way to visualize what the future of AI would be, as AI begins to take on the more human aspects of cognition. Learning about the types of AI is integral to understand how they would progress in the future. Read on to learn about the endgame of artificial intelligence.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence refers to any cognitive process exhibited by a non-human entity. Today’s AI includes computer programs that perform tasks similar to human cognition, including learning, vision, logical reasoning, and more.
Owing to its several benefits, AI is prevalent in the enterprise and consumer space today. Modern algorithms can provide labor that is as accurate as a human employee, except many times faster.
AI has long been researched as a way to bring automation to the same level of cognitive functioning as humans. Now, smart automation is but one of the many applications of AI algorithms and software.
Artificial intelligence has many subcategories, such as neural networks and deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. These are used mainly in smartphones and Internet applications, as they offer a quick and easy way to optimize the user experience.
When asked about the benefits of artificial intelligence, Oliver Tearle, Head of Research, The ai Corporation, says, “AI and machine learning exist for two purposes: solving problems that require a lot of repeated, often complex manual effort, and to solve problems humans can’t solve. It is impossible for a human to continually understand and extract insight from very large data sources that grow over time. A machine can do this very efficiently and never gets tired. It continually works on the problem with sustained effectiveness.
Applying AI and machine learning throughout a business not only saves time and effort by replacing manual processes with machines, but it allows those teams to innovate and pursue revenue generation activities.
What’s more, the machine can use the insight from the data it has seen to predict future behavior. AI and ML can be implemented as an insight generation tool, allowing a business to remain on top of the critical behavior of its customers. Enabling a business to take swift action to make the most of events identified by the technology.”
Types of Artificial Intelligence
In order to differentiate between the degree to which AI applications can conduct tasks, they are generally split into three types. These types are distinct from each other and show the natural progression to AI systems today.
Contrary to popular belief, artificial intelligence is not here to replace humanity, as it is nothing but a technology that is used by humans. In its current state, it is merely a program that can be trained to perform tasks. As it advances in the future, it is important to create a legal, ethical, and moral framework to govern AI.

The consequences of AI’s advancement must be considered when taking a look at the types of artificial intelligence that have been proposed to exist in the future. As the scale progresses from generally lower to higher intelligence, more human-like characteristics, such as emotions and thought processes, might present themselves. This makes the regulation of AI and its related technologies a difficult undertaking for a developed society.
It’s crucial to have a forward-thinking mentality as the future of artificial intelligence has been mapped out, primarily by the types of AI that are described today. Let’s dive deeper into what these types are.
Narrow Artificial Intelligence
Narrow AI is the most prevalent kind of AI today. From applications in mobile phones to the Internet to big data analytics, narrow AI is taking the world by storm.
The name stems from the fact that this kind of artificial intelligence systems are explicitly created for a single task. Owing to this narrow approach and inability to perform tasks other than the ones that are specified to them, they are also called as ‘weak’ AI. This makes their intelligence highly-focused on one task or set of tasks, allowing for further optimization and tweaking.
Why Is It Called Narrow Intelligence?
Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks and cannot perform tasks other than the ones specified to it. This narrow focus is mainly due to the following factors:
Narrow AI is a Complex Computer Program
Narrow AI is usually restricted in its scope because it is created to solve a problem. It is built with the explicit focus of ensuring that a task is completed, with its architecture and functioning representing this.
Today’s narrow AI is not made up of non-quantifiable parts; it is just a computer program running as per the instructions given to it. Due to these constraints and specified use-case, narrow AI has a laser focus on the tasks it was created for.
Narrow AI is Created as per Today’s Standards and Tools
With the increase in adoption of AI by enterprises, the technology is expected to do one thing and do it well. While the use-case might differ from company to company, the expectations are the same – an exponential increase to the bottom line. Today, this can be done only with narrow AI.
Narrow AI is developed in an environment where the problem is front-and-center, using the latest technology. Artificial intelligence, in general, is a highly research-oriented field, and the research groundwork to create something more than a single use-case system has not been laid out yet. This creates AI with a narrow focus.
Owing to its high efficiency, speed, and consumption rate over humans, narrow artificial intelligence is one of the go-to solutions for corporates. For a wide variety of low-level tasks, narrow AI can employ smart automation and integration to provide efficiency while maintaining accuracy.
This makes it a favored choice for tasks that involve million-scale datasets, known as big data. With personal data collection being prevalent, companies have a large amount of big data at their disposal that can be used for training AI and deriving insights from it.
Examples of Narrow AI
Today, narrow AI is also used in various Internet applications that we use on a daily basis. Following are a few examples of narrow AI:
Recommendation Systems
Whenever you see a ‘recommended’ tag on a website, it is usually put there by a narrow AI. By looking at a user’s preferences with respect to the database of content or information, an AI is able to determine their likes and dislikes.
This is then used to offer recommendations, thus providing a more personalized experience to the user. This is commonly seen on sites, such as Netflix (“Because you watched…”), YouTube (“Recommended”), Twitter (“Top Tweets first”), and many more services.
Spam Filtering
Narrow AI with natural language processing capabilities is employed to keep our inboxes clean. Employees cannot check every spam email they receive, but it’s a perfect task for narrow AI.
Google is the leader in providing email services and has evolved its narrow AI to a point where it conducts various email-related tasks. Along with AI-powered spam filters, they can also assign a category to a particular type of email (promotions, reminders, important, and so on).

Expert Systems
Narrow AI has the capability to create expert systems, which could pave the way for the future of AI. Just as human intelligence is comprised of various senses and logical, creative, and cognitive tasks; expert systems also consist of many parts.
Expert systems may represent the future of artificial intelligence. This term is used to denote an AI system made up of many smaller narrow AI algorithms. For example, IBM Watson, which is made of a natural language processing component along with a cognitive aspect.
General Artificial Intelligence
While narrow AI refers to where artificial intelligence has reached today, general AI refers to where it will be in the future. Also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and strong AI, general artificial intelligence is a type of AI that can think and function just as humans do.
This includes perceptual tasks, such as vision and language processing, along with cognitive tasks, such as processing, contextual understanding, thinking, and a more generalized approach to thinking as a whole.
While narrow AI is created as a means to execute a specific task, general AI can be broad and adaptable. The learning part of an adaptive general intelligence also has to be unsupervised, as opposed to the supervised and labeled learning that narrow AI is put through today.
General AI is still a far off reality, as the tools required to build it are not available today. Many argue that neural networks are a dependable way to create the forerunners of what can be called general artificial intelligence, but the reality of the situation is that human intelligence is still a black box.
While we as humans are beginning to decode the inner workings of our minds and brains, we are still a long way from figuring out what ‘intelligence’ means. In addition to this obstacle, the need to define ‘consciousness’ is integral to creating a general AI. This is due to the fact that an AGI needs to be ‘conscious’ and not just an algorithm or machine.
Challenges of General Artificial Intelligence
There are various pitfalls associated with general artificial intelligence. Some of them include:
Replicating Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a term used to denote applying the knowledge learned in one domain to another. This is something that humans engage in every day and is an important part of society. For example, the knowledge of how to ride a bicycle is applied in riding a motorcycle.
This is something that neural networks have become better at doing recently; a positive sign for the future. A capable AGI needs to have strong transfer learning capabilities to avoid retraining.
Enabling Common Sense and Collaboration
Common sense is integral to human functioning, along with collaboration on tasks with other human minds. Due to the narrow nature of today’s algorithms, dependable collaboration has not been achieved, with common sense being a far-off reality.
To create a true general artificial intelligence, it needs to be imbued with such characteristics to ensure that it is not just another narrow AI. This will set it apart from the systems that came before it, as it will not only collaborate with other machines but also with humans.
Figuring Out Consciousness and Mind
Consciousness is an integral part of being human and being conscious is the most resilient method of determining the existence of intelligence. In addition to this, the human mind is still something that has not been decoded. These remain as significant obstacles to the creation and achievement of general artificial intelligence.

Artificial Super Intelligence
Artificial super intelligence (ASI) is a term used to denote an AI that exceeds human cognition by a great extent in every possible way. This is one of the most far-off theories of artificial intelligence but is generally considered to be the eventual endgame of creating an AI.
While artificial super intelligence is still a theory at this point in time, a lot of scenarios involving it have already been envisioned. A common consensus among those in the field is that ASI will come from the exponential growth of AI algorithms, also known as ‘Intelligence Explosion’.
Intelligence explosion is a concept required for the creation of artificial super intelligence. As the name suggests, it is an explosion of intelligence from human-level, general artificial intelligence to an unthinkable level. This occurs through recursive self-improvement.
Self-improvement in AI comes in the form of learning from user input in neural networks. Recursive self-improvement, on the other hand, is the capacity of an AI system to learn from itself, at rapidly increasing levels of increasing intelligence.
To illustrate this, take the example of an AGI functioning at the level of average human intelligence. It will learn from itself, using the cognitive capabilities of an average human, to reach genius-level intelligence. However, this begins compounding, and any future learning made by the AI will be conducted at a genius-level cognitive functioning.
This accelerates at a fast pace, creating an intelligence that is smarter than itself at every step. This continues to build up quickly, until the point where intelligence explodes, and a super intelligence is born. Containing or creating a super intelligence is something that we as a human race are far from, making it an entry for sci-fi novels. For now.
Theory of Mind in Artificial Intelligence
In psychology, the theory of mind is the ability to connect what one is feeling to the reality that they are feeling it. In other words, it is the ability of humans to attribute their mental state to themselves while recognizing that they are different from others.
It is an important part of social cognition and is integral for a human being to function in society. Replicating the theory of mind and a construct such as the ‘mind’ may be what we are missing to create a true general artificial intelligence.
In a way, the theory of mind is a way for individuals to create a simulation of the consequences of their actions. This can be replicated in AI by creating an internal simulation which contains a model of the AI itself, along with a model of the world.
This brings a perspective of ‘common sense’ to the model and can represent solving one of the primary challenges of creating a general AI. Experts believe that this is one of the biggest steps that will bridge the gap between the neural networks of today to create a stronger, more adaptive AI.
Key Takeaways for Techies
Artificial intelligence can be leveraged by techies to stay ahead of the curve in the IT space today. As this technology is transforming at a rapid pace, those in the market are especially required to stay ahead of the curve.
It is also important to understand concepts, such as AGI and ASI, as they may eventually turn into reality. Moreover, it is also important to note that we are at the beginning of using AI, and the algorithms used today are restricted to narrow tasks.
It is safe to say that AGI and ASI will disrupt the world in a way we cannot envision. The narratives portrayed in movies involving AI, especially those such as ‘Her’ and ‘I, Robot’, may, in fact, come true with the rise of general AI.
One of the more important topics for the techies to consider is the ethics of AGI and ASI. While it might be redundant in the latter case, the dependable regulation and ethical treatment of general AI is important for many reasons.
Society as a whole needs to catch up with the idea of computers being able to think and put laws in place to ensure the ethical treatment of such machines. Owing to the disruptive nature of general AI, the consequences must be foreseen to avoid several issues in the future.

The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Hyderabad) has launched the beta version of ‘Swarajability’, a job portal powered by artificial intelligence that helps people with disabilities acquire relevant skills and find jobs. The platform will analyse the profiles of the job seekers and suggest the skills they would require to become eligible. A platform that addressed this challenge would help this vulnerable section of the population.
The institute has developed the platform in association with Youth4Jobs, Visual Quest and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. While IIT-H offers its expertise in AI, Visual Quest India has developed the platform. Youth4Jobs provides skilling services to job seekers.

The future of artificial intelligence is a subject of many discussions and speculations. Due to the hype-filled nature of this field, the future of AI has been the epicenter of exaggerated claims and theories of ground-breaking disruption. However, the benefits that automation through AI provides to companies today is undeniable.
Many early adopters of AI-powered solutions have been able to see sizeable gains in the optimization of their processes. The field itself is seeing widespread acceptance among the enterprise sector but is still considered to be a solution that will solve any problem. Therefore, the truth about AI is not known to many who have not dealt with it, and the technology is perceived as a catch-all solution to any enterprise problem.
Keeping this in mind, the only dependable way to gauge the effect of AI on the field is to get in touch with those that interact with the technology. Toolbox reached out to industry experts to get their views on what the future of artificial intelligence would be like.

The Future of AI
The future of artificial intelligence is subject to wild speculation. In many cases, AI is marketed as an end-all solution to every problem faced by an enterprise. Whereas, in reality, it is simply a tool that can be used to optimize complex business processes through intelligent automation.
Explaining this further, Mark Gazit, CEO of ThetaRayOpens a new window , said, “The world is moving from simple AI analytics to a more powerful form – artificial intuition. Up to this point, we’ve only had what I would term “rational” AI, which is comparable to the functioning of the cerebral cortex. Intuitive AI algorithms, on the other hand, replicate the powerful decision-making of human intuition. Looking into the future, we can envision machines that are like humans in thought, memory, emotions, and self-awareness.”
Although AI is a complex concept, customers do not need to understand how it works to appreciate the benefits. This will eventually result in an environment where the end user interacts with the product, while AI provides its benefits in the background.
Agreeing to this, David Gingell, CMO at Seal SoftwareOpens a new window , said, “Few people understand (or even care) how the internet truly works, how transfer protocols work, how data moves around networks or how security is implemented. AI will be like that. It is in the background, facilitating every aspect of computation. AI will be pervasive. In the way that the internet has permeated every facet of human existence, at least in the developed world, so too will AI.”
However, for this widespread adoption of AI to occur, many of the issues that plague it today need to be remedied. This is especially relevant in the fields of data protection and privacy.
Speaking on the subject, Dr. Alain Briançon, Chief Technology Officer and VP Data Science of Cerebri AIOpens a new window , commented, “The future of AI resonates with possible successes that we cannot even dream of today. For AI to be adopted thoroughly, the backlash against the obvious abuses of privacy from social media concerns and the ‘slap happy’ approach to data security will both have to be worked out.”
Owing to its capability to be easily adapted into any field, a suitable AI implementation can often provide a better solution than existing ones. Even existing systems and networks can find improvement in the future through artificial intelligence applications.
Steve Blow, Technology Evangelist at ZertoOpens a new window , said, “In the future, a security system equipped with advanced machine learning will be able to detect the encryption taking place as it happens and then automatically connect with a recovery system to both stop the attack as it’s happening and failover to unencrypted data. This scenario will be a reality in the near future, and eventually, with the rate at which cyber threats are growing, no business will be able to survive or compete without this kind of protective technology in place.”
With the widespread use that this technology has seen over the past few years, it is evident that the field still has room to grow and develop. This makes the future of AI an exciting proposition for enterprises and customers alike.
While talking to Toolbox about the future, Al Brown, the SVP of Engineering at VeritoneOpens a new window , said, “The future of AI is nothing short of amazing. When it comes to AI’s impact on the business world, specifically, we have only scratched the surface of its potential to transform companies around the world. Over the next five years in particular, as AI continues to develop and mature, it will make companies and their employees more effective, efficient, and profitable in their work.”

Which Industries Will AI Disrupt the Most?
With the scale of adoption that AI is witnessing across verticals, widespread disruption seems to be on the horizon. Several industry experts seem to agree that AI will fundamentally change operations across verticals.
Bala Venkatrao, Founding Team & VP of Products, UnravelOpens a new window , stated, “End-users and consumers are now becoming familiar with the increasing predictive intelligence they find in tools, web sites, and the myriad of social, business, and commercial interactions.” He went on to say that any company looking to sell products or services will be disrupted by those that crack the AI code early on.
The future of artificial intelligence is not clear, even to experts, but the outlook is positive. Thomas Ash of CLARA AnalyticsOpens a new window , stated, “Nobody knows what the future will bring, but we know that AI is on the upswing, and its uses will continue to broaden as systems become more refined. Yet, with the explosion of cloud-based services and applications, there is an opportunity for organizations to no longer feel stuck in a singular way of doing business, which is a game-changer.”
When it comes to securing existing systems, AI has the capability to step up and provide tangible improvements. Cybersecurity is one of the biggest fields that is set to be disrupted by AI solutions, as it can process large amounts of data in a relatively short time.
Derek Lin, Chief Data Scientist at ExabeamOpens a new window , when talking about AI’s scope in cybersecurity, said, “AI has already disrupted the SIEM (security information and event management) market. SIEM stores and archives historical data, traditionally used as a data repository for querying post-breach incidents. In the big data era, it didn’t take long for security practitioners to realize AI can be used to comb through data haystacks to proactively search for the information nuggets.”
In an exclusive chat with Toolbox, Shailesh Majrekar, Head of Products and AI/ML Solutions Marketing at SwiftStackOpens a new window , stated, “AI is expected to disrupt existing markets in a big way. Tasks which can be automated and repetitive, can be effectively carried out using AI.” He further pointed out, “For the most part AI will be implemented as augmented artificial intelligence than pure play AI, where humans and AI will work best collaboratively.”

The Next Step for AI Enterprise Adoption
Before companies can fully see the benefits of adopting AI, they must first surpass the pitfalls that stand in their way. With many companies testing out the technology like a proof-of-concept, the pace of AI adoption is slow.
Setu Kulkarni, VP of Strategy and Business Development at WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , provides a possible solution, stating, “AI has to move from a proof-of-concept phase to solving real business problems that move the needle for the business by either reducing time to market, increasing profits, or reducing the costs. The key is to identify the AI-addressable problem statement in your business that can help your organization pivot.”
The general idea of AI also needs to be revamped, with important distinctions being made between hype and reality. A renewed perspective can also enable businesses to discover a new unique selling proposition (USP).
Dr. Alain Briançon, Chief Technology Officer and VP Data Science of Cerebri AIOpens a new window , commented on this, saying, “We need to differentiate what AI could be, versus what it should be. What AI should be is consumer-centric. What companies should be focusing on are new experiences.” He argues that these new experiences, which have an intrinsic focus on the customer, are likely to propel the adoption of AI among enterprises.
Some early adopters are already seeing benefits, both in seen and unseen manners. Due to the self-improving nature of AI algorithms today, it is common to see results during deployment and improved results upon deployment. This results in the next iteration of the solution being better than the previous one, providing improvements to the bottom line of processes.
Wasim Khan, Chief Digital Officer at RipcordOpens a new window , while elaborating on this, said, “Initially AI tools have helped deliver significant cost savings by helping automate the overall process experience. This is resulting in not only tangible cost savings but also intangible cost savings in terms of increasing resource efficiency – a necessary component for running a successful business. The initial success of AI process automation implementation has had (and will continue to have) an avalanche effect: organizations are now equipped with better content and data visibility by using AI tools to extract metadata.”
Speaking about the future of AI, Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , stated, “I think the use of AI will expand the focus on eliminating repetitive tasks and empower organizations to make more efficient use of their skilled talent.”

Advantages of Adopting AI
Introducing AI to operations can give a USP to companies. Moreover, it can also offer optimizations that set the company apart. The USPs that AI can offer range widely. Tracy Oppenheimer, Senior Marketing Manager, Content and Communications at HelpshiftOpens a new window , said, “The unique selling proposition for AI-powered solutions is, ultimately, the incredible levels of efficiency that they have the power to drive. The caveat is that when these technologies are not used or implemented effectively, they can drain resources instead of saving them.”
Companies can also benefit from the problem-solving capabilities AI brings to the table. AI-powered solutions can help companies make crucial business decisions or identify pain points in their operations.
According to Setu Kulkarni, VP of Strategy and Business Development at WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , “Predictive problem-solving capabilities of AI will definitely help companies further automate the business process by anticipating consumer interaction patterns. However, it is extremely likely that artificial intelligence will almost always require human intelligence either before, during, or after processing.”
AI is not a catch-all solution for companies; it requires certain workflows to be in place before deployment. While elaborating on the factors that affect AI’s efficiency, Al Brown, the SVP of Engineering at VeritoneOpens a new window , stated, “Companies will definitely benefit from the predictive problem-solving capabilities of AI – but only if they’re already heavily driven by and using data to move the organization forward. Data gives organizations the information they need to make decisions and target the business problems that AI can solve.” He further added, “The change comes when organizations recognize the value of data resulting in them working cross-functionally to prioritize data collection and analysis.”
Will AI Take Our Jobs?
Probably one of the most commonly repeated statements about AI is the eradication of human labor due to the rise in automation. As many experts will tell you, this is a nuanced subject that needs to be investigated with more depth. This is one of the most popular debates when it comes to the future of AI.
Commenting on this, Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , stated, “There is a lot of fear across industries that AI will eliminate jobs, but the reality is far more nuanced. Yes, it will eliminate some jobs that comprise mostly low-level and repetitive work. But it also will enhance people’s jobs and open new and different opportunities. AI will be able to take on tasks that the human brain cannot handle, such as analyzing vast data sets to gain insights that would elude the human mind.”
Currently, the labor market has a high rate of low-value and low-skill jobs. With the adoption of AI, these jobs are put at risk. However, companies must take up the responsibilities of upskilling their employees. This not only increases the value of the employee to the company but also provides the employee with the skills needed to survive in the AI age. This is also necessary for the future of AI growth to occur in a responsible manner.
Wasim Khan, Chief Digital Officer at RipcordOpens a new window , explained, “Emerging AI technologies, will change the current labor market. However, that change will encompass additional job creation, including new, higher-value positions. The benefits AI brings to improving processes not only frees companies to increase focus on higher-value services but also results in owning better, cleaner information which can then be analyzed and utilized to develop new offering areas.”
However, there is another side to this story. Any AI solution requires a team behind it, opening up possibilities for new jobs and positions to come into the play. Thomas Ash of CLARA AnalyticsOpens a new window , further elaborated saying, ”Developing a quality AI-based platform that effectively addresses specific needs requires a large dedicated team. To build this team your company will need to hire data scientists, product managers, software engineers, data engineers, data scientists, operational experts to develop process and operational workflows, and staff to integrate data models into operations.” He further added, “There is also a requirement for people to manage onboarding and training of the employees who will ultimately use the solution, along with staff who can quantify value generation.”
 Mark Gazit, CEO of ThetaRayOpens a new window , stated, “I believe AI will create additional employment opportunities. More importantly, it will make current jobs much more interesting. AI demonstrates the partnership between human and machine intelligence. AI does the heavy lifting that accelerates, not diminishes, who we are. It helps us to make better decisions and be more creative and in tune with the needs of the world around us.”

Closing Thoughts for Techies
With the rapid growth of the AI vertical in the enterprise sector, roles for the management and creation of solutions using the technology have ballooned. There is a significant increase in the job roles surrounding AI. From May 2017 to May 2018, job postings for AI on IndeedOpens a new window  went up by 57.9%Opens a new window , with a growth of 29.1%Opens a new window  in the following year.
Elaborating upon the need for AI talent, Bala Venkatrao, Founding Team & VP of Products, UnravelOpens a new window , revealed, “For the remainder of 2019 and beyond, AI knowledge and experience will continue to be among the most sought-after skills, as it can help remove human error, reduce tedious low-value activities, guarantee optimal technology performance by delivering recommendations, autonomous remediation of problems in both physical and virtual environments.”
Companies are looking to adopt AI in significant ways, as the solutions provided by service providers are sure to optimize processes. In the future, there will be an increased requirement for high-skilled workers who know the mechanics of creating and deploying an AI solution.
Existing job markets will also be redefined, with lower-skilled, repetitive jobs being taken up by AI. This will require new workers to be more skilled in their position, redefining the way the job market works today. Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , affirmed this by saying, “AI will change jobs. With the capability AI presents for doing more with huge data sets and analytics, the opportunity for more jobs that will exist because of the use of AI is significant.”

Closing Thoughts for Techies
As a technology, artificial intelligence has advanced enough to facilitate improvements that offer visible enhancements to company processes. This means that automated processes can achieve as much accuracy as human workers. AI also can accomplish this at a much higher speed and cheaper cost than employing manual labor.
With the rise of AI applications for corporate use, many big players, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, and SAS have begun offering artificial intelligence solutions that solve business problems through AI. With companies of this scale actively participating in the market, the AI space is quickly developing and advancing.
What Is AI?
To understand why artificial intelligence offers a sizeable benefit for companies, we must first thoroughly understand what AI is. At its base, AI is a computer program that imitates certain paradigms of human intelligence. What this means is that AI can conduct tasks that were previously only reserved for humans, such as recognizing images or finding patterns in data.
Law, for example, is one of the largest fields where AI is gaining quick adoption. Typically, a lawyer is not only required to have a working knowledge of landmark cases regarding certain laws but also to interpret laws by utilizing these cases. This is an integral part of fighting a case, and previously took a lot of time and resources on the lawyer’s part.
Today, with the progress of natural language processing, artificial intelligence software can execute several processes that take place in a typical legal setting. These include legal reasoning, evidential reasoning, argumentation and decision-making, data mining, legal task automation, risk assessment, and e-discovery.
This is just a small fraction of what specialized AI technology can achieve. Mainly, machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, is seeing widespread adoption among companies. Machine learning is the process by which programs can learn from past processes. This allows machine learning algorithms to improve upon past versions of itself. Moreover, it can also change dynamically with new data, as opposed to a static program that cannot change after it is deployed.
How Is AI Changing the Enterprise Landscape?
The rise of accessible AI solutions has transformed the enterprise landscape. This is mainly because artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions have begun to take the place of business intelligence operations. Business intelligence is the practice of utilizing software and technologies to collect, analyze, and present information systems. It holds the potential to improve the bottom line in the operation sector.
With every company now making data collection a priority through various digital mediums, there is a need to analyze much higher volumes of data. Commonly referred to as big data, these collected statistics can provide a more in-depth look into consumer expectations from a product or service, along with potential improvements.
However, manual analysis has quickly become more expensive and less scalable than AI-based solutions. Enterprise-grade algorithms can ingest data on the scale of petabytes (1 petabyte =1 million gigabytes) and provide actionable intelligence or insights.
For example, let’s consider a company that offers products for sale to the customer through an e-commerce portal. Collecting data from the website will allow the company to observe users’ actions, such as clicks, hovers, or scrolls. This data is then fed into an AI algorithm, which analyzes the data and provides insights.
In such a case, if the data shows that most users are scrolling down to click on an object, the algorithm will suggest moving the object to top. This improves the user experience and makes for a more engaging product overall.
When looking at this example, it becomes clear why AI can change the enterprise landscape. Keeping this in mind, let’s look at some artificial intelligence software, artificial intelligence tools, and artificial intelligence platforms commonly used by enterprises.

In today’s hype-filled world of artificial intelligence, myth is often confused for fact. Due to a large number of myths about AI, it becomes difficult to differentiate the truth from fiction. Join us as we tackle some of the oft-repeated myths when it comes to AI.
When it comes to myths about AI, many theories might seem incredulous, and some which are grounded in fact. Considering the hype around the technology, it might get difficult to determine the true disruptive power of artificial intelligence on society.
Many of these theories revolve around AI somehow taking over human civilization. This may even seem true when coupled with the science fiction trope of giving great power to artificial intelligence and robots. However, when looking at the actual capabilities of the technology and how it is being used by today, it becomes clear that something like this isn’t possible.
In this article, we will delve deeper into some of the most popular myths about artificial intelligence. We will also investigate the real-world implications and possibilities of such theories and attempt to separate hype from reality in the AI sphere.

Artificial Intelligence: Fact vs. Fiction
Most Common Myths About AI
Closing Thoughts
Artificial Intelligence: Fact vs. Fiction
Let’s first look at the reality of AI. Today, artificial intelligence is simply a computer program that mimics certain aspects of human thinking and intelligence. Today’s AI programs are created with a narrow focus, which does not allow them to function outside their prescribed task. They cannot reproduce the learning from their knowledge and apply it in the real world because their sole purpose is to do a well-defined task with precision and speed.
There are some algorithms which are also built to improve upon themselves by learning. This type of artificial intelligence program is called a machine learning algorithm, as it continues to iterate upon itself. With each progressive version of the algorithm, it becomes better at solving the problem faster or more accurately.
Comparatively, human intelligence widely applies a concept known as the transfer of learning. When a human being learns, they solve a given problem using cognitive processes. Using the transfer of learning, this knowledge is generalized and applied to problems that are similar to the problem faced in the first iteration.
For example, a child learning arithmetic in a class can use that knowledge when calculating the bill for groceries. The knowledge is directly carried over from previous problems, thus allowing an individual to easily come to the solution without learning the method again.
Transfer of knowledge is also possible in AI using a concept known as transfer learning. A machine learning algorithm is created with a template of the task it is going to solve. The learning is then carried forward to solve a similar problem. Transfer learning in AI functions only for a small subset of solutions, unlike humans, who are able to generalize a vast variety of problems.
Transfer of learning is one of the many things that sets human intelligence apart from AI. Currently, many complex cognitive procedures and shortcuts cannot be recreated in an AI setting. This means that all AI programs created today are narrow AI – a program designed to do one task specifically. When AI can generalize knowledge and exhibit functionality like that of humans, it is termed as general AI.
General AI is still a far-off reality, as the main focus is on using narrow AI as a tool right now. Narrow AI has found great adoption in the enterprise sector, as it can vastly improve the speed and accuracy of many company processes. Moreover, AI programs can also solve complex business problems and assist enterprises to make informed business decisions.
This means that most AI programs today are generally put into a utility category. AI is simply a tool that serves to assist companies to make better decisions or solve a problem with great speed. Even chatbots, such as Google Assistant and Siri, are simply AI programs that are optimized to process language and decipher human speech patterns into text.
AI has been widely adopted due to the vast amount of computing power at our disposal. Due to the powerful hardware we have today, it is possible to run complex AI programs and receive optimal results with great efficiency.

Most Common Myths About AI
Movies like ‘Terminator’, ‘I, Robot’, and ‘Eagle Eye’ have catapulted villainous AI into pop culture. The idea of machines thinking for themselves has been around since the late 1950s. First, as a mainstay villain of science fiction writers, then as a technology that was hailed as the next big revolution, AI has been relevant for a long time.
While the AI in these representations is shown to be omniscient and all-powerful, with access to indestructible robots or a military arsenal. However, AI today is simply a collection of complex computer programs. Therefore, most myths about AI taking over the world are not possible with today’s technology. Let us look at these myths in detail.
Myth 1: AI Will Take Over Jobs
This is, by far, the most popular AI theory. Proponents state that AI will be so advanced and cheap for companies that hiring human labor will simply seem too expensive. This will then lead to mass unemployment as AI will take up the same job roles as humans, and execute them at much better speed and cost.
This cannot occur for a multitude of reasons. Primarily, a vast variety of jobs today require cognitive tasks that humans can do much better than AI. While low-level jobs, such as data entry and sorting jobs will be at risk, the rest of the working population will simply see benefits from having AI at their disposal.
AI will be used as a tool to augment existing jobs but will replace some low-level jobs. This means that employees will have to be upskilled, thus promoting them to newer jobs that involve using AI as a tool rather than being replaced by it.
Adding to this, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , shares, “From an analytics perspective, the biggest myth we hear is, “the machine will take over my job”, particularly for data analysts. The truth is that AI technology for analytics today is largely about automating the things that are done manually.
From the machine doing the “discovery” aspect of data discovery or technology that utilizes algorithms that automatically surface statistical change, AI-technology is sifting through millions of data points to find what might be of interest.
It’s still up to the analyst to understand what’s important, add context for their organization and present that to their business users. AI is actually freeing them up to perform more high-value tasks.

Myth 2: AI Will Control the World
AI taking over the world has long been a mainstay of science fiction. Many stories describe artificial intelligence programs infiltrating the most secure systems in the world and taking over world governments. Some even describe these programs taking control of the nuclear arsenals of a country, causing the extinction of humanity.
This is not possible in any given situation. Firstly, such privileges of national security cannot be given to artificial intelligence, as AI programs will be used only as a tool. They will not be able to make such decisions without human intervention. Moreover, they cannot ‘hack’ their way into the security systems in place today, as they only have a narrow intelligence for their programmed problem.
AI also cannot rule the world through existing systems, as there is no possible way to train narrow AI to lead a country. Moreover, ruling through surveillance is also not a concern as AI or even superintelligent AI’s goal might not be to rule humans.
Myth 3: AI Robots Will Rule Humans
Usually, robots and evil AI programs go hand in hand when it comes to science fiction villains. The myth that AI will create robots that can think for themselves and lead a rebellion against human beings is one of the most popular theories.
Firstly, robot technology is far behind what is described in science fiction. They are usually not paired with intelligent algorithms today; instead, they are programmed to conduct repetitive tasks like an assembly line. Even personal assistant robots are restricted to a small set of tasks.
AI-powered robots getting a hold of weapons is commonly touched upon as an issue. However, the cognitive requirement for this will not only take up a lot of computing power but also require complicated algorithms. These algorithms cannot be deployed in such a remote state, as they will need a considerable back-end infrastructure for computing power.
Myth 4: AI Will Develop on Its Own Without Human Knowledge
This theory states that AI will suddenly ‘go rogue’ and develop itself to a point where it cannot be stopped by humans. Firstly, AI researchers have been dedicating resources towards creating AI that can not only learn from data but also its own results. There is slow progress in this field, recently resulting in unsupervised machine learning.
Otherwise, it is simply not possible for an AI to develop consciousness and sentience on its own and rebel against humanity. AI algorithms cannot develop beyond their own code, as they are simply smart programs that use computing power to solve complex problems.
If in the future, an accurate general artificial intelligence is created, this scenario has a mild possibility of occurring. However, when considering forward-thinking regulatory practices being taken towards AI today, this scenario is unlikely to occur in the near or distant future.
Myth 5: AI Will Eventually Learn to Function like the Human Brain
Artificial intelligence algorithms are just algorithms. They are simply a complex set of commands for a computer to follow and do not work like the human brain in any form. Modern AI advancements, such as neural networks, have derived inspiration from the architecture of the human brain, but are not capable of thinking like humans.
There are many cognitive processes that cannot be replicated by a computer program, at least in the case of AI as we know it today. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to reproduce a human brain completely in software form, as there are still many unknown variables in play. Barring ground-breaking advancements in both AI and neuroscience, this myth won’t turn into reality for the foreseeable future.

Myth 6: Only Big Companies Can Use AI
Today’s AI landscape is dominated by software giants, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. This has led many to believe that only big companies can effectively utilize and control AI. This introduces the possibility of a dystopian world where these companies use AI to control the population.
Of course, this theory is unfounded. Not only is the AI startup sphere booming, but efforts to democratize AI have been undertaken by these companies. Believing that more attention and research will bring better advancements in AI, most of these companies have open-sourced the tools they use for making AI algorithms. AI marketplaces are also present in great numbers, allowing any computer program to utilize complex algorithms in a pinch.
Adding to this, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , says, “The technology can be varied in its application and cost. For an SMB, our advice would be to look at the problem that they’re trying to solve or solution they’re looking to deliver and see where it would benefit from this type of technology.
This could vary from using products with these capabilities that enhance areas, such as marketing or sales. They may be looking to deliver an enhanced customer experience, such as a chatbot on their website that may, in fact, mean a lower customer acquisition cost than traditional methods. Others may go down the path of embedding this technology as part of their application.”
Myth 7: More Data Means Better AI
Another myth says that more data results in automatically better AI. Firstly, AI is only as good as the data it ingests. If the data is inaccurate or structured incorrectly, most of the benefits that come from training the AI are not present. This is because AI simply combs through the data and finds the most effective solution and does not improve upon the data that it is given.
This means that any data given to the AI must be in a machine-readable format, requiring human labeling to be truly effective. Even big companies find problems with labeling the large amounts of data that they collect. More data can mean better AI, but only if the data is clean and easily readable by the AI algorithm.
Myth 8: AI Puts Our Data at Risk
With the predatory data collection practices employed by many software giants, AI has found itself amid security concerns. These include protecting the privacy of the customers providing the data, and concerns about the leakage of private information through data breaches. As this data is fed to an algorithm, the private user data is then used, indirectly, for financial gain by deriving insights.
Regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are softening the blow for consumers, as they require companies to use data in a responsible manner. This also means that the privacy of consumers cannot be compromised in any way. However, companies may not stop these practices even with such regulations in place, leaving this myth currently unsolved.
Myth 9: Superintelligent AI Will Take over the World
Superintelligent AI, or simply superintelligence, is an advanced general AI learns not only from data but also from itself. Theoretically, this should result in exponential growth of the program’s intelligence, resulting in an ‘intelligence explosion’ and superintelligent AI.
Separating the myth and facts about superintelligent AI is not an easy task. Primarily, superintelligent AI is still far off in the future, with today’s technology being nowhere close to replicating this task. While the myths about superintelligence are well-rooted in theory, it is simply not possible to create superintelligent AI with today’s technology.
In case a superintelligent AI does come along sometime in the future, the best thing to do is to prepare for it through regulation and laws. The main thing to worry is that superintelligent AI’s goals may not be aligned with humanity. In this case, superintelligent AI may surpass all human barriers and take over the world.
Talking about superintelligence, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , shares, “I’m sure we’re going to see a lot more articles on the subject around October 23 as the new Terminator movie gets released. For our industry, this wave is known as “Augmented Analytics” and we see this as a positive transformative shift.
As people work more closely with this technology, understand it, and can apply the benefits, we’ll see our processes become more fluid and adaptive – this technology is shifting the way organizations are operating.
One key thing is the foundation you’re building this upon has to be governed. Particularly in the data world, it’s “garbage in, garbage out”, when you’re applying this type of AI-technology without a governed data foundation it becomes garbage in and garbage out, at scale!”
Myth 10: Technological Singularity Is Not Far Off
Technological singularity is an event where human technology transcends itself to a point where the universe becomes irreversibly changed. Prominent author and thinker Ray Kurzweil utilizes a concept known as ‘computronium’ to describe what singularity is. By using the energy and computation contained within an atom and engineering it, Kurzweil predicts that it will become possible to utilize anything to compute complex calculations and run AI.
In the ever-expanding quest to add more computronium to our arsenal, Kurzweil speculates that we will convert the entire universe to computronium, thus reaching a singularity. However, Kurzweil, along with other thinkers in the field, do not attempt to predict what happens after singularity as it is simply unknowable and cannot be predicted with any semblance of accuracy.

Closing Thoughts
Myths about AI are widespread, and many might seem believable. The things AI can and cannot do are not widely known, and the hype surrounding the technology might make it seem like a miraculous solution. While many companies are adopting AI to optimize their processes, this hype might cause them to make a mistake when dealing with AI.
Learning to distinguish fact from hype is extremely important when it comes to artificial intelligence, especially considering popular opinion. Pop culture has cemented AI’s place as the ultimate supervillain, or an omnipresent and omniscient ghost in the machine. In the real world, it is simply a complex computer program, as much in our control as a text processor or web browser.
Hence, anyone willing to take the AI path moving forward will have to not only formulate their own views on what the technology is capable of but also strictly keep in mind what it cannot do. General AI and superintelligent AI are best left to future generations or science fiction authors.

2. Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI by Paul Daugherty and H. James WilsonOpens a new window 

This book is written by Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of Accenture and James Wilson, Managing Director of IT and Business Research, Accenture. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that it has a focus on the business applications and implications of AI. The authors demonstrate that the transformation of all business processes in an organization is the essence of the AI paradigm shift. The book talks about the business areas where humans and machines are working closely together today and reveals the various ways in which companies are leveraging advancements in AI technology for more profitability.
An interesting read for all corporate officers. 
3. Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era by James BarratOpens a new window 
This is an excellent book on AI that considers the dangers of anthropomorphizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), and notes that superintelligence is a completely different type of threat. In this book, James Barrat talks about the various agencies and governments that are invested in researching artificial general intelligence (AGI). Many experts and scientists today believe that once the goal of AGI is achieved, machines will have a survival drive that’s almost similar to humans. Barratt discusses this further and concludes that artificial super intelligence (ASI) will eventually become a threat to the human race.

4. Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick BostromOpens a new window 
Animals lack the capabilities that a human brain possesses, making the human race the dominant species on earth today. Nick Bostrom discusses the implications for if this dominant position is compromised due to machine superintelligence. Like many other philosophical works, this book, too, asks more questions than it answers. It talks about the time when machines will surpass human intelligence and whether this will turn out to be positive or negative for mankind. If a day like that ever occurs, the fate of humans will more or less be dependent on machine superintelligence, much like the fate of gorillas depends on humans today. This book is quite ambitious and carefully makes its path through an intellectual terrain we’d all like to be able to ignore.
Scary but compelling, right? 
5. The Singularity is Near by Ray KurzweilOpens a new window 

Ray Kurzweil is known for his respected opinions about the role of technology in the future. In The Age of Spiritual Machines, his classic book, he discussed how computers were soon going to rival human intelligence. In The Singularity is Near, he dives into super artificial intelligence and describes singularity from a fresh perspective. Kurzweil says that singularity is the point at which the intelligence of machines and humans will merge. And once that happens, there will be no stopping these machines.
So much potential!

Language is the cornerstone of human intelligence.

The emergence of language was the most important intellectual development in our species’ history. It is through language that we formulate thoughts and communicate them to one another. Language enables us to reason abstractly, to develop complex ideas about what the world is and could be, and to build on these ideas across generations and geographies. Almost nothing about modern civilization would be possible without language.

PROMOTED
Building machines that can understand language has thus been a central goal of the field of artificial intelligence dating back to its earliest days.

It has proven maddeningly elusive.
This is because mastering language is what is known as an “AI-complete” problem: that is, an AI that can truly understand language the way a human can would by implication be capable of any other human-level intellectual activity. Put simply, to solve language is to solve AI.

This profound and subtle insight is at the heart of the “Turing test,” introduced by AI pioneer Alan Turing in a groundbreaking 1950 paper. Though often critiqued or misunderstood, the Turing test captures a fundamental reality about language and intelligence; as it approaches its 75th birthday, it remains as relevant as it was when Turing first conceived it.

Humanity has yet to build a machine intelligence with human-level mastery of language. (In other words, no machine intelligence has yet passed the Turing test.) But over the past few years researchers have achieved startling, game-changing breakthroughs in language AI, also called natural language processing (NLP).

The technology is now at a critical inflection point, poised to make the leap from academic research to widespread real-world adoption. In the process, broad swaths of the business world and our daily lives will be transformed. Given language’s ubiquity, few areas of technology will have a more far-reaching impact on society in the years ahead.


Transformers: A Once-In-A-Generation Breakthrough
The most powerful way to illustrate the capabilities of today’s cutting-edge language AI is to start with a few concrete examples.
Today’s AI can correctly answer complex medical queries—and explain the underlying biological mechanisms at play. It can craft nuanced memos about how to run effective board meetings. It can write articles analyzing its own capabilities and limitations, while convincingly pretending to be a human observer. It can produce original, sometimes beautiful, poetry and literature.
(It is worth taking a few moments to inspect these examples yourself.)
What is behind these astonishing new AI abilities, which just five years ago would have been inconceivable?
In short: the invention of the transformer, a new neural network architecture that has unleashed vast new possibilities in AI.
A group of Google researchers introduced the transformer in late 2017 in a now-classic research paper.
Before transformers, the state of the art in NLP—for instance, LSTMs and the widely-used Seq2Seq architecture—was based on recurrent neural networks. By definition, recurrent neural networks process data sequentially—that is, one word at a time, in the order that the words appear.
Transformers’ great innovation is to make language processing parallelized, meaning that all the tokens in a given body of text are analyzed at the same time rather than in sequence. In order to support this parallelization, transformers rely on an AI mechanism known as attention. Attention enables a model to consider the relationships between words, even if they are far apart in a text, and to determine which words and phrases in a passage are most important to “pay attention to.”
Parallelization also makes transformers vastly more computationally efficient than RNNs, meaning that they can be trained on larger datasets and built with more parameters. One defining characteristic of today’s transformer models is their massive size.
A flurry of innovation followed in the wake of the original transformer paper as the world’s leading AI researchers built upon this foundational breakthrough.
The publication of the landmark transformer model BERT came in 2018. Created at Google, BERT’s big conceptual advance is its bidirectional structure (the B in BERT stands for “bidirectional”). The model “looks in both directions” as it analyzes a given word, considering both the words that come before and the words that come after, rather than working unidirectionally from left to right. This additional context allows for richer, more nuanced language modeling.
BERT remains one of the most important transformer-based models in use, frequently treated as a reference against which newer models are compared. Much subsequent research on transformers—for instance, Facebook’s influential RoBERTa model (2019)—is based on refining BERT.
Google’s entire search engine today is powered by BERT, one of the most far-reaching examples of transformers’ real-world impact.
Another core vein of research in the world of transformers is OpenAI’s family of GPT models. OpenAI published the original GPT in June 2018, GPT-2 in February 2019, and GPT-3 in May 2020. Popular open-source versions of these models, like GPT-J and GPT-Neo, have followed.
As the “G” in their names indicates, the GPT models are generative: they generate original text output in response to the text input they are fed. This is an important distinction between the GPT class of models and the BERT class of models. BERT, unlike GPT, does not generate new text but instead analyzes existing text (think of activities like search, classification, or sentiment analysis).
GPT’s generative capabilities make these models particularly attention-grabbing, since writing appears to be a creative act and the output can be astonishingly human-like. Text generation is sometimes referred to as “NLP’s party trick.” (All four of the examples linked to above are text generation examples from GPT-3.)
Perhaps the most noteworthy element of the GPT architecture is its sheer size. OpenAI has been intentional and transparent about its strategy to pursue more advanced language AI capabilities through raw scale above all else: more compute, larger training data corpora, larger models.
With 1.5 billion parameters, GPT-2 was the largest model ever built at the time of its release. Published less than a year later, GPT-3 was two orders of magnitude larger: a whopping 175 billion parameters. Rumors have circulated that GPT-4 will contain on the order of 100 trillion parameters (perhaps not coincidentally, roughly equivalent to the number of synapses in the human brain). As a point of comparison, the largest BERT model had 340 million parameters.
As with any machine learning effort today, the performance of these models depends above all on the data on which they are trained.
Today’s transformer-based models learn language by ingesting essentially the entire internet. BERT was fed all of Wikipedia (along with the digitized texts of thousands of unpublished books). RoBERTa improved upon BERT by training on even larger volumes of text from the internet. GPT-3’s training dataset was larger still, consisting of half a trillion language tokens. Thus, these models’ linguistic outputs and behaviors can ultimately be traced to the statistical patterns in all the text that humans have previously published online.
The reason such large training datasets are possible is that transformers use self-supervised learning, meaning that they learn from unlabeled data. This is a crucial difference between today’s cutting-edge language AI models and the previous generation of NLP models, which had to be trained with labeled data. Today’s self-supervised models can train on far larger datasets than was ever previously possible: after all, there is more unlabeled text data than labeled text data in the world by many orders of magnitude.
Some observers point to self-supervised learning, and the vastly larger training datasets that this technique unlocks, as the single most important driver of NLP’s dramatic performance gains in recent years, more so than any other feature of the transformer architecture.

Foundation Models
Training models on massive datasets with millions or billions of parameters requires vast computational resources and engineering know-how. This makes large language models prohibitively costly and difficult to build. GPT-3, for example, required several thousand petaflop/second-days to train—a staggering amount of computational resources.
Because very few organizations in the world have the resources and talent to build large language models from scratch, almost all cutting-edge NLP models today are adapted from a small handful of base models: e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, BART. Almost without exception, these models come from the world’s largest tech companies: Google, Facebook, OpenAI (which is bankrolled by Microsoft), Nvidia.
Without anyone quite planning for it, this has resulted in an entirely new paradigm for NLP technology development—one that will have profound implications for the nascent AI economy.
This paradigm can be thought of in two basic phases: pre-training and fine-tuning.
In the first phase, a tech giant creates and open-sources a large language model: for instance, Google’s BERT or Facebook’s RoBERTa.
Unlike in previous generations of NLP, in which models had to be built for individual language tasks, these massive models are not specialized for any particular activity. They have powerful generalized language capabilities across functions and topic areas. Out of the box, they perform well at the full gamut of activities that comprise linguistic competence: language classification, language translation, search, question answering, summarization, text generation, conversation. Each of these activities on its own presents compelling technological and economic opportunities.
Because they can be adapted to any number of specific end uses, these base models are referred to as “pre-trained.”
In the second phase, downstream users—young startups, academic researchers, anyone else who wants to build an NLP model—take these pre-trained models and refine them with a small amount of additional training data in order to optimize them for their own specific use case or market. This step is referred to as “fine-tuning.”
“Today’s pre-trained models are incredibly powerful, and even more importantly, they are publicly available,” said Yinhan Liu, lead author on Facebook’s RoBERTa work and now cofounder/CTO of healthcare NLP startup BirchAI. “For those teams that have the know-how to operationalize transformers, the question becomes: what is the most important or impactful use case to which I can apply this technology?”
Under this “pre-train then fine-tune” paradigm, the heavy lifting is done upfront with the creation of the pre-trained model. Even after fine-tuning, the end model’s behavior remains largely dictated by the pre-trained model’s parameters.
This makes these pre-trained models incredibly influential. So influential, in fact, that Stanford University has recently coined a new name for them, “foundation models”, and launched an entire academic program devoted to better understanding them: the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM). The Stanford team believes that foundation models, and the small group of tech giants that have the resources to produce them, will exert outsize influence on the future behavior of artificial intelligence around the world.
As the researchers put it: “Foundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization: Almost all state-of-the-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in the foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models.”
This Stanford effort is drawing attention to a massive looming problem for large language models: social bias.
The source of social bias in AI models is straightforward to summarize but insidiously difficult to root out. Because large language models (or foundation models, to use the new branding) learn language by ingesting what humans have written online, they inevitably inherit the prejudices, false assumptions and harmful beliefs of their imperfect human progenitors. Just imagine all the fringe subreddits and bigoted blogs that must have been included in GPT-3’s vast training data corpus.
The problem has been extensively documented: today’s most prominent foundation models all exhibit racist, sexist, xenophobic, and other antisocial tendencies. This issue will only grow more acute as foundation models become increasingly influential in society. Some observers believe that AI bias will eventually become as prominent of an issue for consumers, companies and governments as digital threats like data privacy or cybersecurity that have come before it—threats that were also not fully appreciated at first, because the breakneck pace of technological change outstripped society’s ability to properly adapt to it.
There is no silver-bullet solution to the challenge of AI bias and toxicity. But as the problem becomes more widely recognized, a number of mitigation strategies are being pursued.
Last month, OpenAI announced that it had developed a new version of GPT-3 that is “safer, more helpful, and more aligned” with human values. The company used a technique known as reinforcement learning from human feedback to fine-tune its models to be less biased and more truthful than the original GPT-3. This new version, named InstructGPT, is now the default language model that OpenAI makes available to customers.
Historically, Alphabet’s DeepMind has been an outlier among the world’s most advanced AI research organizations for not making language AI a major focus area. This changed at the end of 2021, with DeepMind announcing a collection of important work on large language models.
Of the three NLP papers that DeepMind published, one is devoted entirely to the ethical and social risks of language AI. The paper proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of 6 thematic areas and 21 specific risks that language models pose, including discrimination, exclusion, toxicity and misinformation. DeepMind pledged to make these risks a central focus of its NLP research going forward to help ensure that it is pursuing innovation in language AI responsibly.
The fact that this dimension of language AI research—until recently, treated as an afterthought or ignored altogether by most of the world’s NLP researchers—featured so centrally in DeepMind’s recent foray into language AI may be a signal of the field’s shifting priorities moving forward.
Increased regulatory focus on the harms of bias and toxicity in AI models will only accelerate this shift. And make no mistake: regulatory action on this front is a matter of when, not if.

Beyond Natural Language
Interestingly, perhaps the most creative use cases for NLP today don’t involve natural language at all. In particular, today’s cutting-edge language AI technology is powering remarkable breakthroughs in two other domains: coding and biology.
Whether it’s Python, Ruby, or Java, computer programming happens via languages. Just like natural languages like English or Swahili, programming languages are symbolically represented, follow regular rules, and have a robust internal logic. The audience just happens to be software compilers rather than other humans.
It therefore makes sense that the same powerful new technologies that have given AI incredible fluency in natural language can likewise be applied to programming languages, with similar results.
Last summer OpenAI announced Codex, a transformer-based model that can write computer code astonishingly well. In parallel, GitHub (which is allied with OpenAI through its parent company Microsoft) launched a productized version of Codex named Copilot.
To develop Codex, OpenAI took GPT-3 and fine-tuned it on a massive volume of publicly available written code from GitHub.
Codex’s design is simple: human users give it a plain-English description of a command or function and Codex turns this description into functioning computer code. A user could input into Codex, for instance, “crop this image circularly” or “animate this image horizontally so that it bounces off the left and right walls”—and Codex can produce a snippet of code to implement those actions. (These exact examples can be examined on OpenAI’s website.) Codex is most capable in Python, but it is proficient in over a dozen programming languages.
Then, just two weeks ago, DeepMind further advanced the frontiers of AI coding with its publication of AlphaCode.
AlphaCode is an AI system that can compete at a human level in programming competitions. In these competitions, which attract hundreds of thousands of participants each year, contestants receive a lengthy problem statement in English and must construct a complete computer program that solves it. Example problems include devising strategies for a custom board game or solving an arithmetic-based brain teaser.
While OpenAI’s Codex can produce short snippets of code in response to concrete descriptions, DeepMind’s AlphaCode goes much further. It begins to approach the full complexity of real-world programming: assessing an abstract problem without a clear solution, devising a structured approach to solving it, and then executing on that approach with up to hundreds of lines of code. AlphaCode almost seems to display that ever-elusive attribute in AI, high-level reasoning.
As DeepMind’s AlphaCode team wrote: “Creating solutions to unforeseen problems is second nature in human intelligence—a result of critical thinking informed by experience. For artificial intelligence to help humanity, our systems need to be able to develop problem-solving capabilities. AlphaCode solves new problems in programming competitions that require a combination of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding.”
Another “language” in which today’s cutting-edge NLP has begun to generate remarkable insights is biology, from genomics to proteins.
Genomics is well-suited to the application of large language models because an individual’s entire genetic endowment is encoded in a simple four-letter alphabet: A (for adenine), C (for cytosine), G (for guanine), and T (for thymine). Every human’s DNA is defined by a string of billions of A’s, C’s, G’s and T’s (known as nucleotides) in a particular order.
In many respects DNA functions like a language, with its nucleotide sequences exhibiting regular patterns that resemble a kind of vocabulary, grammar, and semantics. What does this language say? It defines much about who we are, from our height to our eye color to our risk of heart disease or substance abuse.
Large language models are now making rapid progress in deciphering the language of DNA, in particular its “noncoding” regions. These noncoding regions do not contain genes but rather control genes: they regulate how much, when, and where given genes are expressed, giving them a central role in the maintenance of life. Noncoding regions comprise 98% of our total DNA but until now have remained poorly understood.
A few months ago, DeepMind introduced a new transformer-based architecture that can predict gene expression based on DNA sequence with unprecedented accuracy. It does so by considering interactions between genes and noncoding DNA sequences at much greater distances than was ever before possible. A team at Harvard completed work along similar lines to better understand gene expression in corn (fittingly naming their model “CornBERT”).
Another subfield of biology that represents fertile ground for language AI is the study of proteins. Proteins are strings of building blocks known as amino acids, linked together in a particular order. There are 20 amino acids in total. Thus, for all their complexity, proteins can be treated as tokenized strings—wherein each amino acid, like each word in a natural language, is a token—and analyzed accordingly.
As one example, an AI research team from Salesforce recently built an NLP model that “learns the language of proteins” and can generate plausible protein sequences that don’t exist in nature with prespecified characteristics. The potential applications of this type of controllable protein synthesis are tantalizing.
These efforts are just the beginning. In the months and years ahead, language AI will make profound contributions to our understanding of how life itself works.

Conclusion
Language is at the heart of human intelligence. It therefore is and must be at the heart of our efforts to build artificial intelligence. No sophisticated AI can exist without mastery of language.
Today, the field of language AI is at an exhilarating inflection point, on the cusp of transforming industries and spawning new multi-billion-dollar companies. At the same time, it is fraught with societal dangers like bias and toxicity that are only now starting to get the attention they deserve.

Scheduling that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) produces various benefits, including easing the frequent burnout experienced by physicians, according to new data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA).







Researchers from the ASA examined the impact of implementing an AI-based scheduling system on physician experience. Their goal was to explore new possibilities for AI and discover ways to decrease the rate of physician burnout, which currently sits at around 50 percent according to the press release. The research was presented at ASA's ADVANCE 2022 conference, Jan. 28 to 30.
For the study, researchers assessed data collected from 2018 through the COVID-19 pandemic at Ochsner Health.
When done manually, creating a schedule generally requires an average of 60 to 75 hours monthly.
Meanwhile, the AI-based scheduling tool cut the time taken to generate new schedules to 14 hours.
Physician engagement rates, which reflect the physician’s level of engagement with the healthcare organization, also skyrocketed following the creation of this new system. After using the AI scheduling system for six months, the average engagement score for 60 anesthesiologists was 4.2 out of 5, significantly higher than the former average of 3.3.
These strong scores did not decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic, showing the method’s effectiveness and ability to reduce stress levels. This pandemic led to the creation of COVID intensive care units (ICUs), resulting in scheduling complications for physicians. However, the AI system was able to keep up with the speed of the disease, consistently staffing all ICUs.
Besides the significant reduction in time dedicated to scheduling and high physician engagement, an AI-based approach provides various other benefits.
""On average, the scheduling allows our anesthesiologists to have one or two mornings and one or two afternoons off a month to allow for increased work-life balance so they are better able to attend events important to them,"" said Dhruv Choudhry, MD, lead author of the study and anesthesiology resident at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, in the news release.
Launched in 1905, ASA is an organization of 55,000 members that aims to promote the field of anesthesiology.
AI scheduling appears to improve work-life balance for physicians and could result in a higher retention rate due to decreased burnout. According to a survey on physician burnout, the year 2020 saw the physician burnout rate drop 4 percent compared with five years prior.
In addition to scheduling benefits, AI is improving the lives of anesthesiologists in the operating room. A recent study explained how drug administration is possible through AI, allowing doctors to attend to other responsibilities while performing surgery, such as monitoring patient comfort levels and making sure they are physiologically stable.

The Smart Nonprofit: Staying Human-Centered in An Automated World

240 pages, Wiley, 2022

“Smart tech” is an umbrella term we created to describe advanced digital technologies that make decisions for people, instead of people. It includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subsets and cousins such as machine learning, natural language processes, smart forms, and chatbots, robots, and drones.
Right now, smart tech is best at doing rote tasks like filling out intake forms, and answering the same questions over and again (“is my contribution tax-deductible?”). However, the technology is quickly embedding itself into the heart of nonprofit work in a wide variety of functions. As a result, we anticipate that staff will be free to focus on other activities. We call this benefit the “dividend of time,” which can be used to, say, reduce staff burnout, get to know clients in deeper ways, and focus on problem-solving like addressing the root causes of homelessness in addition to serving homeless people. 
Smart tech has recently reached an inflection point common to technologies that reach everyday use: An enormous increase in computing power meets a dramatic decrease in the cost of the technology. As a result, technology that was previously available only to elite institutions like NASA or embedded in widely complicated systems has suddenly become available to everyday people and organizations for fundraising, accounting, human resources, service delivery, and more.
Grabbing software off-the-shelf that is “smart” may look like a technical decision, at its heart it is a deeply and profoundly human challenge that requires informed leadership to do well. There is a sweet spot of balancing the capability of the technology with the interests and needs of the people inside and outside that organizations need to identify. Some people call this convergence “co-botting.” The responsibility for identifying this sweet spot cannot rest with the IT department alone. Organizational leaders need to be interested, knowledgeable, and engaged enough to ensure smart tech is used in human-centered ways.
In the following excerpt from our chapter on staying human-centered in our new book, The Smart Nonprofit, we discuss how being human-centered means prioritizing the interests, strengths, and unique talents of people over the speed and wizardry of the technology. Valuing humans has never been more important as our workplaces become more and more automated.—Allison Fine and Beth Kanter
* * *
Caesar Chavez said, “It was never about grapes or lettuce and always about people.”1 The same holds true for smart tech. It is not about the code or the wizardry; it’s about ensuring that people matter the most. Being human-centered means prioritizing the interests, strengths, and unique talents of people over the speed and wizardry of the technology. Valuing humans has never been more important as our workplaces become more and more automated.
Smart tech is a fundamentally new way of working and has the potential to do more harm than good if treating people well inside and outside isn’t the top priority. This chapter explores the differences between human and machine intelligence, describes how to marry people and bots inside of organizations, and outlines steps for designing human-centered efforts to ensure smart tech is enhancing and not subjugating the needs of people.
Man vs. Machine
Since the 1950s experts have been forecasting that smart tech will reach human-level intelligence in 20 years. “In other words, it’s been 20 years away for 60 years,” according to MIT Professor Thomas Malone.2
Over the past few years, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, and many other big names in science and technology have expressed concerns in the media about the potential for AI to be smarter than humans. There have been a number of surveys asking when this will happen and they all reach the same conclusion: we simply don’t know. But we can say with absolute confidence that right now human and machine intelligence are not equal.3
In a gross oversimplification, intelligence has two components: fact-based knowledge and emotional intelligence. Smart tech is clearly gaining ground on fact-based knowledge, but it is also in the very early stages of incorporating emotional intelligence. At the heart of emotional intelligence is empathy, understanding what other people are feeling. Smart tech is not as empathetic as people yet, and may never be, but it can mimic empathy through sentiment analysis.
Smart technologies are more accurate, faster, and more consistent at doing particular tasks like filling out forms. Smart technologies never get tired or need to take a lunch break or vacation. However, currently, bots are not empathetic. What they can do is simulate an emotional response. For instance, a customer support chatbot may be taught to apologize in a caring or helpful tone, even calling you by your name. Imitating emotions is not the same as having them or understanding them.
People have the unique ability to imagine, problem solve, anticipate, feel, and judge changing situations, which allows us to shift perspectives. Our memories, hopes, concerns, and personality also contribute to how we react to the world around us. Smart technologies simply are not capable of empathy, love, or other emotions, yet. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, writes, “. . . while AI systems may be able to mimic human empathy, they can’t truly understand what empathy is like. It’s a distinction that nonprofits may not understand, but it is an essential tenet of being human-centered.”4
The gap between human and bot intelligence is reflected in the growing field of therapy chatbots. Dr. Freud in a Box and other therapy chatbots are attractive products because they are inexpensive and always available. But research has shown that bots make terrible therapists because of the limitations of smart technology to understand subtext.5
There are other significant challenges to therapy bots. Private companies are often not transparent about how their algorithms work, amplifying the potential for the chatbot therapist to provide bad or biased advice.
If all this was not bad enough, there is potential to weaponize private information by sharing it with marketing companies. For instance, there’s Woebot. It is a chatbot therapist providing cognitive behavioral therapy through Facebook Messenger (Editorial note: Woebot is no longer on Facebook messenger and is available via the app store on a smartphone.) It is not regulated or licensed as a therapist and although it has no plan to do so today, the company could choose to sell users’ data to pharmaceutical companies or employers in the future.6
Co-Botting
Getting the balance right between people and smart tech is called co-botting or augmented intelligence.7 H. James Wilson and Paul R. Daugherty have conducted research with over 1500 companies and found that significant performance improvements happen when humans and machines work together. “Through augmented intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each other’s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter.”8  
Smart tech is an equal opportunity job disrupter and doesn’t care if a job is low paying or high paying. If it involves analysis of large amounts of data, the job is going to change. Curtis Langlotz, a radiologist at Stanford, predicts, “AI won’t replace radiologists, but radiologists who use AI will replace radiologists who don’t.”9
Most experts doubt AI will replace doctors any time soon because even if an algorithm is better at diagnosing a particular problem, combining it with a doctor’s experience and knowledge of the patient’s individual story will lead to a better treatment and outcome.
The Trevor Project provides crisis counseling to young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) people. They created Riley, a chat bot to help train counselors by providing real-life simulations of conversations with potentially suicidal teens. Riley is always available for a training session with volunteers and that helps the staff scale the number of trained counselors without adding more resources. Riley will never work on the front line directly with youth in crisis because The Trevor Project sees this role as a human-centered one.10
Co-botting goes beyond working with chatbots. Benefits Data Trust is a Philadelphia-based poverty reduction organization. It created a co-botting system for integrating smart tech into its efforts to help its call-in center staff assist clients to navigate and complete public benefits’ application processes. The pain point they were trying to solve was the enormous amount of time and documentation it takes for clients to apply for and receive benefits. The computer system was trained on thousands of interactions between call-in staff and clients to make recommendations among dozens of possible public benefits. The system also pre-populated forms for clients, saving staff an enormous amount of time.
Ravindar Gujarl, chief data and technology officer from the Public Benefits Trust, told us, “At the end of the day, our role as a nonprofit is to create a human connection. We won’t replace our call-in staff who directly interface with our clients. Our nonprofit’s work is about building relationships with our clients. They come to us in distress and we want them not to have to worry about having to collect documents or wade through a complicated application process.”11
These examples involved careful planning to ensure that the technology augmented and didn’t replace the work of staff. There is no special formula for ensuring you get the right balance between people and technology. It takes careful planning, monitoring, and continuous adjustments to ensure your organization is staying human-centered and getting the best out of both. Without this kind of care and thoughtfulness, your nonprofit could end up adding a bot like Flippy to your staff.
In March, 2018, Miso Robotics and Caliaburger, a fast-food franchise in Southern California, announced the public debut of “Flippy,” the world’s first autonomous robotic kitchen assistant powered by artificial intelligence. Flippy’s job was to flip burger patties and remove them from the grill for its human co-workers to put the cheese on top at the right moment and add the extras, such as lettuce and sauce, before wrapping the sandwiches for customers.
The press release for the launch described how Flippy would disrupt and transform the fast-food industry by taking over the hot, greasy, and dirty task of flipping burgers. The company touted Flippy as a cost-effective and highly efficient solution that could flip 150 burgers per hour, far more than the cooks it was replacing. What the press release didn’t mention was that in addition, Flippy wouldn’t complain about the low pay, scanty benefits, and long hours.12
After two days on the job, Flippy was fired. News of Flippy, the robot cook, went viral on social media. This prompted a surge in interest and while Flippy flipped away, the human kitchen staff could not keep up with the demand. The restaurant realized it needed to spend more time on its internal systems and training people to work side-by-side with the robots.
This story shows how easy it is for an organization to choose a bot to solve a problem without engaging staff in the process and keeping the entire system human-centered.13,14
Human-Centered Design
COVID-19 highlighted the bad habit some organizations have of not staying human-centered during stressful times. A hospital system in Washington State welcomed donors who had given at least $10,000 to set up vaccination appointments on an “invite-only” basis. The chief executive of a high-end nursing home and assisted-living facility in West Palm Beach, Florida, invited board members and major donors to receive immunizations. These were not the only two examples of hospitals and care facilities offering donors first shot at the shots.
Mike Geiger, president of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, said in response, “The idea of hospital systems, or any charity, ignoring protocols, guidance, or restrictions—regardless of origin—and offering certain donors and board members the opportunity to ‘skip the line’ and receive vaccinations ahead of their scheduled time is antithetical to the values of philanthropy and ethical fundraising.”15
While this example is not specifically about smart tech, it illustrates how easy it is for organizations to slip away from keeping clients and patients front and center. The use of smart tech makes staying human-centered even more pressing. We recommend engaging with end users through human-centered design techniques noted in the sidebar. Human-centered design focuses on developing deep empathy for end users or those who are impacted by smart tech. At the heart of this process is designing processes and services with people, not at them, through interviews, observation, and developing personas or models of end users to test processes and assumptions.
There are many excellent tools and resources for human-centered design. The essence of these processes is to:

Get input from key stakeholders about what issues are most important to them.
Outline an idea, process or service that delineates responsibilities.
Test, reflect, improve.

Public Benefits Trust used this kind of process to determine what parts of their process should be automated. Ravinder said, “You can’t build an algorithm that powers a public benefit system without getting feedback from the people using it.”16
Conclusion
The very first step that nonprofits must do when embracing smart tech is to put humans first and deeply understand how machines and people can work together. Human-centered principles and approaches are critical for the successful use of smart technologies by nonprofits as we have discussed throughout this chapter.

Human-Centered Design Resources
There are many excellent human-centered design resources that offer step-by-step guidance for implementing a human-centered design process, which is beyond the scope of this book. Many are techniques that any nonprofit can use without hiring an expensive consultant.
If you want to quickly get up to speed, we recommend these resources for additional reading about human-centered design. Many of these organizations also offer training.
Ideo Design Kit: IDEO has been a thought leader in human-centered design methods. The design firm has a nonprofit spinoff (ideo.org) that focuses on methods for nonprofits and social change and includes many free practical resources and examples. In addition, IDEO has also developed specific human-centered design methods for artificial intelligence, including these cards to help understand unintended consequences of smart technologies.

Stanford Design School: In 2018, the D-School (as it is known), launched an initiative called “Radical Access,” a program and resources to develop fluency in emerging technologies as a medium of design for all people. The rationale is that for any use-case of artificial intelligence to serve us, we must be involved in the design. These two techniques are especially useful to designing human-centered algorithms or mapping problems to solutions for artificial intelligence.

Participatory Machine Learning: Defined as the practice of using human-centered design methods to inform the design and iteration for automation projects. Google has recently published a guide that actively involves a diversity of stakeholders—technologists, UXers, policymakers, end users, and citizens—in the process of feedback for the project. The guidebook provides an overview of how human perception drives every facet of machine learning and offers up worksheets on how to get user input.

Agentive Design: When designing chatbots and “intelligent agents for automation,” it must be grounded in human-centered design principles. The concept was developed by Chris Noessel, an interface designer for Watson IBM. Design principles include the focus on easy setup and informative touch points. Also, when the chatbot is working, it’s out of sight. When a user must engage its touch points, they require attention and consideration. Overall, well-designed chatbots and agents require lots of constant attention to manage. Effectively designing chatbots or intelligent agents requires a lot of user testing and feedback to properly for training. The more a chatbot or intelligent agent interacts with humans, the better it learns to respond. It is different than designing other types of technology where the user is actually performing the actions versus the programming code. The metaphor often used is that it is less like designing a hammer and more like designing a butler.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Zoë Kravitz portrays a Seattle tech worker in “Kimi.” (Warner Bros. Entertainment Photo / Claudette Barius)
Once again, Seattle’s tech scene provides the backdrop for a high-profile movie on HBO Max — but this time, it’s serious.
Oscar-winning film director Steven Soderbergh’s tech-noir thriller, “Kimi,” echoes movies like “Rear Window” and “The Conversation” in a tale that also reflects the mind-wrenching isolation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the concerns raised by smart devices that are capable of tracking our every move.
 Zoë Kravitz portrays an employee at a Seattle tech startup that markets a smart speaker and AI voice assistant called Kimi. The startup is gearing up for an IPO that promises a big payoff, but as Kravitz’s character works through a list of audio files that Kimi couldn’t understand, she happens upon a snippet that suggests a crime was committed. Her efforts to get to the truth spark a classic spy chase with some extra tech twists.
It’s a tale far darker than “Superintelligence,” the 2020 romantic comedy starring Melissa McCarthy as a Seattle techie and James Corden as an AI overlord.
Will “Kimi” stir up a debate over AI voice assistants? Does the movie accurately reflect the Seattle vibe? Will it generate as much buzz as Amazon’s Alexa, or will it flop as hard as the Fire Phone? The early indications are mixed: On the Rotten Tomatoes website, for example, the critical consensus is thumbs-up (90%) while the audience score is an emphatic thumbs-down (55%).
To get the verdict from ground zero, we turned to the experts who helped us sort out the fact, fiction and frivolousness in “Superintelligence”: Carissa Schoenick, director of program management and communication at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence; and Kurt Schlosser, GeekWire’s go-to guy for coverage of Seattle’s tech culture.
Here’s the slightly spoiler-y breakdown from Schoenick and Schlosser, with some extra spin provided by yours truly:



Smart speaker … dumb plot?
There are strong echoes of Amazon’s Alexa AI assistant and Apple’s Siri in the squat smart speaker that was designed specifically for “Kimi.” (Soderbergh’s ex-wife, Betsy Brantley, provides the placid feminine voice that’s a prerequisite for smart speakers.)
Screenwriter David Koepp was reportedly inspired to write the script for “Kimi” by a murder case in Arkansas in which prosecutors sought access to audio files that may have been recorded by a suspect’s Amazon Echo device. That case was eventually dismissed due to lack of evidence, but it’s specifically invoked in the movie.
In some of the Seattle scenes, we see flashes of billboards touting Kimi 6.0, but Schoenick was surprised by how basic the speaker’s functions seemed to be. “It was all extremely Home Smart Speaker 101,” she said.
At the beginning of the movie, the CEO of the company that makes Kimi claims that his product is superior to Alexa and Siri because actual humans are employed to make sense of the audio that Kimi can’t figure out. (This is the job that Kravitz’s character has.)
Real-world AI companies would probably dispute the CEO’s claim.
“I’ve heard reports of Amazon using content workers to look at misheard commands and help annotate those, to correct the system,” Schoenick said. “That is absolutely par for the course with AI. Having a human in the loop like that is the way you get annotated data to improve your models.”
Director Steven Soderbergh looks over Zoë Kravitz’s shoulder during the filming of “Kimi.” (Warner Bros. Entertainment Photo / Claudette Barius)  
An ethical company would scrub the audio files to ensure the users’ anonymity. But because this is a movie, the company behind Kimi isn’t bound by real-world rules. “They had a nice, really slick little app for how to spy on their users,” Schoenick said.
The same goes for the other intrusive surveillance methods shown in “Kimi,” including triangulating on cellphone signals and collecting retinal scans of employees without their informed consent. 
“It’s a good example of how a tech company could have abused personal data rights by gathering data and hiding that language in their terms and conditions, because the point that nobody reads those is true,” Schoenick said. “That is where regulating the application of AI can be important.”
In contrast to many other tech thrillers, the AI isn’t the bad guy. Instead, the plot relies on old-fashioned human villains who aren’t always as smart as the devices they wield. Without getting too heavily into plot spoilers, Schoenick said the movie’s climactic confrontation strained plausibility.
“No one was doing the thing that they would really do in real life in this situation,” Schoenick said. “Including the bad guys. They seemed very bad at their job.”
Seattle shines … maybe too much?
One of the least plausible aspects of “Kimi” has to do with the idea that Kravitz’s character could actually afford the apartment where most of the action takes place.
“She’s a glorified content moderator,” Schoenick said. “This is a job that crowdsourced folks would be doing in the real world  — you know, people in content moderation farms. It wouldn’t support the lifestyle of a single person in a huge loft apartment.”
The Kimi-equipped apartment serves as a fortress for the audio interpreter, whose fear of public places arose after a traumatic experience and was reinforced by COVID-related social distancing. It’s in a neighborhood that looks like Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square or Belltown in Seattle, but is actually in Los Angeles.
Schlosser agreed that the apartment seemed a bit too upscale for the typical Seattle techie, but he said Kravitz’s blue-haired, hoodie-wearing character was in tune with the Pacific Northwest vibe.
“She looked perfectly Seattle to me,” he said. “She had a young and fun, techie look about her, and her apartment was decorated with the requisite music posters and stuff like that.”
There are plenty of exterior scenes showing off the Emerald City — including views of Westlake Park, the Helix Pedestrian Bridge and the city’s light-rail stations. There’s even a homeless protest that brought hundreds of extras to downtown Seattle during last year’s filming.

Seattle looks good in the movie. Maybe a little too good, Schlosser said. The way he sees it, a tech-noir thriller like “Kimi” could have taken better advantage of the Pacific Northwest’s trademark gloom. 
“The sunshine was a little offputting,” he said.
But Schlosser said the mere fact that AI-centric movies like “Superintelligence” and “Kimi” are set in Seattle says something about the city’s status as a tech capital.
“I just think it’s cool in regard to the fact that now moviemakers are leapfrogging Silicon Valley and picturing Seattle as the setting for anything happening in tech — whether it’s badly portrayed, weirdly portrayed, funny, exciting or beautiful to look at,” he said. “Seattle is on the moviemaking minds of these guys who are saying, ‘Where is tech centered?'”
Final grades
AI2’s Carissa Schoenick: “The AI voice assistant Kimi takes a backseat to the psychology and action of the storyline. Kimi isn’t invoked in any surprising ways that aren’t already possible with today’s smart speakers – instead, the tech is a plot device to motivate the agoraphobic main character to face her fears. The notion that humans would be employed to review and correct misheard voice commands is not unrealistic; in fact, human-annotated data is fundamental in developing and improving AI algorithms, and companies like Amazon do this very type of voice command auditing for speech recognition technology. The movie has a slow start and really uneven character development with a bit of an eye-rolling conclusion, but if you’re looking for something short and a little weird, it’s a pretty average watch. Grade: C for technology, and C-minus for watchability.”
Geek Life guru Kurt Schlosser: “I’ve been living through COVID and forced isolation for two years. I didn’t need a movie to trap me inside all of that for two more hours – especially with a smart speaker as my only friend. I want to escape! When ‘Kimi’ does get outside, it’s into a Seattle that is too sunny for a film that is so psychologically gloomy. Grade: C-minus.“
Science geek Alan Boyle: “Maybe ‘Kimi’ doesn’t quite measure up to ‘Rear Window,’ but I think anyone who’s a fan of that claustrophobic film genre (which also includes ‘The Woman in the Window’ from last year and a newly released parody, ‘The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window’) will want to check this out. The same goes for folks who get into the issues raised by digital surveillance, or who just want to see if they recognize the Seattle scenery. ‘Kimi’ is the first movie I’ve seen that weaves the COVID-19 pandemic into its plot, and the first movie since ‘Her’ to give a central role to an AI voice assistant. Grade: B.”

Azerbaijan to develop national artificial intelligence strategy


 11 February 2022 18:00 (UTC+04:00)







By Ayya Lmahamad
Nowadays, practically everything around us that comes from the
realm of technology appears to have some aspect of artificial
intelligence (AI).
Artificial intelligence, in computer terminology, is the
programming and development of computers and systems capable of
utilising and processing information in a way analogous to human
activity. In other terms, it is a technology that allows robots to
accomplish jobs that would ordinarily need human-like
reasoning.
Artificial intelligence offers a wide range of potential
applications, including transportation, healthcare, education,
agriculture, cybersecurity, and so on. It has the potential to
increase worker productivity, stimulate economic growth, and
improve the lives of millions of people.
Azerbaijan, like many other countries, is interested in
introducing artificial intelligence into public management.
National strategy for AI
Azerbaijan’s Economy Ministry has recently reported that a
national plan for artificial intelligence will be established.
The work done in this area was discussed at the inaugural
meeting of the working group on Fourth Industrial Revolution
technologies.
Presentations on IoT, Big Data, and its analysis and processing
were also included in the program.
It should be mentioned that over 60 nations worldwide have
national plans, programs, and initiatives in the field of
artificial intelligence, with only 40 countries developing national
strategies that have been authorized as a distinct document.
Azerbaijan places a high value on this set of technologies.
Currently, over 15 businesses in the country provide consultancy
services and do research in several sectors of artificial
intelligence.
A symposium on artificial intelligence in digital governance was
conducted online in April 2021. The three-day conference was
conducted by the E-GOV Development Center (EGDC) of the State
Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations and featured 58
speakers from 22 nations. The worldwide conference was held in
remembrance of late world-renowned scientist Lotfi Zadeh.
AI application in South Caucasus
Azerbaijan ranks 65th in the Artificial Intelligence application
index, according to Oxford Insights.
Azerbaijan has led the South Caucasus in the use of artificial
intelligence for several years in a row.
In the list, Georgia ranks 72nd and Armenia 77th. In terms of
artificial intelligence application, Turkey ranks 67th, Iran 75th
and Russia 33rd.
The top five nations for artificial intelligence application are
the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Germany, and
Sweden.
One of the facts of the current period is the development of new
technologies throughout the world, as well as the employment of
artificial intelligence and robots in many aspects of social
life.

								JAIC piloting artificial intelligence education for DOD							

								New education pilots from the JAIC are seeing large demand from across the DOD, its policy head said.

The Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center recently launched new AI education pilots for thousands of DOD employees that range from executive education for general officers to in-depth coding bootcamps.
The most recent cohort of participants started taking an “AI 101” course in early February through a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while another recently entered an AI coding bootcamp. The range of educational offerings from the AI-accelerator is designed to eventually be transitioned to other DOD institutions for tens or even hundreds of thousands of people to learn about AI, Greg Allen, the JAIC’s head of policy and strategy, told FedScoop.
“We are running training pilots to really test,” Allen said. “We partner with the broader department of defense … to help them deliver education materiel at scale.”
Allen added that “ultimately there is going to be hundreds of thousands of folks” getting some form of AI training, out of the DOD’s nearly 3 million employees and service members.

The work stems from a congressional mandate for the JAIC to develop an AI workforce and education strategy in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act. The JAIC is now implementing that strategy through educational pilots, Allen said.
In that strategy, the JAIC identified six archetypes of AI learner: Lead AI, Drive AI, Create AI, Employ AI, Facilitate AI and Embed AI. Each type of DOD employee needs a different level of detail on AI, so the JAIC is leaning on different platforms to teach them.
For general and flag officers at the highest ranks of the military, Lead AI is an in-person seminar on the basics of what AI can do and how it will impact the capabilities they oversee. On the other end of the spectrum is Create AI, a group of coders that will be developing machine learning models for the military and need specialized training in developing machine learning models.
One of the adjustments the JAIC has made to its offerings for the Create AI category is a new coding bootcamp on the Python coding language that is often used to develop AI.
“These are folks who actually need all the skills to meet their current and future operational needs,” Allen said.

By 2023 the JAIC hopes to have all these lesson plans transitioned to other organizations, like the Defense Acquisition University or the Air Force’s Digital University.
“The No. 1 thing that brings the most joy to us is when we hear back from past participants … they put what they learned to practice in their jobs,” Allen said.

AdChoicesADVERTISINGPomerleau, based in Quebec, completes work through multiple  delivery systems ranging from design-build to lump sum, employs 2,000 and claims  revenue of about $1 billion. The project will apply powerful AI algorithms and  neural networks to the problem of speeding up, de-risking and improving the estimating  processes that set any construction project on a path towards either success  or failure.The initiative announced today is a second phase of Zetane  and Pomerleau’s collaboration. Zetane already successfully completed an initial  phase last year, designed to deliver an AI methodology that can pull important information  from unstructured documents submitted during a request for proposals (RFP).  Prior to that project, Pomerleau engaged in a Call for Innovation, soliciting  small technology companies to engage work with them on an AI-driven approach to  estimating. Thirty companies participated, five were retained for more  substantive proposals and Zetane was ultimately selected. After selection, Zetane  delivered a four-month proof of concept for its approach to intelligent  estimating functionality. The more thorough buildout of this proof of concept  is what is ultimately announced today.“The Initial  problem we addressed that evolved into this project had to do with  preconstruction and estimating and the fact that contractors are getting all of  these complex requests for bids,” Zetane CEO Guillaume Herve’ told ForConstructionPros  in a phone interview in the days before the announcement. “The project was focused on  buildings rather than civil engineering. The problem statement was that they always  get the same massive request for proposal, specifications that are written and  in drawings, and have to throw a number of estimators at it to extract the most  relevant data and get the risk profile and other things that allow you to bid  on the contract.”The labor-intensive nature of the estimating process and the  risk that comes from the fact that estimators can still miss critical elements  were both problems the technology project was designed to address.“It is a very manual process, even if you are using digital  tools currently used in construction and they were using a couple,” Herve’  said. “There is no re-use of data. You would submit a bid and you would not  learn anything from it or from the hundreds of other estimates you have  completed.  And then there is no  continuity between estimating and the project. So what you did in estimating  kind of got restarted—if you did win the job it was a reset. There was no  benefit from all the work you did in preconstruction on the execution phase of  the project. This is the problem addressed in the proof of concept and that is  what we will now be doing at scale.”The technology Zetane and Pomerleau are working towards can  take historical information and use it to inform estimates going forward. This  includes not just looking at past estimates, but at change orders on the  ensuing projects to identify risks inherent in the design, the project type,  the specification or even the customer organization.“They have massive amounts of data against the original bid  that you had, including data on change orders,” Herve’ said. “There are ways  today in AI to retroactively look at that and tell us ‘well, you can expect  these areas to be changed.’ In construction 20 percent of the project probably  drives 80 percent of the cost and the risk. Knowing which 20 percent that is  gives you a proactive way to assess risk, cost, or for the contractor, success  or failure.”Structured Data MandatoryThe current phase of the project will be developed  specifically for Pomerleau, but following that according to Herve’ it will be  commercialized, likely as a digital service offered within estimating software brought  to market by others. What this means is that standardization becomes important  both internal to a given contracting organization and to an extent across the  industry.This consistency must extend to data held in tables and as  text, as well as images and drawings. Design documents may vary, depending on  subindustry and source, ranging in quality and sophistication from building information  modelling (BIM) structed data files to portable document format (PDF) images.“On this project we had to address the problem of How to  extract data and important specs from documents,” Herve’ said. “That was easy.  The hard part was the drawings—there is more richness and risk in large scale  construction drawings than in text. In this project, we are creating the tool  that allows automatic export of information from drawings that are then  provided as input to an estimating tool.”The current phase of the project will involve arriving at a unifying  format the resulting AI application will use to teach the algorithm so it can  create projections that lead to faster, more accurate and less risk-intensive  estimates and bid documents. The AI application will be able to identify and  provide take-offs for graphical elements in a drawing that represent wiring, size  of a room, lighting, ductwork and other structural and mechanical elements.Contractors Must ModernizeHerve' stressed that as more AI-enabled applications make  their way to market, contractors should make sure their data house is in order  so they can take advantage of emerging technology.“The big message for us now is that the massive amount of  data that has always been there can now be useful because machine learning,  deep learning and AI allow you to get value out of that data to do a better job  on estimating and projecting costs and risks in proposals,” he said. “Those  algorithms did not exist five years ago. The tech was just not there. AI has  been around for a long time, but in categories like statistics and business  intelligence. What has changed is the availability of machine learning and deep  learning which can extract value from the data to arrive at a better end point.”   The end result of the project announced today will be a web  service accessible to Pomerleau estimators as a guide-on-the-side during  estimating and bidding processes. That same solution will be adapted for broad  market use, according to Herve', and could come to market either as its own  estimation software solution but more likely as a licensed or whitelabeled  feature within estimating softwares already broadly used in the construction  market.But much of the construction industry may not be prepared.“AI is now ready to revolutionize the preconstruction  process,” Herve’ said. “Despite incremental innovation, the industry has lagged  in the introduction of new technology across the supply chain. Don’t let the  disparate format of data formats you currently have keep you out of the AI  conversation. If you’re not doing it, your competitors are.”  BOTTOM LINE: The Zetane-Pomerleau project is promising not  only because it attacks one of the most critical and challenging elements of  construction, and an element that can get a project off on a positive or  negative trajectory. The involvement of a Pomerleau as a stakeholder also  ensures the application that results from this project will be laser-focused on  immediate industry needs of large and complex contracting organizationsFacebook IconLinkedIn IconTwitter X iconRelatedQ3 Construction Technology UpdatesSeptember 30, 2022How Technology Can Change The Future of Skilled TradesJuly 6, 20223 Cool Construction Estimating Software TrendsApril 13, 2022Latest in Construction TechnologyInside the R&D at Milwaukee ToolJuly 15, 2024Point of Rental Elite Releases Work Orders for POR OneJuly 18, 2024Hitachi Unveils Solution Linkage CONNECT Fleet Management SystemJuly 17, 2024Caterpillar Launches Sensor to Monitor Undercarriage DamageJuly 17, 2024RecommendedConstruction TechnologyHow AI, Automation, and Tech Are Shaping Asphalt IndustryThe machines that we use to pave, mill, and compact are getting smarter at an increasingly fast pace.

Study on the use of artificial intelligence in refrigeration plants





Details 



15 February 2022 





  

International. A group of Italian researchers presented a review of the performance of 19 refrigeration plants in which artificial intelligence algorithms were implemented.
Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning (DL), which are subfields of AI, can generate significant benefits in terms of operation and maintenance of refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for predictive maintenance and improvement of machine operations is one of the most studied AI applications in these fields. As predictable failures, the authors give examples of refrigerant charge defects, in terms of overload or leakage/insufficient load, and heat exchanger failures in terms of fouling, secondary fluid mass flow, and reduced heat transfer.
Using AI algorithms instead of physics-based ones can be interesting if a reduced calculation time is required and if the cumulative operational effects over time are considered. FDD enables better scheduling of maintenance operations to avoid serious failures and limit costs related to minor failures.

AI is also being widely used for predicting the energy performance of refrigeration equipment. Energy performance prediction is useful for establishing the optimal control strategy and maximizing energy savings. For example, predicting the COP of a geothermal heat pump with an ANN algorithm using soil temperature and air temperature of the inlet and outlet condenser as input variables resulted in an error of only 1% between the measured and predicted COP.
Predictive control is an important application of AI. Thanks to their simplicity and reduced computing time, ANN algorithms can be implemented in the main control boards of operating systems in real time. These novel control systems can push the boundaries of widely used thermostatic and PID controls by providing a shorter response time during transient operation, achieving significant energy savings.
As an example, the authors present the modeling of a 4-cooler plant with a two-level algorithm to minimize operating costs. At the first level, a genetic algorithm is used to predict the on/off state of the cooler based on the cooling charge. At the second level, particle swarm optimization is used to minimize system energy consumption using cooling capacity, water temperature difference, and enthalpy as main inputs. During two days of operation, energy savings of 14% were achieved; In addition, thanks to a high calculation rate, it is possible to implement this algorithm to control the entire plant in real time.
On the other hand, little work has been done on the prediction of frost formation and on the techniques of optimizing thaw control, which shows that this area of research is still to be explored.
