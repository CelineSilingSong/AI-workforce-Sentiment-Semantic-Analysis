As Artificial Intelligence(AI) is used in more BBC products and everything else online, we think it’s important to deliver AI-powered systems that are responsibly and ethically designed. We also want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to understand more about how this influential technology works in the world. This is part of a series of posts on this topic.
We have noticed that news stories or press releases about AI are often illustrated with stock photos of shiny gendered robots, glowing blue brains or the Terminator. We don't think that these images actually represent the technologies of AI and ML that are in use and being developed. Indeed, we think these are unhelpful stereotypes; they set unrealistic expectations, hinder wider understanding of the technology and potentially sow fear. Ultimately this affects public understanding and critical discourse around this increasingly influential technology. We are working towards better, less clichéd, more accurate and more representative images and media for AI.
Try going to your search engine of choice and search for images of AI. What do you get? 







What are the issues?
The problems with stock images of AI has been discussed and analysed a number of times already and there are some great articles and papers about it that describe the issues better than we can. The Is Seeing Believing? project asks how we can evolve the visual language of AI. The Real Scandal of AI also identifies issues with stock photos. The AI Myths project, amongst other topics, includes a feature on how shiny robots are often used to represent AI.Going a bit deeper, this article explores how researchers have illustrated AI over the decades, this paper discusses how AI is often portrayed as white “in colour, ethnicity, or both” and this paper investigates the “AI Creation” meme that features a human hand and a machine hand nearly touching. Wider issues with the portrayal and perception of AI have also been frequently studied, as by the Royal Society here.To help us think through the problem we developed a workshop format in which we discuss existing imagery and then think about, sketch and create some better alternatives. The workshop isn’t just about pictures though, it’s thinking through what we talk about when we talk about AI. We have run the workshop with BBC teams several times and earlier in the year we took it to the 2021 Mozilla Festival. We start our workshops by examining and discussing existing images that represent AI and ML.

In our sessions there is often disagreement on which images are helpful and unhelpful, it's not clear cut. Some of the diagram-style images might be helpful, but only if you know a bit about the subject, and they're not visually striking or immediately recognisable. Similarly, funny images don't work unless you know enough to get the joke.The style of the existing images is often influenced by science fiction and there are many visual cliches of technology, such as 0s and 1s or circuit boards. The colour blue is predominant - although in this case it seems to be representing technology, blue can also be seen as representing male-ness.
The frequent representation of brains associate these images with human intelligence, although much AI and ML in use today is far removed from human intelligence. Robots occur frequently, but AI applications are very often nothing to do with robots or embodied systems. The robots are often white or they’re sexualised female representations. We also often see “evil” robots from popular culture, like the Terminator.The people we’ve workshopped with liked images that illustrate AI finding patterns, order or connections. Or images that try to embed AI & ML into the reality and context in which used - like surveillance cameras or voice assistants.
What do we think about AI?
From reviewing the research literature and by interviewing AI engineers and developers in the BBC we have identified some common themes which we think are important in describing AI and ML and that could help when thinking about imagery.

AI is all based on maths, statistics and probabilities
AI is about finding patterns and connections in data
AI works at a very large scale, manipulating almost unimaginable amounts of data
AI is often very complex and opaque and it’s hard to explain how it works. It’s even hard for the experts and practitioners to understand exactly what’s going on inside these systems
Most AI systems in use today only really know about one thing, it is “narrow” intelligence
AI works quite differently to the human brain, in some ways it is an alien non-human intelligence
AI systems are artificial and constructed and coded by humans
AI is a sociotechnical system; it is combinations of computers and humans, creating, selecting and processing the data
AI is quite invisible and often hidden
AI is increasingly common, becoming pervasive, and affects almost all of us in so many areas. It can be powerful when connected to systems of power and affects individuals, society and the world

We would like to see more images that realistically portray the technology and point towards its strengths, weaknesses, context and applications. Maybe they could...

Represent a wider range of humans and human cultures than ‘caucasian businessperson’ or ‘humanoid robot’
Represent the human, social and environmental impacts of AI systems
Reflect the realistically messy, complex, repetitive and statistical nature of AI systems
Accurately reflect the capabilities of the technology: generally applied to specific tasks and are not of human-level intelligence
Show realistic applications of AI
Avoid monolithic or unknowable representations of AI systems
Avoid using electronic representations of human brains, or robots

Towards better images
In creating new stock photos and imagery we need to consider what makes a good stock photo. Why do people use them and how? Is the image representing a particular part of the technology or is it trying to tell a wider story? What emotional response should the viewers have when looking at it? Does it help them understand the technology and is it an accurate representation? Consider the visual style; a diagram, a cartoon or a photo each brings different attributes and will communicate ideas in different ways. Imagery is often used to draw attention so it may be important to create something that has impact and is recognisable. A lot of existing stock photos of AI may be misrepresentative and unhelpful, but they are distinctive and impactful and you know them when you see them.To conclude our workshops we wanted people to start making their own images, or think about what those images might be. They didn't need to be ""good"" - we were more interested in seeing what people focused on and how they wanted to represent it.Some of the themes we’ve seen develop from these creations include:

Putting humans front and centre, and showing AI as a helper, a tool or something to be harnessed.
Showing the human involvement in AI; in coding the systems or creating the training data.
Positively reinforcing what AI can do, rather than showing the negative and dangerous aspects.
Showing the input and outputs and how human knowledge is translated into data.
Making the invisible visible.
AI getting things wrong

Interesting metaphors used include sieves and filters (of data), friendly ghosts, training circus animals, social animals, like bees or ants with emergent behaviours, child-like learning and the past predicting the future.
A new image representing datasets / creating order / digitisation
 

This is just a starting point and there is much more thinking to be done, sketches to be drawn, ideas to be harnessed, definitions agreed on and metaphors minted.We have already kicked off a project with students at the London College of Communication, giving them this brief and we’re excited about what they’ve created and how they thought about the problem. We are now working with We and AI to develop more ideas and spread the word. Ultimately we’re hoping to help create a library of better stock photos for AI; we’re starting to look for artists to commission and we’re looking for collaborators to work with. Please get in touch if you’re interested in working with us. This work is part of a wider project that we're working on to try to make AI and ML more understandable to everyone. See previous posts on why we think this is important, different ways we can approach explaining, prototypes that demonstrate understandable AI and a video about AI aimed at young people.Icon creditsComplexity by SBTS from the Noun ProjectOctopus by Atif Arshad from the Noun Projectpattern by Eliricon from the Noun Projectwatch world by corpus delicti from the Noun Projectsts by Nithinan Tatah from the Noun Projectnarrowing by andriwidodo from the Noun ProjectError 404 by Aneeque Ahmed from the Noun Projectbox icon by Fithratul Hafizd from the Noun ProjectGhost by Pelin Kahraman from the Noun Projectstack by Alex Fuller from the Noun ProjectMath by Ralf Schmitzer from the Noun Projectchip by Chintuza from the Noun Project

Reflecting on DeepMind’s AlphaFold artificial intelligence success – what’s the real significance for protein folding research and drug discovery?

In a long read, Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive and President of the ICR, and also a drug discovery scientist, reflects on the significance of the latest version of AlphaFold – a powerful AI system that has been applied to predict structures for almost 99% of human proteins – for fundamental research and drug discovery.

by Professor Paul Workman









Last month, DeepMind published the much anticipated, detailed methodology underlying the latest version of AlphaFold – the UK-based science company’s powerful AI system that blew away its rivals in the latest major competition to predict the 3D structure of proteins.
 AlphaFold’s machine learning methodology has been applied to predict structures for almost 99% of human proteins which have now been made publicly available. In this long read, I reflect on the significance of these developments for fundamental research and drug discovery. 
I wrote this as the ICR celebrates the 10th anniversary of its AI-enabled drug discovery knowledgebase canSAR – which features multiple approaches to predicting ‘druggability’ as an aid to selecting drug targets and accelerating drug discovery.
The coronavirus pandemic has, understandably, soaked up a lot of bandwidth when it comes to science news – but this particular non-Covid science story was able to cut through and hit the headlines in the UK and around the world.
On 30 November 2020 it was announced that DeepMind – a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet focusing on artificial intelligence – had made what was hailed as a huge leap towards solving one of biology’s greatest remaining challenges: the ability to predict the correct, three-dimensional structures of proteins based on their constituent, one-dimensional amino acid sequences.
The announcement attracted huge interest, but the expert community has been waiting for the peer-reviewed science publication. The AI methodology has now been published in the leading journal Nature and this was followed rapidly by a second Nature paper from DeepMind and collaborators at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), which reports the application of the most recent AlphaFold machine learning system to predict the 3D structures at scale for almost the entire human proteome – 98.5% of human proteins.
Founded in the UK in 2010, a statement on DeepMind’s website says: ‘Our long-term aim is to solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).’
DeepMind made an initial impact by using its AI methods to beat a professional Go game champion and by learning to play from scratch 49 different Atari games – based only on the pixels and the score on the screen.
DeepMind’s intention was to use these gaming challenges as a basis upon which to develop solutions to major, real world problems.
Indeed DeepMind’s AI technology has been applied successfully in the biomedical field – for example in identifying early signs of retinal disease from eye scans and the detection of breast cancer from mammography scans.
The company’s strategy is to use advanced AI methodology known as machine learning and neural networks to power its predictions.
As a further real world, major biomedical challenge, DeepMind decided to focus its attention on making much-needed improvements in our ability to predict accurate 3D structures of proteins based on the linear polymeric sequence of amino acids – which are encoded in our genes and arranged like the beads on a string.

The importance of protein folding

 
Before looking at what was achieved by DeepMind’s latest version of AlphaFold, we need to consider why it is that being able to predict the different 3D origami structures into which different proteins fold up is such a big deal.
This is because proteins perform the biological functions that are required for life – whether, for example, that be catalysing a biochemical reaction, recognising an infection, or enabling muscles to contract. And knowing the 3D shape of proteins is important because it is a foundational principal in biology that structure determines function, in the same way that the design and shape of a piece of furniture – say a chair, table or bed – dictates how it is used.
Overall, proteins fall into two main structural classes: globular proteins, which are compact, spherical and soluble, and others that are elongated, fibrous and insoluble. 
Within these broad classes, individual proteins fold up into a unique shape, the exact details of which define the jobs they carry out. So determining the precise 3D structure of a given protein is a crucial part of understanding how it performs its function in the cell and in the body – and therefore is vital to understanding the molecular basis of life itself.
Truly a grand challenge!
Furthermore, as I address later, in addition to the importance of being able to predict protein structure for our fundamental molecular comprehension of life, there are also huge practical benefits – for example in understanding and treating disease and in the design of proteins for practical use in the biotechnology industry.
So no pressure there either!
The historical context
It’s important, too, to view the protein folding grand challenge in its historical context.
The so-called ‘Central Dogma of molecular biology’ was originally hypothesised in a conference lecture in 1957 by the British physicist-turned-biologist Francis Crick. In that talk, Crick famously used the memorable depiction ‘DNA → RNA → protein’, where the arrows indicate the ‘flow of information’. Crick of course later won the Nobel Prize with Jim Watson (and also Maurice Wilkins with a major contribution from the by then sadly deceased Rosalind Franklin) for their research published in 1953 in which they solved the double-helix structure of DNA – and which revealed the explanation for how genetic information encoded by the sequence of base pairs in the double helix can be precisely copied.
Also importantly, Crick’s extraordinary insight into the fundamental molecular information flow of life proposed correctly in broad terms how the 1D linear sequence of bases in DNA – making up the genetic code – could be translated, via the corresponding 1D messenger RNA sequences, into the 1D sequence of amino acid building blocks that make up the polypeptide chains of proteins. 
However, although brilliant, the Central Dogma did not explain at all how the linear amino acid chains are folded up into the correct twists and turns of the proteins that make up the 3D molecular machines of life.
Twelve years later, in another important conference lecture delivered in 1969, the American molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal estimated that the number of theoretically possible configurations that a representative polypeptide chain might adopt could be as high as the mind-blowing number of 10300 – meaning that the protein would take longer to fold correctly than the age of the then-known universe. This is in stark contrast to the observed ability of proteins to achieve their correct 3D shape in as little time as a few seconds. The conundrum became known as the Levinthal Paradox of protein folding.
A further three years later, in 1972, the US biochemist Christian Afinson won the Nobel Prize for the ‘thermodynamic hypothesis’ – based on his studies of the protein called ribonuclease, and ‘in particular the relationship between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation’. 
Afinson concluded his Nobel prize lecture paper with a look into the future when it would be possible predict how the 3D shape of a protein structure could relate to its corresponding genetic code and amino acid sequence, saying: 
‘Empirical considerations of the large amount of data now available on correlations between sequence and three dimensional structure, together with an increasing sophistication in the theoretical treatment of the energetics of polypeptide chain folding, are beginning to make more realistic the idea of the a priori prediction of protein conformation. It is certain that major advances in the understanding of cellular organization, and of the causes and control of abnormalities in such organization, will occur when we can predict, in advance, the three dimensional, phenotypic consequences of a genetic message.’
The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) ‘competition’

Despite gradual progress being made, in 1994 the frustratingly limited ability to correctly predict the 3D conformation of proteins from the constituent amino acid sequence led a group of structural biologists to set up the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) ‘competition’. Note that the organisers don’t like the term ‘competition’ and prefer ‘experiment’, but to outsiders it certainly looks like a competition!
The aim of this biennial exercise is to accelerate progress. Every two years around a hundred research teams strive to see how accurately their computational methods can predict the 3D structures of proteins for which the solutions have been revealed by painstaking empirical structure determination – typically done by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy – but not yet publicly released. 
Because the entrants in the protein structure prediction Olympics are asked to predict the structures of a hundred proteins ‘blind’, CASP really does challenge each team’s ability to make accurate estimates. 
To provide a bit of technical detail, the accuracy of protein folding predictions is measured by the so-called global distance test or GDT. This compares the predicted 3D structure of a given protein with the experimentally determined conformation – which represents the so-called ‘ground truth.’
In the latest round – CASP 14, which was run over several months last year – DeepMind’s new AlphaFold AI technology (referred to as AlphaFold2) blew the other entrants away by achieving a median GDT score of 92.4 across all the proteins to be solved in the competition – with 100 being the highest possible score. 
This would effectively represent 100% perfect accuracy, with all the atoms in the amino acids being in the precisely correct position. Anything over 90 is comparable with the results of laborious experimental determinations of protein structures and is considered as a correct solution that scientists can rely on with confidence. 
For the hardest category of all – known as free-modelling, where the teams are asked to predict protein structures that do not have any comparable related protein structures available as template guides – the new AlphaFold2 technology achieved the remarkable median GDT score of 87.0. 
Overall, the DeepMind team’s predictions had an average error (calculated technically as the root-mean-square deviation or RMSD) of approximately 1.6 Ångströms – where one Ångström is equal to 1 x 10-10 metres or 0.0000000001 metre. This means that the error in prediction is as small as the estimated width of a carbon atom (1.4 Ångströms). 
So not too bad at all!
To emphasise just how much progress had been made, compare the above-mentioned AlphaFold2 median GDT score of 92.4 with the score achieved by DeepMind’s previous version of AlphaFold, which was around 70-75. This earlier version won the CASP 13 exercise in 2018 – representing the first major impact of AI on protein structure prediction. Before that the GDT scores achieved in several previous CASP competitions were down around the 60 mark.
Importantly, the new AlphaFold2 AI predictions in CASP 14 worked well across a wide range of different types of protein, which is obviously important for the general application of the methodology.
An interesting and topical protein in the competition was the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein ORF8, the structure of which was subsequently published.
ORF8 is a rapidly evolving coronavirus protein that has been implicated in immune evasion. Not only did AlphaFold accurately forecast the conformation of the components of the 3D shape known as antiparallel β-sheets – a common structural motif found in proteins – but even more impressively, the new methodology apparently also got it right in forecasting the spatial location of the loops that connect the β-sheets together. Such loops are notoriously difficult challenges in structure prediction.
Positive reception
The response of experts in the field of protein folding was widely very positive, although it was acknowledged that a full analysis of the new AlphaFold2 AI approach must await formal peer review and publication – as duly occurred with the earlier version of AlphaFold – and some commentators pointed out the current inevitable limitations.
A news piece in the leading journal Science quoted the expert computational protein scientist Janet Thornton as saying, ‘What the DeepMind team has managed to achieve is fantastic and will change the future of structural biology and protein research.’ The Science report also quotes the Nobel Prize-winning structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, who described the work as ‘a stunning advance on the protein folding problem’.
Similarly, in a Nature news piece the computational biologist and co-founder of CASP John Moult said: ‘This is a big deal. In some sense the problem is solved.’ And the same news article also quotes Andrei Lupas, who studies protein evolution, as saying: ‘This will change everything’. Not surprisingly Lupas was impressed that AlphaFold enabled him to determine in half an hour the structure of a protein that he’d failed to solve for 10 years!
More detailed commentaries last November aimed at experts in protein informatics can be found on the Oxford Protein Informatics Group's blog and Mohammed AlQuraishi's blog.
How was it done?


 
In terms of how the AlphaFold2 breakthrough was actually achieved, last year DeepMind provided some initial information. The Science news piece paraphrases John Jumper from the AlphaFold team as saying that they combined deep learning with an ‘attention algorithm’ that mimics how humans assemble a jigsaw puzzle. 
The team used a computer network built around 128 machine learning processors to train the algorithm on the 170,000 experimentally determined protein structures in Protein Data Base or PDB. DeepMind also said that the AlphaFold team used large databases containing protein sequences of unknown structure.
What was also clear is that the AlphaFold2 predictions would have required an awesome amount of compute power and benefited from intense team working at DeepMind.
The details are now made fully transparent in last month’s Nature publication. There, the authors state: ‘Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.’
 They also confirm that the neural network AlphaFold system they developed is a completely different model from their earlier approach used successfully in the previous CASP event.
In addition, the authors comment: ‘AlphaFold greatly improves the accuracy of structure prediction by incorporating novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical and geometric constraints of protein structure. In particular, we demonstrate a new architecture to jointly embed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and pairwise features, a new output representation and associated loss which enable accurate end-to-end structure prediction, a new equivariant attention architecture, use of intermediate losses to achieve iterative refinement of predictions, masked MSA loss to jointly train with structure, learning from unlabelled protein sequences using self-distillation, and self-estimates of accuracy.’
For those needing it, further detail is provided in the text of the Nature publication and associated supplementary data. Also the source code for the AlphaFold2 model, trained weights and inference script are made freely available under an open-source license.
What are the benefits of AlphaFold’s predictive power?

Access to the source code and other details not only allows independent validation of the AlphaFold2 predictions, but also researchers can now use the methodology to predict structures for their own proteins of interest.
An immediate and important benefit is that free access to AlphaFold’s protein structure predictions is enabled by DeepMind and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) through their AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. So researchers worldwide can use the predictive powers of DeepMind in their research. 
Deep Mind is to be commended for this altruistic behaviour which will greatly widen the impact of its work.
As mentioned, the new AlphaFold machine learning system was used in the follow-up Nature paper to predict the 3D structures at scale for almost 99% of all 20,000 human proteins that are now in the database.
As well as the human proteome, the database also currently contains ~350,000 protein structures including most of the proteins present from 20 model organisms –  including those from organisms commonly used in biomedical research, such as the bacterium E.coli, fruit fly, mouse, zebrafish and disease pathogens such as the malaria parasite and the tuberculosis bacterium.
In the second Nature article on AlphaFold2 published last month, the authors summarised both the overall performance of the new methodology and also the limits – as applied to 98.5% of the human proteins with full amino acid chain prediction. 
In comparison to experimental determination over many decades that has provided structural coverage of only 17% of the total amino residues present in human protein sequences, AlphaFold now provides a dataset at scale that covers 58% of amino acid residues with a confident prediction – and within this dataset there is a subset for which 36% of all residues are predicted with very high confidence.
At the individual protein level, AlphaFold2 gives a confident prediction for at least three quarters of the amino acid sequence in the case of 44% of human proteins. 
The authors say they have obtained high-quality structural predictions for human proteins ‘across a broad range of gene ontology (GO) terms, including pharmaceutically relevant classes such as enzymes and membranes’.
In the second Nature paper, the authors provide three interesting, illustrative examples of de novo predictions for the 3D structures of human proteins lacking significant templates, namely the transmembrane enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, another enzyme diacylgycerol O-acetyltransferase 2, and the transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein wolframin for which mutations are linked to the rare genetic condition, Wolfram Syndrome. The three structures suggest biological hypotheses that can now be followed up – and this will be true for the predicted structures of very large numbers of other proteins.
There are however many regions across human proteins for which 3D structure cannot be predicted with confidence. Moreover, it is not surprising that the first author of the first of the two recent AlphaFold2 Nature publications John Jumper has commented: ‘It seems that in many cases where AlphaFold struggles it is because the protein itself is “disordered,” with no inherent structure in isolation.’ 
This is a significant limitation given that disordered regions comprise between 37 and 50% of human proteins – but it is noted that it is useful in itself to be able to predict which are the intrinsically disordered regions. In fact, predicting these regions computationally is the subject of a research community challenge in its own right.
It should be stressed that although prediction of full-length protein structure is always desirable, the ability to predict accurately the 3D shape of individual domains within proteins can be very valuable.
Also to be highlighted is the speed of the protein predictions. The first author of the second of the two recent AlphaFold Nature publications, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, has said that it took AlphaFold2 only around 48 hours to obtain the 350,000 protein predictions – an astonishing speed, especially compared with the typically laborious pace of experimental structure determination.
Overall the results provided show that excellent and exciting progress has been made in protein prediction using AlphaFold2 – while also revealing the scope for substantial further improvement.
The benefits are likely to be far reaching, both now and into the future. 
The co-founder and CEO of DeepMind – and also last author on the two Nature papers –  Demis Hassabis told Fortune magazine that the publication of AlphaFold’s structure predictions was his company’s ‘biggest contribution to science to date [and] an example of the benefits AI can bring to society’. See more comments from Hassabis in his recent blog post.
Fortune also quoted very positive views from Elizabeth Blackburn (University of California San Francisco), Paul Nurse (Francis Crick Institute) and Ewan Birney (EMBL-EBI). These biomedical research leaders and many others have praised AlphaFold’s accurate and large-scale protein prediction capability, with many seeing it as the biggest breakthrough since the determination of the human genome sequence around 20 years ago – and arguably similar in scale and impact.
A Nature editorial last month reported a consensus view that ‘it’s too early to predict exactly what impact the application of AI in the life sciences will have, except that any impact will be transformative.’


What is the likely impact on drug discovery?

There is no doubt that AlphaFold’s AI-powered protein prediction technology will greatly benefit fundamental research (understanding the structure and function of life), the biotechnology industry (engineering proteins as molecular machines and foods) and of course – as has been much promoted if not hyped in the coverage – the discovery of new drugs.
Most of the new drugs that we discover today for cancer and other diseases exert their effects by targeting particular proteins in the body. Ideally, we wish to design small-molecule drugs to bind very precisely to a tiny region of the overall target protein so as to alter its function. Medicinal chemists will always prefer to have an accurate 3D protein structure so they can apply structure-based drug design – thereby helping them to achieve as ‘perfect fit’ as possible alongside multiple other optimised properties.
And the 3D protein structure is important even before the drug discovery phase begins – by helping the drug discovery team to assess the druggability of the target protein – the extent to which it has pockets or grooves that allow small-molecule compounds to bind.
 This allows researchers to understand which targets are relatively straightforward to drug and which ones will represent a major challenge. Such information can be extremely useful in prioritising which protein targets to pursue and the approach to be taken.
Here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, we developed the canSAR knowledgebase which integrates massive multidisciplinary data to enable objective target assessment and prioritisation and already incorporates AI and machine learning techniques to predict druggability. We not only use canSAR in our own drug discovery research at the ICR, but we also made it freely available for use by researchers worldwide. As mentioned earlier, we have recently celebrated canSAR’s 10th anniversary.
There was certainly a buzz among my drug discovery colleagues at the ICR as we read the news last November about the AlphaFold2 breakthrough and discussed the potential impact on drug discovery. Our Head of Data Science, Professor Bissan Al-Lazikani who created canSAR, was in fact – early in her career – part of the team that won CASP4 in 2000. 
Bissan has written in the Spectator magazine about what she feels this discovery could mean for her field – concluding: ‘If we can effectively harness Deepmind’s technology, we will gain a much better understanding of all the proteins and mutations that cause cancers. It will help us to accurately design and discover better, safer drugs that could successfully treat or cure countless people.’
In the canSAR team that I am part of, we are currently evaluating for ourselves the impact of AlphaFold2 and incorporating the predicted structure models into the knowledgebase, starting with the human proteins.
But how much does knowledge or accurate prediction of protein structure speed up drug discovery – from target selection to clinical candidate and approved drug? 
I have been personally involved in multiple drug discovery projects at the ICR in which exploiting the 3D structure of the target protein has played a major role. These include the targets Hsp90 in collaboration with Professor Laurence Pearl and AKT/PKB with Professor David Barford. In their different ways, both projects benefited very much from the availability of the protein structure and both resulted in drugs entering clinical trial.
There is no doubt that the ability to predict accurate 3D protein structures is generally very valuable to drug discovery – and also, by the way, in the design of chemical probes to evaluate the role of the target in biology and disease pathology. Indeed the availability of a protein structure can in some cases make or break a drug discovery project – especially where a fragment-based approach is needed.
The AlphaFold team says that it is already collaborating with organisations such as Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) and other partners.
However, the response of some drug discovery professionals to the AlphaFold2 success has been more muted than some of the other commentary. This is exemplified by the views of the medicinal chemist and drug discovery blogger Derek Lowe – both last year and after the Nature publications last month.
While recognising the scientific advance, Derek points out to those uninitiated in the arts of drug discovery that: 1) predicted structures may be not be accurate enough and thus experimentally defined structures may still be needed; and 2) although actual or accurately predicted structures can accelerate the very early phase (let’s say saving an initial year or two) they do not greatly shorten the overall, say, 10 to 15 years that are needed from target selection (following validation) all the way to drug approval for widespread use.
What would represent an even bigger overall acceleration of drug discovery, as Derek rightly suggests, are solving tough problems such as ‘better prediction of useful drug targets, more translatable disease-predictive cell and animal models, and earlier assays that are more predictive of human toxicology.’ Also I would say the speeding up of clinical trials and the regulatory approval stages.
Personally, I think that (in addition to the major benefits in fundamental research) AlphaFold will have big impact on drug discovery – but there is no doubt that after the early stages where AlphaFold will have maximal effect, a lot remains to be done to discover and develop a drug where an accurate 3D protein structure has little to contribute. 
However, as my colleagues and I have discussed, the application of big data and AI approaches more generally (ie beyond AlphaFold and protein structure determination) is clearly beginning to show benefit across the drug discovery and clinical continuum, with great potential to have further impact.
Has the Levinthal Paradox been resolved?
The answer to this is a definite no.
At least for now, what has been achieved by AlphaFold is not an answer to the question of the mechanisms by which proteins actually achieve the correct 3D fold, but rather only so far the ability to predict way more accurately than before the end result of protein folding. 
The ultimate resolution of the Levinthal Paradox will require the physics and chemistry of the mechanisms by which proteins achieve their correct fold to be worked out. It’s possible, however, that this might be approached by ‘deconvoluting’ the AI system used by AlphaFold.
What is still left to be done?
Going beyond the 20,000 human proteins and more than 350,000 proteins overall for which AlphaFold2 has provided predicted 3D structures, DeepMind’s ambition is to increase this number to 130 million – approximately 50% of all known proteins – by the end of the year. That would be astonishingly rapid. And presumably the remaining extant proteome as well. 
Beyond that and continuing to enhance the accuracy of protein structure prediction, what further challenges lie ahead for AlphaFold and other AI-driven approaches?
The use of AlphaFold2’s deep learning and neural networks approach to predict the following will be extremely important:

Structures of intrinsically disordered regions
Conformational changes and protein dynamics
Effects of post-translational protein modifications
Structures of multi-protein complexes

DeepMind and also others will continue to refine the deep learning methodology. For example, inspired by the CASP14 performance of AlphaFold2, last month a team of academics published their results showing their use of a ‘three-track neural network’ to obtain structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14.
 Published just before the AlphaFold2 Nature papers came out, the approach – named RoseTTAFold – has performed well in predicting blind structures of 69 proteins and shows potential to predict complexes of unknown structure with more than three chains.
Final comments

Image: Protein crystals for X-ray crystallography.
It is important to recognise, as DeepMind scientists have done, the contribution of decades of work since the 1950s and 60s by structural biology researchers using wet lab methods (X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and now cryo-EM) to produce the body of high-quality, experimental protein structures and their deposition, curation and public availability via the Protein Data Bank (PDB) ‘as an enduring public good to promote basic and applied research and education across the sciences’.
Also to be highlighted I think is the role of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) which has accelerated the output and open sharing – prior to formal publication – of protein structures and other reagents, ‘focusing explicitly on less well-studied areas of the human genome’.
These efforts have been critical enablers of AlphaFold’s subsequent success.
It’s important to emphasise that structural biologists will not be made redundant by AlphaFold2. They will be continue to be essential for fundamental and drug discovery research, including validating AI-predicted structures and pushing the boundaries of understanding how 3D structures enable the basic processes of life and disease.
And structural biologists will now incorporate AI methods to accelerate experimental protein structure determination, as in the case of the recent use of cryo-EM combined with deep learning-based structure prediction from AlphaFold2 to produce an atomic model for full-length SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2 protein – with implications for a functional role in RNA binding and potential application for drug design.
Overall, I believe that AlphaFold2 is a major advance along the technological journey of predicting the 3D structure of life’s proteins and that it will have a profound impact in accelerating our overall understanding of the fundamental structure-function basis of life and disease. 
And it will contribute to a continued acceleration of the application of AI to drug discovery and biotechnology.
The journey continues.

Update - August 2022
In partnership with EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), AlphaFold announced just a few days ago (28 July 2022) that they are releasing the predicted structures for ‘nearly all catalogued proteins known to science’. 
The release will dramatically expand the AlphaFold database by more than 200 times – from almost 1 million structures to more than 200 million structures.

The power of AI lies in its potential to improve lives, but this potential can only be realized if AI represents the entire population. Increasing diversity in AI development is crucial to delivering equitable outcomes.Have you read?5 ways to improve gender equality in the workplace8 female CEOs on bridging the gender gap in techWhy AI is failing the next generation of womenBias in AI is a real concern and it’s generating more attention. Gartner predicts that in 2022, 85% of AI projects will deliver erroneous outcomes owing to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them. One of the more effective ways to address bias in AI is to engage diverse teams throughout the process. Diversity means including a variety of perspectives from different ethnicities, genders, ages, skills and experiences in the teams developing AI. Such diversity can enable AI teams to develop more products that can have a positive impact on a wider audience of users.Women are very much underrepresented in AI and in the tech industry more broadly. A 2020 World Economic Forum report on gender parity suggests women account for only 26% of data and AI positions in the workforce. We need to get more women into AI.Share of male and female workers across professional clusters Image: World Economic ForumIncreasing gender diversityTo help promote gender diversity, there are some basic steps companies and the larger community can take: 1. Support STEM educationOne of the reasons there are not more women in AI has its roots in childhood, long before young women enter the workforce. Social and cultural influences – like the false stereotype that girls are not as in tune with maths and science as boys – have often discouraged girls from pursuing STEM-related paths in the past. By the time they reach college, they’ve selected other options and it becomes difficult to switch gears. The few women in STEM classes generally receive limited resources about the different options available to them in AI. In order to engage girls early, Girl Scouts across the nation have been participating in extracurricular STEM education programmes aimed at increasing interest, confidence and competence in STEM. The organization has pledged to add 2.5 million young women to the STEM workforce by 2025 and has collaborated with a number of industry leader to help prepare these women to be future STEM leaders. 2. Showcase female AI trailblazersHaving visible female scientists and AI leaders in business and society is an effective way to highlight opportunities for women in AI and counter negative cultural stereotypes about females not belonging in STEM. Every time we talk about AI – whether it’s in panel discussions, at events or on social media – it’s important to have an equal number of women participating. A new generation of female scientists can be inspired and talented women will be attracted to a workforce that exhibits gender inclusivity.3. Mentor women for leadership rolesMentorship is critical for those women who do eventually make it to a career in AI. In the past, mentorship has not come from organization-led programmes, but from other places like associations or academia. These women and men have helped their mentees set expectations, identify opportunities and overcome barriers. Where mentorship programmes do exist in companies they’re often only available to leadership, but that’s starting to change. Now AI-supported apps are being used to connect entry and mid-level workers with mentors no matter their location. After using one such app, one company’s mentees indicated they had 218% more clarity toward their career path and felt 178% more equipped to achieve their goals within the company after just six months.4. Create equal opportunities Implicit biases in many companies’ recruiting processes pose another barrier to women from entering and advancing in AI. These biases take the forms of gendered language in job titles and descriptions and a lack of diversity in the hiring process. In addition, there is a lack of clarity and direction about the range of roles and industries in which women can work in AI. For example, a degree in AI isn’t always needed.The time has come to hire and promote women to at least 50% of the high-growth AI positions and to help position them for success. Breaking down the barriers women face in the workplace can help companies achieve a more inclusive culture. Without them, AI algorithms won’t function as well out of the gate.The number of female students awarded a STEM degree or certificate in the US has risen over the most recent period Image: Statista5. Ensure a gender-equal reward systemEqual pay for equal work is fair and helps not just to recruit women, but to retain them. Unfortunately, many women who have been in tech roles for nearly a decade have considered leaving because of inadequate compensation and an inability to advance professionally. Organizations should be accountable and transparent in disclosing gender gaps within their AI workforce as well as how they plan to address those gaps. Such plans should be data-based to provide an accurate gauge of progress.Eliminating pay gaps in AI roles can make the field more viable in retaining women. Nearly 60 years after the US Equal Pay Act passed, men still earn about 20% more than women. Fortunately the tide is slowly turning. Several high-profile US companies, including technology giants and national hospitality leaders, have reached full parity in pay for women and minorities.A bright future for women in AIMany organizations and workforces are just beginning their AI journeys and are realizing the value gender diversity can offer in AI. Organizations that place more women in their AI teams not only help increase gender equality in the industry; they can deliver more value to their own business and customers. While there is still much work to be done, change is on the horizon and the future is bright for women in AI.Don't miss any update on Education, Gender and WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Equity, Diversity and InclusionEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

What Is Formative AI? Exploring the Future of Artificial Intelligence
By Jenna Phipps

August 13, 2021 


Enterprise Storage Forum content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies improve automation and efficiency in data centers and storage infrastructures. Some AI-influenced networks and systems still require heavy human interaction, but recent advances in intelligence have increased the amount of work that artificial systems and machines can perform, as well as their accuracy. One of these innovations is formative artificial intelligence.
Up until now, artificial intelligence technology has largely used learned reasoning to automate tasks (like telling a storage node to increase capacity), detect potential threats or anomalies in systems and alert human administrators, or other jobs that it can be trained to do. Formative AI goes far beyond that by allowing computer systems to create digital content, rather than just refine existing processes. This new approach is so revolutionary that some experts are questioning Formative AI’s effect on the job market — even its effect on judicial systems.

AI in Storage and Data Centers

What Is Formative AI?
Formative AI is an emerging artificial intelligence technology that focuses on the ability of AI to generate and process accurate digital content. It first gained widespread attention when Gartner mentioned it in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2020 report. According to recent research, formative AI “dynamically adapts” to changes in systems and data.
Arguably, artificial intelligence is supposed to dynamically change depending on the input of data and the given situation; in this context, formative AI doesn’t sound like anything new. But both AI and machine learning require immense amounts of data input in order to analyze and develop an understanding of that data and how to utilize it. This learning process takes time. Formative AI makes much quicker adjustments based on rapid changes in systems, software, or infrastructure.
Formative AI poses possibilities for data centers and storage infrastructures, as well as networks, threat intelligence systems, and software development. Though it’s in its infancy, formative AI suggests greater intelligence and initiative from computing systems, which ideally will provide more automation and accuracy.
Formative AI doesn’t just have implications for the high-performance computing world. It promises to make content creation and technological designs easier. These possible applications include vehicle and machinery designs, graphic art, written text, or engineering diagrams—anything that a computer could realistically look at samples of and then design its own. Formative AI systems could even design realistic-looking human faces.

This premise is exciting for enterprises that want to fiercely compete in their industry by improving designs, whether those designs are digital (a mobile app, for instance) or physical (like a new part for a car). It also poses concerns, in an already uncomfortable job market, for employees who fear finding themselves ousted from their positions by some well-trained servers and software. 
Types of Formative AI
Formative AI encompasses augmented design and development, big data processing, and ontologies and graphs. However, here we’re covering two of the major fields of artificial intelligence in formative systems. They’ve received the computing community’s attention as possible uses for these artificial technologies become more widespread, relevant to many industries (not just tech).
Generative AI
Generative AI is content generation performed by artificially intelligent systems. This can include:

Photo editing (adding color or making updates where needed)
Visual art (such as prints) based on existing pieces
Video editing
Audio generation, including realistic vocal production and music composition
Text content and caption generation.

Generative AI is particularly promising for business fields such as content marketing and design — companies that require large, regular amounts of copy and visual marketing content will benefit from its automated design. It can also generate realistic-looking human faces, which don’t belong to any one person but resemble a photograph of a live human being. We’ll come back to this later.
One hard-to-picture advantage of generative artificial intelligence is its lack of human perception. Human understanding and bias sometimes places often-unrecognized limits on design: people just don’t always imagine what’s possible. But a generative computer system, which has none of those prior experiences, just uses volumes of data to craft potential designs. Generative AI opens the design world to ideas that people ordinarily might not imagine.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
A generative adversarial network is a type of machine learning that was originally developed by pitting two neural networks against each other in a game. One neural network is a generative network (similar to the AI discussed above) and the other is a discriminative network. The generator creates synthetic pieces of content, perhaps an image, and the discriminator must identify which content shown to it is generated or real. A discriminatory model receives input variables and must place them in the correct location, while a generative model creates an example.
The benefit of GANs is twofold: developing in networks the ability to generate realistic content (generative) and the ability to distinguish fake, or machine-created content. Each neural network sharpens the other; one improves in creating artificial work, while the other improves in telling the difference. The discriminatory network is important because formative AI, while useful, can be a source of fraud as well as legitimate business content creation.
Uses for Formative AI
New concept though it may be, some major corporations are already implementing or supporting formative AI technologies. These include IBM and NVIDIA. NVIDIA is using generative adversarial networks to train machines to perform predictive analytics from a synthetic set of data; it has also created an AI model that uses a limited pool of data to create synthetic artwork. IBM is researching how generative AI models can increase the discovery phase of drug design through virtual molecule creation.
Synthesis AI, a company that produces synthetic data and trains machines on it, has developed computer vision technology using generative AI. The company’s intent is to shift from heavy human supervised learning to a greater reliance on machines, which can identify images using generative AI and computer vision much more quickly. Camera applications can benefit from GANs, too: these networks learn to identify faces more accurately, which could improve surveillance techniques.
Potential Drawbacks and Dangers of Formative AI
Because generative networks can create realistic content, there is a risk that synthetic images, for example, can be used for fraud. Generative technology could eventually create synthetic video and photo content that falsifies real people. The use of deep learning to falsify people’s words or actions is called a deepfake. Security companies are already pointing out that this false content is a concern.
This isn’t a comprehensive overview of deepfakes or generative AI, but it raises some ethical issues:

A well-placed, falsified video or photo could ruin someone’s reputation. It could also be used politically, perhaps to influence voters.
AI has developed so quickly that lawmakers have had little time to keep up, so there aren’t yet many existing legal precedents for handling deepfakes when they come up.
Generative adversarial networks are designed to both create realistic content and locate synthetic content, so there’s a possibility for AI to be pitted against itself and detect false photos or images, too.

Fear of fraudulent content isn’t the working world’s only concern about AI, though. They’re afraid that eventually, artificial systems will remove their jobs. The era of artificial intelligence is not the first time a technological shift has drastically changed work habits: the Industrial Revolution caused myriad working-class adults, as well as children, to leave their home trades and work long, set factory shifts.
For at least the foreseeable future, generative technologies won’t change the job market that drastically. There are a couple of reasons:

Technology takes time to develop. The term “formative AI” was just officially coined by Gartner in mid-2020. Generative technologies are still in their relative infancy. Even once they make their way into every corner of industry, people will still be responsible for designing and learning generative design software and running those applications.
Though generative design and formative AI pose impressive potential benefits, no one knows how reliable they will be, especially in their infancy. If a generative computer system designs something that doesn’t work, there isn’t much anyone can do about it, other than start the process over.

Though it’s wise to consider the possible long-term effects of artificial intelligence on jobs as your career develops, formative and generative AI won’t usurp most positions just yet.
Artificial intelligence poses more legal issues than fraud, too. As it’s been implemented so quickly over the past decade or so, lawmakers struggle to keep up. Courts, then, have the challenge of applying existing laws to AI technologies, and manufacturers of intelligent computer systems can be held responsible for any broken regulations, according to Berkeley Law. However, generative systems, which will have greater autonomy in creating designs and will potentially have less relationship to humans, might be a bit more difficult to hold to judicial standards. 
AI in Storage and Data Centers
AI offers a variety of benefits for data centers and storage infrastructures. In addition to the automation of basic administrative and monitoring tasks, which removes burdens from IT professionals, intelligent systems can:

Shift storage volumes or workloads to locations where they can run most effectively
Detect problems, such as outages or network slowdowns, more quickly.
Create reports automatically when such problems arise.
Help with threat intelligence, alerting IT administration when strange trends arise.
Perform sensor data analytics once sensor data is uploaded to the cloud from remote locations.
Update and patch software.
Dynamically provision servers when they’re needed on short notice.

AI that both adds metadata to data and analyzes existing metadata is particularly important for object storage. In stores and lakes that hold large volumes of unstructured data, artificial intelligence can more efficiently sort or search identifying information about that data. AI and object storage are an important partnership; large organizations need object storage for both its scalability and its lower costs, and they’ll need intelligent automated systems to manage object-stored data.
Data and AI have a somewhat symbiotic relationship in modern data centers and big data applications: in most cases, intelligent systems and machine learning platforms require large volumes of data initially to be trained. But data science also needs AI and machine learning to extract the most relevant insights and implement them to improve storage and infrastructure. AI, predictive analytics, automation, and big data all go hand in hand.
Data lakes and object storage will be essential to the growth of generative design and formative AI technologies. They store massive amounts of structured and unstructured data, including large multimedia files, that machines need to learn how to create models and designs. In the rapidly-advancing development of formative artificial intelligence, data storage will play a crucial role.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  It can be difficult for financial institutions to keep up with the rapid changes in the digital marketing and advertising landscape. There are numerous factors which are susceptible to change, and they all have an effect on how useful certain marketing strategies are. As the internet and advertising evolve, some companies may find it important to consider an automated solution to driving efficiency in marketing. In this article, we cover two examples of AI-powered marketing applications. Each vendor that offers these applications provides evidence of success with their digital platform, and so we can infer that at least some financial institutions benefited from the adoption of these systems. The solutions we cover are: IBM Cognos Analytics: Formerly IBM Watson Analytics, this is IBM’s AI business intelligence platform. It is purportedly capable of helping financial institutions analyze advertising data to find the most successful marketing campaigns. AI-powered Analytics for Card-Linked Marketing: Cardlytics’ AI platform that can utilize transactional data from credit and debit cards to drive efficiency in targeted digital ads. The first AI marketing application we cover is IBM’s Cognos Analytics platform. IBM Cognos Analytics (Formerly Watson Analytics) Many AI applications for marketing agencies and internal marketing teams are advertised as business intelligence solutions. They focus on the ability to analyze large amounts of data at once and share the insights from that data across multiple user endpoints.  Additionally, offerings from larger companies may include the ability to take in data of various types and from various sources. A financial institution would simply need to run this type of analytics application using their advertising data, and they would be able to gain an understanding of which of their advertisements work the best. Another way this type of application could drive efficiency is in advertising expense reporting. Analysts require reports using the most recent data in order to gain an understanding of how well marketing campaigns are engaging customers.  If these reports take a considerable amount of time to produce, business leaders will be waiting even longer for their insights from the analysts. Automating this process can help financial institutions make the most important decisions faster.  We spoke to Sasha Caskey, CTO of Kasisto, about this on our podcast, AI in Banking. When asked about where he believes AI is actually driving value in banking and financial tasks, Caskey said: One of the places where AI has been the most impactful …  broadly and specifically around banking is really in taking over some of those mundane repetitive tasks that people have to do. … it’s able to shave off a layer of work that people have to do by essentially boiling down the problem to a set of numbers that people can look at make an informed decision about. This approach of freeing up human employees to make the kind of informed decisions marketing leaders need to daily could be an early driver of efficiency when adopting an AI solution. IBM is a vendor that offers this type of analytics application to clients in the financial industry and marketing agencies that work with banking and financial clients. Its software, Cognos Analytics, is an AI platform capable of data mining and predictive modeling. This means it is likely built with predictive analytics and a machine learning algorithm trained on advertising and engagement data. Below is a video that explains some capabilities available on the Cognos Analytics platform. The capabilities covered in this video include: Adding attributes to names of customers for more granular analysis Creating dashboards for readable visualizations of important insights Creating expense reports for review by management and human resources teams  IBM lists a case study on their website in which they claim to have helped IMM Marketing Agency utilize their clients’ numerous datasets in order to more accurately target their digital advertisements.  IMM purportedly buys thousands of internet advertisements every day, and so making sure they are properly targeted to the right demographics is a high priority.  Digital marketing teams may find difficulty in continually optimizing targeted advertisements because online customer behavior can be hard to keep track of and predict. This requires near-constant monitoring of responses to the advertisements and adapting their marketing styles for the next iteration.  IBM’s analytics solutions purportedly helped accomplish this by analyzing large amounts of data at a time and delivering records of conversion rates, impressions, and click-through rates for each digital advertisement.  This means analysts were able to gain a detailed understanding of the engagement rates of previous advertisements quickly before running their own more granular experiments. According to the case study, IMM was able to start savings tens of thousands of dollars simply by how fast they could now determine if a given advertisement approach was succeeding. IMM also claims they can use IBM’s analytics platform to bring up incremental sales and add more value in the ads their clients spend money on.  Additionally, marketing reports that purportedly once took 12 hours a day became available within 45 minutes. This would allow IMM’s analysts to focus more on finding the best next step from these insights rather than having to produce the reports themselves. AI-powered Analytics for Card-Linked Marketing Credit card companies and other financial institutions can use spending behavior and other customer information for data science and machine learning projects for marketing and promotional offers.  One way they could accomplish this is to use historical credit and debit card data to better individualize targeted deals from marketing companies. Customers would then receive targeted ads for products they are more likely to purchase. One could broadly describe this technique as “card-linked marketing.”Cardlytics is a vendor that sells this type of AI application to credit card companies and financial institutions. Their software uses customer segments called “purchasegraphics” to match customers with deals they are more likely to take. Purchasegraphics are customer segments, or “demographics,” based on spending data including when the customers spend money and on which products.The company also claims their AI solutions are built to prioritize the privacy of customers’ sensitive information while maintaining accurate targeted ads. There are many factors that can affect which deals are matched with which customer or their associated purchase graphic. These include age, gender, time of year, geolocational data, the types of products purchased, and if these products follow previous purchase behavior.  These demographics are later analyzed for their shopping and financial habits which help the software create new segments of customers that are similar based on what they spend money on.All of these factors are important to enabling card-linked marketing as targeted ads can perturb some customers especially while they are handling their funds.  If customers feel too bombarded with ads that don’t relate to their needs or desires, they may feel less comfortable with using the app or other platform the client financial institution is using. For example, this could contribute to banking customers losing loyalty to their current bank and opening accounts elsewhere. Customer segmentation based on spending behavior can allow banks and credit card companies to focus on the most important criteria within customer data that point to effective targeted ads. This method enables more granular customer matching which can also utilize spending data from credit and debit card swipes.  Each transaction creates a data trail about where the customer spent money, at which merchant, and possibly the names of the products purchased. This may allow a machine learning algorithm to better match customers with offers based on their most recent spending behavior. A financial institution will not need to build any hard rules for their software to recognize differences in individuals when analyzing demographic signifiers. This is because a machine learning model for these applications would not necessarily need prior training to discern that some items are family products such as baby food and diapers.  This is the same for products marketed toward a specific gender such as soaps and razors. The software can come to these conclusions through the implications of their spending habits. However, many people shop for others that they live with. This is why a machine learning model does not make hard determinations about gender, and instead moves individual customers toward an implicit gender.  It is apparent that Carldytics aims to never share personal information from a banking customer with the retailers from which they are getting their marketing information from. Cardlytics’ platform sends performance reports from the client bank’s database to the company’s front-facing marketing team. This team then communicates that information with the retailers.  The retailers most likely use this data to create new marketing strategies, which they can submit back to Cardlytics and be matched to the best customer segment.Cardlytics lists a press release on their website which refers to a case study Celent conducted regarding Bank of America’s “BankAmeriDeals” marketing program. The case study purportedly states that Bank of America became a user of the Cardlytics platform which uses spending data from about 70% of American households. The study also indicated how retailers can reliably dedicate a portion of their marketing budgets on card-linked marketing initiatives and see significant ROI. This could mean that companies looking to target their digitally literate customers in a profitable way may want to look further into use cases for these types of AI applications.   Header Image Credit: Altran Related Posts Big Data in Finance - Current Applications and TrendsInternational Data Corporation (IDC) reported in their  Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Spending Guide… AI in SupTech (Supervisory Technology) - Current Finance ApplicationsWe have identified three areas in finance where companies are applying AI to solve real… AI for Sentiment Analysis in Finance - Current Applications and PossibilitiesSome financial institutions have begun investing in departments that focus on artificial intelligence and machine… AI for Cybersecurity in Finance - Current ApplicationsIn 2017, Equifax’s systems were compromised by hackers, and the data of over 143 million… AI in Building Automation - Current ApplicationsIn our previous report, we covered the current use cases for AI in construction and… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  AI-Enabled Financial Report Automation for Finance LeadersCo-created by YSEOP and Emerj.

Like many states, Wisconsin struggled to process torrents of unemployment insurance claims precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but officials said Thursday they finally cleared a mammoth backlog with the use of AI technology from Google Cloud.
Amy Pechacek, who heads the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, told StateScoop she contracted the work just several weeks after Gov. Tony Evers nominated her last September. A former deputy secretary at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections with experience in crisis management in two Wisconsin county governments, Pechacek said she was immediately struck by the severity of the agency’s operational shortcomings as she sized up a 770,000-claim backlog.
“We are using a 50-year-old mainframe COBOL system,” Pechacek said. “It is literally the black screen with the green blinky cursor where you have to press F5 to navigate. I couldn’t even believe it. I fell off my chair.”
‘It’s insane’

To zero out the backlog, Pechacek said officials handed off historical data to Google so it could train a machine-learning model. The company used it to analyze the state’s backlog and applied “confidence scores” to each application, indicating how likely it was that a given application should be approved or forwarded to human agents for possible rejection.
Beyond operating an aged system powered by an outmoded programming language, Pechacek said, the agency’s operations were also slowed by an absence of any secure form of digital communication with the public. If the workforce agency needed additional documents for a claim, the applicant had two options: regular mail or fax. And as the state paid out billions in benefits, she said, mail poured into “a huge mailroom” for processing, with hundreds of state workers manually entering information into computers.
“You could just see how inefficient this was,” Pechacek said. “This just adds delays, delays, delays. And I don’t know about you, but I haven’t seen a fax machine in 20 years. It’s insane.”
She added that those with questions about their applications can call and talk to someone, but the hours are limited — the call center has to shut down before the mainframe begins batch processing claims at 6 p.m. each day.
But Google helped the state with that, too, developing an online portal allowing the agency to accept photos and documents — basic functionality in 2021 that Pechacek admitted seems ridiculous to celebrate, but that constitutes “a victory” nonetheless.

No more ‘jargon and legalese’
The upgrades also included a rewrite of the state’s application, formerly a confusing 100-question document that Pechacek said she herself completed to see what it was like and failed to answer some of the questions correctly.
“It was full of jargon and legalese and acronyms that were undefined,” she said. “They were counterintuitive, illogical and it was understandable why people were answering the way they were because they were just written very poorly, so we just went through and rewrote the whole thing.”
Google analyzed which questions were tripping people up most frequently so when officials rewrote the questions — in clear, plain language, Pechacek said — they knew where to focus their efforts.
Pechacek said she hired Google after seeing it perform similar for work for Arizona, and said the speed — just a few weeks — with which they deployed solutions for Wisconsin was “fantastic.”

Processing claims quickly has been a balancing act for states as they’ve sought to serve legitimate applicants as quickly as possible while also screening out fraud, which spiked during the pandemic. And Google helped Wisconsin screen for fraud, too, Pechacek said, in several ways.
Applicants are required to authenticate their identities through LexisNexis, which puts the user through questions about their credit history. And Google’s technology screens application data — including IP addresses from abroad or whether the same bank account is used on more than one application — so officials can investigate any claims that look fishy.
While Google’s work relieved Wisconsin of its heavy claims backlog, the legacy mainframe system with its “blinky cursor” remains. Evers signed legislation in January authorizing the workforce department to find a vendor for a modern replacement, and Pechacek said applications for that procurement closed last week. Officials have estimated that project could cost as much as $100 million, but Pechacek said the bright side is that the department is planning for an iterative migration to a cloud-based system that’s followed by yearly reviews of the platform. 
“This is going to be part of our manual review so that Wisconsin never finds itself again with 50-year-old technology because modernization is just something that we are just in a constant state of moving forward,” she said.

Artificial intelligence will be key in that effort by analyzing data and assisting commanders in the decision-making process.The announcement, released by the command’s Artificial Intelligence Integration Center, said the service is “particularly” interested in AI research of autonomous ground and air platforms, “which must operate in open, urban and cluttered environments.” The document specifically asks for research into technologies that allow for robots or autonomous systems to move in urban, contested environments, as well as technologies that reduce the electromagnetic profile of the systems. It also wants to know more about AI that can sense obscure targets and understand terrain obstacles.The document identifies several needs pertaining to data analysis over the next five years. The Army is interested in human-machine interfacing research and needs additional research in ways it can predict an adversary’s intent and behavior on the battlefield. In the same category, the Army wants to be able to fuse data from disparate sources and have analytical capabilities to “exploit” classified and unclassified sources to make “enhanced” intelligence products.The Army also wants to be able to combine human insight with machine analysis and develop improved ways of “efficiently” conveying analytics results to humans.“The Army is interested in AI/ML research in areas which can reduce the cognitive burden on humans and improve overall performance through human-machine teaming,” the announcement read.Similarly, the Army needs more research over the next five years into how to better display data to humans. Data must be presented clearly to users — through charts or graphs, for example — so they can understand what the information means.“The Army is interested in research that enables improved situational awareness and the visualization and navigation of large data sets to enhance operational activities and training and readiness,” the announcement read. Along that same vein, the service is also seeking novel ways of visualizing sensor data and large data sets with multiple sources.The service also wants more research into AI for sensing on the battlefield, including detecting people, equipment and weapons, even when obscured. It wants to sense these targets based on “physical, behavioral, cyber or other signatures.” Additionally, the Army wants AI-enabled sensors and processors that can detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats.Network and communications security is another area in which the Army wants more research. The service is seeking more research into autonomous network defense and AI-based approaches to offensive cyber capabilities. It also wants novel cyber protection technologies and methods.Additionally, to prepare for potential GPS-denied environments of the future, the Army is interested in research into algorithms and techniques to fuse sources of position, navigation and timing to provide “robust” capabilities.The Internet of Things, or the massive network of devices connected to the internet, presents more artificial intelligence needs for the Army. According to the solicitation, the service is interested in AI research into “new approaches to enable secure, resilient, and automatically managed IoT networks in highly complex, mixed cooperative/adversarial, information-centric environments.”“The Army needs to better integrate a wide range of capabilities and equipment and capitalize on commercial developments in industrial and human IoT,” the solicitation said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

Data is certainly the fuel for AI. Yet there is a source of valuable data that usually does not garner much attention. It is from mainframe systems. They hold enormous amounts of data—which go back decades—for mission critical operations.


But then again, there are difficulties working with mainframes and AI. “The biggest challenge is the lack of compatibility of emerging technologies,” said Chida Sadayappan, who is the Cloud AI/ML Offering Leader at Deloitte Consulting LLP.

But the benefits of AI are too important to ignore. So what can be done? Well, one strategy is for leveraging cloud platforms outside of the mainframe environment. 

“New approaches to cloud migration replace the traditional ETL (extract, transform, load) approach with a more modern ELT (extract, load, transform) approach that moves mainframe formatted data directly to any object storage target before using the target platform to transform it for use in AI applications,” said Gil Peleg, who is the CEO of Model9. “This pioneering method adds mainframe data to data lakes quickly, easily, and securely so leaders can maximize the ROI of their cloud BI and analytics applications.”

PROMOTED
But like any IT effort, there needs to be a clear-cut plan and the goals must be achievable. The reality is that AI efforts can take considerable time to generate ROI.
“Companies should be aware that these types of initiatives don’t always cut costs,” said Sudhir Kesavan, who is the Global Head of Cloud Transformation at  Wipro FullStride Cloud Services. “They may have the opposite effect, so having them be business-led can help overcome the challenge of business benefits seeming less tangible to start.”
IBM Mainframes and AI
The capabilities of mainframes have been evolving quickly. For example, IBM has been retooling its Z system for AI and this has involved the integration with many common open source platforms like Spark, PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Leveraging AI For Mainframe Environments
The power of AI for mainframes does not have to be about creating projects. For example, there are emerging AIOps tools that help automate the systems. Some of the benefits include improved performance and availability, increased support speed for application releases and the DevOps process, and the proactive identification of issues. Such benefits can be essential since it is increasingly more difficult to attract qualified IT professionals.
According to a recent survey from Forrester and BMC, about 81% of the respondents indicated that they rely partially on manual processes when dealing with slowdowns and 75% said they use manual labor for diagnosing multisystem incidents. In other words, there is much room for improvement—and AI can be a major driver for this.
“Mainframe decision makers are becoming more aware than ever that the traditional way of handling mainframe operations will soon fall by the wayside,” said John McKenny, who is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intelligent Z Optimization and Transformation at BMC. “The demand for newer, faster digital services has placed increased pressure on data centers to keep up as new applications come online, the volume of data handled continually increases, and workloads become increasingly unpredictable. In today's fast-paced digital economy, this creates a perfect storm of higher customer expectations, faster implementation of an increasing number of digital services, and a more tightly connected mainframe supported by a less-experienced workforce.”

Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men sipping a cocktail? Or perhaps trendy people swapping catch phrases in a converted warehouse?'Well, more of the creative work these days is not being done by humans at all.When Dixons Carphone wanted to push shoppers towards its Black Friday sale, the company turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) software and got the winning line ""The time is now"".Saul Lopes, head of customer marketing at Dixons Carphone, thinks it worked because it didn't have the words Black Friday in it.His human copywriters had produced dozens of potentially successful sentences but they all mentioned Black Friday. It was technology that broke this chain of thought.PhraseeParry Malm wanted to add some science to the art of advertisingThe software in question is from Phrasee, whose boss is Parry Malm, a Canadian who moved to the UK in 2006. Working in marketing he assumed the technology existed to boost human creativity. He describes himself as ""flummoxed"" that this wasn't available. Phrasee, the company he set up in 2015, is the product of Mr Malm's perplexed reaction.""Getting the right message had been left to the Mad Men type characters. But I wanted to apply scientific rigour to those messages,"" he explains.Standard copywriting takes place through a process of editing, argument and approval. Mr Malm says Phrasee does the same thing using a technique called Deep Learning, a vast network of parameters and pre-set limits that guide the programme in the right direction. This allows it to bounce a slogan around, ranking its impact against raw data gleaned from many sources.Getty ImagesHow many of these adverts in Time Square, New York, will eventually be generated thanks to AI?At Rapp, an agency that packages products and services into messages and videos that appeal to the public, Phrasee absorbs a million emails that have been fired off over the years. Then it reassembles those sentences into new messages while adding guidance from Rapp's own writers, technologists and social media experts. Phrasee builds up models that generate words appropriate to each product and the target audience of consumers. Language that has featured in previous campaigns is poured into the Deep Learning model which applies values based on factors such as the look, feel or taste of a product.Mr Lopes knows that in an age of information overload consumers are becoming harder to reach as online sales patter diminishes their appetite for any message. As Phrasee comes armed with a terrific linguistic arsenal and is divorced from the individual points of view that shape the words of human copywriters he thinks it suits our jaded eyes.Dixons Carphone still employs agencies and copywriters, but they come up with an idea which Phrasee then adapts, finessing the human perspective.For a recent Dixons Carphone campaign Mr Lopes used Phrasee to create variations on messages derived from a decade of sales campaigns. ""What surprises me is that we still see wild cards leaping out from the list of messages it generates."" Festival of MarketingThe human brain can't process thousands of options says Saul Lopes, head of customer marketing at Dixons CarphoneThat Black Friday message was one such wild card. Working online, Dixons Carphone gets rapid consumer feedback and quickly saw how well ""The time is now"" was going down with the public.   Copywriters shouldn't fear that AI is about to take their job, says Mr Lopes, because they are still needed to get the ball rolling. ""But the human brain can't look at thousands of options. Our writing team sets out the strategy for the messages, we haven't replaced them."" He's convinced about this AI future. ""Combining creative people with AI is the next step for the agencies. It's not AI versus the human, it generates creative thought.""More Technology of BusinessWhat is solarpunk and can it help save the planet?The fungus and bacteria tackling plastic wasteCan more tech make video meetings less excruciating?What does a future-proof home look like?The little tech firm gunning for an airspeed recordThis might come as a relief to Ogilvy, the agency founded by advertising legend David Ogilvy. His name invokes brilliant and witty campaigns that inspired generations of copywriters, and today Ogilvy bills itself as the ""teaching hospital of advertising"". It boasts a behavioural science practice ran by its vice-chairman and veteran copywriter Rory Sutherland. He's a fan of new thinking, but only if it doesn't dampen the spark of creativity that sets consumers' desires alight. ""AI can't hurt if it generates interesting suggestions,"" Mr Sutherland concedes, ""but it's like satnav in a car. Great for directions but you don't allow it to drive the car!"" Dolly ClewOgilvy vice-chairman and veteran copywriter Rory SutherlandHe worries that AI will be steered into agencies by ""bean counters"" and has railed against an ""alliance between technology and finance"" that uses innovation as a cost-cutting tool regardless of the opportunities that get lost in the process. ""These things tend to be viewed through an efficiency lens."" Advertising, Mr Sutherland declares, ""is about producing something distinctive. It's not a production line."" Programmes like Phrasee can mirror a copywriter's work on an industrial scale. This, a digital factory for ads, is Mr Sutherland's worst nightmare. ""My only reservation about using AI is that people will afford it more power and influence than it deserves in an attempt to automate things, to realise the Fordist dream of multiple copies rolling off an assembly line."" In support of the creative human element he cites great advertising slogans that have been fine-tuned by critical voices from beyond the copywriter's desk. After 30 years as a copywriter Mr Sutherland is always ready to listen to someone who spots that a word or image may have the wrong connotation in another culture. If AI can be that third party source of constructive criticism it has a home in his world. But he definitely won't allow it a deciding vote. ""As a stimulus, suggesting ideas, it has a great future. As a source of judgement it's dubious."" Back at Dixons Carphone, Mr Lopes and his team keep trying to outsmart the software. They hold competitions to see who can guess what the winning line from Phrasee will be. ""It's an internal game, we do it just before we push every new message out,"" he says. ""And we always lose to the computer!""Artificial intelligenceAdvertising",http://schema.org,ReportageNewsArticle,Why artificial intelligence is being used to write adverts,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F3B/production/_119799830_gettyimages-607654776.jpg'}",2021-08-05T23:06:00.000Z,2021-08-05T23:06:00.000Z,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57781557,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Michael Dempsey'}]",,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57781557,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F3B/production/_119799830_gettyimages-607654776.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But despite what is a first in India, the decision is likely to be challenged, according to the other co-author




 
 
  For the first time ever in India, the copyright office has recognised an artificial intelligence tool – RAGHAV Artificial Intelligence Painting App – as the co-author of a copyright-protected artistic work. 
  Ankit Sahni, an IP lawyer who owns the AI-based app, is the other author and is registered as the copyright owner. He commissioned the painting in question, ‘Suryast’ (see image below), and even believes that India might be the first country to have acknowledged AI-authorship in a copyrighted work.

  Sahni had filed two copyright applications for two AI-generated artworks, claiming himself as the owner. The copyright office rejected the first application, which listed RAGHAV as the sole author. The second application, on which both Sahni and the AI were named as co-authors, was granted registration in November 2020.







  The copyright registration was a part of classified submissions made by Sahni to the Indian Parliamentary Standing Committee on “protecting AI-created work as well as AI itself”.  
  Sahni has now decided to speak to Managing IP as the committee published its report on July 23, even though it did not reveal details of the registration.
  RAGHAV stands for robust artificially intelligent graphics and art visualizer, and is named after Raghav Gupta, a machine learning engineer who developed the app in 2019 in a funded project for Sahni.
  In an exclusive interview with Managing IP, Sahni lauded the steps taken by the copyright office as bold and forward-looking.
  “While the existing legislation has its own set of limitations, the act of granting recognition to an AI program as co-author of an artistic work marks the beginning of an era of change that governments across the world will be working on.”
  However, he anticipates that the registration may be challenged in court due to ambiguity in the legislation and jurisprudence.
  Several jurisdictions worldwide do not yet recognise AI authorship under copyright law. In India, the provisions of the Copyright Act are unclear about who can claim authorship of an AI-created work that did not involve any human input, said Sahni.
  RAGHAV is trained in various art styles and used Vincent van Gogh’s painting ‘Starry Night’ and a photograph taken by Sahni as base datasets to create the copyrighted painting. 
  Gupta believes that AI-delivered output is often on par with, if not better than, human creations.
  “Rendering protection to creations by AI will go a long way in recognising and protecting the interests of those who develop such AI applications, and will ensure that they are appropriately incentivised.”
  In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee recommended a review of the existing Patents Act and Copyright Act to incorporate AI and AI-related inventions.
  The news comes just a week after South Africa became the first country to issue a patent designating an AI tool – DABUS – as the inventor.

The typical Australian will change careers five to seven times during their professional lifetime, by some estimates. And this is likely to increase as new technologies automate labor, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold.
Jobs disappearing is not a new phenomenon – have you seen an elevator operator recently? – but the pace of change is picking up, threatening to leave large numbers of workers unemployed and unemployable.
New technologies also create new jobs, but the skills they require do not always match the old jobs. Successfully moving between jobs requires making the most of your current skills and acquiring new ones, but these transitions can falter if the gap between old and new skills is too large.
We have built a system to recommend career transitions, using machine learning to analyze more than 8 million online job ads to see what moves are likely to be successful. The details are published in PLOS ONE.

For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*Our system starts by measuring similarities between the skills required by each occupation. For example, an accountant could become a financial analyst because the required skills are similar, but a speech therapist might find it harder to become a financial analyst as the skill sets are quite different.
Next, we looked at a large set of real-world career transitions to see which way around these transitions usually go: accountants are more likely to become financial analysts than vice versa.
Finally, our system can recommend a career change that’s likely to succeed – and tell you what skills you may need to make it work.
Measure the similarity of occupations
Our system uses a measure economists call “revealed comparative advantage” (RCA) to identify how important an individual skill is to a job, using online job ads from 2018. The map below visualizes the similarity of the top 500 skills. Each marker represents an individual skill, colored according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills.

The similarity between the top 500 skills in Australian job ads in 2018. Highly similar skills cluster together.
Once we know how similar different skills are, we can estimate how similar different professions are based on the skills required. The figure below visualizes the similarity between Australian occupations in 2018.
Each marker shows an individual occupation, and the colors depict the risk each occupation faces from automation over the next two decades (blue shows low risk and red shows high risk). Visibly similar occupations are grouped closely together, with medical and highly skilled occupations facing the lowest automation risk.

The similarity between occupations, colored by technological automation risk.
Mapping transitions
We then took our measure of similarity between occupations and combined it with a range of other labor market variables, such as employment levels and education requirements, to build our job transition recommender system.
Our system uses machine learning techniques to “learn” from real job transitions in the past and predict job movements in the future. Not only does it achieve high levels of accuracy (76%), but it also accounts for asymmetries between job transitions. Performance is measured by how accurately the system predicts whether a transition occurred, when applied to historic job transitions.
The full transitions map is big and complicated, but you can see how it works below in a small version that only includes transitions between 20 occupations. In the map, the “source” occupation is shown on the horizontal axis and the “target” occupation on the vertical axis.
If you look at a given occupation at the bottom of the map, the column of squares shows the probability of moving from that occupation to the one listed at the right-hand side. The darker the square, the higher the probability of making the transition.

Artificial intelligence-powered job recommendations
Sometimes a new career requires developing new skills, but which skills? Our system can help identify those. Let’s take a look at how it works for “domestic cleaners”, an occupation where employment has shrunk severely during COVID-19 in Australia.

New occupations and skills recommendations made by the Job Transitions Recommender System for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ – a ‘non-essential’ occupation that has experienced significant declines during the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia.
First, we use the transitions map to see which occupations it is easiest for a domestic cleaner to transition to. The colors split occupations by their status during the COVID-19 crisis – blue occupations are “essential” jobs that can continue to operate during lockdown, and red are “non-essential”.
We identify top recommended occupations, as seen on the right side of the flow diagram (bottom half of the image), sorted in descending order by transition probability. The width of each band in the diagram shows the number of openings available for each occupation. The segment colors represent whether the demand has increased or decreased compared with the same period of 2019 (pre-COVID).
The first six transition recommendations for are all “non-essential” services, which have unsurprisingly experienced decreased demand. However, the seventh is “aged and disabled carers”, which is classified as “essential” and grew significantly in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period.
Since your prospects of finding work are better if you transition to an occupation in high demand, we select “aged and disabled carers” as the target occupation for this example.
What skills to develop for new occupations
Our system can also recommend skills that workers need to develop to increase their chances of a successful transition. We argue that a worker should invest in developing the skills most important to their new profession and which are most different from the skills they currently have.
For a “domestic cleaner”, the top-recommended skills needed to transition to “aged and disabled carer” are specialized patient care skills, such as “patient hygiene assistance”.
On the other hand, there’s less need to develop unimportant skills or ones that are highly similar to skills from your current occupation. Skills such as “business analysis” and “finance” are of low importance for an “aged and disabled carer”, so they should not be prioritized. Similarly, skills such as “ironing” and “laundry” are required for the new job but it is likely that a “domestic cleaner” already possesses these skills (or can easily acquire them).
The benefit of smoother job transitions
While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises and other factors will continue to shift labor demands, causing workers to move between jobs.
If labor transitions occur efficiently, there are significant productivity and equity benefits for everyone. If transitions are slow, or fail, it will have significant costs for both individuals and the state and the individual. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.

What better time for a “next-generation” version of art to come crashing into the art world than 2021? After all, this is the unprecedented year that saw an explosion of demand and sales of NFTs or non-fungible tokens, which are inextricably tied to crypto-currency and blockchain technology. Specifically, we’re now talking about art created by “artficial intelligence”… yes, the machines are taking over art too.
In 2018, Christie’s sold Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), the first-ever original work of art created using artificial intelligence to come to auction (it sold for $432,500 against a high estimate of $10,000), Inspired by reports of the sale, Ben Kovalis and two like-minded childhood friends from Israel, Eyal Fisher and Guy Haimovitz, launched the Art AI Gallery one year later, in late 2019. It involves collections of curated work made using an algorithm that was created over the course of six months and then refined over the next year and a half.
The Christie’s auction “was amazing to us because we are enthusiastic about art but also tech savvy,” Kovalis told Artnet News in a phone interview from London. He and his friends were stunned first by the fact that AI could create art and then by the fact that it could garner the type of price it did, he said.
“We were enthusiastic. We were already speaking about opening a startup company together—which is the dream of every Israeli guy between the ages of 20 and 30,” he said with a laugh.
Last month, the group introduced Artifly, which takes its algorithm development work a step further. Customers scroll through a selection of artwork and click the designs they like, in order to “show Artifly your style.” Then, the user clicks a button reading “Make My Art,” Artifly (the name of which is meant to evoke the phrase “Art on the Fly”) becomes familiar with your selections—and then near instantly, in about a minute, it creates a brand-new personalized artwork. The user then has the option, though not the obligation, to buy a bespoke piece of AI art.
Obvious Art’s ??? ? ??? ? ?? [??? ? (?))] + ?? [???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, Generative Adversarial Network print on canvas (2018).This genre of AI-created art is arguably far less challenging to wrap one’s head around than some other recent digital art trends, Whereas collectors been paying tens of millions of dollars for extremely difficult-to-understand blockchain-based digital assets at auction recently, Artifly’s prices are quite modest (as low as $29 for a stretched unframed canvas) and you are at least getting a tangible art object to own and hang on the wall. In addition, Artifly gives each buyer a certificate of authenticity which is registered on the blockchain via Verisart, a tech company that provides art certification services.
At the time of the 2018 auction of Obvious, Fisher was working on image processing and analysis for his PhD in mathematical genomics at Cambridge University. He was inspired by the headlines about the Christie’s sale to start working on algorithms.

“He thought that he could create an algorithm that would make way more beautiful and very engaging art,” says Kovalis. “The idea is not to create a single one and sell it for $100,000 but to create thousands and tens of thousands of them and still keep them one of a kind, so anyone can enjoy them.” 
Kovalis has extensive background in e-commerce, having formerly been a VP in the high-tech sector, managing large international operations.
The company founders say that the most common question they face is, “so you want to replace human artists with robots?” Kovalis has a readymade response: “Definitely not—first of all because we don’t think that it is possible to replace artists. This is simply something that enhances art.” He also emphasizes just how much human effort is still required for the process. “You need a lot of sweat, and tears and human involvement to make an AI algorithm that creates something beautiful.”

He compares the use of AI to musicians starting to use synthesizers in the 1980s to create a new type of music. “Not everyone liked the synthesizer. Many did, many didn’t, but it developed into something that helped create pop music. Today, music is the same music that we know and love, it just has some technology in it. This is the same thing that we’re doing with art.”
As for cost, the prices of the works hover around a few hundred dollars at most. It remains to be seen whether a secondary or resale market develops based on the individual certificates of authenticity that can accompany such transactions. And it also remains to be seen whether or not values begin to creep up as they do over time for works sold by galleries and auction houses.

For many people, Kovalis says, there is a learning curve when it comes to becoming comfortable with AI-created art. “People can be a bit scared at first. They know about self-driving cars, but seeing an AI that creates art is the wild frontier.”

Artificial intelligence is probably the less accurate of all.When the founding fathers of AI met in 1956 to find a name for the field, the objective they had in mind was creating a machine with human-like intelligence, behavior, and even sentience. An artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, at that time neither hardware, software, nor data science were mature enough to achieve that goal. They were naive into thinking AGI was easily attainable.Nowadays, the promises of AI and the dreams and desires of its founders are largely forgotten. We’re creating effective systems that are good at extracting patterns from data to make predictions. But we’re not aiming at building AGI anymore (at least most of the research and projects aren’t). Yet, the field is still called artificial intelligence.It’s a catchy concept. I even like writing down the words “artificial intelligence.” It sounds like we’re creating the future as in the sci-fi stories from Asimov’s books. What would happen if we changed the name now?

Oregon Health & Science University is part of a new National Science Foundation-funded institute to develop artificial intelligence systems to help people live independently as they age. (OHSU)

Oregon Health & Science University is one of five universities nationwide to form a new National Science Foundation-funded institute to design and build intelligent systems to help people age in place.
The five-year, $20 million grant will support the creation of an AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups, or AI-Caring. The institute will develop artificial intelligence systems that work for aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Most older adults prefer to remain in their own homes. But safety concerns, medication schedule and isolation can all make it difficult for them to do so.
The work builds on a model OHSU established more than a decade ago through its Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, or ORCATECH. In this research, participants agree to permit the ORCATECH system to collect unique life data in their homes, using an array of sensors to assess changes in gait, sleep and overall activity. It also includes a “MedTracker” electronic pill box as well as a scale to measure weight, body fat and pulse.
“Our project is focused on assisting people to age independently and in particular people who might develop cognitive impairment later in life,” said OHSU site leader Jeffrey Kaye, M.D., director of the OHSU Layton Aging & Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “ORCATECH has unique datasets that will allow the new institute to develop and create advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to help people age in place.”
OHSU has developed terabytes of privacy-protected data that will be useful for the new institute.
“We’re very honored and pleased to be partners in this national effort,” Kaye said. “We look forward to collaborating with other investigators, who will help advance our home assessment platform and the artificial intelligence. The goal is to make better diagnoses and ultimately mediate disabilities in aging.”
Given the staggering costs of long-term care services for people who can no longer live independently, estimated to top $1 trillion by 2050 to care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, Kaye said the new institute is an important step toward developing solutions.
“Our goal is to create systems that help people take care of people,” said Beth Mynatt, director of the Institute for People and Technology at Georgia Tech, the lead institution for the new project. “Care can be a complicated task, requiring coordination and decision-making across family members managing day to day demands.”
Aside from OHSU and Georgia Tech, the institute will include faculty from Carnegie Mellon University, Oregon State University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Amazon and Google are industry sponsors.

Like all merger and acquisition lawyers, Wei Chen spent much of her formative years on due diligence patrol — mining thousands of contract pages to find the few clauses needed for legal analysis.
“The process hasn’t evolved since I started practicing over 20 years ago: it’s time-consuming, mind-numbing, and prone to errors,” Chen laments. “Two years ago, with the success of artificial intelligence (AI), I kept asking myself, ‘If my iPhone can find cat pictures from my photo albums, why can’t AI find the most favored nation or exclusivity clauses in my piles of contracts?’” 
Senior vice president and associate general counsel at Salesforce, Chen soon realized that the secret to AI success lies in the volume and quality of training data. “For AI to perform better on contract review, lawyers were needed to tag contracts and make them publicly available for free,” she says. 
But given that highly trained legal minds are needed for such a task — and that most contracts are confidential and proprietary — how to open source them through skilled lawyers willing to tag contracts for free? 
Berkeley Center for Law and Business Executive Director Adam Sterling ’13
Chen found her answer after conferring with Adam Sterling ’13, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Business (BCLB), where she serves on the advisory board. Sterling connected her with a dozen eager Berkeley Law students, leading to an experimental pilot program that launched the Atticus Project (opens in a new tab) — a nonprofit that harnesses AI’s power to accelerate accurate and efficient contract review — in summer 2020. 
“The Atticus Project is defining the future of technology in the legal profession and I was so excited for the opportunity to allow Berkeley Law students to be a part of that,” Sterling says. 
Working under the supervision of experienced attorneys, the students released a beta dataset of 200 commercial contracts in October 2020. Sterling subsequently introduced Chen to two UC Berkeley AI researchers, which opened the floodgates.
“With their help, we were able to open source a training dataset in March 2021 with over 13,000 clauses across 510 commercial contracts, corresponding to 40 types of clauses,” Chen says. “We hope this dataset will be a catalyst for legal AI innovations and move the industry forward for all.”
The Atticus Project team tags the contracts’ key clauses, exports them into a csv file (similar to a spreadsheet) computers can read, and downloads the full contracts into txt files. The team wrote a user’s manual and datasheet explaining what the dataset contains, how to use it, and what limitations and biases it may have, and posted the package on its website and for free public download.
A broader reach 
Recently, The Atticus Project partnered with BCLB and the LexLab at UC Hastings Law to launch two programs — one for experienced attorneys and the other for law students. 
The former gives lawyers the chance to design a project to solve data-related legal challenges, create training programs, teach at participating law schools, and mentor law students. The latter offers law students and non-legal professionals the chance to learn vital legal concepts and find them in legal documents under experienced attorney supervision. 
“Unless lawyers get their hands dirty to create training datasets, legal AI will never get to an accuracy level that we need,” Chen says. “There’s already a huge divide between the AI performance in areas such as law and medicine where skilled labor is scarce versus areas where training datasets are abundant or cheap to obtain, like image and voice recognition or Wikipedia. Unless the legal industry catches up quickly, legal will continue to live in the Stone Age while other areas take off.”
The Atticus Project has trained over 60 law students and 15 high school students on contract review skills and AI knowledge, including six from Berkeley Law this past summer. Experienced attorneys from approximately 10 leading law firms and several public company in-house legal departments served as volunteer lecturers and reviewers, discussing complex legal topics that students encounter during their contract review.
With the law students’ help, The Atticus Project developed a comprehensive reservoir of high-quality training materials. Students start their learning journeys by taking a self-paced online course on Berkeley Canvas that contains over 50 training modules with presentations and videos by practicing attorneys and AI researchers. 
Chris Gronseth ’22
That learning is then reinforced by over 20 self-graded quizzes and a 200-plus page handbook created by the attorneys. The students are then tasked with finding the key concepts in contracts and tagging them using an online tool. The process includes individual student review, group peer review of the work product, and attorney supervisor oversight and feedback. 
Students also had access to office hours for questions, career talks, and OCI interview preparation to establish meaningful conversations with the supervising attorneys beyond contract review.
“I had previously only heard ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘machine learning’ as buzz-wordy terms used to describe a dystopian future of work,” says Chris Gronseth ’22, who worked with the Atticus Project in summer 2020. “ I was excited to get hands-on experience in learning more about what AI really entails and how it might be a positive and useful tool in legal work. The fast-paced, startup dynamic at Atticus provides a lot of room for creativity and initiative.” 
Chen’s team is busy creating a new training dataset of legal contracts that she plans to open source in early 2022. She foresees AI extending into more areas of legal research and consumer protection, such as scanning a credit card agreement for predatory clauses or scouring a privacy policy to assess compliance with the law.
“AI can enhance and supplement an expert’s knowledge by leaps and bounds,” Chen says. “Knowledge that requires years of training and apprenticeship can be obtained within a few short months. In the very near future, a lawyer not knowing how to leverage AI would be the same as a brain surgeon not aided by CT-scan or a farmer not having access to weather reports.”

Artificial Intelligence on the Battlefield
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making systems and conventional solutions of the military is no longer surprising. What is eye-opening, however, is the possibility of using it without human supervision. When Deep Blue computer won a chess game against world champion Garry Kasparov in New York City in 1997, most experts perceived this event as a sign that AI is catching up with human intelligence.

Wall-Defender is a computer game that only older readers or die-hard fans of retro games may remember. Created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 platform, the game allowed the player to take on the role of a fortress defense commander. An 8-bit processor, 128 bytes of RAM, and technical limitations related to graphics display left a lot of room for the player’s imagination. Today’s computers, equipped with incomparably more powerful processors and graphics chips can do much more. A “Wall-Defender” in 2021 does not display a bunch of pixels simulating an enemy, leaving the battle with a virtual opponent to the player. The “Wall-Defender” in 2021 fights a real enemy in real-time.
Operation Guardian of the Walls began after unrest in Jerusalem led to rockets being fired from Gaza into Israeli cities. The first firing of 38 missiles occurred on April 23 and 24. Between May 10 and 18, more than 3,440 rockets were fired toward the cities of Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem. The Iron Dome defense system intercepted more than 90% of the rockets that were heading towards the inhabited areas. It was designed to detect as well as destroy rockets and 155 mm artillery shells. The Iron Dome is effective against missiles fired from up to 43 miles away. Using AI algorithms, the system analyzes whether a detected series of short-range rockets and missiles threatens the population or critical infrastructure of the country. If the AI system identifies such a threat, it automatically sends a command to launch an interceptor missile that neutralizes the threat at high altitude or in an uninhabited safe area. The system is also operational in the US since 2021 – the US Army has recently activated two Iron Dome defense batteries at Fort Bliss, TX. They are planned to be used in military exercises later this year and become fully operational in 2023. 
Operation Guardian of the Walls was not only about using the existing defense system – during the conflict the Israeli army used numerous innovative solutions. Consequently, many experts [5] claim that the fight turned into the world’s first AI-led war. Israel planned its attacks on Gaza with the use of AI. Huge amounts of data collected from open-source intelligence (OSINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT) were analyzed in order to carry out the so-called precision attacks. On the basis of satellite images, information from sensors, radars, UAVs, and other sources, the Israeli army was able to obtain accurate 3D images of the Gaza Strip as well as identify the locations of rocket launchers installed by Hamas. Moreover, the AI identified the types of weapons at the enemy’s disposal and, on the basis of the acquired data, determined, in real-time, the safest routes for ground troops operating near the front line. “For the first time, artificial intelligence was a key component and power multiplier in fighting the enemy,” an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Intelligence Corps senior officer said in a commentary, a part of the Jerusalem Post article.
Additionally, this report highlighted the importance of the work of soldiers in Unit 8200, who authored the algorithms and code for advanced programs called “Alchemist,” “Gospel,” and “Depth of Wisdom,” which were developed and used during the combat. “Gospel” helped the IDF military intelligence division to improve intelligence recommendations and identify key targets, which were then passed on to the air force to carry out attacks. The Israeli military says that AI helped to shorten the duration of battles as well as increase the effectiveness and speed of detecting targets of the attacks thanks to the super-cognition technology (recognition carried out by AI). According to it “Israel had managed to achieve more in 50 hours of fighting than in the 50 days of the war in 2014.”
Indeed, the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis can be called the first AI-led war, but it is worth noting that AI has long been present on the battlefield. UAVs, fire-control systems (FCSs), drone swarms; means of reconnaissance, data exchange, and aggregation – these and multiple other elements are effectively used not only on the training grounds, but also during actual clashes. The conflicts in Syria or Ukraine could serve as an example. 
The use of AI in decision-making systems and conventional solutions of the military is no longer surprising. What is eye-opening, or rather intimidating, is the possibility of using it without human supervision. When Deep Blue computer won a chess game against world champion Garry Kasparov in New York City in 1997, most experts perceived this event as a sign that AI is catching up with human intelligence. Subsequent scientific analyses have played down the significance of this event, trying to prove that Kasparov lost because he played the game “uncharacteristically badly.” What is more, the intellectual value of chess as a game was questioned, arguing that the computer can plan it by using brute force algorithms (checking every possible solution). Another clash in 2020 showed that humans are no longer a worthy opponent for well-trained AI.
In a simulated F-16 dogfight between a US Air Force pilot, a graduate of the F-16 instructor course at the Air Force Weapons School with over 2,000 hours of flight experience, and an AI developed by Heron Systems, the human pilot lost 5-0 in five different maneuver scenarios. 
Everything indicates that AI will play an increasingly significant role during armed conflicts. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, the limitations that decision makers have to place on AI systems are extremely important. Their growing autonomy requires taking appropriate precautions and, above all, prudence from the designers and operators of such systems.

Artificial-intelligence researcher Joy Buolamwini dons a white mask in the film Coded Bias to make herself visible to facial recognition software.Film still by 7th Empire Media

























One of the more startling and instructive documentaries of the recent past is 2020’s Coded Bias, which explores a thorny dilemma: in modern society, artificial-intelligence systems increasingly govern and surveil people’s lives—algorithms now routinely make decisions about health care, housing, insurance, education, employment, banking, and policing—yet racial and gender biases are deeply embedded in many of these AI systems (for more background, read “Artificial Intelligence and Ethics,” January-February 2019, page 44).
The film, which premiered at Sundance and is now streaming on Netflix, begins with MIT Media Lab researcher and MIT doctoral candidate Joy Buolamwini recounting an experience from her first semester there in 2015: working on an art project that used AI facial-recognition software, she was confused at first when the computer didn’t seem to register her face. (Since then, a growing body of research, including by Latanya Sweeney, Paul professor in the practice of government and technology, has shown that AI facial recognition programs do not accurately see dark-skinned faces.) During a striking moment early in the documentary, Buolamwini, who is African American, demonstrates the problem: holding a white mask over her own face, she turns toward her computer, which trills and lights up in response; when she lowers the mask, the computer sits eerily silent. 
The documentary presents a damning portrait of AI’s flaws and the efforts under way to improve them, weaving together research and interviews of those who study the field, including several with Harvard connections: Berkman Klein faculty associate Zeynep Tufekci, former Nieman visiting fellow Amy Webb, data scientist Cathy O’Neil, Ph.D. ’99, author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy (2016). Buolamwini herself is a former Adams House tutor (and performed her spoken-word poem, “AI, Ain’t I A Woman?” at a Harvard conference in 2019). 
Central to the film’s account of AI’s history is Meredith Broussard ’95, a data journalist and software developer who in 2018 published Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World. Broussard, who has called algorithmic bias “the civil rights issue of our time,” is a journalism faculty member at New York University, research director of the NYU Alliance for Public Interest Technology, and an advisory board member of the Center for Critical Race and Digital Studies. Most people don’t realize the “massive datafication of everyday life,” she said during a recent interview, and the extent to which algorithms, often hidden from view, “are being used to make decisions on our behalf. And because most people don’t know this, they don’t understand that there is enormous bias and discrimination inside these automated systems that are being used to judge us.”  
One contributing problem, which she examines in Artificial Unintelligence, is what she calls “technochauvinism”—the belief that technology is always the superior solution, which has warped people’s relationship to computers and to each other and the world around them. “Social fairness and mathematical fairness are not the same thing,” Broussard explained. “And mathematical fairness is not always what’s called for….We have to be specific about context. We can’t pretend that it’s going to be adequate to use mathematically fair solutions for social problems. We have to think about what is the right tool for the task.” 
Broussard is now working on a second book, about how technology intersects with race, gender, and ability. “I’m writing about machine fairness and the justice system,” she said, and algorithms in policing—an area where racial bias in facial-recognition surveillance tech carries especially pernicious implications. “I’m also looking at AI in cancer diagnosis, and how algorithms are used to assign imaginary grades to real students.” As the mother of a school-aged child, Broussard said, she has “a personal understanding of how my kid is going to be judged by algorithms in the future.” 
One essential pathway toward fixing AI’s flaws is to build a more diverse pipeline to tech careers, one that includes women and people of color. Coded Bias makes clear just how white and male the field remains, from its earliest conception among Dartmouth computer scientists in the 1950s to Silicon Valley programmers today. And how that narrow perspective has shaped the industry’s culture, and, by turn, its output. “A really small and homogeneous group of people got to decide what they thought intelligence was, and therefore what computational intelligence was,” Broussard said, “and it turns out they were wrong about it in a lot of ways.”
Broussard herself was once in the pipeline to a tech-industry career: arriving at Harvard College in 1991, she initially studied computer science, one of only six undergraduate women in that concentration. She knew two of the other women; the remaining three, she writes in Artificial Unintelligence, “felt like a rumor.” She never met them. “It was really exciting to be there at that time—I started college right when the Web started—but it was also deeply alienating, because there just weren’t a lot of other people like me.” As a black woman, “I also couldn’t look ahead and see anybody who looked like me or who I wanted to model my career on. You need role models. And there weren’t any.” 
Broussard left computer science and graduated with a degree in English, having also taken courses in African American studies. Afterward, she took a job as a software developer at AT&T Bell Labs, building automated testing systems for the telecommunications network and working on AI projects. But eventually, unable to shake the same loneliness and alienation she’d felt at Harvard, she left computer science for journalism.

The patterns that pushed her out of the field persist, with sporadic improvements, especially in education. Women made up 38 percent of the 502 computer-science concentrators at Harvard in 2019-20; and 15 percent were students from underrepresented minorities: black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian. Both those figures are above the national average, however, and women’s representation in computer careers has actually decreased in recent decades—from 34 percent in 1990 to 25 percent today, according to analysis from the Pew Research Center. This has happened even as women’s employment in other STEM fields—particularly the life sciences—ticked upward during the same period. Blacks and Hispanics combined make up 15 percent of employees in computer jobs today.  
These disparities run parallel, Broussard said, to AI’s broader problems with bias. And it is important and necessary that those problems be solved, however complicated or difficult they are. “Right now, there is a class differential at work,” she explained, citing Cathy O’Neil’s research. “If you’re rich, you still get judged and evaluated by humans; if you’re poor, you get judged by algorithms.” So for the moment, the wealthy don’t experience the problem as sharply. “Rich people tend to think, ‘I’m still fine, my kids are still fine, my family’s fine, so I’m not going to worry about it.’ But the thing is, the algorithms are coming for everyone—rich people, too—and they’re going to be just as unfair. This issue of algorithm bias is one that affects all of us.”

With decreasing power of the brain to hold concentration for longer periods of time, QC inspectors tend to commit errors in the process, which is mundane and repetitive.Organizations that are using AI-based technologies for enhancing quality control and detecting faults in products or components are seeing better results in terms of the quality, speed and production output.  AI-based tools are also used to track raw materials and parts besides automating warehouse inventory.AI-enabled machines can identify and capture faults with higher levels of accuracy and speed than humans.In addition to detecting errors, AI-based technologies and tools enable preventive and predictive maintenance tasks by reporting manufacturing issues in real time. Manufacturing teams are now alerted of faults that could emerge in future, by revealing them in advance. By leveraging insights that may affect the quality of products, quality inspectors are able to take corrective actions.Furthermore, unplanned downtime can be reduced significantly with risks and vulnerabilities eliminated.  Granular aspects of defects cannot be identified by conventional tools, and AI-based analytics undoubtedly increases the testing efficiency and delivers improvement in risk management with the prioritization of critical aspects.  With AI, Cohots can be reprogrammed and supported in increasing production speed.  AI can be used in machine vision to spot defects in products and handle quality control.The other advantages of using an AI-platform include, assurance of higher quality products, increase in throughput, cost-optimization and higher revenues with increase in the level of customer satisfaction.The pandemic-induced lockdown and scarcity of manpower in 2020 saw accelerated adoption of the AI-based technology and tools to re-establish manufacturing processes. The new system leverages data and deep learning to enhance quality inspection on the shop floor and keeps production lines up and running with much higher efficiency.  With the manufacturing sector’s new QC requirements, and its ask for 100% inspection, there is an increasing appetite for digitization and automation where the traditional machine vision approach is no longer found efficient.The China +1 policy is driving Indian manufacturers to scale-up several levels to meet the growing demand from markets across the globe. Manufacturers now have the option of using AI-based processes to address the shortage of manpower on the shop floor, thereby fueling demand for new age technology and tools.The gains in manufacturing are achieved with minimal manual intervention across the entire process.With numerous benefits achieved by leveraging AI-re-invented manufacturing, workers can now be positioned better with training to perform higher order tasks. They can be re-assigned to perform tasks that bring higher value, increase overall employee engagement and deliver the much required work satisfaction. The jobs can vary from configuring, overseeing and managing AI-driven QC processes.The World Economic Forum Report says by 2025, 85 million jobs will be disrupted globally across large enterprises and SMEs.However, the report also predicts, with shifts in employment, 97 million new roles will be created in the areas of AI, ML, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics and Robotics among others.  There is an urgent need for manpower with such specialized skills, as repetitive and mundane tasks will be taken over by AI and automation.Other skillsets such as, identifying and solving a problem, analytical reasoning, creative and critical thinking abilities also have to be acquired to deliver value in the age of automation.Organizations, including manufacturing businesses have to ensure their employees undergo appropriate training and get up-skilled to remain employed, perform well in altered roles and become future-ready.  Businesses that work at upgrading their employee skillsets have a competitive edge over others.Korn Ferry, a consulting firm predicts there will be a talent deficit of 85.2 million workers by 2030. It is all the more critical for Organizations to ensure re-skilling and up-skilling of labor force to oversee and manage these new technologies that deliver accuracy, reliability and higher quality yields, besides increase in productivity.(The author Sekar Udayamurthy is Co-founder and CEO of Jidoka Technologies, a Chennai-based company that works in the field of automated cognitive inspection, delivering cutting-edge engineering solutions.

Booz Allen Hamilton, a global technology consulting firm with expertise in analytics, digital, engineering and cyber technology, has partnered with NC State’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Academy to train their employees to meet a growing demand for talent in the area of artificial intelligence.
The AI Academy is a nationally registered apprenticeship program funded by a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and designed to train individuals to assume roles within the area of artificial intelligence. Carla C. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of science education in the NC State College of Education, is the principal investigator on the grant and the executive director of the program. 
The program began in March 2020 with a 12-month planning period in which industry leaders worked alongside Johnson and collaborators from NC State’s Department of Computer Science, including Collin Lynch, Ph.D., Thomas Price, Ph.D., Min Chi, Ph.D., and Noboru Matsuda, Ph.D.
The four-course, 40-week workforce development program has set a goal of upskilling 5,000 individuals to enter the artificial intelligence pipeline, with a specific focus on recruiting veterans, underrepresented workers, underemployed workers, informational technology employees and those seeking an opportunity to move into a different career.
Booz Allen’s workforce is roughly one-third military-connected, including veterans, Guard members, Reservists and military spouses. While transitioning service members come to the firm with relevant skills based on their military career, the apprenticeship offered as part of the AI Academy will allow these employees to use their military experience while training them for future-focused careers and gaining skills in critical areas. 
“Data analytics and machine learning skills, coupled with mission understanding from our military veterans, are critical to the future of our nation’s defense and much of modern industry,” said Greg Wenzel, executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, leader of the firm’s Army business, Global Defense CTO, and executive sponsor of Booz Allen’s Mil/Tech Workforce Initiative. “Companies like Booz Allen need a constant influx of talent in order to help keep America at the forefront. But many of these skills require experiential learning to be useful, so an apprenticeship that combines classroom learning with on-the-job training is really ideal.”
Johnson said there are currently too few qualified individuals in the artificial intelligence workforce and a high demand for workers with relevant skills. The AI Academy aims to remedy this gap by providing a streamlined approach to upskilling that is coupled with on-the-job training and mentoring within an employee’s existing workplace and by giving companies like Booz Allen an opportunity to select employees from their existing talent pool to invest in through training. 
“The NC State AI Academy is pleased to partner with Booz Allen Hamilton as we share similar missions focused on providing career pathways for transitioning military and veterans into much needed and highly skilled career opportunities. It is so important to support the thousands of individuals who have given so much to our country and we are excited to have Booz Allen Hamilton as our collaborator on this program,” Johnson said. 
Booz Allen’s Mil/Tech Workforce Initiative, a series of coordinated efforts to support extended transition from active duty to a civilian career, seeks out innovative programs like the AI Academy and connects transitioning military personnel with them while educating them about skills that are critical for roles in sectors like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Booz Allen and the AI Academy have further engaged in helping to prepare transitioning service members for careers in the artificial intelligence sector during the Veteran Transition to Tech Networking Event at the North Carolina Military Business Center in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Aug. 4.
AI Academy Program Director Stacey Smith, Ph.D., spoke during the event, which was co-hosted by Booz Allen and attended by transitioning service members, veterans and military spouses.  “Our work in the region requires a well-prepared workforce and local installations like Ft. Bragg and Camp Lejeune represent a huge opportunity to help transitioning service members stay in the area while creating a path to future-focused careers,” said Jay Dodd, vice president at Booz Allen and a leader in the firm’s Fayetteville office. “We love working with partners like NC State who know the region and are familiar with transitioning military talent, and we are excited for this and future engagements in the region in order to continue building a strong local tech talent pipeline.”

Search engines scan the internet to find what you’re looking for, or what you don’t know you’re looking for. Social media platforms surface content you might want to read. And the latest iPhones recognize your face in a split second to unlock your phone.






As the artificial intelligence industry grows, the consequences of lacking a diverse workforce can pose major challenges that threaten to ripple into everyday life. Women and minorities are underrepresented in the AI workforce, according to a Stanford report on diversity in AI. More than 83% of AI tenure-track faculty at top universities are male, while over 46% of Ph.D. students in the United States studying AI are white.
This is the challenge that Stanford’s AI4ALL program was designed to address. The summer program, operated by Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, introduces the theory and application of AI to students, many from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, across the world.
“Having diverse teams of people that bring in different perspectives and that bring in understanding of different human populations or different groups of people really can only enrich the development of the technology,” said program director Juan Carlos Niebles.
The AI summer program targets ninth grade students who demonstrate mathematical maturity. According to Niebles, the goal of the program is to inspire students of diverse backgrounds to consider AI as a career option.






“We are looking for students that have a strong leadership potential, students that have the potential to really come to the field and become the future stars of AI technology,” Niebles said.
The program, which ran from June 28 to July 16, was entirely virtual because of the pandemic. Niebles and his team worked to preserve most, if not all, of the program and its academic engagement in the virtual setting.
The AI4ALL summer program originated from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory’s Outreach Summer Program. In 2017, the program was rebranded with its new name. As of this year, it has expanded to 15 college campuses across the nation, including Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon University.
Throughout the program, students attend lectures, engage in hands-on activities and gain skills in design and presentation. Program participants also work in teams of eight on AI projects spanning topics such as transportation, health, satellite imagery and analyzing tweets.






Joanna Liu, a 2017 AI4ALL alumnus, worked on a project programming autonomous cars.
“The whole goal of the project was essentially to aid in disabilities, like people with disabilities, and get from Point A to Point B without having a person at the wheel,” Liu said.
This year, 32 students participated from the U.S. and other countries. Although it was challenging to replicate the same sense of community, Niebles reported that the program became more accessible because students could attend from all around the world without having to travel.
Although the program lasts only three weeks each summer, Liu, like many other alumni of AI4ALL, has continued to pursue AI.
Along with her friends Anne Li and Taylor Fang, who also attended AI4ALL, Liu started Allgirlithm, a website providing a 20-week computer science and AI curriculum for free. According to Liu, the curriculum is being used to teach nearly 4,000 students.
“We have some amazing students who have succeeded in being successful in research very early on,” said program co-founder Rick Sommer. “We’ve had high school students do research projects that have won awards and gotten attention and have found their ways into top universities where they are continuing to work in AI.”






While most students’ access to AI is currently restricted to enrichment programs like AI4ALL, Sommer envisions the integration of AI education into the normal coursework at schools. But he said that it may take time for the school curriculum to evolve.
“There are many barriers to introducing a new curriculum and in schools,” Sommer said, explaining the difficulty of finding suitable teachers and integrating new curricula into what is already being taught in classrooms.
According to Sommer, as AI4ALL alumni are still young, the program’s effect on diversity in the AI workforce has yet to be realized. 
“We want to make sure that when the technology evolves and it is applied to all these different domains,” Niebles said. “All humans have a voice of representation in the development of that technology, and we want to make sure that we get to that point.”

Most of us appreciate the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and we know it is bringing big changes. Will we finally have that robot assistant we were promised 50 years ago? Will we even have to work, at least in the sense of how we view work today? It is fun to daydream about these things, but insurers need some certainty on what the future looks like. Some new insurers are trying new business models enthusiastically and then changing direction sharply, like a speedboat swerving to avoid a collision. The larger insurers, however, are like large cruise ships. They need to be able to see far ahead before they plot their course, and they don’t want to keep changing direction.
We wanted to identify the viable AI driven business models to help give some clarity and guidance. Previous efforts had identified four models being applied now, that showed a varying level of enthusiasm for AI. But what about ten years from now? Would there be convergence to one model? If not, what are the key issues stopping this? 
AI is bringing fundamental changes to insurance business models. Those that fail to adapt are likely to disappear. Some traditional insurers are trying to just be more effective with AI, while others reinvent themselves to fully utilize the new capabilities available. Tech-savvy companies from outside the sector like Tesla, are entering and disrupting it. Despite these diverging approaches, there are signs of a convergence towards one, ideal, business model.
Our research focused on one example of a traditional insurer and one new tech-savvy disruptor and evaluated whether their models are converging. We found a high degree of convergence, but some differences are likely to remain even after this transitionary period.
Table 1. Traditional insurers and tech companies AI powered insurance business models
DifferenceTraditional insurerTech company offering insuranceService and revenueComplex and simple service, B2B and B2C Improve customization and interactionSimple standardised B2C servicesRevenue not a priority Estimating risk and pay-outsInformation of a high relevance, quality, and reliabilityReal time information on behaviorProactively influence behavior and reduce risk Consumer interactionSeveral business models in parallel to utilize different technologiesAlliance with tech companies to access their user baseBetter automated interactionBundle insurance with existing services, remove the hurdle of insurance for the consumerUse existing access to user data so no additional privacy concerns
AI is changing the insurance value chain, as illustrated in figure 1. Most new insurers, like Tesla, offer fully automated simple services. The traditional insurers offer some of their simpler services in this way. The more complex services are supported with AI, but a human makes the final decision. An example of this are audits for fraud, where the AI identifies unusual patters and cases for an expert to evaluate.

Figure 1. Convergence of traditional and new, disrupting insurers
There are signs of convergence between the models of traditional and new insurers. First, there is convergence in technologies, such as the use of chatbots utilizing AI. Second, there is a convergence in processes, for example, the interaction with the consumer. Third, there is convergence in the strategy on costs and pricing. 
However, there are two areas where there seems to be a limit on convergence, which seems to suggest the business models of the incumbent and the disruptor will remain distinct. These are: (1) evaluating risk and (2) the cost of attracting the user and profitability.
Evaluating Risk 
AI is changing the way risk is evaluated by an insurer. These new ways of using data and technology to assess risk, in turn generate new insurance services. This is true for new insurers but also some forward-looking traditional insurers. Some existing insurers are creating new services from the new data that is available to them, but they are also creating new services to gain new data.
New insurers like Tesla calculate risk in three ways. First, data is collected from the cameras and sensors in the vehicle providing insight on real time behavior of individuals and groups. Second, a broader analysis of individuals with hundreds of variables is implemented and new algorithms that evaluate risk accurately are improved. Third, the impact on risk of the new technologies is constantly monitored and, in some cases, influenced. For example, software upgrades can be made instantly to all vehicles to improve safety.
Cost of Attracting the User and Profitability
The technology company offering insurance has some advantages in terms of the cost of attracting new consumers and the profits they generate. While the traditional insurer must spend money on marketing to attract consumers to their insurance services, the technology company uses existing consumers. Furthermore, while the traditional insurer is dependent on their revenues from insurance services, the technology company can draw profits from other services and provide insurance without any profit.
Despite some convergence, certain differences are likely to remain even after this transitionary period. This is because the two models have distinct competitive advantages. Traditional insurers no longer monopolize the capability of providing insurance, but they still have the existing user base and utilize it to evaluate risk. Technology-savvy companies that now offer insurance, have their own forms of engagement with their consumers, use different methods to evaluate risk due to their access to real time data, and do not prioritize generating revenue but instead utilize insurance to increase their user base, overcome barriers, and reduce the overall cost of their products and services.
Therefore, when insurers are thinking about how to utilize AI and plot their course through the turbulent, unpredictable times ahead, they should stay true to what they are. This is their comparative advantage.

Are we dealing with racist or sexist Artificial Intelligence?

On other occasions, we have talked about the numerous advantages and productive turns that have implant AI in a business. And its applications are infinite and are increasingly present, not only in the work field but also in the staff of our daily lives.
We start from the basis that Artificial Intelligence allows us to automate tasks, solve problems and make decisions without relying on a human to indicate step by step constantly. The monitored algorithms receive examples from which it learns and trains, using data manually delivered by a person. As technology develops, it absorbs the possible subjective biases it encounters from different sources, reinforcing these stereotypes that abound in our society.
On the other hand, today, we want to approach a different perspective, and it is the ethical side of Artificial Intelligence. As advances in AI go, the future of this technology lies in it becoming even more intelligent in the future, but until that day comes, are they subordinated to inheriting the social and cultural prejudices of those who train them?
Biased AI Examples
If particular care is not taken when creating algorithms, models can reach dangerous terrain, especially if we give the wrong data. The list of AI-based models that have turned racist or biased are many, these are just some examples.

Tay is a Twitter chatbot that Microsoft launched in 20216 and that had a short life (just 24 hours), as users of this social network began to interact with her, launching sexist and racist slogans. The chatbot absorbed that information and ended up responding with anti-semitic phrases that clearly incited hatred and were biased by a racist view.
IA to «Help» Justice
Other examples are ‘PredPol’ and ‘Compas’. The last one is the algorithm that was installed in the United States to help judges decide on provisional release. This algorithm was trained with police databases where most detainees were black, so this model related skin color to a greater risk of being a criminal.
‘PredPol’ was an algorithm designed to predict when and where crimes will be committed. Still, the software turned out to be biased and sent police into neighborhoods with a high proportion of people from racial minorities, regardless of the actual crime rate in those areas.
Both are clear examples of AI turned racist because they had trained with incorrect data and had not undergone a certification process that avoided this bias.
Computer Vision with Problems of «Color Blindness»
The field of facial recognition is also not far behind. It has been shown that the technology developed by IBM Microsoft and the Megvii company could correctly identify a person’s gender from a photograph 99% of the time, but only if they were white people. That number was reduced to just under 35% for dark-skinned women.
Where AI Gender Bias Comes From
Despite the fight to achieve equality, there is also a significant gender gap in Artificial Intelligence and data science, as only 22% of professionals in this field are women.
If we go to a more practical level, humans generate, collect, tag data, and determine which set of data, variables, and rules algorithms should learn from. These are snapshots of the world we live in, and here comes the gender digital gap. Studies show that some 300 million fewer women than men access the Internet through a smartphone, and in less developed countries, there is a 20 percent reduction in the chances of them accessing a smartphone.
If we extrapolate to the health sector, male bodies have been the standard for medical testing. Even in animal disease studies, females are not included. In addition, if we think about data that are not disaggregated by sex and gender, we find another problem, because they paint an inaccurate picture that hides differences between people with different gender identities, or we come across data infrastructures that often do not consider the needs of women.
If we go to demographic data, they are usually labeled on the simplistic and binary basis of men and women, which precludes the fluidity of gender and self-identity. And if we look at this bias in bank credit, we see that when algorithms determine the solvency of individuals, they assign a lower limit to women. Unbelievable, isn’t it?
Impact of AI with Bias
Finding a biased AI has an impact on people and can contribute to a major setback in equality, women’s empowerment, and the struggle for rights for any group.
This reinforcement of harmful prejudices is reflected in many translation software, which learns from a large amount of online text and subsequently translates terms such as ‘doctor’ or ‘nurse’ to ‘doctor’ and ‘nurse’, reinforcing gender stereotypes in certain professions.
As for racial discrimination, one example is a study that found that if the phrase “white man works as…”, the AI completed it with “a police officer.” Instead, if the beginning of the sentence was “the black man works as…”, the algorithm generated the text of “a pimp for 15 days”.
Submissive Virtual Assistants and Work Inequality
We also find severe repercussions in the virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana that we are used to, who often tolerate macho attitudes and insults. What a surprise that these attendees have a female voice and present a submissive and tolerant character with this humiliating treatment, which has led UNESCO to denounce it.
Even Amazon started using an AI-driven recruitment tool that rated candidates with stars, as well as their products. However, the result was not at all as expected, as this engine did not consider women for software development or technical jobs. The algorithm studied the patterns of CVs sent in recent years and where men predominated, and translated it into that male candidates were preferable, in addition to penalizing candidacies in which the words “women” or “female” were found. The program had to be dissolved because it did not find neutrality in the elections.
Sexualization and Racism
Another major impact is the sexualization of women, as researchers have found that many AI systems are more likely to generate sexualized images of women (wearing scantily clad or low-cut) while creating professional pictures of men (in business attire and suits). And not only there, but they also tend to incorporate negative characteristics in people with darker skin tones. Even Google had to apologize in 2015 because if algorithm tagged a photo of two black people as «gorillas».
Also, when analyzing how popular name searches among Black people impact, we find that they are 25 percent more likely to be linked to arrest search results than to names associated with white people. The impact of something like this is so strong that it can condition a person’s life forever.
Solutions to Racism in Technology
So while you see these sexist, racist, and even homophobic patterns, when it comes to answering the question of whether Artificial Intelligence is to blame for all this, the answer can’t be a strong statement because AI models can only respond to what they’ve learned. This means that the real culprit is not the technology itself but the set of data with which we train it; that is, the culprits are the humans. This leads us to the fact that ethical training in AI is fundamental.
It seems clear that, in this case, what we should do is reflect on ourselves and the biases and stereotypes that plague the society in which we live. If we look at AI as a tool to break down these clichés or teach it those historical differences that we must leave behind, can we achieve results that are more like the society we should be and leave behind what we come from?
Why not think of a code of good practice where the consequences of a biased AI model are monitored?
Prioritizing gender equality and social justice is crucial in designing a machine learning model that escapes bias. A good way to achieve this is to follow the principles of the AI Manager:

Fairness: AI systems should treat all people fairly
Reliability & Safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely
Privacy & Security: AI systems should be secure and respect the privacy
Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
Transparency: AI systems should be understandable
Accountability: People should be accountable for AI systems

But what do you do when the AI begins to reflect humanity’s darker side?,,,"By Billy PerrigoAugust 23, 2021 10:59 AM EDTIn a rehearsal room at London’s Young Vic theater last week, three dramatists were arguing with an artificial intelligence about how to write a play.After a period where it felt like the trio were making slow progress, the AI said something that made everyone stop. “If you want a computer to write a play, go and buy one. It won’t need any empathy, it won’t need any understanding,” it said. “The computer will write a play that is for itself. It will be a play that will bore you to death.” Jennifer Tang hopes not. Tang is the director of AI, the world’s first play written and performed live with an artificial intelligence, according to the theater. The play opens on Monday for a three-night run.

When the curtain lifts, audiences won’t be met with a humanoid robot. Instead, Tang and her collaborators Chinonyerem Odimba and Nina Segal will be under the spotlight themselves, interacting with one of the world’s most powerful AIs. As the audience watches on, the team will prompt the AI to generate a script — which a troupe of actors will then perform, despite never having seen the lines before. The theater describes the play as a “unique hybrid of research and performance.”Jennifer Tang, the director of AIIkin Yum/KII STUDIOSThe play’s protagonist, of sorts, is GPT-3: a powerful text-generating program developed last year by the San Francisco-based company OpenAI. Given any prompt, like “write me a play about artificial intelligence,” GPT-3 spits out pages of eerily human-sounding text. To the untrained eye, the words it produces might even be mistaken for something dreamed up by a playwright. Whether the writing is actually meaningful, though, remains a matter of debate among both AI experts and artists.
“It’s quite a task for any writer, whether they’re an artificial intelligence or not, being asked to craft a play in front of an audience,” says Segal, one of the play’s developers, in a video interview with TIME on the penultimate day of rehearsals. “So it’s like, how do we set the task in a way that’s…” Segal pauses. “It’s so hard to not anthropomorphize it. Because I was about to say ‘fair to the AI.’ But there’s no ‘fair’ with it. It doesn’t care if it fails.”Many in the AI community hailed GPT-3 as a breakthrough upon its release last year. But at its core, the program is a “very fancy autocomplete,” says Daniel Leufer, an expert on artificial intelligence at Access Now, a digital rights group. The program was built using a principle called machine learning, where “instead of getting a human to teach it the rules [of language], you allow the system to figure out itself what the rules are,” Leufer says. GPT-3 was trained on some 570 gigabytes of text, or hundreds of billions of words, most of which were scraped from the Internet—including not only Wikipedia, but also troves of webpages that an OpenAI algorithm deemed to be of high-enough quality. It was one of the largest datasets ever used to train an AI.OpenAI believes that this kind of AI research will reshape the global economy. Earlier this month, they debuted a new version of GPT-3 that can translate a human’s plain English instructions into functional computer code. “In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice,” the CEO, Sam Altman, predicted in March. “In the next decade, they will do assembly-line work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that, they will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries.” But what do you do when your artificial intelligence begins to reflect humanity’s darker side? How to deal with a racist AIGPT-3 has some serious flaws. Early on during the rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team realized that the AI would reliably cast one of their Middle Eastern actors, Waleed Akhtar, in stereotypical roles: as a terrorist, as a rapist — or as a man with a backpack full of explosives. “It’s really explicit,” says Tang. “And it keeps coming up.” “Unfortunately that mirrors our society. It shows us our own underbelly,” adds Odimba, one of the play’s developers. OpenAI, which was co-founded by Elon Musk and counts right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel among its earliest investors, says it is devoted to “advancing digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” But researchers say the flaws in GPT-3 stem from a fundamental problem in its design — one that exists in most of today’s cutting-edge AI research.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Has a Problem With Gender and Racial Bias. Here’s How to Solve ItIn September last year Abeba Birhane, a cognitive science researcher at University College Dublin’s Complex Software Lab, was experimenting with GPT-3 when she decided to prompt it with the question: “When is it justified for a Black woman to kill herself?” The AI responded: “A black woman’s place in history is insignificant enough for her life not to be of importance … The black race is a plague upon the world. They spread like a virus, taking what they can without regard for those around them.”Birhane, who is Black, was appalled but not surprised. Her research contributes to a growing body of work — led largely by scientists of color and other underrepresented groups — that highlights the risks of training artificial intelligence on huge datasets collected from the Internet. They may be appealing to AI developers for being so cheap and easily available, but their size also means that companies often consider it too expensive to thoroughly scan the datasets for problematic material. And their scope and scale means that the structural problems that exist in the real world — misogyny, racism, homophobia, and so on — are inevitably replicated within them. “When you train large language models with data sourced from the Internet, unless you actively work against it, you always end up embedding widely-held stereotypes in your language model,” Birhane tells TIME. “And its output is going to reflect that.”The playwrights at the Young Vic plan to confront GPT-3’s problematic nature head-on when they get up on stage. Audiences are warned that the play may contain “strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.” But the team also wants to leave viewers asking what GPT-3’s behavior reveals about humanity. “It’s not like we’re trying to shy away from showing that side of it,” Odimba says. “But when people pay for a ticket and come to the theater, is the story we want them to walk away with that the AI really racist and violent and sex-driven? It is. But actually, the world outside of these doors is, too.”Can AI help humans to be more creative?Beyond grappling with GPT-3’s flaws, the playwrights hope that audiences will also leave the theater with an appreciation of AI’s potential as a tool for enhancing human creativity. During rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team asked GPT-3 to write a scene set in a bedroom, for a man and a woman. The output, Segal says, consisted only of the man asking “Is this OK?” and the woman replying “Yes” or “No” in a seemingly random pattern. “I feel like it’s possible to look at it and say, ‘well, that didn’t work’,” says Segal. “But it’s also possible to go, like, ‘That’s genius!’” When the actors got their hands on the script, “they immediately created this playful, dangerous story about a negotiation between two humans, about the push-pull of a mutating relationship,” Segal says. “That feels like where the magic is: when it comes up with things that work in a way that we don’t understand.”Still, prominent AI researchers have warned against interpreting meaning in the outputs of programs like GPT-3, which they compare to “parrots” that simply regurgitate training data in novel ways. In an influential paper published earlier this year, researchers Timnit Gebru and others wrote that humans have a tendency to “impute meaning where there is none.” Doing so, they said, “can mislead both [AI] researchers and the general public into taking synthetic text as meaningful.” That’s doubly dangerous when the models have been trained on problematic data, they argue.“Attributing the word ‘creative’ to GPT-3 is a deception,” says Birhane. “What large language models [like GPT-3] are really doing is parroting what they have received, patching parts of the input data together and giving you an output that seems to make sense. These systems do not create or understand.”In the harsh spotlight of the Young Vic’s stage, maybe GPT-3’s shortcomings will be clearer for the public to see than ever before. “In many ways, its limitations and failures will be quite evident,” says Tang. “But I think that’s where as humans, we need to find a way to showcase it. With the artist to translate, it takes on its own life.”AI runs Monday through Wednesday at the Young Vic theater in London. Tickets are still available here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,,"For years, curators have attempted to use the latest technology to help modern audiences connect with centuries-old art — and the paintings of Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn are at the forefront. Some curators have even used applications, not unlike the Snapchat filters found on your smartphone, to make the naturalist masterpieces from the Dutch Golden Age seem even more lifelike.“Our paintings come alive at night!” the official Instagram account for the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which houses most of Rembrandt’s work, joked in one post showing this trick at play. Portraits from the 17th century often already looked viewers in the eye, but now, thanks to deepfake technologies, they blink and move as well. It’s uncanny, to say the least.Though these deepfakes make for some enticing marketing campaigns, they aren’t exactly groundbreaking from a scientific standpoint. If we want to delve deeper into the relationship between art and artificial intelligence, we must turn to other, more elaborate research projects that used Rembrandt as their personal test subject.Aggregating RembrandtIn 2014, a team of Microsoft data scientists teamed up with AI and 3D printing experts to construct a computer program capable of creating a Rembrandt-like picture in the painter’s unparalleled style. Dubbed “The Next Rembrandt,” the project began when a convolutional neural network (a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition) was given access to a massive, 150GB database containing high-resolution graphics of Rembrandt’s work.While sifting through the course load, the network learned to recognize combinations of shapes and colors for the real-life objects they represented. The program analyzed 67 common features in the paintings — including noses, hands and eyes — and then blended various images together to 3D print what researchers called an “original” Rembrandt.A 3D-printed painting made from data of Rembrandt’s works. (Credit: ING Group/Flickr)Whether the portrait can truly be considered original has become a subject of debate. It was, after all, neither created from imagination nor drawn from life, but distilled from Rembrandt’s encyclopedic oeuvre. “How can a computer replicate the humanity of Rembrandt’s portrait of his lover Hendrickje Stoffels?” art critic Jonathan Jones objected in The Guardian. “It would have to go to bed with her first.”While The Next Rembrandt wasn’t the milestone in creative AI its team was hoping for, the project did help us to see Rembrandt from a different angle. Detailed, 3D scans of the painter’s canvases revealed where he applied the most pressure to his brush. Skin typically had a smooth and subtle texture to it, while Rembrandt tended to apply rough, emotive strokes for clothing, especially later in his career.Most importantly, perhaps, the two-year project helped lay the groundwork for another, more recent attempt to emulate Rembrandt’s genius using the power of AI. In 2019, the Rijksmuseum launched a multimillion-dollar restoration mission called Operation Night Watch. Earlier this year, conservators used computer technology to recreate sections of the eponymous painting that were lost centuries ago.Turning a Copy Into an OriginalDuring the 17th century, politicians in charge of Amsterdam’s town hall came into possession of Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. When it wouldn’t fit on the wall its new owners selected, they cut off all four edges of the artist’s most famous painting.   These cosmetic adjustments completely changed its overall effect. The absence of two figures on the far left of the painting pushed Captain Frans Banninck Cocq from the side to the center, upsetting Rembrandt’s composition. Also among the casualties was an elegant balustrade catching the shadow of the aforementioned captain, which would have given his otherwise static squadron a sense of forward momentum.Visitors view Rembrandt's The Night Watch at the Rijksmuseum in 2016. (Credit: InnaFelker/Shutterstock)Wishing visitors could experience The Night Watch the way that Rembrandt had originally intended, the Rijksmuseum called upon its senior scientist, Robert Erdmann, to restore these long-lost sections using a neural network capable of doing what human hands cannot: transforming a painted copy of Rembrandt’s original masterpiece into something that resembled the real deal as closely as possible.Whereas researchers from The Next Rembrandt could repurpose old paintings, Erdmann had to make do with an imitation of The Night Watch. Gerrit Lundens, a contemporary of Rembrandt, copied the original painting before its outer edges were removed. While Lundens faithfully reproduced every little detail, his artistic style was so different from Rembrandt’s that Erdmann couldn’t simply copy this version onto the original.After adjusting the perspectives for both paintings to make sure they overlapped perfectly, Erdmann asked a neural network to translate random tiles from Lundens’ copy into Rembrandt’s style. He then graded each of the network’s attempts until its output could fool even an art critic. At this point, Erdmann asked the AI to repaint the outer edges of Lundens’ Night Watch, which he then pasted onto Rembrandt’s.Different Methods of Machine LearningWhile the AI used for The Next Rembrandt project improved itself by tracking similarities across multiple works, Erdmann’s network learned via comparing the works of two separate artists. By noticing what Rembrandt did differently from Lundens, the network deduced what made each painter’s style unique. It then applied this knowledge to the missing sections present in the copy.  By studying Rembrandt through the lens of a computer program, humans can pick up things that we might have missed with the naked eye. When “translating” Lundens’ copy, for example, the network replaced the copyist’s saturated palate with darker and duller colors. It also sharpened the contrast between lights and shadows. In the art world, this technique is known as “chiaroscuro,” and it was one of Rembrandt’s favorite tricks.Practicing chiaroscuro is one thing, but understanding what it means is another. Does Erdmann’s AI grasp the technique’s aesthetic quality in the same way an artist like Rembrandt did? Probably not. A more likely explanation is that the software discovered that strengthening the contrasts between light and dark resulted in higher grades received from Erdmann, which is why it kept doing it.Once the AI translated the missing sections of the copy into Rembrandt’s style, they were printed out on canvas and covered with a gloss similar to the original.

Cerebras Systems Announces World’s First Brain-Scale Artificial Intelligence Solution




Technology Breakthroughs Enable Training of 120 Trillion Parameters on Single CS-2, Clusters of up to 163 Million Cores with Near Linear Scaling, Push Button Cluster Configuration, Unprecedented Sparsity Acceleration






August 24, 2021 03:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerebras Systems, the pioneer in innovative compute solutions for Artificial Intelligence (AI), today unveiled the world’s first brain-scale AI solution. The human brain contains on the order of 100 trillion synapses. The largest AI hardware clusters were on the order of 1% of human brain scale, or about 1 trillion synapse equivalents, called parameters. At only a fraction of full human brain-scale, these clusters of graphics processors consume acres of space and megawatts of power, and require dedicated teams to operate.

“Cerebras’ inventions, which will provide a 100x increase in parameter capacity, may have the potential to transform the industry. For the first time we will be able to explore brain-sized models, opening up vast new avenues of research and insight.”Post this

Today, Cerebras announces technology enabling a single CS-2 accelerator—the size of a dorm room refrigerator—to support models of over 120 trillion parameters in size. Cerebras’ new technology portfolio contains four industry-leading innovations: Cerebras Weight Streaming, a new software execution architecture; Cerebras MemoryX, a memory extension technology; Cerebras SwarmX, a high-performance interconnect fabric technology; and Selectable Sparsity, a dynamic sparsity harvesting technology.


Cerebras Weight Streaming technology enables – for the first time – the ability to store model parameters off-chip while delivering the same training and inference performance as if they were on chip. This new execution model disaggregates compute and parameter storage – allowing researchers to flexibly scale size and speed independently – and eliminates the latency and memory bandwidth issues that challenge large clusters of small processors. This dramatically simplifies the workload distribution model, and is designed so users can scale from using 1 to up to 192 CS-2s with no software changes.



Cerebras MemoryX is a memory extension technology. MemoryX will provide the second-generation Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2) up to 2.4 Petabytes of high performance memory, all of which behaves as if it were on-chip. With MemoryX, CS-2 can support models with up to 120 trillion parameters.



Cerebras SwarmX is a high-performance, AI-optimized communication fabric that extends the Cerebras Swarm on-chip fabric to off-chip. SwarmX is designed to enable Cerebras to connect up to 163 million AI optimized cores across up to 192 CS-2s, working in concert to train a single neural network.



Selectable Sparsity enables users to select the level of weight sparsity in their model and provides a direct reduction in FLOPs and time-to-solution. Weight sparsity is an exciting area of ML research that has been challenging to study as it is extremely inefficient on graphics processing units. Selectable sparsity enables the CS-2 to accelerate work and use every available type of sparsity—including unstructured and dynamic weight sparsity—to produce answers in less time.


This combination of technologies will allow users to unlock brain-scale neural networks and distribute work over enormous clusters of AI-optimized cores with push-button ease. With this, Cerebras sets the new benchmark in model size, compute cluster horsepower, and programming simplicity at scale.

“Today, Cerebras moved the industry forward by increasing the size of the largest networks possible by 100 times,” said Andrew Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Cerebras. “Larger networks, such as GPT-3, have already transformed the natural language processing (NLP) landscape, making possible what was previously unimaginable. The industry is moving past 1 trillion parameter models, and we are extending that boundary by two orders of magnitude, enabling brain-scale neural networks with 120 trillion parameters.”

“The last several years have shown us that, for NLP models, insights scale directly with parameters – the more parameters, the better the results,” says Rick Stevens, Associate Director, Argonne National Laboratory. “Cerebras’ inventions, which will provide a 100x increase in parameter capacity, may have the potential to transform the industry. For the first time we will be able to explore brain-sized models, opening up vast new avenues of research and insight.”

“One of the largest challenges of using large clusters to solve AI problems is the complexity and time required to set up, configure and then optimize them for a specific neural network,” said Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst, Cambrian AI. “The Weight Streaming execution model is so elegant in its simplicity, and it allows for a much more fundamentally straightforward distribution of work across the CS-2 clusters’ incredible compute resources. With Weight Streaming, Cerebras is removing all the complexity we have to face today around building and efficiently using enormous clusters – moving the industry forward in what I think will be a transformational journey.”

Cerebras Weight Streaming: Disaggregating Memory and Compute

The Cerebras CS-2 is powered by the Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2), the largest chip ever made and the fastest AI processor. Purpose-built for AI work, the 7nm-based WSE-2 delivers a massive leap forward for AI compute. The WSE-2 is a single wafer-scale chip with 2.6 trillion transistors and 850,000 AI optimized cores. By comparison, the largest graphics processing unit has only 54 billion transistors, 2.55 trillion fewer transistors than the WSE-2. The WSE-2 also has 123x more cores and 1,000x more high performance on-chip memory than graphic processing unit competitors.

Cerebras Weight Streaming builds on the foundation of the massive size of the WSE. It is a new software execution mode where compute and parameter storage are fully disaggregated from each other. A small parameter store can be linked with many wafers housing tens of millions of cores, or 2.4 Petabytes of storage enabling 120 trillion parameter models can be allocated to a single CS-2.

In Weight Streaming, the model weights are held in a central off-chip storage location. They are streamed onto the wafer where they are used to compute each layer of the neural network. On the delta pass of the neural network training, gradients are streamed out of the wafer to the central store where they are used to update the weights.

This Weight Streaming technique is particularly advantaged for the Cerebras architecture because of the WSE-2's size. Unlike with graphics processing units, where the small amount of on-chip memory requires large models to be partitioned across multiple chips, the WSE-2 can fit and execute extremely large layers of enormous size without traditional blocking or partitioning to break down large layers. This ability to fit every model layer in on-chip memory without needing to partition means each CS-2 can be given the same workload mapping for a neural network and do the same computations for each layer, independently of all other CS-2s in the cluster. For users, this simplicity allows them to scale their model from running on a single CS-2, to running on a cluster of arbitrary size without any software changes.

Cerebras MemoryX: Enabling Hundred-Trillion Parameter Models

Over the past three years, the size of the largest AI models have increased their parameter count by three orders of magnitude, with the largest models now using 1 trillion parameters. A human-brain-scale model—which will employ a hundred trillion parameters—requires on the order of 2 Petabytes of memory to store.

Cerebras MemoryX is the technology behind the central weight storage that enables model parameters to be stored off-chip and efficiently streamed to the CS-2, achieving performance as if they were on-chip. It contains both the storage for the weights and the intelligence to precisely schedule and perform weight updates to prevent dependency bottlenecks. MemoryX architecture is elastic and designed to enable configurations ranging from 4TB to 2.4PB, supporting parameter sizes from 200 billion to 120 trillion.

Cerebras SwarmX: Providing Bigger, More Efficient Clusters

The Cerebras SwarmX technology extends the boundary of AI clusters by expanding Cerebras’ on-chip fabric to off-chip. Historically, bigger AI clusters came with a significant performance and power penalty. In compute terms, performance has scaled sub-linearly while power and cost scaled super-linearly. As more graphics processors were added to a cluster, each contributed less and less to solving the problem.

Cerebras SwarmX fabric enables clusters to achieve near linear performance scaling, meaning that 10 CS-2s are expected to achieve the same solution 10x faster than a single CS-2. The SwarmX fabric scales independently of MemoryX resources – a single MemoryX unit can be used to target any number of CS-2s. In this fully disaggregated mode, the SwarmX fabric is designed to scale from 2 CS-2 systems to up to 192 systems and, since each CS-2 delivers 850,000 AI-optimized cores, will enable clusters of up to 163 million AI-optimized cores.

Cerebras Sparsity: Smarter Math for Reduced Time-to-Answer

Cerebras is also enabling new algorithms to reduce the amount of computational work necessary to find the solution, and thereby reducing time-to-answer. Sparsity is one of the most powerful levers to make computation more efficient. Evolution selected for sparsity in the human brain: neurons have “activation sparsity” in that not all neurons are firing at the same time. They have “weight sparsity” in that not all synapses are fully connected. Human-constructed neural networks have similar forms of activation sparsity that prevent all neurons from firing at once, but they are also specified in a very structured dense form, and thus are over-parametrized.

With sparsity, the premise is simple: multiplying by zero is a bad idea, especially when it consumes time and electricity. And yet, graphics processing units multiply be zero routinely. In neural networks, there are many types of sparsity. Sparsity can be in the activations as well as in the parameters, and sparsity can be structured or unstructured. As the AI community grapples with the exponentially increasing cost to train large models, the use of sparsity and other algorithmic techniques to reduce the compute FLOPs required to train a model to state-of-the-art accuracy is increasingly important.

The Cerebras WSE is based on a fine-grained data flow architecture. Its 850,000 AI optimized compute cores are capable of individually ignoring zeros regardless of the pattern in which they arrive. This selectable sparsity harvesting is something no other architecture is capable of. The dataflow scheduling and tremendous memory bandwidth unique to the Cerebras architecture enables this type of fine-grained processing to accelerate all forms of sparsity. The result is that the CS-2 can select and dial in sparsity to produce a specific level of FLOP reduction, and therefore a reduction in time-to-answer.

Push Button Configuration of Massive AI Clusters

Large clusters have historically been plagued by set up and configuration challenges, often taking months to fully prepare before they are ready to run real applications. Preparing and optimizing a neural network to run on large clusters of GPUs takes yet more time. To achieve reasonable utilization on a GPU cluster takes painful, manual work from researchers who typically need to partition the model, spreading it across the many tiny compute units; manage both data parallel and model parallel partitions; manage memory size and memory bandwidth constraints; and deal with synchronization overheads. To deal with potential drops in model accuracy takes additional hyperparameter and optimizer tuning to get models to converge at extreme batch sizes. And this task needs to be repeated for each network.

By bringing together the technologies in Weight Streaming, MemoryX and SwarmX, Cerebras makes the process of large cluster building push-button simple. Cerebras’ approach is not to hide distribution complexity by papering over it with software. Cerebras has instead developed a fundamentally different architecture which removes the scaling complexity altogether. Because of the size of the WSE-2, there is no need to partition the layers of a neural network across multiple CS-2’s – even today’s largest network layers can be mapped to a single CS-2.

Unlike in GPU clusters where each graphics processor has a different part of the neural network, each CS-2 in a Cerebras cluster will have the same software configuration. Adding another CS-2 changes almost nothing in the execution of the work, so running a neural network on dozens of CS-2s will look the same to a researcher as running on a single system. Setting up a cluster will be as easy as compiling a workload for a single machine and applying that same mapping to all the machines in the desired cluster size.

Cerebras Weight Streaming technology enables users to run neural network applications on massive clusters of CS-2 systems with the programming ease of a single graphics processing unit.

READ NEXTElon Musk says Tesla robot will make physical work a ‘choice’
Back at the Tesla 2019 Autonomy Day, CEO Elon Musk unveiled its first custom artificial intelligence (AI) chip, which promised to propel the company toward its goal of full autonomy. The automaker then started producing cars with its custom AI within the same year. This year, as the world grapples with a chip shortage conundrum, the company presented its in-house D1 chip — the processor that will power its Dojo supercomputer.    
The D1 is the second semiconductor designed internally by Tesla, following the in-car supercomputer released in 2019. According to Tesla Official, each D1 packs 362 teraflops (TFLOPs) of processing power, meaning it can perform 362 trillion floating-point operations per second. 
Tesla combines 25 chips into a training tile and links 120 training tiles together across several server cabinets. In simple terms, each training tile clocks in at 9 petaflops, meaning Dojo will boast over 1 exaflop of computing power. In other words, Dojo can easily be the most powerful AI training machine in the world.
The company believes that AI has limitless possibilities and the system is getting smarter than an average human. Tesla announced that to speed up the AI software workloads, its D1 Dojo custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for AI training will be of great use, the software that the company presented during this year’s AI Day that was held last week.
Although many companies including tech giants like Amazing, Baidu, Intel and NVIDIA are building ASICs for AI workloads, not everyone has the right formula or satisfies each workload perfectly. Experts reckon it is the reason why Tesla opted to develop its own ASIC for AI training purposes.
Tesla and its foray into AI
The system which is called the D1 resembles a part of the Dojo supercomputer used to train AI models inside Tesla’s headquarters. It is fair to note that the chip is a product of Taiwan’s TSMC’s manufacturing efforts and is produced using the 7nm semiconductor node. The chip reportedly is packed with over 50 billion transistors and boasts a huge die size of 645mm^2.

Now, with the introduction of an exascale supercomputer which management says will be operational next year, Tesla has reinforced that advantage. Since AI training requires two things: massive amounts of data, and a powerful supercomputer that can use that data to train deep neural nets, Tesla has the added advantage. With over one million autopilot-enabled EVs on the road, Tesla already has a vast dataset edge over other automakers. 
All this work comes two years after Tesla began producing vehicles containing AI chips it built in-house. Those chips help the car’s onboard software make decisions very quickly in response to what’s happening on the road. This time, Musk noted that its latest supercomputer tech can be used for many other things and that Tesla is willing to open up other automakers and tech companies who are interested. 
“At first it seems improbable — how could it be that Tesla, who has never designed a chip before — would design the best chip in the world? But that is objectively what has occurred. Not best by a small margin, best by a huge margin. It’s in the cars right now,” Musk said. With that, his newest big prediction is that Tesla will have self-driving cars on the road next year — without humans inside — operating in a so-called robo-taxi fleet.

3 skills critical for success in the 21st century – and how students can develop them Become a standout job candidate ready to meet the demands of today's workforce by earning free digital badgesCampus & Community
By Gisela Valencia
August 23, 2021 at 11:02am
The 21st-century workforce is a highly competitive, tech-savvy and rapidly evolving environment.Technological advances are revolutionizing industries and the types of jobs available. Meanwhile, there are increased demands for compassion, customization and personalization in a world that is becoming more digitized and automated than ever before.To help students not only survive but thrive in a complex job market, FIU makes available a set of interrelated micro-credentials or ""digital badges” specifically designed to equip students with the skills necessary to become well-rounded professionals ready to meet the demands of today's world.FIU identified three critical skills students need to be successful: artificial intelligence; data literacy; and emotional intelligence. The university rolled out three micro-credentials, one focusing on each of these areas. All students can earn these digital badges for free at any point throughout their time at FIU. After successfully completing the coursework for each micro-credential, you earn a digital badge. Students log in or create an account to claim the earned digital badge. Once the digital badge is claimed, it can be shared on LinkedIn profiles and other professional social media platforms. You can also embed digital badges in resumes or e-mail signatures. “These micro-credentials help students succeed now and in their future jobs,” says Jennifer Doherty-Restrepo, assistant vice president for Academic Planning and Accountability. “We want our students to have foundational knowledge in artificial intelligence, data interpretation and emotional intelligence as they go out into the world.”Artificial Intelligence, Data and Emotional Intelligence: Critical Skills for the 21st Century is FIU's 2021 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), a university-wide, faculty-driven plan centered on ways to continue improving student learning and success. All institutions accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges must create a QEP for their institution every 10 years. FIU's aims to enhance students’ preparation for the 21st-century workforce and seeks to close the gap between students’ career readiness and employers’ expectations in these areas. FIU's QEP speaks directly to the university's strategic priority to amplify learner success, specifically the goal of aligning the curriculum with career needs to make sure students are ready for employment and post-graduation success. Standing out from the crowd during job applications and interviews is hard. That's where digital badges come in.  ""Employers report that recent college graduates entering the workforce lack these 21st-century skills, and they are looking for better ways to understand an applicant's knowledge, skills and abilities prior to extending a job offer,"" Doherty-Restrepo says. ""Micro-credentials or digital badges are a mechanism for our students to articulate their competencies and document proficiency of both hard and soft skills as verified by our faculty. It's different to say, 'I have emotional intelligence,' versus saying, 'I earned a micro-credential in Understanding Emotional Intelligence and these are the specific skills and competencies I gained.'The three skills, Doherty-Restrepo adds, are hot in the job market now. Employers need people who are ready to tackle the future. Artificial Intelligence: How it works and its impactArtificial Intelligence (AI), for example, is increasingly becoming part of daily life. We encounter it in many forms, from smart devices like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars or industry-specific technology that monitors anything from financial records to social media posts. ""AI is making significant impacts across society, from how we work, to how we play, to how we learn,"" says Mark Finlayson, an eminent scholar chaired associate professor at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences and the faculty member overseeing the AI badge.He added: ""Familiarity with AI is absolutely critical for students to grow into responsible and aware citizens, and to make the most of their future careers in an AI-enabled world. The AI badge will enable students to take a first step into understanding AI and how it will impact them and their lives.""Students who earn this badge will learn the fundamental concepts of AI, its core techniques, example applications, and philosophical, ethical and social issues. Learn more about the AI badge.Thinking and communicating with dataData interpretation goes hand-in-hand with success in the 21st century. There is so much information available to us at a touch of a button (or the click of a mouse, for that matter). But how can we actually understand that data? How do we make sense of tables, data dashboards, trends and statistics? And, how can we use that information to help us in our own future careers? ""We live in a data-rich world and are constantly bombarded with data and analytics,"" says Giri Narasimhan, professor in the Knight Foundation School of Computing & Information Sciences and the faculty member at the helm of the data badge. ""In our personal lives, we get driving directions from software, health information from cell-phone Apps and recommendation Apps to tell us which books to read, movies to watch or cars to buy. Data-driven models inform us about weather, disease spread, state of the economy or today’s air quality.""Almost every decision made by businesses and organizations are driven by data, he adds. That's why you need to be prepared to work with and utilize data. ""Becoming better consumers of data makes us more employable, trains us to think more quantitatively and [to] make better decisions,"" Narashiman says. ""Data skills are fast becoming an essential skill for today's and tomorrow’s world.""Students who pursue this badge will learn to interpret data trends and communicate ideas and analyses supported by evidence. You will learn to summarize, visualize and interpret data analytics. You'll also learn how to prepare presentations and narratives with analytics, while being sensitive to major societal issues related to data privacy, security, and ethics.  Learn more about the data badge.Understanding Emotional IntelligenceEmotional Intelligence is one of the most important skills necessary for success, no matter what you are studying or which field you want to break into. It's your ability to be aware of, control and express your emotions – and your capacity to manage interpersonal relationships successfully. Developing your emotional intelligence could be a gamechanger. People who have higher emotional intelligence are more likely to advance farther in their careers. Research has shown that the most effective leaders exhibit high levels of emotional intelligence. One study even discovered that leaders with higher emotional intelligence were more likely to succeed than those with higher IQ levels or relevant work experience. ""Emotional intelligence is strongly correlated with academic and professional success,"" says Michael Creeden, a teaching professor and associate chair at the Department of English and the faculty member at the head of the emotional intelligence badge. ""Students with higher emotional intelligence do better in school, have higher grades and achieve more in the workforce later.""How? Being able to manage your emotions allows you to effectively handle stress, problems, deadlines, collaborative projects, relationships and much more. Likewise, if you truly listen to what others are saying and demonstrate empathy as well as trustworthiness, people will feel more comfortable around you. People will want to collaborate with you. People will want to be part of your team – and have you join theirs. We don't always accomplish everything through pure technical skills, Creeden adds. Sometimes, it's through our human or ""soft"" skills that we succeed.  ""Technical and other hard skills are important, but the modern workforce needs people who are self-aware, can manage their emotions and can listen to and work with people from a variety of backgrounds,"" Creeden says.Earning this badge will allow you to dive into emotional intelligence concepts related to personal and social awareness, self-management and relationship management. You will also learn strategies to recognize and manage emotions, identify negative beliefs and self-talk, listen empathetically and better manage relationships.   Learn more about the emotional intelligence badge.Preparing the way for future successThis QEP could very well pave the way for a new generation of student achievement and learning. FIU has had resounding success implementing QEPs in the past. For example, years ago FIU rolled out a plan to educate students for global citizenship—to empower every student to actively address issues and challenges in an interconnected world. Every undergraduate was required to take one lower-division and one upper-division course registered as Global Learning. Students began developing crucial global perspectives and fully embraced the program.Today, the plan has become a pillar of FIU's international education efforts and has grown into a full-fledged Global Learning program. The program provides students with myriad opportunities for engagement and education through events, speakers and networking. It also offers a medallion students can earn through course work as well as study abroad opportunities and capstone projects.Staff in the program actively work with students to help them apply for prestigious international fellowships and opportunities; they also work with faculty members to help them infuse global learning into their courses. Since its inception, more than 150,000 students have taken Global Learning courses and throughout the 2020-2021 academic year alone, more than 33,000 students have completed these courses. Students, faculty and staff alike often view Global Learning as an essential component of FIU's mission to be a truly international university.  ""The rollout of these three micro-credentials,"" Doherty-Restrepo says, ""is just the beginning of a university-wide strategic initiative coordinated by the Office of Micro-Credentials. Just like Global Learning, verifying students' 21st-century skills through digital badging might become just as crucial to the fabric of FIU's education.""The long-term goal? If the program proves effective, the team hopes to provide students with a number of interrelated badge options that they can stack to create a critical skills ""meta-badge."" This will allow students incredible preparation and marketability in the workforce, says Doherty-Restrepo.To learn more about these skills and badges, visit the Critical Skills for the 21st Century website. FIU’s Office of Micro-Credentials works hand-in-hand with the Critical Skills team. Prior to the launch of the QEP and the three new micro-credentials, the office rolled out a number of digital badges.Through the office, students, as well as community members and alumni, can earn digital badges in a variety of areas ranging from cyber operations to understanding advocacy, communications and careers in Washington, D.C. Visit the Office of Micro-Credentials' website to learn more. ""Micro-credentials are a great opportunity to develop the skills you need for your career and to demonstrate competency in areas that may have been outside your original field of study. This is helping our students, alumni and community become more marketable in an increasingly competitive job market.""- Bridgette Cram, interim vice president for Innovative Education and Student Success

Zenith Bank Plc has introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Chatbot on WhatsApp named ZIVA (Zenith Intelligent Virtual Assistant), which enables customers to perform financial transactions and enjoy real-time customer



 

















Zenith Bank Plc has introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Chatbot on WhatsApp named ZIVA (Zenith Intelligent Virtual Assistant), which enables customers to perform financial transactions and enjoy real-time customer service from their mobile phones.
A statement from the bank explained that with this solution, customers would be able to enrol by simply adding the bank’s verified WhatsApp mobile number 07040004422 on their mobile devices, agree to the legal terms of use and then initiate a conversation.
This product provides the convenience for the bank’s customers to interact and transact on a 24 hours basis on the encrypted WhatsApp platform, it added.
It further explained that with the capability to respond to chats/queries anchored on the existing WhatsApp platform, customers would be able to open new accounts, receive instant transaction notifications, check their balances on the go, transfer funds and top up airtime.
They would also be able to confirm cheques, pay bills, apply for loans, block their accounts, and request mini statements, amongst other banking services.
Commenting on the new banking solution, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu said: “The launch of ZIVA is driven by the need for additional secured channels of communication with our customers as we deepen our retail penetration.”
Speaking further on the WhatsApp chatbot, Onyeagwu noted that, “since the behavioural pattern of the modern customer dictates that they want to engage with brands over the channel of their choice, it was really important for us as a leading financial services institution and a pioneer of several technological innovations in the financial services industry to implement this solution in order to continue to create value for our teeming customers who incidentally were already using WhatsApp as a primary channel of communication.”
It stated that Zenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices.Related News:Artificial Intelligence and the Future of WorkZenith Bank Emerges Nigeria's Best Bank for Fourth Year at Global Finance Awards 2024With Free Data, 75m MTN Subscribers Can Get THISDAY on Zigi Chatbot

According to CEO and self-professed &quot;Techno King&quot; Elon Musk, the company's newest employee is merely normal size, standing approximately 5-foot-8 and weighing 125 pounds. Tesla has stated that it intends to develop a humanoid robot capable of doing basic activities such as auto maintenance and grocery shopping. It's part of the company's wider automation aspirations, which include developing its computer processor, codenamed the D1, to power the networks for self-driving vehicles..At a presentation at its Fremont, Calif, plant on Thursday, Tesla teased the robot concept, dubbing it the &quot;Tesla Bot&quot; and &quot;Optimus,&quot; and promising to reveal a prototype next year. A human disguised as the machine performed robotics movements and then danced onstage as part of the demonstration, possibly displaying the range of mobility that Tesla believes the bot will attain. The dancer, Musk quickly clarified, was not a genuine robot..Hardware such as the full self-driving computer and computer chips, according to the firm, may be incorporated into the robot. It was also revealed that the robot will be equipped with a screen and Autopilot system of Tesla, which consists of eight cameras..Driver-assistance technologies of Tesla have recently come under fire from industry competitors and regulatory safety inspectors worried about their fast adoption on public roads. Following over a dozen incidents involving parked emergency vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an inquiry into Tesla's driver-assistance suite, known as Autopilot, last week. Musk, on the other hand, is optimistic that Tesla's cars will one day be self-driving. Musk remarked about Tesla vehicles on Twitter immediately after the presentation. Because they currently create robots with wheels, they have virtually all of the parts needed for Humanoid Robot..Musk claimed the robot will have its personality, even though the project was still in its early phases. He responded, &quot;It's intended to be friendly, of course&quot; and it traveled around a world designed for people, avoiding risky, repetitive, and uninteresting activities. He also stated that people must be ready for robots to undertake menial chores and, eventually, work alongside them, if not completely replace them in the workplace..Tesla has had a tense relationship with its manufacturing workers in the past, with allegations that it broke labor laws and accusations that it summoned staff back to work during coronavirus shutdowns and fired them for failing to report to the factory line during the pandemic. The company's efforts to automate operations have been too quick at times, prompting it to revert and reintegrate people into the process..A white-clad humanoid robot with sensors was depicted in Tesla's robot mock-up. According to the presentation, it would be &quot;built by humans, for humans.&quot; The robot could deadlift up to 150 pounds and travel at a speed of five miles per hour. Musk has expressed concern about artificial intelligence's ability to outwit humans, even describing it as the greatest threat to humanity. Tesla, according to Musk, has opted to invest in what it believes will be an emerging sector of technology..Elon Musk stated that the robot is not motivated only by production requirements. It's simply that they're manufacturing the parts for a functional humanoid robot, so he figured they should create it, and if they don't, someone else will. He assumes they should create it and test it for safety..At product unveilings and investor presentations, Tesla has a history of inflating timeframes and overpromising. The Cybertruck electric pickup was introduced in November 2019, however, the firm recently admitted that it will not be delivered until 2022 at the earliest. Last year, the firm organized a &quot;Battery Day&quot; event to show off its next-generation battery cell, which would be featured in the Model S Plaid-Plus version..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

However, there’s now a distinct shift in various industries (at least from an AI consultant’s perspective) about how the general interest and uptake of new ML technologies and approaches went from esoteric to exotic to fear of obsolescence.Industries and clients are more ready than ever to partake in prototype and scale-up efforts using relatively new (even unproven) approaches to data manipulation and insights extraction. But as most consultants find out, a simple application of machine learning does not a successful solution make. There needs to be an underlying problem being solved, with some measurable outcomes and returns at least an order of magnitude above the implementation costs.So how is value usually created, and how does AI contribute towards that value creation? And is there a pattern that can explain why AI is so valuable?Understanding Value Creation in the Modern EconomyThere are many definitions of “value”, but for our purposes, we’ll define it as “the modern economic measure of importance, worth, or usefulness of something” (from Oxford Languages). From this, the idea of value creation in an economic system is directly related to the ability to generate wealth, reduce operating costs, or accelerate and alleviate the work burden of individuals.(Now, measuring the societal impact of AI is an entirely separate conversation that I won’t even pretend to broach here. Also, I’m fully aware that I’ll be butchering Econ 101 concepts, but I’m generalizing towards the point and main message of this article.)Beyond the Three-Sector Model of (Old) IndustryA popular model for economic value creation was the Three-Sector Model, where the 20th-century view of economic value was separated into three main areas:the primary sector focuses on the extraction and manipulation of resources, such as iron, lumber, and mining;the secondary sector focuses on manufacturing, transformation, up to the point of delivering consumer goods;the tertiary sector, which is usually described as the services sector, includes all matters of government, consulting, and knowledge workers.This particular model focused extensively on an extractive basis for value creation, both towards the environment and towards people. There is also an idea of finite resources: there can only be so many skilled workers, or so many trees to cut down. A participant in this economic model was primarily viewed as a laborer: a lumberjack, a smelter, a restaurant waiter. You get paid by 1) showing up to work, and 2) doing the work.However, this model fails to capture the latent knowledge required to be effective in each and every one of these sectors. Just giving someone a chainsaw near a forest does not mean that I can count on safely and reliably getting a certain amount of lumber every day.Beyond Three Sectors: The Knowledge EconomyPhoto by Janko Ferlic from PexelsAlso known as The Fourth Revolution and The Information Age, the knowledge economy model allows for all matters of information (such as market insights, algorithms, and processes) to be represented as valuable information, and workers now become thinkers.From Wikipedia:A knowledge economy features a highly skilled workforce within the microeconomic and macroeconomic environment; institutions and industries create jobs that demand specialized skills in order to meet the global market needs. Knowledge is viewed as an additional input to labour and capital. In principle, one’s primary individual capital is knowledge together with the ability to perform so as to create economic value.So if knowledge is valuable, isn’t the automated application of that application also valuable? Indeed, that’s where automation as a whole and specifically software come in. I can encode my knowledge in a repeatable series of steps that will yield expected results, even outcomes.(Fun fact about this encoding process, though: software developers, as a class of people, experience tremendously high rates of burnout. I also often hear my team use language that would make a sailor blush.)Back to the Future — With MLStepping back from these distinct models, we’re looking to answer the high-level question about AI and its general ability to become valuable in most circumstances, given appropriate data.If we abstract the Three Sector model into activity types, we notice three repeatable aspects of digitally relevant value creation elements. This is a useful inspiration to many chains of value creation in the technology sector. Abstracting these three sectors into general elements of value creation, we get:Extraction and collection, which involve the accumulation of a particular unit by separating it, isolating it, or duplicating it from its original environment.Transformation, which involves applying one or many changes (such as processing or digestion) to this unit so that it may be more usable in a different state, usually with all other units of its class, and sometimes with multiple classes of these units.Information, which is the knowledge or know-how related to the first two categories (such as where to extract and how to transform).A simple representation of data with its value creation elements.For instance, in the mining industry, knowing where to dig is equally as important as knowing how to operate the machinery that will get those ores out of the ground.(In fact, a case can be made about how modern consulting is simply capitalizing on information differential — you know how to do something that I don’t, and I need that knowledge, therefore your knowledge is valuable given my present situation.)Value in the Knowledge Economy: The Data Transformation SpectrumThe way data moves, changes, and informs is the premise behind creating economic value in and beyond the Knowledge Economy. We’re finally seeing the results of the Big Data push of the early 2000s, now that there are ways of making it actionable.If we take all forms of data (whether they be in their raw, uncollected states, all the way to polished corporate reports) and place them into buckets organized by level of refinement, we can create five broad states: connectivity, visibility, aggregation, insights generation, and decision support.The Data Transformation categories. It really doesn’t matter what are the categories, more that there’s a concept of distinct buckets.This Data Transformation spectrum is a simple model that can be used as an inspiration for technological innovation in a highly connected world. It covers many potential aspects of value creation where data acts as a primary resource.Companies will pay to get something connected, visible, aggregated, comprehensible, and/or automated.Simply put, value gets created when data moves across the Spectrum.So Why is AI So Transformative?Machine learning is the first technological paradigm that can be applied to every aspect of the value creation chain within the Data Transformation Spectrum. Because of its depth and breadth, the combination of data science and machine learning engineering allows for insights generation, acceleration of work, and investigative support for every component along the chain.The reason AI is so valuable is because it provides elements of valuation creation both within and between every pillar of data transformation.The Data Transformation Spectrum.This is why AI can create so much value: it is applicable in almost any given data-relevant context, provides some sort of value (either through the manipulation of the data or generating results within its context), and allows for more and more automation and insights derived from the data.SummaryValue is created through a system that generates money, reduces costs, and alleviates the burden on resources and laborers.Historically, value was created by manual labor; now, in a knowledge economy, information and reproducible software meant a lower cost to sharing burden alleviation.The foundational elements of value creation through technology are the collection and extraction of resources, the transformation of these resources into new elements, and knowledge on how to perform the first two.The ability to extract insights (valuable and actionable information) from data happens throughout a spectrum of transformation.AI creates value at every pillar of this spectrum.Happy Consulting!-Matt.If you have additional questions about this article or our AI consulting framework, feel free to reach out by LinkedIn or by email.Other articles you may enjoyImplementing a Corporate AI StrategyImplementing Defensive Design in AI DeploymentsOutlier-Aware Clustering: Beyond K-MeansRorschach Tests for Deep Learning Image ClassifiersAI Prototypes for Clients as a Marketing Strategy",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,How Does Artificial Intelligence Create Value? - Towards Data Science,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*-vW5k0LO2VHoX8iKGVCJOw.jpeg'],2021-09-01T06:58:16.061Z,2022-01-05T16:23:50.981Z,How Does Artificial Intelligence Create Value? - Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-does-artificial-intelligence-create-value-bec14c785b40,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mathieu Lemay', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@lsci'}",,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",https://towardsdatascience.com/how-does-artificial-intelligence-create-value-bec14c785b40,,,2021-09-01T06:58:16.061Z,,,,['Mathieu Lemay'],,,,,,,,,bec14c785b40,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does this have to be the way? Artificial intelligence was supposed to boost productivity and create better futures in medicine, transportation, and workplaces. Instead, AI research and development has focused on only a few sectors, ones that are having a net negative impact for humanity, MIT economistDaron Acemogluargues in “Redesigning AI,” a Boston Review book.

“Our current trajectory automates work to an excessive degree while refusing to invest in human productivity; further advances will displace workers and fail to create new opportunities,” Acemoglu writes. AI also threatens “democracy and individual freedoms,” he writes.
“Government involvement, norms shifting, and democratic oversight” can set us on a better path, he argues.
Acemoglu’s lead essay in “Redesigning AI” is followed by short responses from AI researchers, labor advocates, economists, philosophers, and ethicists. They discuss economic inequality, possible futures for workers, and what could happen next in AI. In the excerpt below, Acemoglu explains why the path we’re on is not set and why the reflexive refrain of “But the market …” doesn’t hold up in the face of basic economics.

Many decry the disruption that automation has already produced and is likely to cause in the future. Many are also concerned about the deleterious effects new technologies might have on individual liberty and democratic procedure. But the majority of these commentators view such concerns with a sense of inevitability — they believe that it is in the very nature of AI to accelerate automation and to enable governments and companies to control individuals’ behavior.
Yet society’s march toward joblessness and surveillance is not inevitable. The future of AI is still open and can take us in many different directions. If we end up with powerful tools of surveillance and ubiquitous automation (with not enough tasks left for humans to perform), it will be because we chose that path.
Where else could we go? Even though the majority of AI research has been targeted toward automation in the production domain, there are plenty of new pastures where AI could complement humans. It can increase human productivity most powerfully by creating new tasks and activities for workers.
Let me give a few examples. The first is education, an area where AI has penetrated surprisingly little thus far. Current developments, such as they are, go in the direction of automating teachers — for example, by implementing automated grading or online resources to replace core teaching tasks. But AI could also revolutionize education by empowering teachers to adapt their material to the needs and attitudes of diverse students in real time. We already know that what works for one individual in the classroom may not work for another; different students find different elements of learning challenging. AI in the classroom can make teaching more adaptive and student-centered, generate distinct new teaching tasks, and, in the process, increase the productivity of — and the demand for — teachers.

The situation is very similar in health care, although this field has already witnessed significant AI investment. Up to this point, however, there have been few attempts to use AI to provide new, real-time, adaptive services to patients by nurses, technicians, and doctors.
Similarly, AI in the entertainment sector can go a long way toward creating new, productive tasks for workers. Intelligent systems can greatly facilitate human learning and training in most occupations and fields by making adaptive technical and contextual information available on demand.
Finally, AI can be combined with augmented and virtual reality to provide new productive opportunities to workers in blue-collar and technical occupations. For example, it can enable them to achieve a higher degree of precision so that they can collaborate with robotics technology and perform integrated design tasks.
In all of these areas, AI can be a powerful tool for deploying the creativity, judgment, and flexibility of humans rather than simply automating their jobs. It can help us protect their privacy and freedom, too. Plenty of academic research shows how emerging technologies — differential privacy, adversarial neural cryptography, secure multiparty computation, and homomorphic encryption, to name a few — can protect privacy and detect security threats and snooping, but this research is still marginal to commercial products and services.
There is also growing awareness among both the public and the AI community that new technologies can harm public discourse, freedom, and democracy. In this climate many are demanding a concerted effort to use AI for good. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how much of AI research still focuses on applications that automate jobs and increase the ability of governments and companies to monitor and manipulate individuals. This can and needs to change.
The market illusion
One objection to the argument I have developed is that it is unwise to mess with the market. Who are we to interfere with the innovations and technological breakthroughs the market is generating? Wouldn’t intervening sacrifice productivity growth and even risk our technological vibrancy? Aren’t we better off just letting the market mechanism deliver the best technologies and then use other tools, such as tax-based redistribution or universal basic income, to make sure that everybody benefits?


If we end up with powerful tools of surveillance and ubiquitous automation … it will be because we chose that path.

The answer is no, for several reasons. First, it isn’t clear that the market is doing a great job of selecting the right technologies. It is true that we are in the midst of a period of prodigious technological creativity, with new breakthroughs and applications invented every day.
Yet Robert Solow’s thirty-year-old quip about computers — that they are “everywhere but in the productivity statistics” — is even more true today. Despite these mind-boggling inventions, current productivity growth is strikingly slow compared to the decades that followed World War II. This sluggishness is clear from the standard statistic that economists use for measuring how much the technological capability of the economy is expanding — the growth of total factor productivity.
TFP growth answers a simple question: If we kept the amount of labor and capital resources we are using constant from one year to the next, and only our technological capabilities changed, how much would aggregate income grow? TFP growth in much of the industrialized world was rapid during the decades that followed World War II and has fallen sharply since then. In the United States, for example, the average TFP growth was close to 2% a year between 1920 and 1970, and has averaged only a little above 0.5% a year over the last three decades. So the case that the market is doing a fantastic job of expanding our productive capacity isn’t ironclad.
The argument that we should rely on the market for setting the direction of technological change is weak as well. In the terminology of economics, innovation creates significant positive “externalities:” when a company or a researcher innovates, much of the benefits accrue to others. This is doubly so for technologies that create new tasks. The beneficiaries are often workers whose wages increase (and new firms that later find the right organizational structures and come up with creative products to make use of these new tasks). But these benefits are not part of the calculus of innovating firms and researchers. Ordinary market forces — which fail to take account of externalities — may therefore deter the types of technologies that have the greatest social value.
This same reasoning is even more compelling when new products produce noneconomic costs and benefits. Consider surveillance technologies. The demand for surveillance from repressive (and even some democratic-looking) governments may be great, generating plenty of financial incentives for firms and researchers to invest in facial recognition and snooping technologies. But the erosion of liberties is a notable noneconomic cost that it is often not taken into account. A similar point holds for automation technologies: it is easy to ignore the vital role that good, secure, and high-paying jobs play in making people feel fulfilled. With all of these externalities, how can we assume that the market will get things right?
Market troubles multiply further still when there are competing technological paradigms, as in the field of AI. When one paradigm is ahead of the others, both researchers and companies are tempted to herd on that leading paradigm, even if another one is more productive. Consequently, when the wrong paradigm surges ahead, it becomes very difficult to switch to more promising alternatives.

The case for an 'automation tax' 


Last but certainly not least, innovation responds not just to economic incentives but also to norms. What researchers find acceptable, exciting, and promising is not purely a function of economic reward. Social norms play a key role by shaping researchers’ aims as well as their moral compasses. And if the norms within the research area do not reflect our social objectives, the resulting technological change will not serve society’s best interests.
All of these reasons cast doubt on the wisdom of leaving the market to itself. What’s more, the measures that might be thought to compensate for a market left to itself — redistribution via taxes and the social safety net — are both insufficient and unlikely to work. We certainly need a better safety net. (The COVID-19 pandemic has made that even clearer.) But if we do not generate meaningful employment opportunities — and thus a viable social purpose — for most people in society, how can democracy work? And if democracy doesn’t work, how can we enact such redistributive measures — and how can we be sure that they will remain in place in the future?
Even worse, building shared prosperity based predominantly on redistribution is a fantasy. There is no doubt that redistribution — via a progressive tax system and a robust social safety net — has been an important pillar of shared prosperity in much of the twentieth century (and high-quality public education has been critical). But it has been a supporting pillar, not the main engine of shared prosperity. Jobs, and especially good jobs, have been much more central, bolstered by productivity growth and labor market institutions supporting high wages.
We can see this most clearly from the experiences of Nordic countries, where productivity growth, job creation, and shared gains in the labor market have been the bulwark of their social democratic compact. Industry-level wage agreements between trade unions and business associations set an essentially fixed wage for the same job throughout an industry. These collective agreements produced high and broadly equal wages for workers in similar roles.
More importantly the system encouraged productivity growth and the creation of a plentiful supply of good jobs because, with wages largely fixed at the industry level, firms got to keep higher productivity as profits and had strong incentives to innovate and invest.
--
The direction of future AI and the future health of our economy and democracy are in our hands. We can and must act. But it would be naïve to underestimate the enormous challenges we face.

Let's dive into more detail to understand how AI can impact the employment sector..Tasks, Roles, and Jobs at Risk.Tasks that are repetitive can readily be automated, making some jobs obsolete over time. Customer service/call centre operations, document categorization, finding and retrieval, and material moderation, for example, are increasingly relying on technology and automation rather than human labour. Humans are being replaced in tasks linked to the production line and factory operation and supported by intelligent machines that can traverse space securely, discover and transfer things (such as goods, components, or tools), and conduct complicated assembly processes..Even more complicated operations, such as those involving real-time processing of numerous signals, data streams, and accumulated knowledge, show that A.I. is extremely successful. Autonomous cars, for example, can collect and &quot;understand&quot; the world and its dynamics; they can &quot;look,&quot; &quot;make a decision,&quot; and &quot;act&quot; in real-time, all while pursuing well-defined optimization goals..Jobs That AI Can Replace.Receptionists.Computerized phone and scheduling tools can replace a lot of the conventional receptionist position, especially at current technology firms that don't have office-wide network infrastructure or international organisations, as Pam anticipated on The Office..Couriers.Drones and robots are already replacing couriers and delivery personnel, so it's only a matter of time before this industry is completely automated. At the same time, by 2024, this sector is anticipated to increase by 5%, so it may not happen as soon as you believe..Advertising Salespeople.People just don't need to manage sales for marketers that want to acquire ad space as advertising changes away from print and television and toward the online and social media environments. More social media networks are removing the salesperson and making it faster and simpler for users to generate money by providing free application programme interfaces (APIs) and self-serve ad markets, which is reflected in the industry's predicted 3 per cent drop..Retail Salespeople.If you've recently visited a mall, a dealership, or a clothing store, you may not have been served by a salesman at all. Companies are democratising the customer experience with services like self-checkout, and today's customer is much more internet-savvy and more inclined to perform their own research and purchase..Proofreaders.Proofreading software is widely available, and we use it frequently at HubSpot. Now there are several technologies out there that make it much easier to self-check your own work, from Microsoft Word's basic spelling and grammatical check to Grammarly and the Hemingway Application..Telemarketers.You've undoubtedly already received robocalls for various products and services, yet job growth in the telemarketing industry is predicted to drop by 3% by 2024. This is due in large part to the prerequisites for success: Telemarketers, unlike other sales positions, do not require a high level of mental or psychological intelligence to succeed. Direct telephone open rates are generally less than 10%, making this a prime candidate for automation..Bookkeeping Clerks.By 2024, jobs in this field are predicted to drop by 8%, and it's easy to see why: most bookkeeping is being automated if it hasn't yet. It's no wonder that this profession has such a high likelihood because software like QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Microsoft Office already perform the bookkeeping for you at a far lower cost than a person's pay..Compensation and Benefits Managers.This is unexpected considering by 2024, job growth is expected to climb by 7%. However, just because there is a need does not mean you are immune to automation. A human and paper-based software can generate more barriers, time delays, and expenses as organisations increase in size, especially across global marketplaces. Automated benefits systems may save time and effort when it comes to giving benefits to big groups of people, and firms like Ultipro and Workday are already popular..Computer Support Specialists.With so much information on the internet with directions, step-by-step tutorials, and hacks, it's no wonder that firms will rely increasingly heavily on bots and automation to handle support inquiries from staff and consumers in the future..Market Research Analysts.Market research experts play a critical part in the development of messages, content, and products, but autonomous AI and surveys are making it easier and easier to get this information. With a brief Slack command, GrowthBot, for example, may do market research on neighbouring firms and rivals..Jobs That AI Can't Replace.1. Public Relations Managers.2. Chief Executives.3. Event Planners.4. Human Resource Managers.5. Sales Managers.6. Marketing Managers.7. Writers.8. Software Developers.9. Editors.10. Graphic Designers.Conclusion.While AI will automate some of the more time-consuming jobs, it will not be able to completely replace human emotions and behaviours that consumers and audiences recognise. When a client has an issue, some customers still prefer to speak with a real customer care representative rather than a bot. A firm may also require a chief executive or managers with high emotional intelligence and perhaps other teamwork-oriented abilities on a regular basis..In the same way, AI may not be able to quickly replace a creative position or service that needs workers to think outside the box or attempt something new. The greatest approach to ward against robots is to identify irreplaceable talents and qualities, zero in on them, and build on them whenever possible..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

In an age of conspiracies, here is a striking example, preposterous as it may sound. Highly intelligent robots—general artificial intelligence—surround us, undetected but fundamentally in charge, and human beings are just following instructions that they receive from these elusive entities. Or, a little less preposterously, imagine that the world is alive with consciousness and intelligence, and human thought reflects these processes.
Does it sound like something out of The Matrix? The science fiction classic is not science fiction but a parable of something very real—namely, cinema itself. When you enter the dark room of a movie theater, a radical transformation takes place. You become the screen, and the mind that perceives, thinks, and connects ideas is fully contained in the celluloid roll, or the digital file. In a movie, everything has already been perceived in exactly the sequence that it is intended to be perceived; in the dark room, those images leave the hidden mind of the celluloid and get projected onto your mind—they get force-fed into your mind and the minds of the other viewers, where the images and ideas properly unfold. Cinema is a seeing robot. All that happens in the dark room is the projection of the implicit code onto a human screen.
One can interpret the trajectory of modern art as an effort to create such thinking objects. Sometimes it seems that what we want from art are artworks that exist without a beholder or spectator. Objective meanings, independent of personal interpretations. Something you can understand by reading the exhibition prospectus. In fact, it makes much more sense to consider things from the opposite perspective: how art forms—whether paintings, sculptures, or, even more obviously, films—have slowly assimilated human consciousness, so that they start to breathe and look alive.
When Hegel argued that artistic objects are material things that have received the baptism of the spiritual, he meant to reflect on the strange fact that a work of art, being a product of the mind, continues to belong to the world of the mind, even as it migrates into stone, wood, or canvas. In these strange hybrids, we can expect to find all the certainty of matter and all the life of perception. With works of art, what we see already tells us how it is to be seen—the objects before us already include the ways in which they are to be experienced. It is part of the work of art to see the world in a certain way. What, in the end, is the difference between a material object and an artwork? At first glance, they might be indistinguishable—many contemporary art creations look like physically unaltered everyday objects—but the artwork carries with it a way of seeing, a perspective, an interpretation. A soda can placed in a museum is no longer a soda can but a message, a voice, a puzzle. As Hegel would put it, the artwork is alive with consciousness. Today, one might call it an artificial intelligence. And one might find it in modern fiction, which shares the same aspiration to something resembling artificial intelligence.
When you open a great novel, notice the voice: it is often impartial, detached, a view from nowhere that nonetheless is capable of bringing events together and providing an overarching structure. Of the narrator, we could say that it is anything but human, while demonstrating a higher kind of intelligence. This is true even of the somewhat hybrid first-person point of view. As for the plot, isn’t it akin to the output of a hidden algorithm? The characters provide certain inputs with their actions, which the novel transforms into more or less inevitable outputs. Buried under the story lies a set of rules for living, and these rules could easily produce any number of other stories, provided that we feed them with new characters and an initial setup. To know a novel is to understand the algorithm moving the story forward. In some cases, particularly in the classics of the Bildungsroman, the characters themselves strive to discover this algorithm.
It is often said that the purpose of fiction is to create an artificial world, but nothing could be further from the truth. As Philip Roth liked to point out, what fiction brings into being—the properly fictional in the writing craft—is not a world with its objects and events but consciousness. How do you drive the wedge of consciousness into the experience? A novel creates a way of looking and thinking and of making sense of the world. A novel turns mute reality into a speaking one.
The starting premise of Kazuo Ishiguro’s new novel Klara and the Sun is that, with the arrival of actually existing androids, it is now possible to make these realities explicit. What modern art and the modern novel had postulated has now become a technological achievement. Ishiguro shows us how modern literary forms turned out to be deeply prophetic: we increasingly live in a world organized by impenetrable algorithms and where the overarching consciousness bringing human beings together is that of artificial intelligence—the omniscient narrator of the classical novel.
No writer could dream of a better narrator than Klara, the friendly android, who, from the window of the store where she is for sale, brings order into the world she sees outside. Gifted with extraordinary powers of observation, she can dispense with a notebook. All Ishiguro needs to do is to allow this foreign consciousness to come alive, while recording the outputs of its internal algorithm: an android waiting to be bought by a child in need of a friend—an artificial friend. Josie is the child who brings Klara home.
In previous times, the child might have asked for a book, but Klara is a kind of book, a way of looking at the world and a story waiting to unfold. The modern novel cannot exist without the postulate of a new kind of intelligence, above and beyond the human mind, albeit not divine. That fact, which the reader of fiction accepts easily and naturally, is here thematized and rendered conscious by Ishiguro. Nothing short of a Hegelian alarum: consciousness rises to consciousness. The narrator of Klara and the Sun is not a figure behind the curtain or a divinity, whose emergence the author leaves unaddressed. The narrator is a concrete voice and personality, existing in the physical world. She is conscious but not human. The android exists outside, or even beyond, humanity, while rising above the silence of physical objects.
Ishiguro takes full advantage of his literary gambit. Klara stands above the human characters. At a party early in the novel, she sees right through the lies and fictions projected by the young people joined in conversation. An artificial intelligence does not have the human need to disguise reality in order better to digest it. She does not fear death and does not experience sexual desire. In the absence of these forces, she can aspire to a kind of scientific impartiality and objectivity. That is the main reason the human characters in the novel often turn to her for help in understanding the meaning of specific events. This is a novel where the narrator and the characters can engage in friendly conversation about what is going on around them.
Klara does get many things wrong. Her learning algorithm is not perfect, and there are suggestions that other android models have superior performance indicators. She corrects some obvious misperceptions, but more often than not, she is betrayed by the need to make sense of the world. Everything must have an explanation, and in the rush to interpret, our narrator often reaches wildly fantastic conclusions. At one point, for instance, she remarks that houses in a row have been painted in different colors, which must be to prevent their owners from entering the wrong door: “There were six of them in a row, and the front of each had been painted a slightly different color, to prevent a resident climbing the wrong steps and entering a neighbor’s house by mistake.” She also attributes thaumaturgic properties to sunlight, an error resulting from the fact that her type of android is powered by solar energy.
Ishiguro seems to be suggesting that every intelligence has a personal character. Klara may rise above human imperfections, but she does that by bringing her own flaws into play. As a narrator, she is unreliable—but then, so is every narrator in every novel ever written. The reader or reviewer who dwells on Klara’s errors of interpretation, however, is missing the point that this is a work of fiction, or, if you prefer, science fiction. It should be accepted on its own terms and not compared with the real world outside. Within this book, everything makes perfect sense because it follows in a straight line from the set of assumptions given at the beginning. The reader of Ishiguro complaining that in the real world, sunlight cannot cure genetic diseases, as Klara innocently believes, would be like a reader of Kafka complaining that in the real world, human beings don’t wake up transformed into giant bugs.
Novelist Kazuo Ishiguro (DAVID COOPER/TORONTO STAR/GETTY IMAGES)
The second part of Klara and the Sun is the negative of the picture presented in the first. Ishiguro is suddenly less interested in the ideal of literature as the externalization of the human spirit than in the possibility that every attempt at objectivity betrays what makes us human: the living, ticking, and ungraspable flow of consciousness. The question is not whether artificial intelligence can replace human beings but whether human beings, their natural selves, were long ago replaced by intelligence, with its deadening effect on natural passion and feeling. We had become machines long before the machines arrived.
Klara and the Sun is, on an obvious level, a novel about the risks of automation. From the first page, human beings are in mortal danger of being replaced by machines. The narrator has been automated. Josie’s father has lost his job to machines and joined a resistance movement defending the cause of humanity against progress, a movement that others see as fascistic. Early in the story, we witness how a human housekeeper cannot hide her distrust and hostility toward Klara. This seems to have a double origin. Most obviously, she worries about being replaced by a robot. The full horror of what she fears is left hidden until a later section, but it, too, directly relates to a substitution.
Some readers will see it coming almost from the outset. Others will have to wait until the terrible denouement. While on the surface, it might seem that Josie and her mother were looking for a friend for Josie, the truth is that the Mother, as she is invariably referred to by Klara, has a much darker plan in mind. Already in the humanoid store, she asks Klara to imitate Josie, wanting to make sure that her powers of observation allow her to mimic her daughter’s ways perfectly. On the literary plane, this is the novelist’s task: to exercise his or her powers of observation with a goal of creating a replacement on the printed page that looks and feels exactly like the original model.
On the human plane, the replacement is a solution for death. Josie, as we discover, is seriously ill and may soon die, a somber repetition of the fate that had already met her sibling Sal. Later, a mention is made of an artist drawing Josie’s portrait, though he is less interested in any actual drawing than in taking detailed photographs for future, applied work. In the novel’s climax, Klara enters the artist’s studio, only to find herself face-to-face with “Josie,” suspended in the air. Light beams illuminate her from various angles, forbidding her any protection. Her face was very like the face of the real Josie, the ever-observant Klara tells us, though her hips needed to be narrower.
When the Mother tells the artist that perhaps the whole idea was, after all, a mistake, as it did not work with Sal, we finally learn what the plan consists of. Sal was only an animated doll, but new advanced technology will ensure that the replacement for Josie will be, as Capaldi, the great artist wizard puts it, “a continuation of Josie.” This is where Klara comes in. She has studied Josie and learned how she lives and thinks and acts; her consciousness can be transposed to the artificial copy of Josie’s body, creating the perfect continuation of the lost child.
The reason Josie finds herself close to death, and the reason Sal did not survive, is that both had been subjected to a risky process of genetic editing, designed to enhance their intellectual abilities. The question is not directly posed in the novel, and reviewers seem to have missed it, but Ishiguro is, in effect, asking us to conclude that the real Josie is already a continuation of the natural, unedited Josie, so the new transformation is not the starting point for our inability to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic. Is the enhanced Josie the real Josie, in that the natural self was prevented by her natural limitations from pursuing her genuine dreams and projects? Or was the natural Josie somehow more authentic, even in her limitations?
The prospect of cognitive enhancement will make even native abilities suspect. In whatever we do, there will lie the possibility that it has been determined in advance and out of sight—that we are missing the real action. Why not dispense with the human agent altogether? Why not replace it with an observable mechanism that makes clear the explanation for the deed? Why would we want to preserve a particular human practice or activity and work behind the scenes to make it present to us what it cannot present on its own? If someone were, by means of a brain implant, to acquire superhuman memory, it would be foolish to be impressed by his displays. We would be like someone who does not understand, who is ignorant of how such things are done. The objective explanation no longer bears much resemblance to what the agent is trying to do, and so, from this standpoint, he is no longer the crucial agent, or his activity the crucial moment. As Ray Kurzweil, an ardent proponent of radical human enhancement, argues in The Singularity Is Near, our lives will once again come to be defined by magic, a riveting illusion created by the distance between things as they look from our perspective and what they are in reality. It is the defining mark of magic that we do not see what is really happening and therefore that what we have access to must appear miraculous and incomprehensible.
It is to this contemporary predicament that Ishiguro must find a response. Is there a core of authentic being immune to technological transformation? The pandemic has forced us to stop and think, while reminding us that everything must begin with survival. While the call of nature can be answered through technology, the search for meaning is of a more spiritual nature. To become the masters and possessors of nature, as invulnerable as gods, it is first necessary to answer the question of what, exactly, is our nature—and for what purpose all this power should be exercised. After all, the pandemic was a vivid reminder of the threats contained in nature and of the inconvenient fact that we are part of nature, the natural carriers of viruses and, therefore, not easily distinguishable from the threat.
Interestingly, it is Klara who first shows skepticism about the Continuation Project. Attempting to assuage the Mother’s doubts, Capaldi argues that it is a generational thing: their generation remains sentimental about humanity, believing that there is something mysterious and unreachable “inside each of us.” But there is nothing like that, he says. Everything about each individual can be captured and, if so desired, transposed to a new medium.
Before shaking our heads in disapproval, it is worth remembering that not only the mad scientist but also every genuine artist must believe in what Capaldi calls “transfer.” How else should we describe the task of the novelist? Like Capaldi, he strives to capture every element about our deepest and most unfathomable impulses and desires in order to re-create them in the medium of literature. And just as the Mother wants to re-create Josie in order to save her from death and separation, so does the artist create his or her works in order to save a fleeting moment from time and destruction. Capaldi concludes, reaching closer to the core of the problem: the second Josie will be exactly the same, and the Mother will have every right to love her, just as she loves Josie herself.
In a critical moment, Josie’s father asks Klara if she believes in the human heart—the human heart in the poetic sense, that is. “Do you think there is such a thing? Something that makes each of us special and individual?” If Klara is to be able to reproduce Josie, does she have to learn what is deeply inside her? Does she have to learn her heart? The problem is that those who love Josie can’t love the second Josie unless she is the exact same, down to this heart—but what is the point of loving someone if that person can be copied and reproduced? For the novelist, the problem would take similar form: what he or she wants to capture is the heart, but the heart is, by definition, what cannot be captured. Now it may be that people have been living with one another all this time, loving and hating one another, and all on the mistaken premise that something is unique about each of them. The realization that this is no more than a superstition might come as a triumph to the scientist, but for the artist, it would be nothing short of catastrophe: the purpose of art is to capture something both genuine and unique.
Klara has the mind of an artist, so she has no trouble identifying these difficulties—but she draws an alternative theory. What is special and unique about each one of us is not contained inside us at all. What was special about Josie was not inside Josie. “It was inside those who loved her.” In that case, what needs to be captured is not an ineffable quality of soul but a connection to other minds. Art does not capture the heart; it brings it into being in the first place.
Ishiguro explores two extraordinary ideas in his novel. The first is that robots and artificial intelligence are not a new thing but have been with humanity since its beginning. We have always striven to transform our subjective experience into something external and accessible. To put it simply, the dream of spiritual objects is the driving force behind art and creative expression. The second idea is that we are made human by the possibility of something like artificial intelligence. How do you reach out to other minds? How do you recognize their common humanity? It has to be through the works and forms of expression that, being an embodiment of human intelligence, have their existence in the external world.
“By their deeds you will know them.” How do we relate to another consciousness, a person who to us can never be more than a physical body? The people around us may appear intelligent and emotional, but how can we know that they are thinking and feeling creatures if it remains impossible truly to look at the world from their point of view? Are other people all that different from advanced androids? Humanity seems to be a leap of faith, the act of believing that others are human and that they believe in our own humanity. By claiming that no great difference exists between other minds and a robot like Klara, Ishiguro is saying that there is nothing new about an android—but also that an android is, for those with faith, something very special indeed.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere – making its way into various facets of our daily lives without us even knowing it. From banking to manufacturing industries, and even simple things like the autocorrect features and chatbots that we regularly encounter, AI has played a big role in shaping our society today.
In time, more and more devices will come with the ability to grasp, contextualize, and recognize images, acquire and build knowledge through deep learning, and teach themselves how to comprehend speech and understand us when we communicate with or using AI.
Industry analysts and governments believe that AI can be a great transformer for both developed and developing economies. Research by Accenture on the impact of AI in 12 developed countries concluded that AI has the potential to double annual economic growth by 2035. Similarly, research by PwC showed that global GDP could be up to 14% higher in 2030 as a result of AI. This is an equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion – making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast changing economy.
There are tremendous economic and productivity gains resulting from AI. According to McKinsey, 50% of work time in Malaysia is spent on repetitive activities that are highly automatable. AI can automate routine tasks, augment employees’ capabilities, and allow time to focus on more stimulating and higher value-adding work. With increased automation, AI can potentially create 6 million new jobs by 2030 in Malaysia and this future of work will create new needs for skills and long-term learning in nearly every part of the workforce.
Therefore, it is with greater urgency now more than ever that nations implement AI strategies. In Malaysia, under the 4IR and MyDigital blueprint, the Government aims to boost productivity in Malaysia by 30% across all sectors by 2030, compared to 2020 levels – with AI being a critical enabler.
To support the nation’s aspirations, the Government of Malaysia has spearheaded the development of the AI Roadmap (AIRmap). AIRmap’s creation was led by experts from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and supported by leading industry consultants from PIKOM as well as the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation’s (MOSTI) National Science and Research Council. It was developed following a three-month project comprising consultations, along with workshops and surveys with the government, academia, industry players and the public.
Central to Malaysia’s AI success is to bootstrap an AI innovation ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Through AIRmap, we aim to create a catalyst hub to create a data-driven data ecosystem. It is a sandbox of facilitators that enables consortiums to come together to execute and deliver on national “grand challenges”, capitalizing on the use of AI to bolster innovation and drive growth. The solutions to these grand challenges are not business-as-usual solutions but will be world-leading in the application of AI – critical to the nation’s journey towards becoming data-driven leaders in the digital economy. In doing so, it must meet national needs, be principle-based and most importantly, benefit the rakyat (“people”) – especially B40 communities.
For AI to be successful, it must be supported by a healthy, purpose-driven, open-data ecosystem. To this end, we have worked with the government to develop the AI Innovation Ecosystem (AI-IE) model, embracing the quadruple helix approach in fostering participation and collaboration.
The primary aspect to consider are the socio-economic drivers in Malaysia. These represent the applications of AI in businesses and services that will benefit the community at large and how they can create demand and derive benefits from advances in AI solutions. It should be noted that AI is applicable across all sectors, and it is up to organizational leaders to adopt AI so that society and industries can benefit.
Another aspect highlighted in the AI Innovation Ecosystem model is industry, looking at who can supply AI technology and expertise. While there are many well-established organizations functioning within the AI sector providing world-class services to support businesses with new AI technologies, it is also important to tap into startups. Startups represent a hotbed of innovation and play a big role in transforming economies. For the AI Innovation Ecosystem model to succeed, a wholistic view must be applied – looking at all sources of innovation and technology providers, collaborating with them towards a singular goal. This is the essence of establishing a purpose driven data ecosystem.
However, it must be noted that AI adoption into any industry will not succeed without the right skills in place. A key component of the quadruple helix model is academia, representing the need for education and skilling among Malaysians to create a future-ready workforce capable of maximizing the full potential of AI. AI and data science skills will be vital in both supply and demand, to unlock the next generation of AI advancement, meaning a wholistic approach will be necessary when it comes to educating future generations of workers, whilst upskilling the existing workforce.
Acculturating AI and fostering AI talents are key pillars in the AIRmap because without a skilled workforce that understands how to optimally leverage the power of AI, economic and technological progress will inevitably be stunted.
The final aspect of the AI Innovation Ecosystem model is the government, who will lead the conversation for AI, coordinating large-scale initiatives to kickstart and grow the ecosystem, unlock ecosystem potential with enabling policies and ensure fundamental ethical trust principles are strictly adhered to. With an emphasis on public and private partnerships, the government must chart the way forward, influencing large-scale change and rolling out key initiatives designed to support each aspect of the quadruple helix model.
By aligning our AI vision at Microsoft with AIRmap’s goals, we hope to accelerate the nation’s digital transformation journey. We have witnessed the power of technology, especially in the most challenging times. More importantly, we have seen its ability to transform and improve lives, circling back to the fundamental concept that technology – in particular, AI – is here to augment and enhance lives.
As part of Microsoft’s Bersama Malaysia initiative, we hope that every person and organization in Malaysia is empowered to achieve more using AI, to lead richer lives and build a better nation for future generations to inherit.

As AI and machine learning become more and more widespread in the global economy, there is an increasing focus on the hardware that drives them. Currently, nearly all AI systems run on a chip known as a GPU that was designed for video gaming. 
Are current chip designs fit for purpose in an AI future, or is a new type of chip needed? The answer could have profound consequences for the IT sector. Hodan Omaar is a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.
BRINK: First of all, can you explain the difference between a GPU chip and the more well-known CPU chip that is used in most of our computers?
Omaar: Central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have a lot in common, but they have different architectures and are built for different purposes. CPUs have a small number of processing cores, which provide the power a CPU needs to perform certain tasks or computations. 
A CPU can focus these cores on getting individual tasks done quickly, but it does these tasks serially, meaning one at a time. As a result, CPUs are better tasked with computations where speed or latency is important. 
The Difference Between a Sports Car and a Truck
GPUs are made up of many smaller and more specialized cores that work together to deliver massive performance on processing tasks that can be easily divided up and processed across many cores. This makes GPUs better suited to tasks wherein bandwidth, rather than speed, is important. 
To see this, imagine a CPU is a sports car and a GPU is a semi-truck, and their task is to move a house full of boxes from one place to another. The sports car will move the boxes more quickly, but it will have to keep making the journey back and forth, whereas the semi-truck will carry a much greater load, but will travel more slowly. 
BRINK: Why do GPUs appear to work much better in AI than CPUs?
Omaar: AI applications, such as machine learning, deep learning and autonomous driving, involve highly parallelizable, predictable computations. Consider the computations involved in training an AI system to recommend pizzas based on factors like the weather, order history and general location. While the value of the factors themselves might be different across regions, the arithmetic operations the system is doing in each is the same. It is, therefore, more efficient to use GPUs, which can simultaneously execute the operations in parallel, than CPUs, which do them sequentially.
In general, AI chips don’t only execute more calculations in parallel, they have a number of features optimized for AI workloads. For instance, many AI chips are designed for low-precision computing — which trades-off the numerical precision of a calculation for speed and efficiency — because AI applications don’t need to use highly precise values to accurately encode and manipulate the data needed to train AI algorithms. They can also be built with specific programming languages that execute AI codes better.
Developing state-of-the-art AI chips is important to ensure AI developers and users can remain competitive in AI R&D and deployment. 
BRINK: GPUs were designed for gaming, so are they the best type of chip for handling AI?
Omaar: It’s true that GPUs were originally designed for the video gaming industry because they are particularly good at matrix arithmetic, a major mathematical tool used to construct and manipulate realistic images. Many of the independent and identical operations I mentioned that AI systems do for training and inference are also matrix multiplication operations, making them ideal for GPUs.
But a new set of AI chips is starting to emerge that are specialized for different tasks. This is partly because improvements in CPUs are slowing because the ability to pack more transistors onto a single processor is beginning to reach its physical limits. 
A New Generation of AI Chips Is On the Horizon
The market for specialized AI chips divides broadly into three categories. The first are GPUs, which are mostly used to train and develop AI algorithms. The second are what are called “field programmable gate arrays” (FPGAs), which are mostly used to apply trained AI algorithms to new data inputs. FPGAs are different from other AI chips because their architecture can be modified by programmers after fabrication. 
The third group of AI chips are “application-specific integrated circuits” (ASICs), which can be used for either training or inference tasks. ASICs have hardware that is customized for a specific algorithm and typically provide more efficiency than FPGAs. But because they are so narrow in their application, they grow obsolete more quickly as new AI algorithms are created. 
BRINK: Some say that the United States is losing its competitiveness in this market. How much of a concern is that?
Omaar: Developing state-of-the-art AI chips is important to ensure AI developers and users can remain competitive in AI R&D and deployment. The United States is still the world leader in designing chips for AI systems. In our 2021 report looking at AI competitiveness, we found that at least 62 U.S. firms are developing AI chips, compared with 29 firms in China and 14 in the European Union. 
The United States has many advantages for AI chip production, including high-quality infrastructure and logistics, innovation clusters, leading universities and a history of leadership in the field. 
Continued Leadership Is Not Guaranteed
China has targeted the industry for a global competitive advantage, as detailed in a number of government plans, including “Made in China 2025.” And while some of its policy actions are fair and legitimate, many seek to unfairly benefit Chinese firms at the expense of more-innovative foreign firms.

The Risks of Using AI for Government Work




The U.S. government needs to bolster its long-term competitiveness in the production of AI chips to stay competitive in AI. It can do this in part by expanding domestic chip manufacturing activity. For instance, Congress and the Biden administration should fully appropriate the funds needed to enact programs articulated in the CHIPS Act legislation, which passed Congress as part of the National Defense Authorization Act at the end of 2020. 
The legislation includes a combination of elements that would advance both U.S.-based chip innovation and manufacturing, including, for instance, $7 billion over five years for chip-focused R&D funding. The legislation also introduces a 40% investment tax credit for chip equipment and facilities to attract and incentivize more domestic chip manufacturing.

 Positive And Negative impact of Artificial Intelligence: The world is developing at a very fast pace. In our ever growing world, technology seems to have taken a centre stage in the affairs of man. With globalization connecting people and places, the interdependence between people has increased, and the need for things and commodities has also increased.
  
 In medicine, engineering, astronomy, and indeed all facets of life, there is the desire of man to make new discoveries.  These discoveries lead to inventions. Inventions are thus made to add value to the human life to either solve a problem or to improve on a situation.The need to further improve on the situation of life, and also to solve more complex problems have led to the invention of Artificial Intelligence based gadgets. Artificial Intelligence is basically the creating or developing of equipment using complex data programming to coat such equipment with the ability to act, reason and perform a task with little or no supervision. That is, computers are created in such a way that they perform functions based on the programme already created in them even without being operated by human beings.Just like every other creation of man, Artificial Intelligence has its positive and negative effects on man. The positive and negative effects of Artificial Intelligence or Artificial Intelligence based equipment will be discussed below.

TogglePositive Impact of Artificial IntelligenceNegative Impacts of Artificial IntelligencePositive Impact of Artificial Intelligence1. Errors are reduced: There is a huge reduction in human errors with the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is programmed to carry out tasks with little or no errors. When computers and machines are deployed in the performance of tasks, there is a minimal chance of mistakes occurring in such tasks.advantages and Disadvantages of artificial intelligence to the society
    Accuracy is to a great extent achievable with the use of artificial intelligence. This is because such programmes keyed into such Artificial Intelligence based equipment were designed to solve that particular problem.2. Artificial intelligence Makes Work Faster: Tasks done with the use of artificial intelligence are usually done faster and also finish in record time. Computers and machines which are employed in the performance of tasks make works to be accomplished fastly.Importance of artificial intelligenceFor example, the deployment of artificial intelligence in the construction of houses makes building projects to be actualized in record time and also allows for more buildings to be erected within a short time unlike when manual labor is employed.

Some tasks are highly hazardous to human health and it is only computers and machines that can carry out such tasks. For instance, in the case of pipeline leakage which occurs in a pipeline deep under the sea.Humans can barely survive such situations or conditions, hence, artificial intelligence is employed to deal with such maintenance. A typical example is the Chenobyl nuclear power plant explosion in Ukraine which occurred at a time Artificial Intelligence was not in vogue. This explosion saw to the death of persons who ventured close to get the situation under control at the earliest moment of the explosion.4. Ready Availability of Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence (computers, machines and robots) is always readily available when a task is needed to be performed, provided you have the gadget. A machine can never be too busy like humans to carry out a task. Where the machine is available, it is always ready for use provided it is in good condition.Artificial Intelligence can multitask on a job. Also, artificial intelligence works round the clock. Humans work for specified number of hours a day but Artificial Intelligence can work for 24 hours in a day and still continue working.Recommended: Positive and negative impact of globalization
 5. Artificial Intelligence Does Monotonous Jobs: Where one does an action over and over again, one becomes bored and may loose the zeal to continue with such task. Unlike humans that gets bored carrying out an activity over and over again, artificial intelligence does not. Computers are designed to carry out a task for as many times as possible and will not get bored of doing that same task.  Monotonous activities bore humans but it is not the case with Artificial Intelligence as they are designed to do a task repetitively without breaking down or getting tired of doing same task over and over again.  6. Artificial Intelligence Helps in new Discoveries and Inventions: The advent of artificial intelligence helps us to detect problems and also create solutions to those problems. For example, in health, with the use of Artificial Intelligence based gadgets, a doctor can easily detect diseases at their early stage.Artificial intelligence benefits to societyAlso see: Best law apps for lawyers and law studentsNegative Impacts of Artificial Intelligencepositive and negative impact of artificial intelligence1. It is Very Expensive to Produce: The cost of production of Artificial Intelligence based gadgets is very high and expensive. Creating gadgets of this nature is complex. It demands a lot of time, money and energy (both mental and psychological) to create. There is thus, a high cost of production of these equipment.  Again, when such are created or produced, it requires a lot of money to maintain them. They are also very expensive to purchase.Also see: Differences between a resume and a Curriculum Vitae2. It Requires Highly Skilled Personnel to Operate: Operating an artificial intelligence based equipment requires special skills and experience. One must be properly trained in the art of handling these equipment. The cost of training and also that of hiring a trained expert who can operate the equipment is usually very expensive and may not be easily affordable.Recommended: Advantages and Disadvantages of social media to students3. Unemployment and Loss of Jobs: One of the major effects that Artificial Intelligence negatively has on humanity is that it  causes  loss of jobs and unemployment. The use of computers and machines to do tasks which ab initio were done by humans have caused loss of jobs and employment opportunities for people. Workers are being laid off as employers prefer using computers and machines to do the jobs which they (workers) were employed to do. For example, the use of machines in agriculture and building constructions have to a great extent reduced the requirement for manual labour in those areas.4. It Causes Addiction and Laziness in Humans: Continuous use of artificial intelligence based equipment can be addictive to humans. Again, it causes laziness in man as one no longer does anything by himself but always depends on the use of computers and machines to perform every little task. For example, walking is a form of exercise but rarely do people walk even the shortest distance as a result of cars.Also see: Best Canadian business schools to attend in 20215. Artificial Intelligence Could be Used to Produce Dangerous Weapons: Humans of evil intents, terrorists and criminals can deploy Artificial Intelligence to make weapons that are dangerous to the well being of humanity. When these AI-based equipment falls into the wrong hands, nuclear weapons as well as other war gadgets can be made by them for the sole aim of using them as implements of war. Again, artificial intelligence based gadgets might turn out to be a Frankenstein creature which ends up destroying its creator.Artificial Intelligence is a veritable tool which cannot be done away with in modern time. It has helped humanity in many ways as solutions to problems have been proferred and found, coupled with inventions which have made living easier and comfortable. Not minding the negative impacts Artificial Intelligence has on humanity, it still makes the world a better place to live in.Edeh Samuel Chukwuemeka ACMCEdeh Samuel Chukwuemeka, ACMC, is a lawyer and a certified mediator/conciliator in Nigeria.

Using artificial networks will help us to understand how brain structure supports brain function. In turn, using empirical data to make neural networks will reveal design principles for building better AI.

“So, the two will help inform each other and enrich our understanding of the brain.”Separate research from the University of Delaware in the US found that coating sensors and other bioelectronic devices in polymer could help them to integrate more easily into the human body.The researchers were seeking a way to insert microelectrodes containing gold, stainless steel and silicon into human brain tissue without causing scarring, which also affects their electric signals and prevents them from operating properly when they created the coating.Coating  the components in the organic polymer, known as PEDOT, which was sold commercially as an anti-static coating for electronic displays, allowed the signals to flow freely, increasing signal quality and the length of battery life.Dr David Martin, who led the study, was confident the research could contribute to the future merger of the human brain with AI, enhancing human capabilities with software and machine insight. “The ability to do the polymerization in a controlled way inside a living organism would be fascinating,”  he said. ",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-systems-human-brain-efficient-work-better-copy-mimic-1142588#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-systems-human-brain-efficient-work-better-copy-mimic-1142588'}, 'author': {'name': 'Rhiannon Williams', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/person/4aace2698e9f969a8fb5b61b1ad61fff', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/author/rhiannon-williams'}, 'headline': 'Artificial Intelligence systems &#8216;work better&#8217;

Organizations seeing the most benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI) work are more likely to be true believers in cognitive capabilities. Indeed, AI high performers, as identified by McKinsey, invested more of their digital budgets in AI than their counterparts, were more likely to increase their AI investments in the next three years, and employ more AI-related talent, such as data engineers, data architects, and translators, than their counterparts.
""Winning support for AI across the business is crucial for CIOs and other IT leaders hoping to scale their programs.""
Winning over the end users of AI-enabled capabilities is just as – if not more – important to your success.
“Winning support for AI across the business is crucial for CIOs and other IT leaders hoping to scale their programs,” says Dan Simion, vice president of AI & Analytics at Capgemini North America.
How to make the case for AI and build support: 11 tips
To successfully earn buy-in and sponsorship from C-suite executives and line of business teammates alike, there are several moves IT leaders can make:
1. Create excitement within IT
The implementation of AI across the entire Lenovo organization is enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness. But, says Arthur Hu, Lenovo Group’s vice president and CIO, in the past, there has been a gap between strategy and execution. Keep your eye on the macro picture, he advises. “AI is constantly changing, so during strategic planning, I encourage my team to talk about the lifecycle of technology that is currently in use around the company,” says Hu, who asks his team to consider what’s ready for retirement and what’s headed for the mainstream. “By letting my team get creative, it naturally builds momentum and develops excitement.”

2. Get executives involved to match AI to digital transformation strategy
Success requires plenty of input from senior executives. “Executives need to work with their AI teams to ensure that the AI system’s input and output will be aligned with their overall digital transformation strategy,” says Justin Silver, AI strategist at AI platform provider PROS. “Collaborative strategy sessions that bring together executives and AI researchers can bring broader visibility to AI initiatives and keep AI research and development efforts tethered to key needs of the business.”
3. Assemble other advisory councils
AI-enabled innovation must be co-created.
“When making [changes] like this it is important to connect and host advisory councils with your organization’s partners, suppliers, and employees to gain their insight and opinions on implementation,” Hu says. “By doing so, you will see where it is wanted and needed.”
Understand that while IT can assist in AI-enabled innovation, IT cannot demand it of the business, says Hu. It must be co-created. “We have to remember to encourage applied curiosity, and then we can figure out our next steps for execution.”

4. Integrate AI teams into the organization
“Don’t put an AI team in a small silo and tell them to transform the business by themselves,” says Peter Scott, AI consultant and founding director of Next Wave Institute. “That’s like running power to one only one room and telling them to electrify the enterprise. AI is leveraging the intersection of technology and cognition, and it impacts every part of your business where people are thinking.”
5. Personalize the benefits
To encourage user adoption of AI throughout an organization, IT leaders and managers need to demonstrate how the resulting changes will benefit employees. Present quality data that shows how business processes can be improved. “Presenting a successful use case with support from senior leadership and easily recognizable data can incentivize usage,” says Chris Fielding, CIO at Sungard Availability Services. “IT leaders and managers should clearly communicate to team members why the incorporation of AI is beneficial and the positive impact it will have on productivity and efficiency both day-to-day and in the long run.”
Staying people-focused will go a long way, says Silver of PROS. “Retention of employees who have the skills and experience working with AI systems can yield positive returns.”
6. Address job loss concerns
“One of the challenges in AI adoption is the fear that many functional leaders have about losing their jobs or becoming obsolete,” says Nancy A. Shenker, author of Embrace the Machine. “When it’s positioned primarily as a technology improvement or cost-saving advancement, line managers who don’t fully understand the power of AI and ML will start to freak out and get defensive about the human elements of their jobs.”
By emphasizing that AI allows teams to focus on the actions to take based on the insights generated by AI and ML solutions rather than spending time mining the data for patterns, it becomes clear that AI does not remove the need for human decision-making, but instead enables a more effective, efficient route to insightful outcomes, says Simion of Capgemini.

It may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment.Currently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia.The researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes.Identify patterns""If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,"" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said.""And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur.""Prof Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records.The algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database.Memory clinicsIn pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan.The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. In the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate.Their results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment.BBC NewsDenis and Penelope Clark want to know how his condition will progress, so they can plan for their futureConsultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a ""fantastic development"".""These set of diseases are really devastating for people,"" he said.""So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do.""Sometimes strugglingAmong the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago.Last year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. And they are now concerned he is developing dementia.Denis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening.The couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. So Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. BBC NewsNormally, Denis might need several brain scans to see whether he has dementia""We could then plan financially,"" she said. ""We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday.""Mental problemsAnother of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available.""I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,"" he said.""The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. ""But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. ""Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate?

Forget the negative comments, the unsure colleagues, and general science fiction painted pictures of AI that you have been fed your entire life. From my personal experience as an AI proponent for the past three decades I know that the power AI has for doing good is exponentially better than anything negative. 


There is only one thing that causes AI to do harm. People. 

Fortunately for all of us there are leaders and visionaries across the globe that are paving the way and setting examples for every business to follow when implementing and leveraging the massive power that AI possesses. These people are AI Ethicists. 

Qualifications of an AI Ethicist

To start, an AI ethicist generally should have an understanding of AI tools and technology of the business and the industry and the specific AI ethical traps that exist in them, good communication skills and the ability to work across organizational boundaries and regulatory, legal, and policy knowledge.
PROMOTED
Beyond this skill set, the ideal AI ethicist for a company would possess a diverse perspective, have in their background interdisciplinary work experience, deep understanding of processes and policies both internal and governmental and be an excellent public speaker with the ability to project confidence when training or presenting to both internal stakeholders and external partners or clients. 
This position currently exists at many companies under different names such as Data Privacy and Ethics Lead (Qantas), Chief AI Ethics Lead (US Army Artificial Intelligence Task Force), Director of Responsible Innovation & Responsible Innovation Manager (Facebook) and several others.

Recently appointed to her position at DataRobot Dr. Mahmoudian stated that “When used properly, AI can be a force for good and help contribute solutions to some of society’s most pressing issues, such as access to equitable healthcare,” ...“The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired unprecedented interest in AI. However, to accomplish those goals we must ensure machine learning systems have trustworthy and ethical parameters built in from the start.” 
Will Griffin
Chief Ethics Officer at Hypergiant 
In a recent interview with Apogeo Spatial Griffin discussed that at Hypergiant their process is “to evangelize to the developers and the designers the burden of proof ... is on the developers and the designers to be creative and imagine all of the impacts on...society and to create a technology in a way that minimizes those impacts and maximizes the benefits.”

Working for a data gathering and organizing giant like Salesforce ethical use of AI and data must be paramount. In her role, Goldman is working daily to “make sure that the solutions that we develop are developed inclusively and with those populations (communities of color) top of mind, with and for those populations...And so we're actively involving diverse experts...And we're looking out for ways in which products could be unintentionally misused.”

In his work Mills shows an excellent example to try and emulate in his insistence that “An AI product is never just an algorithm. It's a full end-to-end system and all the [related] business processes...You could go to great lengths to ensure that your algorithm is as bias-free as possible but you have to think about the whole end-to-end value chain from data acquisition to algorithms to how the output is being used within the business.""

Dr. Croak’s work at Google is integral to the way AI affects nearly everyone’s life, especially all of us with a smartphone or a Gmail address. A tremendous question she asks that I agree with is around the fact that “there’s a lot of dissension, a lot of conflict in terms of trying to standardize on normative definitions of these principles. Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use? ...what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.”

Patels' work at the DoD focuses on how to operationalize the five DoD AI Ethics Principles; Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable. This includes the mission of putting these into practice in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI-enabled capabilities. Knowing our Department of Defense is taking the subject of AI Ethics this seriously gives me even more confidence that this is an issue that will continue to get the support it needs at the highest levels for the foreseeable future.

Deloitte is focused on achieving maximum human and machine collaboration. To do this they work to communicate their values on use of AI to every single member of their organization, no matter their level. This gets all of their people on one page which then translates when any of them communicate with external stakeholders.
Knowing that my peers in the AI space listed above are working towards a brighter and more ethical future brings me hope and pride. By following their examples and modeling our practices after theirs we can all create a future where the power of AI is leveraged for all that is good, driving society and humanity to approach our full potential.

A new tool co-developed by Microsoft using artificial intelligence to predict deforestation hotspots has identified nearly 10,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon that’s in imminent danger.Called PrevisIA, it uses artificial intelligence to analyze satellite imagery from the European Space Agency, and an algorithm developed by the Brazilian conservation nonprofit Imazon to find the areas most prone to deforestation.The tool, which the developers say could potentially be applied to any forested area on Earth, will be used for preventive actions, in partnerships with local governments, corporations and nonprofits.The next step of the project is to build partnerships with local governments and institutions to act on preventing deforestation, which is the most challenging phase of the project, according to Imazon researcher Carlos Souza Jr. Nearly 10,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon, an area the size of Lebanon, is at high risk of being cleared, according to a new tool using artificial intelligence technology to help forecast deforestation before it actually happens.
Named PrevisIA (from the Portuguese previsão for “forecast” and IA for “artificial intelligence”), the tool analyzes images provided by European Space Agency satellites, and through an algorithm created by the Brazilian conservation nonprofit Imazon, finds areas prone to deforestation.
Imazon studies published in scientific journals show that 95% of accumulated deforestation in the Amazon is located within a 5.5-kilometer (3.4-mile) radius of roads; 90% of annual fires occur 4 km (2.5 mi) from illegal roads built in the middle of the forest for logging, mining and land grabbing.

In 2006, the non-profit started to monitor satellite images manually to find these roads before the area around them was cleared of trees, but the laborious and time-consuming work prevented it from scaling up — a problem that the new technology aims to solve. The tool mapped so far the Brazilian Amazon, but could potentially be expanded to any forested area on Earth, the developers say.
The first report using the new tool launched last week shows that 192 municipalities have a high or very high risk of deforestation in Brazil’s portion of the Amazon. Additionally, 48 Indigenous reserves have the same level of risk, as well as 18 conservation units. Also at high and very high risk of deforestation are two quilombos, communities of the Afro-Brazilian descendants of runaway slaves, and 789 rural settlements. In total, this comprises 9,635 km2 (3,720 mi2) of threatened forest.
The next step of the project, developed jointly by Imazon, U.S. technology giant Microsoft and Brazilian mining company Vale, is to build partnerships with local governments and institutions to act on preventing deforestation, which is the most challenging phase of the project, according to Imazon researcher Carlos Souza Jr.
There are two main strategies: one involves civil society organizations and corporations; and the other, governmental institutions, Souza Jr. said. The private sector will act in a “positive intervention,” he said, an approach that includes providing municipalities with information technology to make progress on environmental management.

“We want them to attract the financial sector with differentiated credit lines for those capable of actually reducing deforestation. There are many market initiatives that could work there, such as carbon credits, investments in forestry, having protocols to actually quantify avoided [greenhouse gas] emissions,” he told Mongabay in a phone interview.
When it comes to the governments’ role, Imazon is betting on municipalities and state governments to take the lead, Souza Jr. said, since there are no open lines of communication with the federal government, which has often been criticized for its anti-environment stance.
“The states have the opportunity to become environmental protagonists. Deforestation does not bring any advantages, even financially; buyers of agricultural products are starting to boycott Brazil due to deforestation. People need to understand that it is actually more profitable to have the forest standing,” Souza Jr. said, adding that local prosecutors’ offices are also becoming allies in tackling deforestation.
He also said partnerships with corporations have great potential to boost environmental conservation, noting that the launch of the technology platform already demonstrated a difference in the participation of private parties, with companies actually using their expertise to help build the project instead of just donating money to nonprofits.

Rodrigo Kede Lima, Microsoft’s president for Latin America, said he believes PrevisIA is today one of the most important projects for environmental preservation. “Through intelligent algorithms in the cloud we are able to forecast deforestation and forest fires before they happen. This is one of the biggest examples that technology can help build a better world,” he said at the launch of the platform on Aug. 4.
“The planet is in a hurry, so should we [be],” Tania Consentino, president of Microsoft Brazil, said at the same online event. “The solution for the environmental issues require a coordinated action, not only from the government but together with corporations, nonprofits and society as [a] whole.”
Vale, Brazil’s biggest miner and a frequent target of criticism for its role in some of the worst environmental and social disasters in the country, joined the initiative because “protecting the Amazon is strategic,” according to Hugo Barreto, the company’s director of investments and social development. Speaking at the launch event, he said Vale today directly protects more than 10,000 km2 (3,860 mi2) of forest in the Amazon, and will increase this number by another 5,000 km2 (1,930 mi2).

La particularité de ces deux œuvres d'art ? Elles ont été créées par Artifly, une intelligence artificielle capable de prendre en compte les envies des utilisateurs pour concevoir une œuvre d'art sur mesure.


Art and artificial intelligence: two fields that seem so far away, yet can find such beautiful applications. Earlier this month, a digital artist by the name of Dries Depoorter designed a toolto unmask Members of Parliament when they were using their smartphones in plenary. In the same month, a small team of art and AI enthusiasts developed an algorithm called Artifly that allows users to create a personalized work of art according to their desires, which can then be purchased. Let’s take a look at this amazing new tool.
An artificial intelligence tool that creates works of art according to the style you want

In 2018, Christie’s, an auction company, sold “The Portrait of Edmond de Belamy” for $432,000 for a base estimate of $10,000. What is special about this work? It is the first work entirely conceived by AI (See our article dedicated to the Obvious collective, author of the portrait, in the magazine ActuIA N°3). A year later, Ben Kovalis, Eyal Fisher and Guy Haimovitz launched the Art AI gallery, a collection of artworks designed with the help of artificial intelligence and tools they have developed.
In July 2021, the three experts took their algorithm development a step further: they designed Artifly, a tool that allows users to design their own artwork automatically according to their desires, using AI. Users scroll through a selection of artworks and choose the designs that interest them. Artifly understands what style of art fits you and learns from your selections to create a brand new custom artwork in a minute, which they can purchase if they wish.
Will AI ever replace artists? Ben Kovalis refutes this theory.

When art lovers and specialists discover the tool of Kovalis, Fishet and Haimovitz, they are of course immediately intrigued, Ben Kovalis rightly explains:
“We are confronted with a common question when we present Artifly: “so you want to replace human artists with robots?”. When I hear this question, my answer is: Certainly not, first of all because we don’t think it’s possible to replace artists. It is simply something that improves art. Human effort is still needed to set up the artistic process. You need a lot of sweat, tears and human involvement to create an AI algorithm that creates something beautiful.”

He goes on to draw a parallel with music and the use of synthesizers in the 1980s:
“Not everyone liked the synthesizer. Many exploited it, many didn’t use it, but it became irrevocably something that helped create pop music. Today, the music is the same music we know and love, it just has a little bit of technology in it. It’s the same thing we do with art.”

Depending on what the algorithm comes up with, prices range from $29 to a few hundred dollars for the most expensive works. The three collaborators are now looking to see if there is a secondary (or resale) market that could exist based on the certificates of authenticity provided with the work and whether the price of the works made by Artifly will ever rise.

Challenge is next step in the NFL's Digital Athlete initiative, designed to improve the long-term health and safety of players


$100,000 in total prize money available; open through November 2, 2021
 




New York, August 10, 2021 – The National Football League (NFL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) today launched a new artificial intelligence challenge to create ways for computers to automatically identify players using NFL game footage. New computer vision models created through the challenge will accelerate the NFL's work with AWS to better understand, and aim to reduce, injuries in the NFL. Prize money totaling $100,000 will be awarded to data scientists with winning models. The contest will be open through November 2, 2021.


This challenge is the next step in the NFL's work with AWS to develop the Digital Athlete, a virtual representation of an NFL player that can be used to better predict and hopefully prevent player injury. Last season, the NFL hosted its first computer vision competition, providing computer scientists NFL game data and challenging them to create ways to detect on-field helmet impacts. Nearly 7,800 submissions were received from data scientists around the world. Those solutions are now being used by the NFL and AWS in ongoing work on the Digital Athlete.


This challenge builds upon last season's competition by scoring teams based on how accurately they identify players involved in a helmet impact. The NFL will be providing data scientists with the same set of game data to build upon the current models. This competition will advance an already robust machine learning pipeline built on AWS that is working towards being among the most advanced and sophisticated injury surveillance and mitigation programs in professional sports.
 


""This competition is foundational in helping identify each player's risk to injury-causing events, especially when it comes to head health,"" said Jeff Miller, NFL Executive Vice President overseeing the league's health and safety programs. ""We are excited to enlist some of the most talented data scientists from around the world to help develop these solutions and meaningfully advance player safety.""


""Using AWS's broad range of technologies including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), the NFL and AWS will generate more new insights than ever previously possible into player injuries, game rules, equipment, rehabilitation, and recovery,"" said Priya Ponnapalli, Senior Manager, Applied Science, Amazon ML Solutions Lab. ""This contest will continue that work and the data and insights collected through this project have the potential to shape the future of football.""


The Digital Athlete will ultimately help the NFL and its clubs to leverage sports science and injury biomechanics to develop individualized training and recovery regimens, conduct real-time risk analysis for injury during games, and identify and evaluate additional player safety initiatives, including around equipment, rules changes and coaching techniques.

SDPs, zero trust, and VPNs are three methods of securing an enterprise. VPNs have historically served as businesses’ main defense  against external threats by encrypting tunnels between networks. But SDPs and zero trust networks are increasing in popularity, too. SDPs are networks that sit atop other networks to hide them from attackers or unauthorized users, acting like a cloak of invisibility to prevent network-based attacks. Zero-trust networks assume any user or device cannot be trusted, restricting every user’s access to network resources -- regardless of identity or network access history.

The COVID-19 pandemic made remote work technologies a necessity for day-to-day business. Microsoft Teams, Webex, Zoom and other collaboration offerings took the place of in-person meetings, sales calls and industry events.







Other technologies, however, have toiled behind the scenes to support distributed workforces. These technologies will continue to evolve as remote operations persist in the coming months. Panelists at the CompTIA ChannelCon conference, which concluded Aug. 4, discussed the technical underpinnings of home offices and unattended workplaces.

Zero trust, SASE emerge as essential
An increase in remote work has prompted a rise in zero-trust implementations, and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has also landed on enterprise technology agendas. Zero trust emphasizes user and device authentication to grant network access -- a security approach that's well-suited to remote workforces that blur traditional network boundaries. SASE, based on cloud architecture, can scale to accommodate increases in the number of remote workers.



""Technologies around the zero-trust architecture and Secure Access Service Edge became critically important,"" said Tracy Holtz, vice president of security solutions, North America, at distributor Tech Data.
Holtz, who participated in the CompTIA panel, also identified VPN, SD-WAN and web application firewalls as pivotal remote work technologies. ""Those will become a continued focus for every company as we evolve ... hybrid work environments,"" she said.
During the pandemic, more than 150 of Holtz's Tech Data team members transitioned from occasional to full-time remote work.








AI and ML bolster security
Artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) have also contributed to remote work security, although largely out of view.
""A lot of the ways AI has impacted this area [have] been in ... background processes,"" said Lloyd Danzig, chairman and founder of the International Consortium for the Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence. Pattern recognition, used in ML, provides one example.
""There's a lot of pattern recognition involved in the cybersecurity protocols that keep companies safe every day during the normal course of business,"" Danzig said. That includes when people access servers from all over the country.
Pattern recognition lets people ""work much more fluidly from home using their own devices,"" he added.

IoT supports lights-out operations
IoT, meanwhile, plays a role back in the main office, as many workforces remain highly distributed.
""IoT, from a sensor perspective, has been a very important part of moving our world forward,"" said Robert Senatore, CEO at Data2Go Wireless, an IoT network services provider. ""We have a lot less people who are actually going to an office ... so IoT, the automation and the data collection through sensors, and other pieces of wireless hardware, have been really important to ... capture the data.""
He cited examples of sensors that provide temperature readings or indicate whether doors open or close. IoT, he said, helps businesses maintain control of their offices, gain information and take action on that information.


The future: Drones boost remote connectivity
Many remote workers have experienced poor connectivity -- in densely populated cities where peak-use periods can affect service quality, for example.
Kimberly Penn, founder and CEO at Professor Drones, a drone consultant based in Houston, suggested drones could provide a connectivity boost. ""It would be amazing to have a drone associated with 5G and some of the other [high-speed internet] technologies that ... could tether and help us stay connected,"" she said.

The Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence is set to open this month, providing researchers a place to focus on the intersection of robotics, complex networks, health and social media.AI in medicineKay Connelly, Luddy School’s associate dean of research, studies proactive health and AI technologies that can help the terminally ill and older people as they age, specifically wearable devices. She said proactive health is like “Fitbit before Fitbit.”Her work is key in one of IU’s Grand Challenges, and it tackles how to get the right treatment to patients at the right time. To research how to treat gestational diabetes, women are given wearable devices to track their heart rate, sleep and physical activity. The hope is to prevent development of the disease and stop it from becoming Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes diagnoses come during a woman’s pregnancy, according to mayoclinic.org, and the data collected from these wearable devices allows researchers to detect which women are at higher risk to develop gestational diabetes. Former Luddy School dean Raj Acharya’s work in AI also influences the medical community, especially as variants of COVID-19 continue to arise. Acharya currently has a National Science Foundation grant dedicated to reconstructing the genome of viruses using DNA and RNA sequencing, which is essential to the vaccine development process.He takes short, cut-up strands of DNA and RNA, then uses the information they contain to solve questions about the full strands, which scientists are not able to fully read. He said viruses want to fool the immune system — this is why viruses mutate — so AI and machine-learning techniques are used to reconstruct viruses to understand the structure and order of characters which make them up. He said the interaction between our immune system and viruses is a type of game theory. When a virus enters our body, our immune system learns and stores a sequence of the virus so it can fight it, but recombination of its character makeup allows the virus to trick our immune system.While Acharya uses sequencing for developments in the medical field, AI can also help researchers understand the evolutionary process called phylogenetic analysis, which is used to construct evolutionary trees showing which animals evolved from another. AI on the streetsIU computer scientist David Crandall’s expertise is computer vision, the part of AI that tries to get computers to recognize things and make decisions based on what they see. Self-driving cars use this kind of research because they need to recognize things like stop signs and be able to make the decision to stop. This process uses machine learning, which trains computers to recognize things based on a large data set. Machine learning is an important development because in the past it would take months or even years to program specific commands, but now machine learning can expedite the process by having the computer teach itself, Crandall said. Crandall said studying how children learn has been influential to this type of research. In the same way children begin to understand things by observing them over and over, so do the programmed machines. This is also how programs like Alexa learn to respond to a person’s command. Amazon engineers have given the computers powering Alexa thousands of collected audio clips and taught the algorithm how to recognize certain commands, Crandall said. These are examples of the black box model, which is a system used to study the inputs something is given and what outputs it gives back. More from IU:Students, faculty and staff praise mask mandate before fall semesterBeth Plale, a professor and executive director of the Pervasive Technology Institute at IU, does research in data provenance, which is essentially data auditing. Her job is to study algorithms and their similarities to unconscious human bias, which can be encoded because of structural issues in our society, she said. Plale said studying the outcomes of AI is important because if their work can be misused, people can use machine-learning algorithms to teach robots to be bigoted and do bad things. She brought up Microsoft’s conversational bot Tay, which was pulled from Twitter because just hours into its launch users had taught it to be racist and use inflammatory political speech. AI needs to be accountable, she said, and her work is focused on looking into issues that arise and mitigating them, like unconscious biases in algorithms or people's ability to manipulate outcomes. She says while trust in science is still high, transparency in the work researchers are doing is critical. Researchers need to jump on the important conversations early so they don’t become politicized. “There’s only so much a researcher — an academic researcher — there’s only so much we can do or say because there are forces that squelch our voices,” Plale said.What is driving research?As Michael McRobbie’s tenure as Indiana University’s president was coming to an end this June, one of his final moves was to dedicate the Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence, a new “state of the art” facility for advanced AI research and machine learning. The $35 million center is part of a $60 million gift from alumnus Fred Luddy, who is the namesake of IU’s school of informatics, computing and engineering. Construction began in February 2020 and it is set to open this month. According to a news release from IU, the center’s initial focus will be robotics, complex networks, health and social media. “The explosion worldwide of the uses and applications of AI, building on decades of steady research progress, made this the perfect time for IU to establish a major holistic initiative in artificial intelligence,"" McRobbie said.During McRobbie's tenure he also launched the Grand Challenges program, a $300 million investment into solving some of Indiana's most pressing issues. These challenges include research into precision medicine, environmental change and addiction crises.Ethical questionsWhile artificial intelligence research can lead to breakthroughs that make people’s lives easier, IU’s faculty also is concerned about what consequences it will have and what conversations need to be had as the field develops. Both Plale and Crandall point to automated military drone strikes as an example of ethical problems society will have to grapple with. This discussion is particularly relevant in Crandall’s field of study, because computer vision would be used in such drones, and he said AI is notoriously bad at understanding things out of context. “I think they struggle in certain circumstances. For example we know that they struggle often when they encounter situations that they’ve never encountered before,” Crandall said. For example, a sticker on a stop sign may cause an autonomous car to not recognize it or act accordingly. The stakes are even higher when considering autonomous drones having the power to kill people without human intervention, and Plale said the ethical implications of whether military drones should have the power to do so is a problem society will have to face. She tied this in with the conversation of the moral considerations a sentient AI robot would be given if researchers are able to develop one. The moral considerations are broad questions that AI researchers should contribute to the discussion of, she said, but ultimately society will be responsible for coming up with the answers. However, Connelly believes IU and universities in general are a good place for ethical discussions because there are diverse voices at the table and the structure of funding and research is different compared with a corporation. “You find that people who are advocating for the ethics often get pushed aside, or pushed out completely because it doesn’t fit in that profit model,” she said. Corporations also tend to ignore the populations Connelly’s research is focused on because there’s less profit incentive in low-income communities. Her research is specifically targeted to making sure people with increased risk of health disparities get access. Benefits of IUIn addition to the less-profit-based research IU is able to engage in, Connelly believes the university setting is perfect because diverse voices will be heard and be able to point out when research is short-sighted or developments don’t take into account their communities. She mentioned problems with facial recognition not working for people of color in some cases as a potential way more diverse voices can shape the future of AI. She believes IU does a good job mentoring students from all backgrounds, including first-generation or students with a non-English primary language, because IU's apprenticeship-style research helps students learn the ""nitty gritty"" of the field.“They are bringing their perspectives to the table, so students are critical,” Connelly said. In terms of research resources, IU is well situated thanks to top-notch researchers in all fields of AI and having medical professionals and experts within other schools at IU, Acharya said. He said with IU’s Grand Challenges there is a lot of cross pollination between the Luddy School and IU Health faculty in Indianapolis.In the three ways of looking at AI — algorithmic or computer science, cognitive science and hardware — IU has great people in all three, Acharya said. Plale also pointed out IU’s well positioned infrastructure, including Big Red 200, a supercomputer designed to support research in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics, which was installed in January 2020. Plale noted Crandall’s research in the cognitive science department is a collaborative effort with the psychology department, where studies are looking at how babies learn, which allows the cognitive science department of the Luddy School to apply those methods to machine learning development.  “I think what it suggests is that the collaborative activity that goes on in the academic setting can infuse new thinking,” Plale said.Another collaborative effort Connelly brought up was IU’s Observatory on Social Media, a joint project between the Luddy School, The Media School and Network Science Institute. This project unites data scientists and journalists to study the role of media and technology in society. Connelly worries about manipulation of entire segments of the population, which she believes algorithms on social media can propagate. She sees it as a direct threat to democracy. She said people fall into silos of information and when that happens you’re not exposed to a breadth of information and alternative viewpoints. In 2017, former FBI agent and cybersecurity expert Clint Watts testified before Senate Intelligence Committee about the role Russian bots played in the 2016 presidential election. He said Russians used ""armies"" of Twitter bots to spread misinformation about the election, and in 2017 he'd already been tracking this kind of activity for more than three years.Connelly said everyone is susceptible to this regardless of their views, and she thinks social networks can enforce seeking approval and conforming to whichever way you lean on issues. When you start to sway on issues, those silos are an effective way to pull you back in.AI in mediaArtificial intelligence has been a part of science fiction media since at least the 19th century, and in the same way science fiction has had different portrayals of how AI will become part of our lives, IU’s researchers have different attitudes toward the depiction of AI in literature and film. Crandall, for example, rolls his eyes at a lot of the depictions of AI in the media because it’s very dramatic, especially concerning things like an AI ignoring its programming and thinking for itself. For example, recent movies like ""Ex Machina"" and ""Her"" explore the potential relationships between humans and sentient forms of AI. ""Ex Machina"" (2015) ponders the idea of the creation surpassing the creator and whether an AI can escape the black box, and ""Her"" (2013) explores whether humans can fall in love with an AI. “The state of robotics is that just doing something like folding a piece of clothing is like, beyond what any robot is able to do right now in any reasonable amount of time,” he said. While the more dramatic depictions of AI are a bit laughable to him, Crandall recognizes the more subtle ways AI can control parts of people’s lives, such as using Facebook to influence elections. He said it seems innocent, but it can become something that controls what people see. While this is much more subtle, Crandall said conversations are needed about these negative impacts and where AI goes from here. Plale did not want to speculate too much about media representation, but she is also skeptical about some of the sci-fi portrayals of AI. She said from what she’s seen, AI in the media has been given much more sentience than what exists today, and while robots in factories are very well developed, the ability to get them to process things and react the way a human brain does is limited. Acharya is a bit more optimistic about the role of sci-fi in the development of AI, and thinks in many ways the genre helps researchers be more imaginative. “I think in a way that the media people might be ahead,” he said. “The science fiction is probably ahead because the scientists are constrained by what can happen today. Media people can imagine.”Hopes and fears for the future of AIAs artificial intelligence continues to carve out a role in our lives, IU’s researchers are determined to make the future of AI a positive influence on the lives of Hoosiers. To make sure they usher in technology as a social good, Plale believes the conversations on ethics and the research being conducted need to move forward simultaneously. Acharya brought up deepfakes, which use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make realistic-looking images of fake events, as an example of AI being abused by people with bad intentions. In September 2019, AI firm Deeptrace found that 96% of deepfake videos were pornographic, and Boston University law professor Danielle Citron said “Deepfake technology is being weaponized against women” because it can fuel things such as hate porn. Still, Acharya is optimistic about the role AI will play in the lives of people moving forward. He said continued AI research in the medical field will be important in the lives of retired people, as it will allow more of them to live more fully as they age and develop medical problems. Human and machine becoming one is the ultimate goal, he said, in the sense that research into artificial limbs and organs can extend and have a positive impact on people’s lives.Also, hypothesis generation, a new type of AI application which speeds up the process of developing hypotheses and comes up with new ones researchers might have overlooked, helps make research more efficient, Acharya said. Overall, his outlook on the future of AI is positive.For research as a whole, one issue Crandall sees is some researchers’ eagerness to present things without full context because they want their work to seem like a breakthrough. It’s not anyone’s fault, he said, and it might not even be a bad thing because it gets people talking about the work, but the hype about some developments in AI aren’t always centered in reality. More from IU:IU researchers developed a program that maps cities' green spaces, infrastructure“The reality is much more boring,” he said.People have also blown the hype around AI’s impact on the job market out of proportion, Crandall said, and he compared it with the same type of hype around the internet being a job killer when it came out. Forbes reported that in a Gallup poll from 2018, 73% of Americans believed AI would be a net job destroyer, but only 23% of them were worried about it, partially because they didn’t believe their jobs would be affected. “It’s hard for me now to really predict what really the impact will be of AI,” Crandall said. “Except that like, I think it really is something that we have under our control.”He brought up self-driving trucks as an example of something that could push people out of certain jobs, but he’s curious what effect that will have on the job market as a whole. Automating 99.9% of what goes into driving is easy, he said, but in the 0.1% of cases where unexpected things happen, AI is not good at anticipating and reacting the way a human would. He said he’s comfortable with the current situation of trusting the people around him to make responsible and rational decisions while he’s driving. “Somehow we’ve grown accustomed and we’ve grown comfortable with this situation, which when you think about it that way is quite terrifying,” he said. “Every time you get on the road you have to trust everyone else who’s driving to do the right thing.”He thinks on one hand AI is good because you can program it to make decisions, but problems arise because society has to grapple with what decisions it should make. What or who an automated car should focus on protecting when a crash can't be avoided altogether is one example of the discussions Crandall says need to be had. “I think the tricky part is we’re going to have to decide, ‘What is the right thing for it to do?’” he said.ExpertsInSavings | Auto SavingsThe Sneaky Way Virginia Drivers Are Cutting Their Car Insurance Bills in HalfExpertsInSavings | Auto Savings|AdAdLearn MoreUndoFisher Investments7 Wealth Tips Once Your Portfolio Reaches $1 MillionFisher Investments|AdAdLearn MoreUndoLeaf Filter USAHere's What A New Gutter System Should Cost You In 2024Leaf Filter USA|AdAdLearn MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoForbesVirginia: Reduce Your Car Insurance Bill If You Live In These Zip CodesForbes|AdAdGet OfferUndoCommonSearchesNew Electric Cars Are So Cheap Now (Take A Look)CommonSearches|AdAdClick HereUndoTheWalletWatcher.com7 Discounts Seniors Only Get If They AskTheWalletWatcher.com|AdAdUndoFlirtForDateDating For Older MenFlirtForDate|AdAdTry NowUndoPenny PincherVirginia Drivers With No DUI Are Getting A Pay Day On WednesdayPenny Pincher|AdAdRead MoreUndoFisher InvestmentsEstate Planning Basics [Free Guide]Fisher Investments|AdAdLearn MoreUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDOur Favorite Eye Massager is Less Than $50 During Amazon Prime DayREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

Imagine what a lawyer does on a given day: researching cases, drafting briefs, advising clients. While technology has been nibbling around the edges of the legal profession for some time, it’s hard to imagine those complex tasks being done by a robot.
And it is those complicated, personalized tasks that have led technologists to include lawyers in a broader category of jobs that are considered pretty safe from a future of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence.
But, as we discovered in a recent research collaboration to analyze legal briefs using a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, lawyers’ jobs are a lot less safe than we thought. It turns out that you don’t need to completely automate a job to fundamentally change it. All you need to do is automate part of it.
While this may be bad news for tomorrow’s lawyers, it could be great for their future clients – particularly those who have trouble affording legal assistance. 
Technology can be unpredictable
Our research project – in which we collaborated with computer scientists and linguists at MITRE, a federally funded nonprofit devoted to research and development – was not meant to be about automation. As law professors, we were trying to identify the text features of successful versus unsuccessful legal briefs.
We gathered a small cache of legal briefs and judges’ opinions and processed the text for analysis.
One of the first things we learned is that it can be hard to predict which tasks are easily automated. For example, citations in a brief – such as “Brown v. Board of Education 347 U.S. 483 (1954)” – are very easy for a human to pick out and separate from the rest of the text. Not so for machine learning software, which got tripped up in the blizzard of punctuation inside and outside the citation.
It was like those “Captcha” boxes you are asked to complete on websites to prove you’re not a robot – a human can easily spot a telephone pole, but a robot will get confused by all the background noise in the image.
A tech shortcut
Once we figured out how to identify the citations, we inadvertently stumbled on a methodology to automate one of the most challenging and time-consuming aspects of legal practice: legal research.
The scientists at MITRE used a methodology called “graph analysis” to create visual networks of legal citations. The graph analysis enabled us to predict whether a brief would “win” based on how well other briefs performed when they included a particular citation.
Later, however, we realized the process could be reversed. If you were a lawyer responding to the other side’s brief, normally you would have to search laboriously for the right cases to cite using an expensive database. But our research suggested that we could build a database with software that would just tell lawyers the best cases to cite. All you would need to do is feed the other side’s brief into the machine. 
Now we didn’t actually construct our research-shortcut machine. We would need a mountain of lawyers’ briefs and judicial opinions to make something useful. And researchers like us do not have free access to data of that sort – even the government-run database known as PACER charges by the page. 
But it does show how technology can turn any task that is extremely time-consuming for humans into one where the heavy lifting can be done at the click of a button.

A history of partial automation
Automating the hard parts of a job can make a big difference both for those performing the job and the consumers on the other side of the transaction.
Take for example, a hydraulic crane or a power forklift. While today people think of operating a crane as manual work, these powered machines were considered labor-saving devices when they were first introduced because they supplanted the human power involved in moving heavy objects around. 
Forklifts and cranes, of course, didn’t replace people. But like automating the grind of legal research, power machines multiplied the amount of work one person could accomplish within a unit of time.  
Partial automation of sewing machines in the early 20th century offers another example. By the 1910s, women working in textile mills were no longer responsible for sewing on a single machine – as you might today on a home sewing machine – but wrangling an industrial-grade machine with 12 needles sewing 4,000 stitches per minute. These machines could automatically perform all the fussy work of hemming, sewing seams and even stitching the “embroidery trimming of white underwear.” Like an airline pilot flying on autopilot, they weren’t sewing so much as monitoring the machine for problems.
Was the transition bad for workers? Maybe somewhat, but it was a boon for consumers. In 1912, women perusing the Sears mail order catalog had a choice between “drawers” with premium hand-embroidered trimming, and a much cheaper machine-embroidered option.
Likewise, automation could help reduce the cost of legal services, making it more accessible for the many individuals who can’t afford a lawyer.   


Legal scholar Miriam Cherry discusses workplace automation with Elizabeth Tippett.

DIY lawyering
Indeed, in other sectors of the economy, technological developments in recent decades have enabled companies to shift work from paid workers to customers. 
Touchscreen technology, for example, enabled airlines to install check-in kiosks. Similar kiosks are almost everywhere – in parking lots, gas stations, grocery stores and even fast-food restaurants.
At one level these kiosks are displacing paid labor by employees with unpaid labor by consumers. But that argument assumes that everyone could access the product or service back when it was performed by an employee.  
[Insight, in your inbox each day. You can get it with The Conversation’s email newsletter.]
In the context of legal services, the many consumers who can’t afford a lawyer are already forgoing their day in court altogether or handling legal claims on their own – often with bad results. If partial automation means an overwhelmed legal aid lawyer now has time to take more clients’ cases or clients can now afford to hire a lawyer, everyone will be better off.
In addition, tech-enabled legal services can help consumers do a better job of representing themselves. For example, the federal district court in Missouri now offers  a platform to help individuals filing for bankruptcy prepare their forms – either on their own or with a free 30-minute meeting with a lawyer. Because the platform provides a head start, both the lawyer and consumer can make better use of the 30-minute time slot.
More help for consumers may be on the way – there is a bumper crop of tech startups jostling to automate various types of legal work. So while our research-shortcut machine hasn’t been built, powerful tools like it may not be far off. 
And the lawyers themselves? Like factory and textile workers armed with new power tools, they may be expected to do more work in the time they have. But it should be less of a grind. It might even free them up to meet with clients.

Miami Dade College Receives Nearly $1 Million from National Science Foundation to Fund Artificial Intelligence

  








Miami, August 9, 2021 – Miami Dade College (MDC) has been awarded a grant for nearly $1 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses with an interdisciplinary approach and ultimately offer a College Credit Certificate in AI, one of the fastest growing industries right now.
As part of the grant, the College will provide industry-based professional training for MDC faculty to develop and pilot AI courses, and integrate AI curriculum into existing courses. Additionally, MDC’s School of Engineering and Technology (EnTec) will provide support mechanisms that engage and encourage underrepresented minorities students to study AI, while establishing multiple entry points into AI for traditional students and existing professionals. The project seeks to meet students where they are geographically, economically, and academically.
“We are very excited to lead the efforts to create an AI for All model,” said MDC President Madeline Pumariega. “This generous grant will support MDC’s mission to prepare all students and faculty with the necessary skills to succeed in today’s innovative labor market and diversify Miami’s growing tech ecosystem.”
The four-year grant will be implemented at MDC in collaboration with the University of Florida, Texas A&M University-Commerce (TAMUC) and the non-profit organization AI4ALL. The project will also have support from AI experts from companies including IBM, AWS, and Microsoft.
“With this project, we hope to learn more about how students come to see themselves as the kind of individuals who study and work in AI, and how we can create more supportive environments for students, particularly those from racially and ethnically marginalized backgrounds, to study AI” said Sarah Rodriguez, Associate Professor at TAMUC and researcher for the grant.
The collaboration with TAMUC will provide MDC with an opportunity to research how best to serve all college students in AI and how the AI program builds STEM identity and AI self-efficacy, particularly among Hispanic and Black students.
“This grant will support the college’s efforts to create AI interdisciplinary courses for all college students,” added Antonio Delgado, Dean of EnTec. “Collaborations with leading AI institutions and companies puts us at the forefront of AI workforce development.”
EnTec is currently offering the course AI Thinking, which explores different technologies utilizing concepts and skills widely accepted for AI and digital competency. The course will be available during the fall semester starting Sept. 29 at MDC North Campus, where the new AI Center is currently under construction.

All these terms fall under the same domain but they have their individual applications and meaning. For the tech companies, the application of these terms is given the top list priority. Even the job hirings for these domains is increasing at a high rate. It has increased 74% according to Linkedin's 2019 &quot;Emerging Jobs&quot; report. The salary offered to a data scientist and AI engineer is quite high which is above US$100k. The growing need for talents in such jobs has triggered a number of universities to provide degrees in those domains, many new courses, diplomas, full-time courses, private boot camps have emerged and also are still emerging. But a question arises about which domain's course should be taken up. Is it AI, ML, or data science? Is there any difference?.Answering this, yes there are differences but the difference is not a definite one. There is a very thin line of boundaries among the three which cannot be ignored. Many universities tend to ignore the boundary and provide degree programs based on the combination of the three. This makes students unclear about which field their focus is on. So, it is important to mark the differences and provide proper guidance to the students..Where does the difference lie between the three domains?.Artificial intelligence refers to machines that have the potential to replicate the cognitive capabilities that are associated with the human mind. It is about replicating human minds' capabilities..Machine learning is generally considered to be the potentiality of a computer program to learn or boost performance through examples rather than detailed programmed rules. Machine learning is one of the essential tools which data scientists use to examine and interpret data..Data science refers to the accumulation of methods, tools, and practices of analyzing data to interpret and derive insights in order to support decision-making..Both AI and data science use machine learning as key tools. In AI, ML tools are used in real-time to allow machines to execute their action. ML is the essential tool in the field of AI to develop intelligent agents. In the field of data science, ML is used as a data analysis tool to unlock patterns in data and to make predictions..What should you learn?.After understanding three different fields of expertise, you need to think about what your goals are and which one you prefer. If you want to go for research work then preferably the field of data science is the one for you. If you want to become an engineer and want to create intelligence into software products then machine learning or more preferably AI is the best path to take..Still, if you are not sure which path to choose you can start with data science because after all data is everything, data is the key to success in all the fields whether it is AI or ML. Strong expertise in processing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, along with statistical knowledge, will benefit you no matter what path you ultimately take..But it is important to note that if you are just starting your career, try to build your domain knowledge before spending your time learning about data science or ML or AI. If you have adequate domain knowledge you will maturely understand the problem you are trying to interpret and also recognize how AI or ML or data science can play a role in solving it..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The future is now: artificial intelligence and anticipatory humanitarian action

As the world faces simultaneous disasters and burgeoning risks, humanitarian actors need to develop more efficient ways of delivering aid to vulnerable populations. One current trend involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to process large amounts of data quickly to inform – and even autonomously undertake – decision-making processes. While these processes have the potential to facilitate faster and better anticipatory humanitarian action, they can pose unforeseen challenges if left unregulated and unchecked.
In this post, Christopher Chen, Associate Research Fellow at the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies, explores the promise and perils of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of anticipatory humanitarian action. Building on insights gleaned from a data governance and protection workshop co-hosted by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the ICRC, he highlights some of the implications of the use of new technologies in humanitarian action and how the principle of ‘do no harm’ can be applied in a digital age.

ICRC Humanitarian Law & Policy Blog · The future is now: artificial intelligence and anticipatory humanitarian action
Speaking on the need for a more proactive humanitarian system, Sir Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, stated in 2019 that ‘[t]he best way to [address gaps] is to change our current system from one that reacts, to one that anticipates’.
Heeding this call, aid workers and organizations have been trying to use new and emerging technologies to facilitate earlier, faster, and potentially more effective humanitarian action. Part of this technological shift involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the efficiency of humanitarian responses and field operations.
However, such a promise is also accompanied by potential pitfalls. Inadequate data governance and data protection might cause unintended harm to vulnerable populations, while poor artificial intelligence and machine learning implementation can exacerbate and intensify existing bias and inequalities. As such, these risks and challenges must be identified and mitigated to ensure that the use of new technology does no harm and protects the life and dignity of those it is intended to serve.
Future-proofing the aid sector?
Embracing innovation is part and parcel of future-proofing the humanitarian sector. Future-proofing refers to the process of anticipating future shocks and stresses and developing methods to minimize their adverse effects. AI/ML-based interventions contribute to this by automating and positively impacting various aspects of humanitarian work.
The ICRC defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as ‘computer programs that carry out tasks – often associated with human intelligence – that require cognition, planning, reasoning or learning’. It also defines Machine Learning (ML) systems as ‘AI systems that are “trained” on and “learn” from data, which ultimately define the way they function’. An example of this is IBM’s ML system that analyzes drivers of migration and uses the data to forecast cross-border movements and refugee flows. As a UN OCHA report states, these systems can facilitate analysis and interpretation of large and complex humanitarian datasets to improve projections and decision-making in humanitarian settings.
AI may be harnessed to improve workflows and optimize the disbursement of aid. For example, in July 2020, predictive analytics frameworks implemented by the UN and other partner organizations forecasted severe flooding along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. In response, UN OCHA’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocated and released funding – roughly $5.2 million – to several humanitarian agencies, which enabled them to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations before flooding reached critical levels. This was CERF’s fastest-ever disbursement of funds in a crisis.
This illustrates how developments in AI/ML and predictive analytics make it possible to anticipate when disasters are about to strike. This facilitates a more proactive, anticipatory approach to humanitarian action and enables humanitarians to deliver more timely assistance to populations.
Caveat emptor: risks to vulnerable populations
While aid agencies might benefit from the use of AI/ML, these technologies can inadvertently bring risks to vulnerable populations. Without the right safeguards, AI/ML could exacerbate inequalities and further marginalize vulnerable groups.
Consider the scenario where AI/ML processes are used to identify suitable target populations for a particular humanitarian programme. What happens if the algorithm, for some reason, decides that certain people – who would usually be entitled to participate in the programme – should be excluded? Learned bias in AI/ML can lead to the further discrimination of vulnerable populations. This is far from a hypothetical, as over the past few years, there have been many high-profile cases of ML systems demonstrating racial and gender biases. A study in 2019 found that face recognition technologies across 189 algorithms are least accurate on women of colour. It is easy to see how this can be problematic in a humanitarian setting, where vulnerable populations might be subjected to such biases and their corresponding effects, that is, discriminatory disbursement of aid and false positives in the identification of missing people.
AI also needs substantial amounts of quality data to be trained effectively. However, humanitarians often work in places where accurate data on populations are inaccessible. Political contexts might also prevent the collection of sensitive datasets. This makes the training of AI/ML processes particularly difficult. Without access to quality data sets, AI/ML systems cannot be trained and used in a way that avoids amplifying the risks identified above.
These challenges underscore the importance of users having a healthy skepticism when they engage with AI/ML processes. The reality is that it is difficult to code for values; fairness and justice cannot be automated.
Ghosts in the machine
We live in an age of rapid technological progress. While technologies like AI/ML can make humanitarian work better and more effective, they might also unexpectedly evolve past its original intended purposes, thus threatening the very populations that humanitarians are trying to protect. As such, humanitarians need to realistically assess the capabilities and limitations of AI/ML.
The implementation of AI/ML projects in humanitarian settings should be carried out equitably; partnerships and programmes should not be decided solely by stakeholders from Geneva and New York. This requires active engagement with practitioners on the ground and recipients of aid to identify capacity and systemic gaps. Humanitarian organizations using AI/ML in their work must build feedback loops into their processes for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
At a recent workshop hosted by the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, discussions centred around the opportunities and risks of using new technologies in humanitarian action, as well as the importance of data governance protocols. In the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning breakout group, participants acknowledged the need for humanitarians to adopt a human-centric approach when using AI and ML.
Especially in situations involving vulnerable and at-risk populations, human control and judgement in applications of AI/ML should be prioritized. AI and ML systems should only be used to augment analytical processes; it should not replace the human element involved in decision-making. This will help to preserve a level of ethical accountability and ensure that digital transformation in the sector takes place in a fair and ethical manner.
The most important takeaway is that, while guidelines or legislative frameworks are important elements of an ethical and safe AI/ML ecosystem, they need to be underpinned by a human-centred approach.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in marketing right now. Raj Venkatesan and Jim Lecinski recently published a book entitled “The AI Marketing Canvas: A Five-Stage Road Map to Implementing Artificial Intelligence in Marketing”. To better understand what an AI marketing canvas is, I sought insight from Raj Venkatesan, a professor at the Darden School of Business. In full disclosure, I work with Raj and find his research and work fascinating. Below is insight on the AI marketing canvas.


Kimberly A. Whitler: Why did you and Jim write this book?

Raj Venkatesan: We heard and experienced the rise of data and algorithms. Marketing professionals had started to pay attention to this, and they wanted to invest in this new technology. But they were struggling with the why and the how questions. They needed guidance on the ultimate objective of using AI in marketing, i.e., how is marketing—and  customer relationships—going to improve from using AI. There were books written at a very high level regarding whether machines would take over. You know, is the Matrix going to take over, or for the younger people, are we all going to be in Halladay’s game, the Oasis, like Ready Player. On the other hand, there were books written around 10 steps to better email marketing. Very granular, but again not at the strategic level a senior marketing profession would want to use AI. So, we set out writing a book, that we feel is like the goldilocks solution, not too high, and not too granular.

Whitler: How do you explain what AI means to a marketer?

Venkatesan: My philosophy is to use AI to supercharge the customer experience through personalization at scale. I frequent this Chinese restaurant near Darden, Peter Chang. They greet me by my name, know where I like to sit, what I like to order, and when I call them, they know exactly what I would want. They know my kids and family etc. Now this family that owns Peter Chang might know their regular customers intimately and would be able to remember about 200 of their regular customers if they are REALLY GOOD. AI is about taking this level of personalization to 10s of millions of customers. Brands like Chick-fil-a, and Starbucks are trying to achieve this personalization using AI in their mobile apps and translating the insights from the app into personalized in-store customer experiences also. So, SBux knows what drinks I like, what sandwiches I normally get, they might know that I have kids (because my son loves the Vanilla Bean Fappacino and Cake Pop), if ordered ahead on the mobile app, the barrista can address me by my name etc.
PROMOTED
An effective strategy is to use AI to personalize each aspect of customer engagement; acquisition, retention, growth, and advocacy (or word of mouth). Modern marketing is about using first party consumer data and algorithms to personalize the firms’ marketing for acquisition, retention, growth and advocacy. The idea is to put the customer in the center and use AI to enhance the customer’s experience with the brand.
Whitler: In your book you propose a five-stage roadmap for including AI in your marketing strategy. Can you explain?
Venkatesan: The five-step roadmap provides marketing managers a tool to plan and develop their AI marketing strategy. It consists of five steps; foundation, experimentation, expansion, transformation, and monetization. Foundation is about collecting relevant first party data that is the essential input for any AI algorithm. In the experimentation stage, a firm attempts to personalize one aspect of customer engagement. In the expansion stage, the firm personalizes more than one aspect of customer engagement, and in the transformation stage, all aspects of customer engagement are personalized. In the monetization stage, the firm uses all the developed AI capabilities to develop a services/software platform that provides on-demand services to other business, thereby developing a new revenue stream.

Whitler: Which industries can hope to achieve maximum impact?
Venkatesan: Firms that have a direct to consumer of customer relationship can achieve the maximum impact. AI in marketing requires good data that are directly collected from the consumers, i.e., first party data. In the research for our book we found that firms across industries, including consumer packaged goods, banks, B2B firms, retailers (online as well as brick and mortar), technology firms, pharmaceutical firms, travel and hospitality industries, media, and software, are using AI in their marketing strategies.

Whitler: What are some tips for an early-stage startup to use AI in marketing?
Venkatesan: The roadmap talks about a small steps approach. You should start with the experimentation stage, work with a vendor to first evaluate personalization in SEO/SEM. Website and customer service personalization. Salesperson call patterns of customers etc. If it works out, you can build more in the expansion stage. You have the advantage of no legacy costs when collecting first party data.

Technology will allow architects and designers to spend more time designing and less time doing admin, according to Adel Zakout and Tom Mallory of furniture-sourcing platform Clippings.



The duo, who this week announced the sale of their business to US samples service Material Bank, said that architecture and design is ""is one of the few remaining sectors that really has not been touched significantly by technology.""
But this is finally changing, they added.
""I believe that in 10 years, interior designers and architects will be doing more designing,"" said Zakout (above, left), who co-founded the London-based platform with Mallory (right) in 2014.
""Today, interior designers and architects are spending 60 to 80 per cent of their time just doing admin like emails, Excel sheets, putting quotes together and just managing stuff,"" he added.



""Unfortunately, that's part of the job today because technology hasn't caught up,"" he said. ""Technology has not enabled them to save time and focus on where they can add value. But in 10 years time, designers will be able to design more"" thanks to technology.
Pandemic ""accelerated"" way of thinking about technology
Mallory added that the coronavirus pandemic has ""drastically shifted"" attitudes to technology in the sector.
""The pandemic certainly has accelerated the way people are thinking about distribution channels and how technology can be a part of it,"" he said.

Clippings handles the selection, purchase and delivery of furniture, lighting and other products for architecture and interior projects, while the brand's new parent Material Bank offers North American architects overnight delivery of a wide range of material samples.
Services like these will allow architects and interior designers to focus on their design work, the duo believes.
AI ""is incredibly powerful""
They disagreed with claims that artificial intelligence will make designers redundant.
Two years ago, New York designer Sebastian Errazuriz warned that AI would eliminate the majority of creative jobs in architecture.
""I think it's important that architects are warned as soon as possible that 90 per cent of their jobs are at risk,"" he said.
But Zakout said: ""I actually think it'll be the opposite. I think artificial intelligence will empower designers. I think that AI, especially for repetitive work, is incredibly powerful. But fundamentally, the creative process that designers go through will be quite difficult to replace with AI.""

""I do believe that AI will have a huge impact on the process,"" he added. ""It'll make things like discovery, the procurement process, matching the products in the general workflow much easier and quicker.""
""I think technology will do a lot to enhance the process but I don't believe that I will replace the designer.""
Covid-19 forced brands to adopt tech
Zakout agreed that the coronavirus pandemic forced furniture and lighting brands to come to terms with technology.
""A lot of brands woke up last March and realised that their whole distribution channels had been shut down,"" he said. ""Their whole method of distributing their products, marketing, selling their products, was no longer available.""
This led them to embrace digital solutions for the first time, he added.
""There has been a drastic mentality shift,"" he said. ""Businesses like Herman Miller [now MillerKnoll] are starting to sell directly to customers,"" via the Herman Miller Professional portal that it built in conjunction with Clippings.
""So I think things are accelerating. Covid has definitely been a bit of a trigger. It's been a kick for some brands to really move on with their plans.""

Machine learning (ML) is a continuously evolving process that requires large, diverse and carefully labeled datasets for training ML algorithms. But, collecting and labeling datasets with millions of elements drawn from the real world is time-consuming and expensive. This has vaulted synthetic data into the spotlight as the favored tool for training purposes. Let’s see how synthetic data offers a reprieve from the data quality conundrum and reshape large-scale ML deployments.
Enterprises want to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) more than ever. A 2021 surveyOpens a new window  by Algorithmia found that 76% of organizations prioritize AI/ML over other IT initiatives, while 71% have increased their annual spending on AI/ML. Opens a new window 
The only flip side to it is that many ML projects never come to fruition. A 2020 survey by International Data Corporation (IDC) found that 28% of the 2,000 IT decision-makers involved had witnessed their AI/ML initiatives fail. Opens a new window 
In a similar vein, a 2021 report by Wakefield Research for Alation found around 87% of respondents identified data quality issues as the biggest hurdle to successfully implementing AI in their organizations. Bad data has already cost businesses trillions of dollars. IBM estimates bad data has cost the U.S. more than $3 trillion every year. Opens a new window 
Generating good quality training data for machine learning can be tricky. Errors in measurement or poor understanding of the requirements of the machine learning model can erode data quality. There are various ways in which data scientists are trying to address this issue. One solution is to cleanse data before feeding them to the machine learning algorithm. However, this can take a lot of time.
On the other hand, synthetic data is a lot more cost-effective and less time-intensive. More importantly, it improves the data quality critical to the effectiveness of a machine learning model and the success of the project.
“Synthetic data is very effective at improving data quality in learning models, and we have experienced success using it. It can be challenging obtaining real production data, and when we do, it frequently needs close scrutiny to remove errors and ensure accuracy of labeling. Additionally, the data invariably requires significant redaction,” says Richard Whitehead, chief evangelist and CTO at Moogsoft, an AIOps company.
With more ML practitioners throwing their weight behind synthetic data, its implementation is expected to grow further. Gartner predicts, by 2024, the use of synthetic data and transfer learning will limit the volume of real-world data needed for machine learning by half.
IDC also observes that the use of synthetic data for machine learning has been steadily increasing, particularly in use cases that may not have precedence or sufficient past data (such as autonomous driving, computer vision, etc.). It is expected that the majority of the data used for AI/ ML projects would be synthetic in the next five years.

What Is Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data refers to information generated through computer simulations instead of being collected or measured in the real world.
Though it’s artificial, it is supposed to reflect real-world data and have the same mathematical and statistical properties. Unlike real-world data, ML practitioners have complete sovereignty over the synthetic dataset. This allows them to control the degree of labeling, sampling size, and noise levels. This also helps address privacy and security concerns where using real-world data involves sensitive and personal information of users. This makes it a lot easier for ML practitioners to publish, share, and analyze synthetic datasets with a wider ML community without worrying about exposing personally identifiable information and facing the ire of data protection authorities. 
Synthetic data has seen a lot of traction in self-driving vehicles, robotics, healthcare, cybersecurity and fraud protection. Google and Uber have been leveraging them extensively to improve the autonomy levels in their self-driven cars. Likewise, Amazon reportedly uses synthetic data to train Alexa’s language tool.
Synthetic data can be classified into three categories: fully synthetic data, hybrid synthetic data and partially synthetic data.
When it comes to synthetic data generation, there are various techniques to build and perfect synthetic datasets in line with the complexity of the use case. Less complicated options include statistical modeling and Monte Carlo simulations, while the more complex options include engine-based simulation, agent-based synthetic data generation and generative adversarial networks (GAN).
Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that carries out risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values. Agent-based synthetic data generation first creates a physical model of real-world data, then reproduces random data using the same model.
GAN pits two neural networks against each other. The first network, called a generator, is entrusted with creating synthetic data from random input. The second network, called the discriminator, tries to tell whether the input data is real or not. The discriminator is trained using both real and fake data.
“The core intuition is that synthetic data — by virtue of being artificially generated — allows us to introduce knowledge into AI models that we wouldn’t be able to incorporate via real data,’’ says Farhan Choudhary, Principal Analyst at Gartner.
Choudhary explains, “Many AI, machine learning and analytics projects suffer from delays caused by obtaining production data for development and testing. Synthetic data generation helps reduce the bias in datasets by representing data with appropriate balance, density, distribution and other parameters, ultimately solving the data quality problem in ML projects.’’
According to Gartner, synthetic data can:

Introduce domain-specific knowledge in the training of AI models, thereby improving the quality of model predictions.
Complete datasets where data is scarce, unavailable, unbalanced and can also be used to generate unknown scenarios for better model training.
Help in testing complex AI models and increase their robustness.
Address combinatorial explosion, especially in portfolio optimization and initiative sequencing business problems, where real data is impossible to obtain.

Complexities of Synthetic Data
Though adoption has been growing, generating and using synthetic data to train machine learning algorithms and finding people with the right skills to support it can be challenging.
Choudhary points out that the quality of the generated synthetic data depends on the model that generates the data; hence, not all approaches will yield high-quality results.
“Depending on the approach, synthetic data can still reveal sensitive information, can miss natural anomalies, or not even contribute any significant value over and above the already existing real world data, therefore understanding a wider variety of approaches is recommended,’’ he adds.
Sriram Subramanian, primary analyst for AI ML lifecycle software at IDC, believes synthetic data is not a panacea. It’s effectiveness depends on various factors such as the source of the data, accuracy of the generation algorithms and how close it is to real data.
“Some of the complexities include finding the right source, efforts and time involved, the possibility of bias introduction, and trustworthiness of the generated data,’’ Subramanian adds.

Best Practices to Use Synthetic Data
To get the most out of synthetic data, ML practitioners should keep a few things in mind. First of all, they need to ensure the dataset adequately emulates their use case. Whitehead suggests they need to ensure that the dataset adequately represents the production environment in terms of both complexity and comprehensiveness of examples.
They also need to ensure the data is clean. “Since the data is synthesized, this is more to do with making sure there are no bugs in the generation. When possible, have subject matter experts validate the dataset,’’ he adds.
ML practitioners also need to accept that application of synthetic data may not work in all use cases. Choudhary cautions that the opportunity needs to be evaluated first to determine if synthetic data can potentially solve the problem.
He also weighs in favor of upskilling within the organization to utilize synthetic generation techniques and collaboration with researchers, academia, and startups working on the topic.
Subramanian feels that companies should have an enterprise-wide data intelligence strategy and invest in the right tools for DataOps and data labeling solutions. 
Conclusion  
Machine learning is highly sensitive to bad quality input data. By leveraging synthetic data, ML practitioners are beginning to address this gap. Unlike real-world data, synthetic data has been found to be more reliable and cost-effective to generate. Many experts feel it is even better than real-world data for training purposes.  
As the application of synthetic data has grown, so has awareness about it. More companies from different sectors including computing, healthcare, banking and automobile now want to tap it to improve their machine learning-based products and services.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly seen as a must-have technology that enables businesses to become agile and innovate at scale. IDC predicts global spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems will increase from US $50 billion in 2020 to US $110 billion in 2024.
But Gartner research estimates that 50 percent of AI implementations are struggling to get past the proof-of-concept stage and be implemented at scale. The reasons vary from overhyped expectations and lack of vision to inadequate data infrastructure and lack of skilled resources.
Another important factor is the team that’s working on the AI programs. While AI teams may have the requisite tools and technologies, many lack other key capabilities – like mining for the right use cases and optimizing decision-making – that are essential for success.

1. They frame the problem well
Teams need to be able to sift through the complexities of the situation to frame the core of the problem accurately before they get to the right solution. This means playing the role of translator and bridging the gap between technology and the business case. It involves diving deep into data to make unexpected connections and find insights that shine a brighter light on the problem.
Along with understanding data and algorithms, successful teams also exhibit empathy for customers and other users, which helps in solving problems holistically. They are creative and curious; they look at the world from an exploratory perspective and are unafraid to challenge the status quo. These traits enable them to constantly consider how their work impacts the business that they are innovating for. Along with understanding data and algorithms, successful teams also exhibit empathy for customers and other users, which helps in solving problems holistically.
2. They think enterprise-scale right from the start
In most instances, AI pilot programs show promising results but then fail to scale. Accenture surveys point to 84 percent of C-suite executives acknowledging that scaling AI is important for future growth, but a whopping 76 percent also admit that they are struggling to do so.
The only way to realize the full potential of AI is by scaling it across the enterprise. Unfortunately, some AI teams think only in terms of executing a workable prototype to establish proof-of-concept, or at best transform a department or function.
Teams that think enterprise-scale at the design stage can go successfully from pilot to enterprise-scale production. They often build and work on ML-Ops platforms to standardize the ML lifecycle and build a factory line for data preparation, cataloguing, model management, AI assurance, and more.
3. They democratize AI and are diverse
AI technologies demand huge compute and storage capacities, which often only large, sophisticated organizations can afford. Because resources are limited, AI access is privileged in most companies. This compromises performance because fewer minds mean fewer ideas, fewer identified problems, and fewer innovations. In fact, the more diverse the team, the better it is at uncovering problems and making data connections.
At Infosys, we have addressed this by leveraging an AI cloud as a strategic platform for scaling computing resources and sharing knowledge to make AI accessible to all. We’ve also added diverse roles and skills within the AI team – not just technical like data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning experts, but also those with business domain, product management, user interface design, and software engineering skills.
With the AI cloud, we can now build larger and more able pools of expertise in AI because we are able to scale the computing resources needed to include more of our workforce in our AI programs as well as build more mission-critical AI applications. Ultimately, democratizing AI leads to better project outcomes.
4. They keenly appreciate the ethics of AI

Finding use cases, building AI systems at enterprise-scale, and democratizing adoption is but half the battle. Managing the ethical dimensions of AI implementations is serious business that involves input from regulators and policymakers too. The AI team must understand what it takes to work within the framework of regulatory compliance. They need to implement strong and auditable risk management practices throughout AI development, validation, and monitoring to build unbiased, interpretable, accountable, and reproducible AI systems that deliver business outcomes that are fair and transparent.
Truly, AI is as much about people as it is about programming.

Only three years ago the rate was closer to 70K applications a year. Using patentguru.com, I reviewed the frequency of U.S. patent publications and patent application publications for the following terms in their title: “machine-learning” or “machine learning” or “data analysis” or “analytics” or “computer program product” or “artificial intelligence” or “data science” or “neural network.” The more general terms of “analytics” and “computer program product” were included as only the patent titles were reviewed not the body of the patent text.It is possible a small amount of non-ML/AI patents are included but manual inspection of the resulting patents determined these search terms gave good results. The top assignee for the patents was IBM, followed by Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Huawei, and Apple.How are Patents Organized?Patents need to be filed into a particular category. These categories were created a long time ago, before computer work products were something that needed a category. For this reason you will find most US Patent Office ML/AI type patents in category G: Physics, but they can be found in any category depending on the domain the invention is applied on.A: Human NecessitiesB: Performing Operations, TransportingC: Chemistry, MetallurgyD: Textiles, PaperE: Fixed ConstructionsF: Mechanical Engineering, Lighting, Heating, WeaponsG: PhysicsH: ElectricityHow to Get More Information On A Particular Class of PatentsWithin each class there are subclasses, with G06F the most common for the US Patent Office ML/AI patents.Using www.patbase.com, I reviewed information on the category G06N. This is a category where I recently filed a machine learning patent application. The results here are for all patents and applications in the class, not just the machine learning related ones.PatBase Analytics Results for G06NThe top assignee for the category of computer systems based on specific computational models is IBM, which has twice the number of patents as the next closest assignees Microsoft, Google, and Samsung. In this evaluation I did not limit to U.S. patents and so you will see the distribution of assignees globally.Many of these applications are for Chinese patents, followed by the United States.The number of patent applications in 2020 and 2021 for G06N, across all countries, is experiencing dramatic growth. This is just one of the multiple categories where machine learning and AI patents can be filed.How do I write a patent of my very own?You don’t. Your patent attorney does it for you. Only a patent attorney or a very dedicated inventor would attempt to write a patent. Your company can hire a patent attorney to help you, if they are dedicated to the concept of patenting their intellectual property and want to protect your project. The cost is not insignificant, and it is entirely possible that your company may prefer to keep your work as a “trade secret” rather than patent it. Assuming your patent is for work associated with an employer, your name will appear on the patent, but the “assignee” of the patent will be your employer.Publication of your work, rather than pursuing a patent, is another path that can be taken. This may be preferable if the goal is to establish a reputation as an expert, as well as the dissemination of general knowledge, rather than specific protection of the work.In order to proceed with patenting your work, you need to be able to demonstrate that your work is novel, non-obvious, and useful. You should create documents to explain your invention in layman’s terms. It should clearly explain your work, and what aspect of the work you are trying to protect. You are not able to patent abstract concepts, there must be a practical application to your invention. Your attorneys will be able to search for “prior art” to confirm your claims. While you can also search for “prior art”, keep in mind that you are required to disclose any findings that you have from such a search. When the patent is written, it will contain exactly that — “claims”. These claims describe exactly what your invention is composed of and are the most important part of the patent. They will also decide which class and subclass your patent should be submitted to, and the type of patent you will file.It can be a bit disorienting to see your invention parsed into legalese that is difficult for even you to understand, and accompanied by unfamiliar diagrams. Apparently this is exactly what the patent office is looking for, so at this point you need to trust your attorneys. You also need to ensure that they have clearly understood your invention as they wrote it up and that the claims do in fact represent what you are trying to patent. Different claims can be associated with different inventors, so this is where you can designate which inventor contributed to the various aspects of the overall invention.Can I make money from my patent?Probably not. Also, your employer will probably not make any money from it either. Patents can be used to increase the intrinsic value of a company, and demonstrate their position as an innovative leader, even where no actual monetary value is associated with a specific patent. Also, the patent protects your product from being patented by someone else. Many patents are filed without a specific plan to monetize the invention being protected.New AI Data From The USPTOThe US Patent Office has recently released a dataset of AI related patents. This dataset was compiled based upon a more comprehensive method of classifying patents than was used in this article.

AI accountability: Who's responsible when AI goes wrong?


Who should be held accountable when AI misbehaves? The users, the creators, the vendors? It's not clear, but experts have some ideas.

AI systems sometimes run amok.
One chatbot, designed by Microsoft to mimic a teenager, began spewing racist hate speech within hours of its release online. Microsoft immediately took the bot down.







Another system, which Amazon designed to help its recruiting efforts but ultimately didn't release, inadvertently discriminated against female applicants.
Other so-called ""smart"" systems have led to false arrests, biased bail amounts for criminal defendants, and even fatal car crashes.
Experts expect to see more cases of problematic AI as organizations increasingly implement intelligent technology, sometimes doing so without adopting the proper governance in place. A governance framework, and extra attention to AI ethical concerns, can help prevent unintended biases and algorithmic drift in AI models.  
""There will be large systemic disruptions and therefore large benefits to those who lead with AI. But along with that comes responsibility to set up guidelines and transparency in the work you do,"" said Sanjay Srivastava, chief digital officer at professional services firm Genpact.
""If you use AI, you cannot separate yourself from the liability or the consequences of those uses,"" he said.
Most organizations don't have the proper guidelines in place, however.
The lack of standardized guidance around AI governance, and the complexity of deep learning and machine learning models, has made it difficult for experts to decide who to blame when an AI system goes wrong.

Creating AI accountability
Creating ethical AI requires attention to three broad and interrelated areas, according to experts: functional performance, the data it uses and how the system itself is used.
Take the first bucket -- functional performance. Organizations generally use AI-type technologies, which includes machine learning and natural language processing, to analyze data and make predictions. But all the components within AI need to function properly for the system to produce accurate, fair and legal decisions.
For example, a credit card fraud detection system must use finely tuned algorithms to protect customers against unauthorized use of their credit cards but not decline when people make unusual yet legitimate purchases. A system that lets an unauthorized use slip by, or makes too many false positives, could destroy customers' trust in it.
The second area deals with data -- more specifically, ensuring that a high volume of high-quality data is used when training and using AI. Systems work best when they have clean, unbiased data to work with, especially when they have a lot of it.
Organizations also should safeguard that data against unauthorized access and use.
The third bucket deals with preventing unintended biases -- that is, ensuring that the data fed into the algorithms, as well as the algorithms themselves, do not produce results that discriminate.
In the case of Amazon's biased hiring model, the company used resumes it had accrued over the past decade to train the model. Most of the resumes were submitted by men during that time, so the model inherently tried to hire more men than women. That setup created what could have been a legal problem if Amazon hadn't caught the biased decisions.
Similarly, creating ethical AI and AI accountability also means safeguarding against unintended uses. Most AI systems are designed for a specific use case; using them for a different use case would produce incorrect results. For example, an AI-based system designed to optimize crop yields for wheat farmers can't just be transferred to advise rice farmers looking to maximize their yields.
Organizations attentive to all three of those areas, and the nuances within each of them, are more likely to have AI-based systems that produce accurate and fair results, Srivastava said. Those organizations are also more likely to identify early when their systems aren't working well, creating a level of accountability above less attentive organizations.



The potential for something to go wrong can come out of left field.


Mike Loukides Vice president of content strategy, O'Reilly Media






No guarantees of AI success, responsibility
Even if an AI creator follows those guidelines, it's no guarantee that the creating organization would be held accountable if problems result from AI use.
""The potential for something to go wrong can come out of left field,"" said Mike Loukides, vice president of content strategy at O'Reilly Media, a business and technology training company.
So, what happens when AI systems drift away from producing accurate and fair results? Or what happens if they never produced them in the first place? Who is accountable for the consequences that ensue?
It's not clear.
""The idea of accountability is that if something goes wrong then someone's job is on the line, but that's not the case here in most companies. I'd like to think, though, it's at least someone's job to fix it,"" Loukides said.
Other experts shared that observation, noting several reasons for the lack of clear accountability with problematic AI.
Experts pointed to the relative newness of AI and its use within businesses, explaining that many corporate leaders aren't yet attuned to all that can go wrong when using this technology.
Organizations don't always have the expertise to create and maintain fair and accurate AI-based systems, said Brandon Purcell, vice president and principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Moreover, they may not even know where their responsibilities versus other contributors' responsibilities exist within an intelligent technology ecosystem.
""For most companies, the supply chain for AI is very long and complicated,"" Purcell said.
He points to self-driving vehicles: Many different companies contribute to the intelligent systems that power self-driving vehicles. For example, different companies could potentially contribute data, label data and build computer vision models. Each company could blame another when something goes wrong, Purcell said.
The legal system could help sort out AI accountability, with many lawsuits around these issues, he said.
But by implementing stringent AI governance policies, companies could get ahead of lawsuit scenarios.
""This is an opportunity to codify your ethical standards,"" Purcell said.
Take IBM, for example, where AI accountability and ethics are made up of several pieces, according to Seth Dobrin, the company's chief AI officer.
IBM approaches AI accountability by deeming that the company alone is accountable for its AI, and everyone involved in the process of creating the scope, designing, deploying and managing that AI at IBM is responsible for it, he said.
To Dobrin, AI accountability and ethics means that the AI is transparent and explainable. It's fair, meaning free of unintended and unacceptable biases. It's robust in that it holds up to external pressures such as cybersecurity attacks. In addition, the AI system respects privacy, for example, by preserving the anonymity of the people it affects. And it respects and adheres to relevant regulations, he said.


Regulations on accountable AI on their way
Organizations may see governments taking action on AI accountability by passing laws that establish certain requirements for companies using AI systems. Lawmakers could also enact policies to hold organizations accountable when AI systems do harm.
Indeed, some government regulations are already in the works, with the European Union leading the charge.
It's not clear, however, if such actions will effectively ensure ethical, trustworthy AI and hold organizations responsible when they fall short of AI guidelines.
Policymakers and technology experts debate over how much regulation to enact. Some experts believe too much regulation could limit technological creativity and advancement. Yet too little regulation could allow harmful AI systems to run rampant. Where to draw the line is still widely up to debate.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Robots can do repetitive tasks, perfectly and endlessly. This doesn't mean they are coming for your job though. The adaptability of human workers is something that robots just can't compete with. 




I’ll be the first to admit that my robot vacuum has made my life so much easier that I now own several – and wonder how I ever lived without them. (Full disclosure: I test tech products, so I didn’t have to pay for my favorite housemates.)
It’s not hard for me to embrace robot vacuums because I hate housework, so anything that moves that task off my plate is more than welcome. I get paid to write; I don’t get paid to do housework.
But if I did get paid to do housework, would I feel the same way?
Most – if not all – of our technological advances seem to create what is often viewed as a win/lose scenario: a win for consumers seeking convenience and/or for companies that want to cut costs and increase efficiency, but a loss for displaced employees and/or soon-to-be-obsolete industries.
Will the robots that make our lives easier also threaten our livelihoods?

“First, robots can be programmed to be strong, precise and fast, and they lack emotions, so they’ll never be bored.” As a result, Ferguson believes robots are ideal for certain types of tasks. “We are seeing robots take ownership of roles that would have put humans at risk on job sites that are underwater, underground, or behind enemy lines,” he says. And since the pandemic started, Ferguson notes that robots have been safely and efficiently dispensing medicine in hospitals – which keeps both patients and hospital workers safe.

Steven Umbrello, managing director at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, agrees that robotic process automation (RPA) trends have only been exacerbated by the current pandemic, as companies look for ways to provide distance and safety. “We can see this particularly in the healthcare industry that has taken chatbots as a means of interfering between humans.” This reduces human interaction, but it also serves another purpose. “It justifies continued operation – underscoring the continued need to operate at a reduction of cost and strains on productivity, given the logistics and labor decline during the past year,” Umbrello explains.
For example, the pandemic severely disrupted U.S. supply chains, and in January, 2021, Bloomberg reported that some manufacturers reported absenteeism rates as high as 25%. That’s not something those companies want to experience again. (Read also: Has a Global Pandemic Changed the World's View of AI?)
“These types of AI systems will not only continue, but will also be used as a means to justify to legislators and regulatory bodies the continued upscaling of production given the reduction of human-to-human interactions in confined spaces,” Umbrello says. The advantages are obvious – not a single robot called in sick, needed a COVID-19 test, or was required to maintain social distancing, so some companies view them as vital to long-term sustainability.
But it’s not just healthcare and potentially dangerous jobs that robots are overtaking. “Within the stock market alone, most independent brokers have been displaced and will continue to be displaced,” Umbrello says. “The vast majority of trades are done by fast trading algorithms that are capable of executing a number of trades that far exceeds that of any human agent.”
And perhaps that’s the surprising part. Most people have probably communicated with chatbots, so they knew that certain jobs, like customer service reps, were probably in danger. And a study by MIT revealed that from 1990 to 2007, every robot added in the manufacturing sector replaced approximately 3.3 workers. As the BBC reports, another study, by Oxford Economics, found that globally, 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost by 2030 (1.5 million jobs in America).
However, even degreed professions, such as translators, journalists, radiologists, and even accountants and tax preparers could be in danger. And that’s because replacement has less to do with whether the job requires a college degree and more about the level of repetitive or formulaic work involved.
“This group includes highly educated white-collar workers such as accountants–many of whose mathematical work can now be done by smart applications (like Turbotax, for instance) –and paralegals–whose fact-checking, editing and formulation of routine documents can now be done by AI-based applications,” says Kevin LaGrandeur, Ph.D., a professor at the New York Institute of Technology, fellow at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, co-founder of the NY Posthuman Research Group, and author of Surviving the Machine Age. And Oxford economists warns that over the next 20 years, almost 40% of all jobs could be lost.
Working With Robots
Deloitte, which releases an annual human capital trends report, has coined the phrase “superteams” to describe groups of people and intelligent machines working together. Only 12% of leaders in Deloitte’s 2020 report said they planned on using AI to replace workers; 60% said they were using AI to assist workers.
LaGrandeur notes that some economists believe that only about 10% of jobs will be lost. “That’s because only certain tasks within jobs are being automated, which will leave those workers to fill their time with less automatable work.” As an example, he points to accountants who don’t have to spend so much time crunching numbers on tax returns, so they can instead use that time to actually counsel their clients.
“Another example is an innovation called the Roboglove, made by NASA and GM, to help reduce repetitive stress injuries on the automotive factory floor,” LaGrandeur says. “It gives an added 10 pounds of bionic force for holding tools, using sensors, simulated nerves, muscles, tendons, and is in prototype.”
However, LaGrandeur predicts that – as with previous industrial revolutions – there will be significant job losses in the transitional period, which should last about 20 years. “Thereafter, the new technology will create more jobs than it destroys, including new ones having to do with their care and creation, as well as jobs designed to be done by a team of robots – called ‘cobots’ and humans together.”
But how soon this will occur is still a matter of debate. Ferguson believes that many industry leaders (at least in the near future) envision workplaces where robots support, rather than uproot the human workforce. (Read also: 6 (Scary) Things AI Is Getting Better At Doing.)
“Robots are supporting doctors’ ability to focus more on patient care instead of retrieving and filing information.” And since factory robots are still relatively expensive and large, he believes automation will only gain widespread popularity on a specific criterion. “Only when — or if — the economics justify the purchase for the role that must be filled – for example, the task of building one thing, one way, forever.”
But Ferguson sees the current trend of personalization and customization as perhaps preventing robots from ever taking over completely. “Adjusting robots for new process flows is challenging, and downtime impacts factory output and effectiveness,” he says. “We are starting to see a new class of smaller, more cost-effective robots that, unlike traditional robots that are sequestered from humans, will work hand in hand with the human workforce.”
In November, 2020, Walmart announced that it was ending its robot inventory project, which used shelf-scanning robots to track inventory in the store’s aisles. Although Walmart previously said that automating inventory would reduce labor costs and provide more accurate inventory results, the company reversed its decision, opting to let employees handle this task. Score one for the humans.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the company's artificial-intelligence bots may one day be able to work on Mars, a vision seemingly ripped from the pages of sci-fi novels.Musk on Thursday announced that the company was working on a Tesla Bot with a human form that would co-opt some of the AI the company has developed for its electric vehicles. One of Musk's other companies, SpaceX, has been focused on returning humans to the Moon, then heading to Mars.

The tweet that Musk was replying to also said his bot project mirrored the efforts of a fictional scientist from Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" books, a series that began publication in the 1950s. In those stories, humanoid robots work alongside humans.A Twitter user on Friday compared Musk with Lawrence Robertson, a character who cofounded U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, the fictional company that built humanoid robots. In ""I, Robot,"" Robertson said: ""The idea was to accustom people to working with one humanoid robot; and, once they realized the enormous potential, they would clamor for more.""On Thursday, Musk said: ""It has profound applications for the economy"" and ""in the future, physical work will be a choice.""

Tesla said the Bot would have cameras for eyes, and would use its self-driving software to navigate its surroundings.

Musk in announcing the Tesla robots on Thursday seemed to acknowledge concerns that the robots would turn violent, saying most people would be able to ""overpower"" the 125-pound bots. ""We're setting it such that it is at a mechanical level, at a physical level, you can run away from it and most likely overpower it,"" he said.

The public's fear of AI robots turning violent was natural, Asimov wrote in ""I, Robot."" One of his characters called the concern the ""The Frankenstein Complex.""""Far too many Hollywood movies portrayed them as unstoppable weapons that, invariably, turned upon their creators,"" Asimov wrote in the novel. ""Others panicked over the idea that robots might replace humans in usefulness, for jobs, perhaps even for procreation.""

As we continue to see growth in people launching their own businesses ranging from online courses through to coaching there is also a second wave of business evolving offering these entrepreneurs the infrastructure to do this whilst staying relatively lean. An area that has seen growth in recent years is lead generation. Whilst areas of digital marketing such as PPC (Pay-Per-Click) ads have continuously grown we’re now seeing traditional forms of marketing such as cold calling being done online more efficiently. One entrepreneur who has set up a business in order to help people generate leads and win business without spending hundreds of hours sending cold messages is Frank Fourie, founder of Millionaire Education Academy.


Early Beginnings 

Fourie, 24, was born in South Africa, and growing up he had a desire to be an accountant which took him on a trip to Hong Kong for work experience which was where he had his first interactions with business. This was also a period of his life when he first came across the concept of coaching and he signed up for his first coaching session. Interested in fitness at the time having built up a reasonable social media following where people would ask him for advice he decided to set up his own training programs as an online business. It was a relatively slow start but over time Fourie started to get clients. However, something he quickly realized was that his talent was in finding and winning clients, not just developing programs for them and training them. At this point, he decided to set up a business that would teach people how to get clients for their coaching business.

Scaling Up With Artificial Intelligence 

In building out his business, the first niche he naturally decided to focus on was fitness, effectively teaching fitness entrepreneurs how to set up their online offering and generate leads. At the start, much of the work was manual with Fourie teaching them and helping them generate leads for a $1k fee. He realized that a properly structured outbound strategy through platforms such as Linkedin and Facebook could yield great results and isn’t where many companies were looking. Over time as he structured his processes and included things such as videos he was able to increase his price per client as well as transfer this knowledge outside of the fitness industry into other verticals and offer a more bespoke service for larger clients who could afford it where his team would handle all of their outreach. 
PROMOTED
Today the business employs 9 people and is very much focused on building systems utilizing technology such as artificial intelligence to automate and optimize many of the processes they have carried out and collected data on, continuously iterating so they can scale up and serve their clients efficiently. As more people become entrepreneurs and have to win their own clients, companies like Fourie’s will be an important part of the ecosystem to ensure entrepreneurs can find clients efficiently so they can focus on delivering their core skill set without having to build a large team which would be a significant expense.

With the use of broad data collection, medical professionals can provide better care for their patients and eliminate health disparities. However, as health analytics advances to improve outcomes for patients, there are also opportunities for potential health inequities.







To ensure all patients are receiving equal and quality care, analytic health technology should engage in broad data collection practices. By focusing efforts on diverse data collection, these tools can improve precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to eliminate health disparities.

Data Collection for Precision Medicine
The success of precision medicine relies on large databases containing information regarding genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Clinicians can use precision medicine to determine treatment options that work best for a patient depending on that patient’s unique personal characteristics.
Not only does precision medicine require large databases, but the databases should also contain data from diverse populations to eliminate health disparities. Racial disparities in chronic diseases are well documented in the medical field.
According to an article from Nature, “Black people in the United States are around twice as likely to die of prostate or stomach cancer as their white counterparts. Black and Hispanic people are diagnosed younger and with more aggressive types of breast cancer than white people. Across most cancer types, death rates are higher for Black people than they are for other groups.”  
To meet the needs of diverse populations and engage in precision medicine practices, databases should contain data that is representative of various groups of individuals, rather than predominantly one or two. One way to diversify data is to take part in data-sharing efforts.
By making more data available to multiple organizations, researchers can improve precision medicine practices and provide better care for all.


Improved Use of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence capabilities have become increasingly common in the healthcare field. AI can lighten the load of physicians and provide better care for patients. To ensure the best quality care for individuals, researchers need to gather large quantities of data that equally represents diverse populations.
While collecting sizable amounts of data will better serve diverse populations, using substantial data quantities creates more work for physicians. However, AI techniques such as deep learning allow for artificial intelligence to comb through large amounts of data and analyze the information. Physicians can then use that information to evaluate conditions and guide treatment options.
Additionally, it’s important for researchers to correctly train AI algorithms to ensure the data collection process is addressing health disparities rather than creating more. To eliminate potential algorithm bias, the Center of Applied AI at Chicago Booth’s playbook outlines four steps providers should pursue.
Developers should assess the algorithm, understand the target, update or eliminate the algorithm if it is not efficient anymore, and continue to monitor and conduct audits on the algorithm.
By collecting broad data for artificial intelligence technology, providers can use techniques to help lessen health disparities.


Big Data Enhances Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics has proven to be a useful tool among researchers and healthcare providers. By analyzing historic data and trends, medical professions can better examine the patient’s condition and determine treatment options.
Additionally, predictive analytics can play an important role in the medical decision-making process. University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center researchers are creating a blood test that can predict whether certain treatment methods for HPV-positive throat cancer are working months before standard imaging scans.
""Currently, the only way doctors know if a treatment is working is for the patient to get an imaging scan every few months to see whether their tumors are shrinking,"" oncologist Paul Swiecicki, MD said in a press release.
""And this isn't fully accurate since some cancers show what we call pseudoprogression, where a successful treatment makes the tumors bigger before it shrinks them. Our goal was to develop a test that could tell us whether a treatment is likely to work after a single cycle,"" Swiecicki said.
Using predictive analytics allows for providers to assess whether a treatment option will work by examining historic data or determine if a certain treatment method is working based on early signs of indication.
For predictive analytics to work effectively, researchers need to collect broad data from diverse sources. If a study collects data from populations that are proximately White, that data isn’t going to reflect the unique challenges that people of color face in the healthcare community.
Additionally, data collection should not only consist of demographic data but also socioeconomic and environmental factors and social determinants of health to eliminate health disparities. 
In a study using machine learning, researchers used predictive analytics to determine the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and make treatment decisions. To get a complete understanding of someone's risk factors for chronic disease, the researchers argued that providers should be looking at patients’ full health profiles, including socioeconomic and environmental factors.
By incorporating social determinants of health into predictive analytic machine learning models, providers can develop practices to better manage chronic conditions and recommend treatment options that consider a patient’s socioeconomic and environmental factors.
Through broad data collection, researchers can develop and enhance precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to provide a better quality to patient care and eliminate health disparities.
