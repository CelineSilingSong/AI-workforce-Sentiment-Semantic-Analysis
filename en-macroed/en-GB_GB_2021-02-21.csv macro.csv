U.S. Holds Slim Edge over China in Artificial Intelligence, Former Google Chairman Says

The chairman of a special commission on artificial intelligence warned Congress the United States is only one to two years ahead of China in developing artificial intelligence, as Beijing remains “relentlessly focused” on achieving dominance across the broad spectrum of high technologies.
Testifying Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Eric Schmidt, former chairman of Google, said the United States needs to maintain a five to 10-year advantage over its “pacing competitor” in AI and other high technology fields like quantum computing.
In discussing the commission’s report, due out March 1, he said he was “worried we don’t understand the competitive threat from China” that encompasses semiconductor manufacturing, directed energy, 5G technologies and synthetic biology, as well as AI, machine-learning and hypersonics.
“DoD treats software as a low priority,” Schmidt told the committee, arguing it actually needs to top the priorities list. “We need to build missiles like cars,” quickly and efficiently from design to deployment, not take years in the cumbersome 70-year-old Pentagon acquisition process, he said.
“You’re wasting money” by following buying regulations that have a two-year lag time before money is appropriated to begin “a program of record,” one that is included in the budget submission, Schmidt said. He noted the department then doesn’t have the flexibility to constantly change software and improves as time passes and the program reaches production.
Using the F-35 program as an example of what can go wrong in having different services and allies following traditional practices for a project, retired Air Force Gen. Herbert Carlisle, chief executive officer of the National Defense Industrial Association, said that “sensors probably need to change every three to four years” and “you should be able change software” as frequently as you would add fuel and change lubricants.
It’s not easy to do under existing law, and the panelists agreed the Pentagon has been reluctant to use “special authorities” granted by Congress to avoid bottlenecks.
Yet the process has “so many levels you have to go through” to reach production and deployment that almost anyone in that chain “can stop it,” Carlisle said.

Schmidt said the idea is “to make sure the next technology success is not just for … commercial activity but national security” in the future.
He said the value of AI can be seen in something as routine as applying it to minesweeping in the Navy where “most of the time is spent watching” and not always catching the mines. “AI and machine learning is particularly good” at watching, Schmidt said, adding the technologies “can do this much, much better” than a sailor.
As to where China is in AI, Schmidt mentioned its extensive use in facial recognition and aggregation of health data, raising privacy concerns in the West, and also in speeding up electronic commerce.
Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, said he viewed the future with “confidence and concern.” Among his greatest concerns are the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the commercial and non-Defense Department digital infrastructure.
He specifically cited the collapse of the electric grid in Texas and the failure of water systems to function in the wake of severe winter weather. Smith noted this was not an enemy’s cyber attack “simply sending code” or planting malware aimed at disruption, but the grid collapse had the same impact.
Smith said the oldest software and hardware tend to be in the governmental sector, making it extremely vulnerable to collapse or disruption. He pointed to the Solar Winds malware placement in thousands of private and governmental networks, which he said highlights “the need to strengthen the software supply chain.” The malware entered the networks as routine patches to fix other problems and update systems.
By strengthening, he meant reporting the intrusion to a specific entity that would then alert others in the private sector and government.
Looking at the vulnerability of critical components in high-tech, Schmidt and Smith said the United States is now heavily reliant on Taiwan for semi-conductors, as is mainland China. While South Korea and Thailand – both allies – and Vietnam have stepped up semi-conductor production, the United States needs to begin “re-shoring” this industry. This was an industry the United States dominated until 20 years ago.
“America needs to stay two generation steps ahead of China” in this cornerstone manufacturing sector, Schmidt added.
He noted the United States ceded leadership in 5G telecommunications to the Chinese over the years and that has had a major impact on security arrangements for financial and governmental data globally. Huawei, a Chinese company, is selling this service from Asia to Africa and into Europe, and is regarded as the world leader in 5G deployment.
Schmidt said the AI commission report will call for establishing 10 high-tech priorities for the United States and its closest allies to invest in. He added that research and development spending in the United States as a percentage of the gross domestic product is below the levels Washington spent before the Soviets successfully launched its Sputnik satellite.
The advantages the United States has in this competition, particularly with China, comes in its innovative private sector and strong university system. Smith called for more investment in the American education system from kindergarten up to prepare students for lifelong learning in digital technologies.
Schmidt and Smith recommended overhauling the immigration system so that students from abroad who want to stay in the United States to work in the tech sector have certainty about their status and their families.
As for the distance that some workers in the tech sector want to keep from Pentagon projects, Smith said many of them “are not aware of the deep ethical tradition of the American military” and how it synchs with their own ethics.
“The American public is further and further away from the military” since the draft ended in the 1970s, Carlisle said. “It’s not that they don’t like the military, they just don’t know.”
The panelists agreed on the need to work with allies on rules of the road for high-tech that emphasize democratic values and concerns like privacy. They wanted clarity on any red lines they should not cross in its use.
Schmidt said he was troubled by United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement several days ago that he “is fervently sinophile” when it comes to trade and economic agreements that open the door to greater reliance on China.

Melding Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms with Health Care and Policy to Combat Human Trafficking

                              The Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab conducts critical research through a collaboration among academics, health-care providers and frontline trafficking experts and prosecutors, using promising innovations in modern data science.

A map of Brazil highlighting overlapping areas of deforestation and cases of human trafficking survivors' home municipalities. This is the type of preliminary data mapping that will support the Human Trafficking Data Lab's work examining the linkage between labor exploitation and illegal deforestation. 








An interdisciplinary team of Stanford researchers — from economists to statisticians to pediatricians — is collaborating to fight the global scourge of human trafficking.
It’s a titanic task.
On any given day, some 40 million people are trafficked into modern slavery, which includes labor trafficking, sex trafficking and forced marriage.
Forty million people — that’s a few million more than all the people in Canada.
The United Nations and myriad government agencies, NGOs and nonprofit foundations have worked tirelessly for decades to curb the practice of forced labor. They have had many successes — but they have not had the desperately needed large-scale microdata to fully understand trafficking markets and change the underlying structures that allow people to benefit from this criminal practice.
“Globally, policymakers are eager to find solutions to reduce trafficking, but efforts are impeded by the lack of data and almost complete lack of quantitative evidence on the causes of trafficking and the effectiveness of interventions,” said Grant Miller, a professor of medicine at Stanford Health Policy. “As a result, global anti-trafficking policy has not been guided by data-informed decisions.”
The Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab intends to conduct critical research through a collaboration among academics, health-care providers and frontline trafficking experts and prosecutors, using promising innovations in modern data science. These include machine learning from artificial intelligence, statistics, and building algorithms that try to determine the corporate structures of those who are profiting from the exploitation of human beings.

The team is creating an open-source data repository that will serve as a global model for innovation in anti-trafficking research. They’re also developing novel research methods and engaging with policymakers and frontline actors to identify the most effective solutions to adapt on a global scale.
“One of the most ambitious tools from the machine learning world, for example, is the creation of what will be a decision-support tool that the labor sector and prosecutors can use,” said Miller, a principal investigator of the Lab. “They’re trying to use their judgment to detect and catch traffickers, and we think that we could potentially develop machine-learning algorithms with all of this data to improve their work.”
Miller is a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The lab he co-founded together with other Stanford scholars was just granted a $900,000 award from the Stanford King Center on Global Development and also has funding from the U.S. State Department, via the African Programming and Research Initiative to End Slavery at University of Georgia.
“This is a huge and highly ambitious project,” Miller said. “It’s an intensive project to build the technology and then try it out in the real world to see how it works and improve on it in ways that policymakers would want to use.”









      Trafficking is one of the most pernicious human rights and global health problems, not only that of sex trafficking, but the problem of forced labor in general — which is rampant and widespread.

Mixing Data and Social Sciences
Pediatrician Vicki Ward, a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Children’s Hospital who focuses on pediatric global health, is providing her deep experience on risk analysis for forced labor in supply chains and is working on the development of effective interventions. She also chairs the Board of Directors of the anti-trafficking NGO Made in a Free World and has worked extensively on human trafficking.
“Trafficking is one of the most pernicious human rights and global health problems, not only that of sex trafficking, but the problem of forced labor in general — which is rampant and widespread,” said Ward. “Given the profound nature of the health impacts for victims, we need better solutions not only to intervene, but to prevent it from happening in the first place.”
Kimberly Babiarz, a social science research scholar at Stanford Health Policy who is an expert on large-scale impact evaluation, econometrics and machine-learning analysis, is serving at the senior analyst on several of the research initiatives. One of those is examining Brazil’s cash-transfer program, which ties government welfare programs and cash support to conditions that must be met if beneficiaries want to remain on the receiving end.
She notes that a commonly held view among policymakers is that poverty is a leading risk factor for human trafficking, but there has never been a quantitative assessment of this relationship to cash transfers.
“Brazil has the world’s largest cash-transfer program with over 27 million households, and we’re looking at the risk of trafficking and child labor in beneficiary households,” Babiarz said.
Brazil Sets Example
Luis Fabiano de Assis, a data scientist and visiting scholar at the Center for Human Rights and International Justice at Stanford, is another key member of the team. He is a prosecutor at the Federal Labor Prosecution Office in his native Brazil, a trafficking hub in Latin America owing to its sizable economy. The country has strong open data policies and a government commitment to fighting human trafficking — so Brazil was a natural choice for the initial focus of the research.
“And there is a demonstrated demand among Brazil’s government agencies for data and evidence that would help curb trafficking,” De Assis said.

De Assis, a world-renowned expert on applying data to human rights, emphasized the human faces of the victims of the global phenomenon should not be forgotten. They suffer lifelong mental and physical health disabilities even after exiting a situation of trafficking: trauma, depression, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, cognitive impairment and memory loss.
“As a frontline agent and Brazilian prosecutor who works with the rescued, we take them straight to health institutions because they’re usually destroyed, mentally and physically, and face a lot of disease,” De Assis said. “We were astonished that the ones who die, die really young of diseases that the general population doesn’t die from.”
Respiratory diseases and lung cancer rates among victims of trafficking are much higher than in the general population in Brazil, he said.
These are not only issues of public health, but of human rights.
Jessie Brunner, the director of human trafficking research at the Center for Human Rights and International Justice, is the point person for connecting the lab with outside partners and keeping them on track with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals related to human trafficking and forced labor.
“My role is to think about how we can connect our work to local, national and international anti-trafficking efforts — and keeping tabs on what funders are doing, while looking for key partners because we’re hoping to grow geographically,” Brunner said.
Intuition Engine
Stanford Medicine statistician and assistant professor of epidemiology Mike Baiocchi is working on a decision-support tool for the lab, which they call the “intuition engine.” The architecture is based on a data processing pipeline that transforms a constant flow of incoming trafficking clues from a variety of sources — and then comes up with predictions of trafficking risks.
“We’re trying to make give prosecutors the kinds of information they need so they can tackle these complicated cases,” said Baiocchi.
“One of the aspects that’s important to this team is that we’re listening and learning from how the prosecutors do their jobs, and we’re enabling machines to figure out a way to comb these huge data sets and automate and prepare insights for the prosecutors, to help prosecutors get into the field faster,” said Baiocchi.
Specifically, he’s using machine learning — getting computers to learn on their own by feeding them data —to have them chew through data in the background, so it’s largely digested by the time prosecutors need it.
“Workers who have been on the front lines develop routines and processes they find helpful, and machine learning is getting sophisticated enough that a lot of complex processes can be automated, Baiocchi said.
For example, Ying Jin, a PhD student who has been working with Baiocchi, been using cluster detecting algorithms to process the data. He said the idea came to them from a conversation they had with a prosecutor who told them that when they find one trafficker they could usually pull a thread and unravel a bunch of others.
“So our team has started to automate this ‘pulling the thread’ process,” Baiocchi said. “Machines are so powerful because they work nonstop, they don’t get bored, and they are scalable. We can have these machine learning algorithms running in the background, getting the data in a usable format so when a prosecutor gets a tip, they can go to the `intuition engine’ and plug it in and find out how concerned they should be.”

New Study of Gun Violence in Schools Identifies Long-Term Harms

      The most comprehensive study of American children who experience gun violence at school finds they are less likely to graduate from high school or enroll in college — and less likely to hold a job as a young adult. Co-authored by SHP's Maya Rossin-Slater, the researchers estimate a loss in lifetime income of $115,550 per shooting-exposed student.

In 2017, I returned to Canada from Sweden, where I had spent a year working on automation in mining. Shortly after my return, the New York Times published a piece called, “The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine,” about Sweden’s embrace of automation while limiting human costs.
Although Swedes are apparently optimistic about their future alongside robots, other countries aren’t as hopeful. One widely cited study estimates that 47 per cent of jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.
Whether we like it or not, the robot era is already upon us.  The question is: Is the Canadian economy poised to flourish or flounder in a world where robots take over the tasks we don’t want to do ourselves?  The answer may surprise you.
Robots are everywhere
Modern-day robots are how artificial intelligence (AI) physically interacts with us, and the world around us.  Although some robots resemble humans, most do not and are instead specifically designed to autonomously carry out complex tasks.
Over the last few decades, robots have rapidly grown from specialized devices developed for select industry applications to household items. You can buy a robot to vacuum your floors, cut your grass and keep your home secure. Kids play with educational robots at school, where they learn to code, and compete in robot design teams that culminate in exciting international competitions.
Robots are also appearing in our hospitals, promising to help us fight the COVID-19 pandemic and performing other health-care tasks in safer and more efficient ways.

The media is abuzz with stories about the latest technical claims, rumours and speculations about the secret developments of major international corporations, including Waymo, Tesla, Apple, Volvo and GM.
And NASA just landed the Perseverance rover on Mars, with an autonomous helicopter called Ingenuity attached to its belly.
Oh, and there are the dancing robots too, of course.
Robots behind the scenes
I have been working on robotics and autonomous vehicles technology in mining since the late 1990s. As such, I have been part of an industry that is undergoing a sea change, with fully autonomous machines steadily replacing workers in dark, dirty and dangerous scenarios.

This robot revolution is happening behind the scenes in other industries too.  Robots fill Amazon orders, manufacture stuff in factories, plant and pick crops, assist on construction sites, and the list goes on. 
In fact, robots even build other robots. Will we soon run out of jobs for people?
Robots in Canada
There are many who paint a bleak picture of the future, where robots and AI take away all the “good jobs.” Although I fully acknowledge that we must be mindful of possible inequalities and unintended outcomes that might arise as a result of new technologies, I contend that Canadians have the potential to thrive.
But to make it happen, my colleagues and I agree that our country needs a “robotics strategy.” 
In 2017, Canada launched the world’s first national AI strategy. Called the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and costing $125 million, the strategy aims to strengthen Canada’s leadership in AI by funding institutes, universities and hospitals to meet key objectives.
In its 2020 list of future jobs, the World Economic Forum listed “robotics engineers” as No. 10, in close company with “AI and machine learning specialists.” In Canada, I see huge potential for our robotics industry, with companies such as Clearpath Robotics, OTTO Motors, Kinova, Robotiq and Titan Medical already world leaders in the design and manufacture of robots for purposes ranging from materials handling to surgery.
Beyond building robots, Canada’s most significant opportunities may lie in the increased adoption of robots into economically important industry sectors, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.
And yet, Canada may be the only G7 country without a robotics strategy.
The robot revelation
As it turns out, there is hope. According to a November 2020 report from Statistics Canada, Canadian firms that employed robots have also hired more human workers, contrary to what you may instinctively believe. In fact, they hired 15 per cent more workers!
However, this does not mean that we can all sit back and relax. Along with the increased economic activity that robots bring to businesses comes a shift in the workforce from “workers spending less time performing routine, manual tasks, in favour of non-routine, cognitive tasks.”

The roles of education and research and development — such as new programs to train the next generation of robot-savvy Canadians and collaborative research clusters — are paramount. And they need to be combined with a national robotics strategy and a progressive socio-economic system that supports a transitioning workforce to ensure the success, well-being and happiness of Canadians, alongside our robot friends.
