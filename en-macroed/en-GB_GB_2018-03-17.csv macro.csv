Organizations that put AI to work in this way will lead their industries. However, making AI work in new and wondrous ways requires a powerful sense of imagination.  In their latest book, Human + Machine, Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson say that as humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling employees and companies make changes on the fly -- or even to completely re-imagine them.
Daugherty and Wilson explored the practices and approaches of 1,500 organizations, and found achieving success with AI is as much an exercise in imagination as it is in technical prowess. 
PROMOTED
Imagine new and bold processes. ""When trying to re-imagine a process, it's natural for people to become stuck on the old ways of doing things, making it difficult to envision things that might be,"" the authors state. ""To avoid that, they should always keep in mind the differences between traditional business processes versus the new, AI approach. Our research shows that outcomes are no longer linear but exponential. Change is no longer episodic and human-led; it's self-adaptive, based on real-time input from humans as well as machines. Roles are not just limited to human-only and machine-only positions; they must also include collaborative work in the missing middle.""
Imagine and experiment. ""In science, an experiment that doesn't support the hypothesis isn't called a failure. It's called data,"" Daugherty and Wilson point out. This is the mindset that should be applied to designing new business processes.""The age of the standard business process is over; companies can no longer aim to replicate the best-in-class process of an industry leader,"" they state. ""That's why experimentation is key. The catch, though, is that tailor-made processes require managers and leaders be more aware of their workforce and culture at large so they know how and when to implement experiments.""
Imagine a blended culture of people and machines: Trust is the key in a blended culture, the authors state. ""How do you foster a culture of trust that extends even to robo-colleagues? One way is to test with AI and train with it. To engender a trust in AI systems, leaders to allow for those who work with systems to develop stakes in the outcome and to have a sense of urgency over the inner workings of the system. Ideally, AI systems should generally be designed to offer explanations of their decisions and to help people maintain some decision-making autonomy. Developing processes that are fundamentally trust-based takes time and experimentation, but case studies show that if all parties are trusted -- humans, machines, and humans and machines working together -- then outcomes can improve for everyone.""

Technological innovations have impacted almost every aspect of life over the past century. The steam engine and electricity allowed total labor productivity to grow at more than 2 percent per year and the total number of weekly work hours to drop from 60 to 40.
The concept of artificial intelligence is not new but has recently come into view as a technology that is capable of revolutionizing the world and bringing a new industrial revolution. A significant amount of research and discussion among scientists and economists has focused on the critical topic of disruption to labor markets and potential productivity gains from AI.











 
 
 
However, there is a more nuanced picture of the way in which AI will reshape how we work – in many cases augmenting our abilities and supporting organizations to redefine their operating models for improved performance and agility. The role of human resource and talent leaders in pairing humans and machines to this end will be critical to success in the future.

4 steps for HR to support enterprise agility and value from AI
A global study conducted by Accenture Strategy found that 64 percent of executives plan to use AI to automate tasks to a considerable extent in the next three years and 97 percent intend to use AI to enhance worker capabilities. Naturally, human resources is no exception. In a survey done by ServiceNow on 350 HR leaders, 92 percent agree that the future of providing an enhanced level of employee service will include chatbots, and they are already bringing this vision to life by leveraging chatbots for recruiting, employee services, development, and coaching. Moreover, things will not stop there – AI will be infused organically into many of the standard tools and activities employees do every day. The traditional world of work, where people are assigned to jobs that contain tasks, is being inherently disrupted. AI can play a tremendous role in augmenting the capabilities of people and organizations to reinvent work and increase agility.
There are four key areas where human resources leaders will need to focus to get the most value from AI in the future:











 
 
 
1. Look inward
HR organizations need to first focus on internal training to help team members be conversant about the possibilities that AI technologies can bring to talent transformation. Additionally, HR needs to disrupt itself by focusing on the options to leverage AI for its processes – including how to automate and augment more transactional and compliance activities. The right people and skills focused on the HR operating model will set the stage for HR to have expertise in the process and free up team members to focus on the more strategic dimensions of implementing transformational AI capabilities. By transforming the HR business model to focus primarily on roles that humans will play in the organization, employees will become the key value drivers behind organizational success. In fact, 75 percent of business leaders acknowledge that a digitally enabled operating model must be customer centered, in this case, meaning HR personnel.
2. Reimagine the talent lifecycle
Machine learning and AI capabilities can and are reshaping recruiting, learning, performance management, and every other dimension of the l employee experience. Companies are using technologies for a variety of HR tactics, including the minimization of bias in writing position descriptions as well as the development of predictive analytic web-based video interviewing. Beyond talent acquisition, AI can play a role in improving the talent lifecycle in many ways. For example, identifying people with expertise on specific topics within an organization or supporting continuous performance management processes.
3. Help business teams rethink the nature of work
Inertia is typical in organizations, and AI is going to be no exception. Additionally, it is likely that leaders will look at AI as “just another technology” to implement. However, organizations that invest in changing the way that people work and interact with this capability stand to achieve outpaced value creation. This includes breaking down typical end-to-end roles into more segmented groups of activities and then targeting those to the appropriate source of labor – be it human or machine. Alongside this, people need to be skilled in how to use AI to support their work. Emerging tools that relieve people of everyday tasks such as scheduling appointments and booking travel (while still evolving) will benefit from HR’s involvement in adapting organization structure, performance assessment, and job/skill architectures. In practice, this may mean restructuring the HR business model to effectively identify the best opportunities for AI augmentation as well as streamline the interface points of humans and machines. This ties hand in hand with 81% of executives who expect to manage multiple operating models in parallel in the future.











 
 
 
4. Support enterprise reskilling
A rapid deployment of “new skilling” is an essential role of AI to help organizations seize value from AI. While three-quarters of companies are investing in AI, only 26 percent of executives believe their current workforce is ready for AI adoption, and a mere three percent of leaders say they plan to increase investment in training programs for AI. HR should lead the charge in changing this dynamic as well as the approach to re-skilling. Traditionally, learning and development is periodic with scheduled training programs. Through the use of AI, learning and development should reflect the agile model leaders would like to see throughout the rest of their organization: learning and development should be constant and re-skilling rapidly.
Getting started
CHROs and talent leaders have a significant opportunity to help build a future workforce in which humans and intelligent machines work together to improve productivity, innovation and growth. Here’s what they can do to get started:
Create partnerships and experiment
Don’t think that implementing AI right is something to do alone. It takes a broad ecosystem of capabilities and relationships to figure out where to invest and where to get the capabilities. Developing a more comprehensive strategy is essential, but just as critical is building trusted alliances across the enterprise and being willing to test and experiment with concepts to see how they work. This necessary collaboration will bring organizations out of siloes into a truly unified workforce, amplifying the organization’s ability to respond quickly to change. As an example, if new hire onboarding is a challenge for hiring managers, exploring ways to automate or augment the experience with AI can demonstrate how HR can leverage advanced technology to make principal activities easier and more efficient.











 
 
 
Design with the employee in mind
A fundamental activity for “getting it right” with AI will be redesigning the paradigm of employees’ relationships with the business and the nature of work in the future. A new design will determine the priorities for HR in where to invest in changing the talent processes or other nature of work as well as how to shape future learning initiatives. Syncing this new paradigm with business priorities will then enable a holistic approach to AI developed on an intrinsically motivated foundation, a key component of maintaining an agile HR organization. For instance, if organizational agility is a priority, HR can support talent investments and AI tools that assist people to move quickly and freely between projects and automate many processes that may create barriers to workforce agility today.
Prototype, evaluate and scale
A perfect approach or framework does not exist for leveraging AI to drive talent outcomes and organization agility. Leaders will need to be focused and courageous in their approach to prototyping AI solutions where it makes sense. If these new capabilities are put together in an employee-centric model, there is tremendous potential for HR to transform the way that people work and the way that organizations adapt to the future. Not every activity will flourish, but a thoughtful model can setup quick wins that can become more substantial capabilities over time.
Ready or not, AI is already making its way into our organizations and changing the nature of work. Savvy HR and business leaders need to develop a digitally-enabled culture focused on human-machine collaboration. This strategy will help enable HR to be a partner in creating value from the talent transformation by changing the way it works and how it invests to help employees get the most from their work.

Scenarios describing the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) seem to gravitate toward hyperbole. In wonderful scenarios, AI enables nirvanas of instant optimal processes and prescient humanoids. In doomsday scenarios, algorithms go rogue and humans are superfluous, at best, and, at worst, subservient to the new silicon masters.  
However, both of these scenarios require a sophistication that, at least right now, seems far away. Our recent research indicates that most organizations are still in the early stages of AI implementation and nowhere near either of these outcomes.  
A more imminent reality is that AI is agnostic and can benefit both good and bad processes. As such, a less dramatic but perhaps more insidious risk than the doomsday scenario is that AI gives new life to clunky or otherwise poorly conceived processes.
Consider faxes in the health care industry. Despite being obsolete in most places, “like the floppy disk or the CD player,” faxes are still a fundamental part of the medical infrastructure. Because of the long history and strong network effects, the medical industry still sends a staggering number of faxes every day.  
Invented in the 1840s, well before the telephone, faxes illustrate how difficult it is to change an entrenched process.
Despite widespread use, sending faxes is, for the most part, a horrific way to transfer information. The process is typically (1) extracting and printing information from a computer system, (2) scanning it into an image, and (3) transmitting it somewhere else via fax. The burden rests squarely on the recipient to interpret a pixelated approximation of the original information. Structured digital information has become unstructured. With every fax, a data scientist gets their wings ripped off.
The conversion from structured information to unstructured and back is a waste. No one wins — a patient may be waiting for approval, medical staff may lack information, errors can creep in, etc. At a minimum, time and effort are needlessly spent.

Advances in AI and image processing are making significant progress in reducing this problem. Organizations can use AI to recognize images, automate the interpretation, and restructure the information. Certainly, this is a welcome improvement. No one gets competitive advantage or business value from wasted time spent restructuring information.
However, this improved image processing is a pyrrhic victory.

Spot on Sam !This is our thesis too at Skan . Automation is one of the end points of a larger transformation agenda. It needs to be preceded by discovery , optimization / re-engineering. Further just because we have been pointed in the automation direction of late let us not assume that that’s only way to transform. Infact automation forms only a small portion of the interventions that can be made in the work continuum. Again great article Sam !

We completely agree with the insights in this article.  Without uncovering process variants, untangling the process pretzels, unleashing legacy processes with AI will not be a fruitful endeavor.  We suggest starting with computer vision-enabled process discovery, and then after understanding the process nuances, any interventions - re-engineering, automation, transformation, et al. - will be a net positive.

I concur with this article, yet think it belittles the potential for hurriedly executed mechanization innovation to use little issues (e.g., squander, incapability) into huge, even vital, waste, botches and hazards. 

A significant number of the charitable Humaneering Technology Initiative's field trials for the rising biopsychosocial or ""humaneering"" connected science (now in v4.0 open beta) have concentrated on the revive or overhaul of human work in readiness for computerization. In light of what now appears to go for the ""plan"" of human work (e.g., some remnant rehearses and a speedy expected set of responsibilities) in associations, the operational and key effect and the ""specialized obligation"" of poor work configuration, once utilized with computerization, would far surpass any advantage that would have been picked up. Or maybe, upgrading the human work on account of the mechanization, and adopting a light-footed strategy to creating and actualizing the robotization innovation, appear to yield the best results, both operational and monetary.

I agree with this article, yet think it underestimates the potential for hastily implemented automation technology to leverage small problems (e.g., waste, ineffectiveness) into significant, even strategic, waste, blunders and risks. 

Many of the nonprofit Humaneering Technology Initiative's field trials for the emerging biopsychosocial or ""humaneering"" applied science (now in v4.0 open beta) have focused on the refresh or redesign of human work in preparation for automation. Based on what now seems to pass for the ""design"" of human work (e.g., some holdover practices and a quick job description) in organizations, the operational and strategic impact and the ""technical debt"" of poor work design, once leveraged with automation, would far exceed any benefit that would have been gained. Rather, redesigning the human work with the automation in mind, and taking an agile approach to developing and implementing the automation technology, seem to yield the best outcomes, both operational and financial.

I 100% agree with this article, but I have also come to think otherwise.  There's a pragmatic view here which you point to:  An automated bad process is still better than a manual bad process.   

Changing people and processes is hard, or at least usually harder than implimenting a bit of technology.  Technology can then act as an agent of change to change the harder parts.  
First step, then becomes to automate the process.  Then you are less constrained by human or legacy influence to improve, or even remove it.

Based on the serverless delivery model, Gradient removes the friction involved in launching and configuring GPU-backed VMs to train machine learning and deep learning models.









Artificial Intelligence
Source: Graphicstock






Data scientists and developers spend a lot of time configuring the right environment needed for creating machine learning experiments and models. Firstly, they need to launch a Linux virtual machine powered by a GPU. This step is followed by installing required NVIDIA tools such as graphic drivers, CUDA runtime, and cuDNN libraries. Once the VM is configured for the GPU, they spend a significant amount of time installing libraries and frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch, Microsoft CNTK and Apache MXNet. With multiple dependencies and fragmented toolkits, the installation and configuration process often turns cumbersome.
Paperspace is removing the barrier to ML experimentation and model generation through Gradient. Users will never have to spin up VMs or install any software to get started. They can gain access to a fully-configured environment that’s ready to run machine learning jobs.
PROMOTED
Gradient PaaS has three components – Notebooks, Jobs, and Storage. Notebooks expose a full-blown Jupyter environment for immediate access. Jobs can pretty much run any Docker container or a Python program on the GPU cluster. Storage exposes artifacts and datasets that can be persisted and shared across multiple projects.

A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that allows users to mix code or formulas with text and diagrams. With Gradient, developers can choose pre-configured Python notebook instances that come with mainstream frameworks including Fast.ai and TensorFlow. Each notebook instance may be backed by NVIDIA K80 or a P100 GPU. The best part of this service is the speed at which the notebook becomes available. In just a few seconds, developers gain access to a fully-configured Python notebook preloaded with the required runtime and frameworks.
Gradient Job Runner is designed for users who want to execute code (such as training a deep neural network) on a cluster of GPUs efficiently and without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. A Job can be a pre-baked Docker container image with code dependencies and packages pre-installed. Developers will also be able to run standard Python code as a Gradient Job. Once the job is done, users will be able to download the artifacts and logs from a secure location.

Gradient Storage exposes storage for workspace, artifacts, and persistence. Users can use persistence storage to access data from multiple jobs.
Paperspace has priced Gradient on the basis of creation, runtime and teardown of Jobs. The hourly cost of a Job depends on the GPU machine type, which is prorated down to the millisecond.
Apart from offering the PaaS, Paperspace also has traditional IaaS-style VMs that can be used for running parallel processes for ML training or game rendering.
When I first encountered Paperspace, it reminded me of DigitalOcean. Both the platforms emphasize simplicity and developer experience. With Gradient, Paperspace has taken the experience to the next level. I loved the workflow involved in creating a deep learning job without ever worrying about the VMs. All I had to focus on was the data and the model packaged in a Docker container.
AI as a Service is the next big thing for the public cloud. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM are working towards offering managed services and tools for ML developers. Startups like Paperspace can become alternatives to mainstream cloud platforms for developing and deploying niche ML workloads. Ultimately, it’s the developer community that benefits from this competition.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Janakiram MSVFollowingFollowJanakiram MSV is an analyst, advisor and an architect at Janakiram & Associates.

For entrepreneurs and companies big and small, AI is not the enemy at the gates we feared, but a strategic building block for professional relationships that can ultimately improve a company's professional network, finances, and operational structure.Here's how AI can improve working relationships with four different business cohorts:Employee relationshipsAlready, AI tools like facial recognition in video conferencing software have helped facilitate teamwork, allowing entrepreneurs to discuss and collaborate on projects more readily. However, it can also help them interact with and manage their employees.



In fact, AI can be an HR advocate in many ways. Machine learning allows businesses to analyze employee data analytics to help incorporate inclusive, representative policies in the workplace. Companies are even implementing AI tools to make their work environments safer and more comfortable places to work.For example, Botler.ai is a startup curbing workplace sexual harassment by utilizing natural language processing to scan online conversations for specific phrases or sentence structures, flagging for any inappropriate content. When implemented, these tools can help safeguard egalitarian structures, performance and personal development among all workers. According to the Harvard Business Review, that same natural processing language algorithm can also mine customer actions and social sentiment data to identify employees (and even customers) who are at a risk of leaving. Although there are privacy issues to be addressed with this operation, profitable data can optimize employee satisfaction and training.


Related: 5 Reasons Machine Learning Is the Future of MarketingEtch, an AI-enabled contact manager, helps foster business relationships by transforming professional networks into unified databases that can be searched and filtered through user-friendly interfaces. This system intelligently provides information about contacts including their biographies, skills, interests and achievements. A searchable interface can even construct timelines for past interactions users had with their contacts. With AI and big data insights, entrepreneurs can get to know their employees much better and even include them in important decisions or ask their opinion on sensitive data.In fact, researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) determined that AI automation can increase employee morale, reduce operational errors and improve employee productivity and transparency between workers and managers. A recent Deloitte University report also shows that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can benefit employee satisfaction and loyalty. With streamlined functions, businesses can truly foster creativity, productivity and well-being of their workers.Vendor relationshipsArtificial intelligence can also improve relationships between businesses and their vendors. Since many AI devices are programmed as personal assistants and communication tools, they can help provide shared insights, mentoring and strategic planning to create a shared understanding and trust between the two partnerships. Whether third party companies are hired for expertise or skilled labor, both teams need to understand clear internal marketing goals and analytics.


Related: Want to Be More Like Amazon? Start By Making Your Startup More Data-Driven.One way to foster smooth and productive relationships is to offer automation and predictive analytics to research, monitor, report and build media content that third-parties can utilize or edit according to their expertise. Regular check-ins and support are essential for nurturing these vendor-to-business relationships. A report from MIT Sloan Management Review mentions that companies like Airbus now use AI to combine data sets from past production projects, but that information is continuously updated from other interlinked projects that can improve the quality of products in development. These AI programs can use computer-assisted translation and self-learning algorithms to identify problems and positive patterns in assembly line production. Airbus's system can match up to 70 percent of factory disruptions to successful solutions that worked in the past -- in real time! This allows teams in different locations to learn quickly and meet production needs.As owners of data sets, hiring companies can provide select information to vendors while creating tangible results and trustworthy relationships. In addition, content like automated video editing can radically cut down on time and save money for both companies, building strong creative dynamics between outside business teams.Related: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business


Customer relationshipsFor businesses and entrepreneurs, one of the most vital relationships AI can foster is the one shared with their customers. Marketing customer relationiship management (CRM) systems can now build more personalized, data-centric centers that are driven by predictive models and customer concerns. Chatbots, especially, are personalizing customer service. Customers can now ask questions and expect high-quality answers. In fact, chatbots are the preferred contact methods for 44 percent of U.S. consumers, according to a Harvard Business Review survey.Machine learning is using customer service data, like customer reactions, actions and social sentiment data, to assess hidden insights even without being programmed. Learning from past customer experiences and interactions, machine algorithms can now create more relevant and personal experiences that directly address the needs of customers in convenient ways. One prime example of this is how Amazon and Netflix recommend suggestions based on your viewing history.Industry giants like Salesforce are motivating businesses to quickly establish AI infrastructures. The company's AI toolkit, Einstein, allows businesses to provide smart, personalized customer experiences through predictive analytics gained from their data and accumulated insights.For small businesses, personalized products are especially important but often take a backseat to larger businesses. Now, even small entrepreneurs can invest in user-friendly (and affordable) in-house machine learning technologies. Third-party tools and software, like Acquisio, help to optimize customer acquisition with their AI-based marketing tool specifically for small businesses.


Related: Artificial Intelligence Is Likely to Make a Career in Finance, Medicine or Law a Lot Less LucrativeInvestor relationshipsBuilding relationships with investors can be fairly difficult for businesses, especially for newer companies trying to prove their capability. But, AI is allowing investors to get a better sense of how new ventures and their current investments are performing. Startups like Alphasense and Kensho let investors analyze market information of emerging and wide-ranging market practices.Databases that implement machine learning algorithms and natural language processing models can browse online messages and social media posts to learn the latest trading sentiments for specific markets or determine a company's output value. This allows investors to analyze a prospective company's market or business model with confidence.As communication is key in any working relationship, investors need to evaluate the necessary background information on new startups. But, information on startups is often limited. Yet, McKinsey & Company reports that companies like Hone Capital are initiating AI metrics and computer vision models, allowing investors to research beforehand to become more acquainted and trusting of their potential acquisitions.


AI software can now identify key background information like current financing, the founder's background, previous funding rounds and intellectual property information. As investors use AI, they can work on strategic plans to enhance their businesses' revenue and operating systems. As a result, these predictive analytics can foster deeper and more nuanced relationships between investors and their companies.New customs for new connections It's time for entrepreneurs to get creative and high-tech with their communication skills. In the future, the factors that will differentiate successful leaders between their competitors is how they can interact, emotionally engage and respond to a wide network of industry players ranging from employees to investors.The interconnected, AI era is not one to hide from. Rather, it's one that can help empower businesses to accentuate their services and creative capabilities, so they can prosper in a more emotionally aware world. Professional relationships are the backbone of success -- even in the business world -- and soon our relationship with AI could advance all of us to another level of innovation.

Robots in the ranks: how human skills fit together with artificial intelligence

This week, public-sector discussions centre around artificial intelligence and how technology will shape the jobs of the future. Research suggests future jobs will require people skills more than high-level engineering and maths, as most will work with technology, rather than build it.
There are two popular views about the impact of technological change in the workplace and the skills mix that will be required by tomorrow’s workforce.
One well-known fear is that various kinds of automation, powered by artificial intelligence and other emergent technologies will put masses of people out of jobs.
The other is the assumption that technological change means skills in science, technology, engineering and maths — particularly an understanding of computer programming, which is now widely seen as a vital part of school curricula — will be in increasingly high demand.
But analysis of labour force data from Australia and the United States shows that the big growth is occurring in “people skills” rather than STEM. And that makes sense in some ways when combined with the first fear. Logically, the more that automation takes processes out of human hands, the more our uniquely human skills come to the fore.
While plenty of people will find work in certain burgeoning fields like cybersecurity or the data sciences, and in the technology industry developing cutting-edge applications of AI, it is likely that the bulk of the workforce will be using more and more technology, rather than actually building it.




Not all jobs will be swept away by technology, some will be complemented by it, and in many cases those workers who are displaced will be able to transition to other jobs, perhaps at higher rates of pay, with a relatively small amount of extra training or education.
Estimates of how this will affect the labour market in terms of unemployment vary considerably, but the machines haven’t taken over yet. We still have our free will, and some experts are concerned about what we do with it.


Claire Mason
“It is really important that we are not being passive about technology,” says Claire Mason, an expert on these issues from Data61, who worked on the aforementioned studies showing that the value of people skills, particularly around communication, is growing much more quickly than demand for traditional STEM skills.
Discourse analysis recently showed people commonly talk about technological disruption as “something that happens to us”,  she adds.
“But the alternative is a much more active stance towards technology — that technology is something that humans have always wielded to shape and improve our lives,” Mason told The Mandarin.
“And that is what I think we need as a mindset, not that we all need to become coders, but that we all need to stay engaged with how we can be using the latest improvements in digital technology to do what we currently do most efficiently, in a new way, to add value, to enhance a customer’s experience.
“That is the mindset that Australia needs in order to maintain our position rather than either fear about technology, or this very narrow view about us all needing to become software engineers.”
Mason is speaking on a panel at the Australian Information Industry Association’s conference in Canberra focused on these very issues, among a long list of federal public servants and parliamentarians, academics and ICT industry leaders.
She thinks there is too much alarming rhetoric around, encouraging people in jobs like teaching or community services to feel “threatened and resistant to the technology” — but “it’s that attitude that will hurt us, rather than the technology itself” in her view.
Some of the research into skills trends showed relatively low growth in demand for traditional STEM areas but there is significant growth in the need for what Mason calls “generic” STEM skills, like using computers.
“So yes, in so many of the jobs of the future, people need to be able to work with tech. They need to be able to make sense of the numbers that might come out of a machine or a program, but they don’t actually need to program [computers], most people,” she explained.
Teaching coding in schools is sometimes said to be important for the same reason writing is important, even though few students will become professional writers; it teaches a basic understanding of how programming works.
Mason says that being able to use technology to “add value, to be more productive” at work will be important, across the workforce, but we don’t need a world of programmers.
A lot of workers will be able to learn how to use new technology that augments existing jobs, and others will be able to transition into new jobs that are created, which will likely maximise the value of the human touch.
Robots on the case
The Department of Human Services has begun implementing systems built around forms of AI — including as a decision-support tool that is relatively easy for staff to use.

Chief information officer Charles McHardie spoke about this on Tuesday at a forum about AI in the public sector, organised by the Institute of Public Administration Australia (full video below). He told his fellow public servants about the department’s exploration of AI products like IBM’s Watson, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s TensorFlow, and its three digital assistants.
Sam answers questions over the phone, Oliver’s job is guide people through the Centrelink claims process, and Roxy helps customer service staff when they have a tricky question about a claim they would otherwise have to ask a superior.
McHardie spoke about the jobs related to rolling out virtual helpers like Roxy — he said they needed to be “corrected and directed” repeatedly, like a child — but the research suggests these technologist roles won’t dominate the workforce.
Three questions rounded off an entertaining and thought-provoking keynote by Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist and futurist who spent a long time in Silicon Valley and is now an Australian National University professor leading a new research institute that collaborates with Data61:
What metrics, beyond efficiency, will be necessary in the 21st Century workplace?
Where on the organisational chart will we put artificial intelligent technologies?
What does training/skill acquisition look like in a 21st Century learning environment?
The first concerns the possibility that standard ways to measure the value of technology might not be the best methods to judge the success or failure of AI-enabled tools.
“What are going to be the other metrics we might want here?” Bell asked. “If not efficiency, is it efficacy, because we’re talking about whole systems?
“Is it about engagement, because we’re changing the model of what that work might do? Is it also about other things that we are far less used to thinking about technology giving us, like the space to make things? Is it about creativity and, god forbid, that much-ballyhooed word, innovation?”

She said the continuing rise of AI was about more than the various technological strands that have come together, “… it’s also about ethics, and regulation, and reason. It’s about how do we think about the systems that will contain these systems.”
In Bell’s view, questions about security, transparency, trust, and “explicability” of automated systems have to be “part and parcel” of public policy and regulation as algorithms and AIs begin to play a larger role.
“This can’t just be about ‘it took us less time to make a decision’ — we might want to think about quality of decisions. There are all sorts of mechanisms we might want to involve here as we think about how we will want to use these things.”
The second question is just a humourous way of considering how AI fits into hierarchical organisations. Who can challenge or overturn automated advice or decisions? Will bots be equals, subordinates, bosses, or some of each?

Education and training up next for disruption
The third question calls out an issue that has occurred to Mason and her colleagues as well: standard education and training needs to change. Universities, Bell suggested, might be next to face digital disruption.
“There’s going to be a real pressure to deliver education somewhat more efficiently but also to allow people to dip in and dip out more, which is lifelong learning,” Mason told The Mandarin.
Another issue is that technological change is never evenly distributed, as Bell noted, repeating this oft-quoted observation of cyberpunk author William Gibson. In some places the future is already here, but in others, like Centrelink’s welfare payments platform, extremely old legacy technology is still in place.
This certainly affects the ICT skills DHS needs to employ; it has a need for software engineers that is hard to fill from the local market, but its massive seven-year project to replace the system might change that.
Theoretically, a huge chunk of current jobs could be automated, but there is reason to doubt how soon the potential will be realised, given old technology tends to linger, especially when it costs a lot to replace. And other jobs that make use of especially human skills will be created, Mason suggests.
The research into skills demand suggests workers won’t suddenly need to undertake “massive re-skilling” but rather small “tweaks” to their existing skillsets, she explains, through new “micro-credentials” for an increasingly digitised world.
Mason says ongoing data analysis could reveal useful details about the kinds of add-on skills people will need to keep pace with how their jobs evolve, or to switch over to new jobs that emerge, and Data61 has already begun helping the Department of Jobs and Small Business (formerly Employment) understand how it could do that.
Other speakers at the AIIA conference on the jobs of the future include the head of the ACT public service, Kathy Leigh, Attorney-General’s Department secretary Chris Moraitis, Digital Transformation agency boss Gavin Slater, Australian Public Service Commission first assistant commissioner Kerryn Vine-Camp and several APS deputy secretaries. 
There will also be politicians like the opposition’s digital transformation lead Ed Husic, who has already thrown the cat among the pigeons with some comments published by Innovation Australia on Wednesday.

As part of our Future of Work series, we look at the cryonics technicians - who are trying to help their clients cheat death.Are you open minded about the future? Do you have a medical background and can you complete tasks under time pressure?

This aims to buy the patient time until future medical science can bring them back to life, and cure them of whatever it is they died from. Cryonics InstituteSecond chance? Cryonics attempts to protect the body from decay by storing it at extremely low temperaturesAs soon as the patient dies, the clock is ticking to start the procedure. The heart has stopped pumping and the brain is no longer receiving oxygen, meaning within minutes it will lose the ability to make new memories, and soon after that the cells will begin to die.This means the technician must get to work immediately after the individual is declared legally dead, cooling their body in an ice bath in order to slow down the process of degeneration.Future of WorkBBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.How to cope when the bots take your jobStaying one step ahead of the cyber-spiesHow to become a professional shopperWhy Finland is experimenting with 'free money'More Future of Work storiesAfter this blood is drained from the body and replaced with cryoprotectant agents - similar to antifreeze - in an attempt to stop ice crystals forming in the blood cells.The body is then placed in a storage tank and brought down to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196C) in an attempt to preserve the organs and tissue.Necessary skillsWhile cryonics has been practised since the 1970s, only the US and Russia actually have small storage facilities.In the US state of Michigan, the Cryonics Institute has about 2,000 living people signed up, and 165 patients who have already gone through the process.

By day, he is a paramedic.""The training to become a paramedic is perfect to become a standby in cryonics,"" he says.""You also need someone with a funeral director's licence (because you are still legally handling dead bodies), experience running a perfusion pump, and basic surgical skills.""Future roleThe Cryonics Institute is a co-operative with just three full-time members of staff, but Mr Kowalski thinks this will grow as medical science evolves.So far just 5,000 people around the globe have signed up but the numbers are growing so funeral homes may start to offer this as an option, he says. ""Artificial intelligence, genetic modification, stem cell engineering - all these fields are vindicating what we are doing, which is giving people the greatest opportunity possible.""Fisher StudiosDr Anders Sandberg has elected to have his head cryonically preserved after death, even though he puts the chance of revival at only 3%One of the 5,000 is Dr Anders Sandberg, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute.He is on the board of the Brain Preservation Foundation and has elected to have only his head preserved after death, even though he estimates a success rate of just 3%.Like Mr Kowalski, he argues the skills needed to become a cryonics technician are already in use in many medical professions.""Right now cryonics feels a little too cold or impersonal and it relies on the admission that it is uncertain, but I do think it will grow. ""In the future, wouldn't having a cryogenicist at the hospital make sense? When you do heart or brain surgery you lower the body temperature to buy more time and I imagine that over time we will start doing more low temperature surgery.""This is a job that you might want to do if you started out as a nurse or a perfusion specialist. It would not be a big leap from a technical standpoint, only from a social one, as it's using arguments from within medicine. ""There's a lot of resistance to overcome but from a practical perspective it makes sense and might save us from a lot of wasteful medicine.""Cryonics and cryogenicsAlthough they sound similar, cryonics and cryogenics are viewed very differently by the scientific community.Cryonics specifically relates to the preservation of the human body after death. Most supporters of the process admit they do not know if or when the technology will exist to revive people, or whether the techniques used to prepare the body for storage will have worked. Getty ImagesCryogenics has many applications in present day medicine, and can be used in stem cell researchCryogenics, on the other hand, has many applications in today's society. It involves the freezing of matter at temperatures of -150C or lower. In medicine, this includes the freezing of embryos, eggs, sperm, skin, and tissue in order to preserve them for future use.  Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College, London, suggests applying validated cryogenic techniques to the brain or whole body is doomed to failure. That's because the application of antifreeze during the preservation process fails to reach all of the brain, and it would be impossible to defrost each part of the body at the same time, he says""Advocates of cryonics are naive in comparing their wishful thinking with the successes achieved in storing loosely packed cells - such as sperm - at low temperatures. ""And they shouldn't forget that any resuscitation process that isn't instantaneous will merely set the process of decay running again.""Getty ImagesCryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organsBut Prof Coen says cryogenics is an exciting field ripe for expansion. Although the brain is far too complex, cryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organs. This could revolutionise the process of transplantation, which would no longer have to take place immediately. ""People are tremendously hard at work in this field trying to store organs such as the kidney, and even the heart on a long term basis. That would be a tremendous boon to our health and wellbeing,"" Prof Coen says.  ""But a whole body? Forget it.""Illustration by Karen Charmaine Chanakira",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43259902,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15B06/production/_100483888_cyrogenetics.jpg,,,,,,,

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

It’s high time for government officials to get up to speed on the promise and potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, two U.S. senators leading the charge said today.
“I think we’re entering an age where artificial intelligence is going to provide great benefits,” Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said during an AI conference presented in Washington, D.C., as part of The Washington Post’s Transformers program.
Cantwell compared the state of the AI field to the state of the internet or the drone industry during the early days, when policymakers weren’t completely sure how those technologies were going to be used.
Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., acknowledged that members of Congress aren’t sufficiently equipped to deal with all of the issues raised by AI. “I like a measure of humility from our legislators,” he said.
To remedy that gap, Cantwell and Young are among the sponsors of a bill known as the FUTURE of AI Act. (The title is an acronym standing for “Fundamentally Understanding The Usability and Realistic Evolution of Artificial Intelligence.”)
The bill calls for creating a federal advisory committee on AI, which would include representatives from academia, private industry, civil liberties groups and other stakeholders.
Cantwell said she’d also like to see the establishment of an AI engineering institute, analogous to the federally funded Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, to help government officials sort through the field’s technical complexities.
“That is probably right now where we’re missing a little bit of, if you will, technology oomph,” she said.

Such institutions would help government and industry leaders address worries about threats to personal privacy, automation’s impact on employment and the potential for black-box algorithms to “bake in” all-too-human racial and gender biases.
Some experts say regulation is desperately needed. Last year, for example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said governments had to be “proactive in regulation rather than reactive,” because the potential threats posed by AI could turn into actual threats so quickly.
Last week, Musk said he regarded AI as “far more dangerous than nukes” — a warning that was brought up several times in the course of today’s panel discussions.
Jack Clark, strategy and communications director for OpenAI, a non-profit research company, said “government has a clear role to play,” particularly when it comes to applications such as autonomous vehicles. But Young counseled caution.
“Before we overregulate it, we want to make sure that we get a better understanding what sort of policy structures need to be in place so people can meaningfully participate in an economy driven in large measure by AI, so that it’s not biased,” Young said, “and so that hopefully America can lead with respect to this technology, which has the potential to increase our rate of economic growth, I’ve been briefed, by up to doubling it within just over 15 years.”
Other angles on AI:

Cantwell put in a pitch for Seattle’s AI ventures, ranging from Amazon and Microsoft to the startups fostered by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “If you have any kind of AI education, please head to Seattle,” she said.
Both Cantwell and Young said they’d like to see Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg provide testimony about the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that’s come in for heavy criticism. Other lawmakers have already demanded that Zuckerberg appear before Congress.
Clark and other experts said this week’s case of a fatality linked to an Uber autonomous vehicle illustrated why AI should be regulated. Young pointed to the AV START Act as an effort to bring clarity to the issue.
Peggy Johnson, Microsoft’s executive vice president for business development, pointed to several AI applications fielded by her company, including Seeing AI and Microsoft’s collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies. Health care, financial services and climate monitoring were among the promising frontiers for AI, she said.
Some experts, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, have suggested enacting a “robot tax” to compensate for the employment disruption caused by automation. But Young said he was against the idea. “I would not start by taxing capital investments, which is what this is,” he said. Cantwell took a different tack: “I would have taken the tax bill and put a big down payment on retraining,” she said.
