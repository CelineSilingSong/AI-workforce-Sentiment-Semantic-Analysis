As Google continues to leverage more artificial intelligence and machine learning in Google Search, one may wonder in what ways does AI and machine learning help Google Search perform its daily tasks. Since 2015, when Google introduced its first AI into search named RankBrain, Google has continued to deploy AI systems to better understand language and thus improve the search results Google presents to its searches.
Several months ago we sent Google a number of questions around how Google uses its AI in search, including RankBrain, neural matching, BERT and Google’s latest AI breakthrough – MUM. We’ve come up with more of an understanding of when Google uses AI, which AI does what in Google Search, how these various AI algorithms may work together, how they have changed over the years and what, if anything, search marketers need to know when it comes to how Google uses AI in search.
We spoke with Danny Sullivan, the Public Liaison for Google Search, to help with the answers to many of these questions. In short, RankBrain, neural matching and BERT are used in Google’s ranking system across many, if not most, queries and look at understanding the language of both the query and content it is ranking. However, MUM is not currently used for ranking purposes, it is currently only used for COVID vaccine naming and powers the related topics in videos results.
It starts by writing content for humans
You hear it all the time from Google representatives and from many SEOs: write content for humans. In the older days of SEO, when the algorithms were maybe simpler, you would have many SEOs who would craft content for each and every search engine (back then there were dozens of different search engines). Now, there is primarily Google, with a little bit of Bing and some ruffling from DuckDuckGo – but the algorithms are much more complex and with machine learning and AI, the algorithms understand language more like a human would understand language.
So the advice Google has given is write for humans, and that you can’t optimize your site for BERT or any AI. If you write content that humans understand, then the algorithms and AI search engines use will also understand it. In short, this article is not aimed at trying to give you SEO tips on how to optimize your sites for any specific AI, but rather to communicate how Google uses AI in Google Search.
Overview of AI used in Google Search
RankBrain. It starts with RankBrain, Google’s first attempt at using AI in search dates back to 2015. Google told us RankBrain helps Google understand how words are related to concepts and can take a broad query and better define how that query relates to real-world concepts. While it launched in 2015 and was used in 15% of queries, Google said it is now, in 2022, widely used in many queries and in all languages and regions. RankBrain does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2015Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languagesVery commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how RankBrain is used, if you search for “what’s the title of the consumer at the highest level of a food chain,” Google’s systems learn from seeing those words on various pages that the concept of a food chain may have to do with animals, and not human consumers. By understanding and matching these words to their related concepts, RankBrain helps Google understand that you’re looking for what’s commonly referred to as an “apex predator.”
Neural matching. Neural matching was the next AI Google released for search, it was released in 2018 and then expanded to the local search results in 2019. In fact, we have an article explaining the differences between RankBrain and neural matching over here. Google told us neural matching helps Google understand how queries relate to pages by looking at the entire query or content on the page and understanding it within the context of that page or query. Today, neural matching is used in many, if not most, queries, for all languages, in all regions, across most verticals of search. Neural matching does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2018Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languagesVery commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how neural matching is used, if you search for “insights how to manage a green,” for example. Google said “if a friend asked you this, you’d probably be stumped.” “But with neural matching, we’re able to make sense of this quizzical search. By looking at the broader representations of concepts in the query — management, leadership, personality and more — neural matching can decipher that this searcher is looking for management tips based on a popular, color-based personality guide,” Google told us.
BERT. BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, came in 2019, it is a neural network-based technique for natural language processing pre-training. Google told us BERT helps Google understand how combinations of words express different meanings and intents, including looking at the sequence of words on a page, so even seemingly unimportant words in your queries are counted for. When BERT launched, it was used in 10% of all English queries but expanded to more languages and used in almost all English queries early on. Today it is used in most queries and is supported in all languages. BERT does specifically help Google rank search results and is part of the ranking algorithm.
Year Launched: 2019Used For Ranking: YesLooks at the query and content languageWorks for all languages but Google said BERT “plays critical role in almost every English query”Very commonly used for many queries
Here is an example provided by Google of how BERT is used, if you search for “if you search for “can you get medicine for someone pharmacy,” BERT helps us understand that you’re trying to figure out if you can pick up medicine for someone else. Before BERT, we took that short preposition for granted, mostly surfacing results about how to fill a prescription,” Google told us.
MUM. MUM, Multitask Unified Model, is Google’s most recent AI in search. MUM was introduced in 2021 and then expanded again at the end of 2021 for more applications, with a lot of promising uses for it in the future. Google told us that MUM helps Google not just with understanding languages but also generating languages, so it can be used to understand variations in new terms and languages. MUM is not used for any ranking purposes right now in Google Search but does support all languages and regions.
Year Launched: 2021Used For Ranking: NoNot query or languages specificWorks for all languages but Google not used for ranking purposes todayUsed for a limited number of purposes
Currently, MUM is used to improve searches for COVID-19 vaccine information, and Google said it is “looking forward to offering more intuitive ways to search using a combination of both text and images in Google Lens in the coming months.”
AI used together in search but may be specialized for search verticals
Danny Sullivan from Google also explained that while these are individual AI-based algorithms, they often work together to help with ranking and understanding the same query. 
Google told us that all of these AI systems “are used to understand language including the query and potentially relevant results,” adding that “they are not designed to act in isolation to analyze just a query or a page.” Previously, it may have been assumed and understood that one AI system may have looked more at understanding the query and not the content on the page, but that is not the case, at least not in 2022.
Google also confirmed that in 2022 RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are used globally, in all languages that Google Search operates in.
And when it comes to web search versus local search versus images, shopping and other verticals, Google explained that RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are used for web search. Other modes or verticals of Google Search such as images or shopping mode use separate, specialized AI systems, according to Google.
What about core updates and AI
As explained above, Google uses RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT in most queries you enter into Google Search, but Google also has core updates. The Google broad core updates that Google rolls out a few times per year is often noticed by site owners, publishers, and SEOs more than when Google releases these larger AI-based systems.
But Google said these all can work together, with core updates. Google said these three, RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are the larger AI systems they have. But they have many AI systems within search and some within the core updates that Google rolls out.
Google told us they do have other machine learning systems in Google Search. “RankBrain, neural matching, and BERT are just some of our more powerful and prominent systems,” Google said. Google added, “there are other AI elements that can impact core updates that don’t pertain to those specific three AI systems.”

Every significant technology disruption has led to fundamental changes in how businesses are run, what products and services are sold, and how customers engage with enterprises. Personal computers and the Internet propelled new business models and value chains, while smartphones and cloud computing enabled a shift toward more mobile, on-demand services.


Technology also enabled us as humans to connect in new ways, often with little or no regard for our differences in a physical location. We are on the cusp of another era of disruption, based on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotic process automation (RPA) that promises to reshape further the nature of work and how we collaborate.

Each technology wave has brought tremendous opportunity to those who understand how to leverage these new capabilities. This time around is no different: businesses that master this digitization trend will better serve customers, lower costs and drive revenue.

PROMOTED
As digital technology infiltrates every corner of the business, companies must shift focus from simply automating existing processes to fully digitizing their operations and elevating the role of the Chief Digital Officer. That means not only transforming how they engage with customers but also fundamentally changing the way they operate internally by adopting new technologies that help employees work more effectively and collaboratively.

Natural language processing, computer vision, AI engineering, autonomic systems, Generative AI, and workforce augmentation are some of the new trends Gartner emphasized. Those technologies help make sense of information generated by employees, customers, machines and things to support better decision-making across industries.  The IoT makes it possible to connect physical objects into the digital world through embedded sensors that allow real-time operations visibility. Mobile and wearable devices enable workers and customers to communicate and transact anytime, anywhere.

These disruptive technologies can help companies acquire and retain customers, create new business models and drive revenue growth — but only if they are implemented correctly.  Businesses need systems that connect across internal functions and the customer experience. They need solutions that collaborate with other enterprise applications to provide the correct information to the right people at the right time. And they need security that can keep up with employees' increasing demands for mobility and collaboration. This article will create a roadmap at how end-to-end digital automation and autonomy bring together business strategy, scalable operating models and the right mix of tools and technologies to help companies achieve impact with digital transformation.

Extreme Customer Experience 
Customers no longer tolerate substandard or cookie-cutter services. They desire intuitive, seamless, and personal interactions. This is where integration and orchestration come in handy. 
This next generation of automation uses machine learning and data science tools to deliver extreme personalization and customer experiences. It provides conversational interfaces powered by advanced knowledge graphs, text-to-speech and deep learning systems.
According to the CEO of the Everest Group, Peter Bendor-Samuel, “ Automating a process is the most cost-effective approach to labor and yields the maximum amount of savings. Implementing a Voice Response Unit (VRU) system is at the heart of this approach. VRUs connect to IVR (interactive voice response) systems for customers to make choices or direct a transaction. The system gives a customer a set of alternatives from which to narrow down the reason for the call so the system can funnel the customer to the right person in the company.”
Moreover, cognitive and virtual assistants like Amelia, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, or Microsoft Cortana are taking center stage in this new world where customer experience is everything. They make interactions more straightforward and personalized through intelligent, context-sensitive interactions.
Business Leaders are responsible for Transformation
Previously, IT leaders and CIOs handled routine automation, eventually implemented in other business units areas. The invention of low-code development platforms that don't require heavy programming knowledge has revolutionized how automation is implemented.
Business leaders can now use automation to build multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder cross-functional teams that can turn data into insight and action at speed by partnering with us. Business leaders always link their investments to business value creation back to business advantages — they understand how automation will benefit all stakeholders of an organization, including its consumers and staff.
It's  also essential that an organization has sound execution capabilities and the ability to change rapidly — which we refer to as ""agility."" Open-source frameworks like Agile, Cloud Foundry and Microservices are part of hyper-agility trends.
Lastly, CDOs, CIOs and business leaders can use advanced automation tools to create repeatable, agile architectural models. According to CDO Trends, Data Enrichment is at the top of many CIO's priority lists for two reasons: The first is that it takes human beings out of the data acquisition process. This leads to the second reason: increasing automation increases accuracy and speed. ""When enrichment data is combined with source system data, the resulting data model can now include a complete picture of the data being mastered as seen by a subject matter expert. Enrichment data make sure you have enough data for effective mastering.""
As an organization builds capabilities with the help of CDOs, CIOs and IT leaders, those organizations must have a solid foundation to initiate from which they can support those new initiatives.  The essential function of enterprise architecture (EA) is to provide a blueprint of the critical importance of the technical and organizational components necessary to support business strategy and deliver value to customers and other stakeholders.

 Managing Talent Retention 
Talent management has become a key differentiator for enterprises. All of this needs to be supported and will need to be backed by world-class recruiting and retention approaches and strategies that foster subject matter expertise, diversity, inclusivity, and lifelong learning culture. The market has never been more competitive for people with Digital and AI skillset, and this trend is likely to continue for many years.
Automation accelerates employee happiness by allowing them to devote more time to higher-value collaborative and creative activities. Employees are more willing to stick around and assist in recruiting future talent when they feel recognized and supported.The concept image of handwriting HYPER AUTOMATION in white colour by chalk on rough blackboad from ...

Hyper automation 
Hyper automation is the process of automating the entire business ecosystem, with collaboration between machines and humans.  This platform focuses on driving operational excellence with digital technologies like robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Executives should stop seeing automation as composed of siloed units and independent elements. Instead, automation technologies should become pieces of the same puzzle that different areas of the enterprise leverage at the same time.  Moreover,  as digital technologies such as AI and RPA continue to mature, we'll see more intelligent automation — or ""hyper-automation"" — that provides context around the tasks being completed.  It's a business-driven framework for businesses and IT to identify, vet, and automate enterprise operations as possible.
By 2025, Gartner expects the market for this software to be worth nearly $860 billion. Hype automation will remain the driving force behind digital transformation in 2022 to increase accuracy and productivity.
AI will lead the way to hyper-automation, which involves many automated activities. Some of these activities include 


Process mining
Robotic process automation (RPA)
Low-code workflow platforms
Intelligent agents 
Intelligent document processing
Artificial intelligence (AI)


 
For example, American Fidelity, an insurance firm, has discovered tremendous time savings thanks to UiPath's RPA solutions despite some early resistance.  Employees were encouraged to playfully utilize the project slogan ""Drop the Drudgery"" to recognize that they could use RPA to complete tasks they probably didn't want to do in the first place. Employees used to read each email, tag it, and route it to the correct channel by hand, but thanks to RPA and machine learning, processing speeds were reduced from 45 hours to 3 seconds.
In addition, according to the CIO Magazine, “RPA is also replacing grunt work at immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP, which has seen a sharp uptick in business thanks to tech clients scrambling to hire staff on H-1B visas. The firm uses UiPath’s software to collect information, including wage data, as well as resumes and passports, from government websites such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor, Vince DiMascio, the firm’s CIO, told CIO.com at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium in May.

To stay competitive, businesses must move fast. Enterprise officials may begin by assessing their automation maturity to ensure that the company automates intelligently and appropriately for their enterprise.
For example, it's essential to know where automation can have the most significant impact instead of automating every process. By prioritizing processes for automation, organizations can gain a better return on their investment while delivering better customer experiences at the same time.
Data Fabric 
A data fabric is a network of linked data sources connected to business objectives and KPIs, and it may be used to provide critical insights throughout the organization. According to MarketWatch, this market is anticipated to expand by more than 25% by 2025. 
For example, The MapR Data Management platform binds together “real-time, dead, and batch” data for collective analysis. The MapR data fabric enables the user to grant access to both existing applications or tools and new tools like Apache Drill. This platform enables access to “data in all forms” across “all locations.” The basic objective of MapR data fabric is to break down data silos for just-in-time access to all types of data, according to The Modern Data Fabric — What It Means to Your Business.
Not only is data fabric highly flexible and scalable, but it's also adaptable to more sophisticated applications. Machine learning (ML) models in data fabric systems allow better accessibility of the prepared data across models and applications while reducing data preparation time. Data fabric provisions “controlled access” to secure data, allowing for more efficient ML procedures when data is dispersed across an organization — on the cloud, on-premise, or at the Edge. When the proper data is fed to ML models at the right time, they can learn much more effectively.

In 2022, many enterprises will begin to use AI-driven applications in the metaverse. The metaverse is defined as an immersive, networked, 3D, virtual environment where people can socialize and access information. This exciting area includes virtual worlds and augmented reality experiences. Meta will significantly impact next-generation automation. Instead of interacting with different systems, customers will experience a cohesive end-to-end service in the metaverse due to the full scale of integration and orchestration capabilities.
The metaverse is forcing the development of digital ecology in which various software and portals interact, engage, and collaborate in an alternative Second world. Meta will construct a single, unified online experience for customers in 2022. 
For example, Meta and Microsoft are positioning themselves as leaders in the metaverse. Given that Facebook has renamed itself to reflect the metaverse trend, Meta may appear to be all-in on the metaverse phenomenon. That commitment to the subject and its Oculus Quest 2 VR headsets is proof of a more thorough dedication than simply changing names. Meanwhile, Microsoft is also focused on the metaverse, but it has made a total commitment to that end only relatively recently. Its latest purchase of Activision Blizzard shows that commitment. In the future, we can expect to see the cohesion of a digital virtual world with the proliferation of VR/AR headsets.
Edge Computing  Intelligencetechnology and innovation conceptgetty
This is another critical trend that businesses must prepare for now.
Edge  Computing intelligence in enterprises establishes closed-loop actions for managing company operations in the most optimized way. Edge computing intelligence helps continuously assess and predict potential risks in creating a solution and eliminating threats.
Essentially, edge intelligence accelerates products and services at the edge to resolve resolutions of problems faster. This particular integration helps eliminate the usage of third-party tools. 
The Way Forward
While the trends mentioned above will undoubtedly impact enterprises and businesses, they're not going to happen overnight.
As these technologies become more widely adopted, organizations must start preparing by developing the skills and competencies that their employees need to work in a digital workplace environment where AI agents and automated systems collaborate to provide customers with an exceptional end-to-end service experience. Digital learning platforms can simulate real-life scenarios and provide employees with a realistic work environment that's more cost-effective and accessible.
Integrating and orchestrating artificial intelligence capabilities will help eliminate third-party tools and expedite market new products.
Elevating the role of the CDO will help in this regard by providing a single point of accountability to oversee the digital transformation, including future trends in AI and automation.

AI in banking is maturing, bringing the potential for higher-complexity solutions that generate positive ROI across business segments. Adoption of AI solutions in banking has become more mainstream: A majority of financial services companies say they've implemented the technology in business domains like risk management (56%) and revenue generation through new products and processes (52%), per the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum. As AI gains popularity in banking, financial institutions (FIs) are building on their existing solutions to solve increasingly complex challenges.

Most banks (80%) are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI and machine learing, per an OpenText survey of financial services professionals. In fact, many banks are planning to deploy solutions enabled by AI: 75% of respondents at banks with over $100 billion in assets say they're currently implementing AI strategies, compared with 46% at banks with less than $100 billion in assets, per a UBS Evidence Lab report seen by Insider Intelligence. Certain AI use cases have already gained prominence across banks' operations, with chatbots in the front office and anti-payments fraud in the middle office the most mature. Banks can use AI to transform the customer experience by enabling frictionless, 24/7 customer service interactions — but AI in banking applications isn't just limited to retail banking services. The back and middle offices of investmentbanking and all other financial services for that matter could also benefit from AI.Applications of AI in BankingThe three main channels where banks can use artificial intelligence to save on costs are front office (conversational banking), middle office (fraud detection and risk management) and back office (underwriting).In this report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies the most meaningful AI and machine learning applications across banks' front and middle offices. We also discuss the winning AI strategies used by fintechs and legacy financial institutions so far, as well as provide recommendations for how banks can best approach an AI-enabled digital transformation.The companies mentioned in this report are: Capital One, Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Personetics, Quantexa, and U.S. Bank

Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:Front- and middle-office AI applications offer the greatest cost savings opportunity across digital banking. Banks are leveraging algorithsm on the front end to smooth customer identification and authentication, mimic live employees through chatbots and voice assistants, deepen customer relationships, and provide personalized insights and recommendations. AI is also being implemented by banks within middle-office functions to assess risks, detect and prevent payments fraud, improve processes for anti-money laundering (AML) and perform know-your-customer (KYC) regulatory checks. The winning strategies employed by banks that are undergoing an AI-enabled transformation reveal how to best capture the opportunity. These strategies highlight the need for a holistic AI strategy that extends across banks' business lines, usable data, partnerships with external partners, and qualified employees.

Several professionals and companies across the globe today have understood that the adoption of smart technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) is actively changing workplaces. There are many applications of AI throughout nearly every profession and industry, and human resources careers are no exception.
A recent survey conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace found that human resources professionals believe AI in HR, can present opportunities for mastering new skills and acquiring more free time, offering human resource management professionals to expand their current roles in order to be more strategic within their firms. Among HR leaders who participated in the survey, however, 81 percent said that they find it challenging to keep up with the gradual changes of technological changes at work.
In this article let’s explore what artificial intelligence entails, and it’s applications to the world of human resources.
Automating the repetitive tasks
Several business activities usually consist of repetitive tasks,the human resource management and project resource management department is no exception. By using AI in HR applications, one can automate most of those repetitive works, giving the organization to save time and resources.
Artificial Intelligence is better than other machines because it is capable of taking intelligent decisions, which they can’t. For instance, one can use it to automate the management of employee benefits. Or, one can use it to handle the general queries of the team. Another excellent example of automation with AI is during the onboarding of a new employee. HR professionals don’t have to worry about provisioning a device, allocating the space and other relevant tasks when there is already a solution that can work it out.
More and better employee experience
Employee experience is necessary for their engagement. A company where the employees aren’t engaged is open to several costly risks. For instance, it costs a firm around USD 4,000 (in the US) to recruit new talent and an additional USD 1,000 for onboarding. Firms with higher employee engagement have a 21 percent higher profitability. That’s a considerable difference. Due to these reasons and many others, companies try multiple methods to advance like using machine learning in their employees’ experience.
Adoption of Chatbots
More and more businesses are adopting the AI-powered chatbots for numerous tasks. The AI in human resources, chatbots can be used to answer online queries, thus offering the HR professionals more time to focus on other essential jobs. Chatbots with this technology can also be used to support contact with potential job candidates and help augment internal operations.
Chatbots can perform short interviews with prospective candidates and come up with ways of enhancing the team performance. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, in the coming future one can expect chatbots to become even more capable of handling numerous tasks to save human beings time and also to create more efficient systems.
Data Aggregation
In the current world it is very tough for the HR professionals to simply look at resumes and conduct interviews. They also demand to scour the internet to see what candidates’ social media profiles are like and whether any red flags are being raised.
With AI-powered data aggregation in human resources, it is simple and quick to automatically scan through the endless repositories on social media platforms and other internet sites. Many firms like eBay and IBM already use this tech to scrape through countless sources and collect data about potential job candidates and analyze the experience and market value of each.
Employee Referrals
AI is also enabling human resources departments to better understand employee referrals. By analyzing the types of employees that are being referred and gaining insights into which ones are successful at being accepted for new roles, it is easier and quicker to ensure the best referrals are hired. AI tools can also analyze data from previous referrals and identify candidates who are similar to successful employees, too.
Learning and Development
The future of learning and development is sure to be fueled by these technological advancements over the coming years. With technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning, employee training and development will become more agile to meet employees’ individual requirements. Learning will become more personalized, taking a wide range of things into account, such as an individual worker’s existing skills and future goals and proactively addressing any skill gaps. Content matching and recommendations can then be based on the relevancy of individual employee requirements.

You might recall around the end of 2016, when seemingly overnight, the business media went from never having talked about artificial intelligence in business to ubiquitous coverage of its applications in marketing.


A small Israeli-born artificial intelligence company named Albert had suddenly emerged as a driving force behind this conversation, getting in before Salesforce had a chance to utter the word “Einstein” at its annual Dreamforce conference and AI was still a sparkle in Oracle’s eye. Behind Albert was New York City-based PR and Communications agency Channel V Media.

I spoke with Kieran Powell, partner at Channel V Media, about how Channel V Media has carved out a niche by focusing on companies’ narratives as a first step to transforming them into vocal market influencers.

PROMOTED
Gary Drenik: How can the messages a company puts out into the market have such a large influence on its standing in its industry?

Kieran Powell: Any message that a company puts out needs to be carefully curated before it’s shared with the wider market. By ‘curated,’ I don’t mean that it should be fake or fabricated; I mean that it should live at the intersection of what a company wants to say about itself and what its target audiences need to hear in order to care about it. The right message has the ability to grow a company’s standing and validate it in its market. The wrong message can cause indifference at best and confusion at worst. Most of the companies that come to us don’t realize that the upfront work to develop their narrative–or, how they want to be seen in the market and what they need to be out there saying–is just as important as the press exposure they come to us for.
Our process for determining what a company’s target market needs to hear starts with a few key questions we ask while in this process:


What are the company’s business goals? Any narrative that a company goes out with should support its business goals. The right message will attract new business and opportunities, which can be leveraged to create more awareness and an ongoing stream of attention.
How does the company want to be seen in the market? How the company wants to be seen influences what it needs to be talking about. We typically take clients through a messaging exercise that talks through its market and competitors, the problems the company solves for and its differentiators and core values. All of this helps us to determine what they should be saying in the market.
What are the current gaps in the market? What people want and need to hear, that the current market isn’t addressing, is a good place to start when creating a narrative. Rather than simply adding to what’s already being said, we figure out where the gaps are in the market – and fill them.
How can the company say what it needs to say–in layman’s terms? This alone will differentiate a company, especially in the B2B space where companies tend to speak in terms of features and functions. Instead, companies’ messaging should speak to the pain points and needs of users, which will then open the door to a conversation about products.

Companies must take the time to methodically answer these questions upfront if they want to shift conversations or own new ones.

Powell: One of the challenges we run into repeatedly with international companies is that they underestimate the size of the U.S. market and media and overestimate the press’s natural interest in them. The latter is especially true if they’re the media and consumer darling in their own country. The U.S. market is a completely different hurdle for companies to overcome — and many international companies don’t recognize that they have to demonstrate why media should care before they actually do care.

We also see many international companies that want to break into the U.S. before they have any adoption in the States. We always recommend that international companies have U.S. validation in the form of users or clients before they start PR. They see this as a chicken-or-the-egg scenario, where they want to leverage PR to get their initial clients, but without this validation, it can be an uphill battle to break through into U.S. media in a meaningful way. This becomes even more important for international companies that are going up against competitors that already have an established U.S. following or name in the market.
Drenik: Why do companies choose to go against market leaders that have a large part of the market share and engaged followings?
Powell: Emerging companies go against market leaders because they believe they have a product that provides different value than what’s already out there.
Market leaders can have a large part of the market share because they’re currently the best option–but their users can have unsolved problems that they don’t even know about yet. And just because their following is engaged doesn’t mean it’s always loyal. These audiences can quickly become early adopters of emerging companies’ products because they’re naturally interested in what they’re selling.
For example, when UK plant-based meat company Meatless Farm entered the U.S., its two dominant competitors, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, still had their first‑movers advantage. There were also a number of other U.S. brands that were gearing up to introduce their plant-based meat alternatives to American audiences–and more and more people were gearing up to try them. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, 7% of Adults 18+ are buying more meatless products, foods, or meals and 4% of adults are buying more plant-based meat products. Our work made Meatless Farm synonymous with the two market creators and one of the go-to plant-based meat choices among a large group of competitors.Prosper - Doing Regarding Your HealthProsper Insights & Analytics
We did this by distinguishing Meatless Farm from its competitors, who positioned themselves as meaty technological marvels, and by differentiating its products based on a taste profile that lends to any recipe that would traditionally use meat.
It’s no easy feat for companies to go up against the ‘Goliaths’ of their industry, but they have an advantage that their first-mover competitors do not: they’re entering an already existing market. This means they’ll spend less time laying the foundation and educating the market, and more time focused on getting their product in the hands of customers.
Drenik: Would you advise companies to create new categories instead of trying to fit into existing crowded categories? What is PR and marketing’s role in category creation if they go this route?
Powell: There’s not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Companies have to consider factors like their product, its differentiators, and the current market, but the most important part of this process is honesty. Companies have to ask themselves–and be honest about–whether their product is so different from what’s out there that it belongs in a category of its own.
There are definite pros and cons of category creation. The pros? By creating a new category, companies can claim to be the first to market and leverage this fact to define their growth trajectory. It also establishes a company as a fresh alternative to legacy options it’s going against, which is necessary if a company is truly one of a kind.
On the other hand, it’s very expensive to educate the market on a new category. This includes educating analysts on the category, teaching prospects where the company fits into their budget, and engaging potential newcomers to the category. The latter is extremely important because there’s no validation of the category until other companies join it. And perhaps the biggest con of creating a new category is the time it takes – it can take years for a category to become widely recognized by the industry.
If companies decide to create a category, PR and marketing will be critical to educating the market and defining what the new category is and how it’s different. We do this through a series of tactics: releasing reports and content about the category, showcasing expertise through thought leadership, and working with the analysts that specialize in relevant categories and market landscapes.
Drenik: According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, it pays to be in the media. Twenty-five percent (25%) of Adults 18+ say that the internet influences their purchase, and 12% say that articles on a product specifically influences their purchase.Prosper - Media Influence On PurchasesProsper Insights & Analytics

The National Institute of Standards and Technology brought on Mark Latonero as senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday.
Latonero will coordinate with international policymakers and standards organizations to advise on the risks and impacts of AI.
The White House launched both the National AI Research Resource Task Force and National AI Advisory Committee in 2021 to strengthen the U.S.’s competitive position globally, but less attention has been paid to the problems with the technology.
“Engaging with social+technical experts along with diverse stakeholders will be central to this work,” Latonero wrote, in a LinkedIn post.

Latonero is also a research professor at Georgetown University and previously worked as a senior consultant to the U.N. Executive Office of the Secretary General, developing policy guidance on human rights due diligence for digital technology use. At the same time he was senior policy advisor at the Partnership on AI.
Latonero has a doctorate in communication, specializing in social science and emerging technology, from the University of Southern California.

Smart traffic light technology controlled using Artificial Intelligence

Researchers utilise Artificial Intelligence to produce smart traffic light technology to reduce congested traffic.
At the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB, researchers in the institute branch for industrial automation INA, in Lemgo, are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable smart traffic light control as part of the ‘KI4LSA’ and ‘KI4PED’ projects to reduce traffic jams. In the future, self-learning algorithms combined with new sensors should ensure better traffic flow and shorter waiting times, while providing improved safety for pedestrians at crossings.
The project partners are Stührenberg GmbH, Cichon Automatisierungstechnik GmbH, Stadtwerke Lemgo GmbH, the city of Lemgo (associated) and Straßen NRW (associated). The German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) is funding the project, which ends in summer 2022.
Conventional traffic lights
Conventional traffic lights utilise rule-based controls, but this rigid approach does not work for all traffic situations. In addition, the sensors currently in use — induction loop technology embedded in the road surface — provide only a rough impression of the actual traffic situation. The researchers at Fraunhofer IOSB-INA are working to address these problems.
Instead of conventional sensors, they are employing high-resolution cameras and radar sensors to more precisely capture the actual traffic situation. This allows the number of vehicles waiting at a junction to be determined accurately in real time.
Employing high-resolution cameras and radar sensors
The technology also detects the average speed of the cars and the waiting times at any current moment. The real-time sensors are combined with AI, which replaces the usual rigid control rules. The AI uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, a method of machine learning that focuses on finding intelligent solutions to complex control problems.
“We used a junction in Lemgo, where our testing is carried out, to build a realistic simulation and trained the AI on countless iterations within this model, explained Arthur Müller, project manager and scientist at the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. “Prior to running the simulation, we added the traffic volume measured during rush hour into the model, enabling the AI to work with real data. This resulted in an agent trained using deep reinforcement learning: a neural network that represents the lights control.”
The algorithms trained in this way calculate the optimum switching behaviour for the traffic lights and the best phase sequence to shorten waiting times at the junction, reduce journey times and thus lower the noise and CO2 pollution caused by queuing traffic. A main advantage of the algorithms is that they can be tested, used and scaled up to include neighbouring lights that form a wider network.
Big impact when scaled up
The simulation phases carried out on the congested Lemgo junction, fitted with intelligent lights, demonstrated that the use of AI could improve traffic flow by 10% to 15%. Over the coming months, the trained agent will now take to the streets for further evaluation in a real-life laboratory. This testing will also consider the influence of the traffic metrics on parameters such as noise pollution and emissions.
However, the unavoidable ‘simulation to reality gap’ presents a challenge. “The assumptions about traffic behaviour that were used in the simulation are not a 1:1 representation of reality. So, the agent will need to be adjusted accordingly,” Müller explained. “If this is successful, the effects of scaling up will be huge. Just think of the large number of traffic lights even in a small town like Lemgo.”
The EU estimates that traffic jams cause economic damage totalling to $100bn per year for its member states. According to Müller, AI traffic lights provide an opportunity to use our existing infrastructure more efficiently. “We are the first team in the world to test deep reinforcement learning for traffic light control under real-world conditions. And we hope that our project will inspire others to similar endeavours,” added Müller.
Intelligent traffic signal systems for pedestrians
The ‘KI4PED’ project focuses on pedestrians rather than vehicles. In a project scheduled to run until the end of July 2022, Fraunhofer IOSB-INA is working together with Stührenberg GmbH and associated partners Straßen NRW, in the city of Lemgo and the city of Bielefeld to develop an innovative approach for the needs-based control of pedestrian signals.
This is estimated to be particularly beneficial for vulnerable people, such as older people or those with disabilities. The aim is to reduce waiting times and improve safety at pedestrian crosswalks by enabling longer crossing times. According to current studies, the ‘walk’ times are too short for these groups of people. The buttons currently in use, generally in small yellow boxes, do not deliver any information about the number or age of crossers, or indeed their other needs.
The project partners want to use AI in combination with high-resolution LiDAR sensors to automate the process and automatically adjust and increment the crossing times according to the needs of the pedestrians. The AI performs person detection and tracking based on data from LiDAR sensors and applies it in an embedded system in real time.
Smart traffic light technology data analysis
“For data-protection purposes, we are using LiDAR sensors rather than camera-based systems,” explained Dr Dennis Sprute, project manager and scientist at Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. “These present the pedestrians as 3D point-clouds, meaning that they cannot be individually identified.”
LiDAR sensors (light detection and ranging) emit pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment, which bounce off nearby objects and return to the sensor. The sensor measures the time it takes for the light to return to calculate the distance it travelled to the object, in this case, the person.
These sensors are also resistant to the influences of light, reflections, and weather. A feasibility study will be carried out to determine the optimum positions and alignment at the crossing. The AI algorithms will initially be trained for a week at two stoplight crossings in Lemgo and Bielefeld. Sensors tests are also planned on the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA site using various simulated light conditions to determine the detection capabilities.
By using a needs-based control concept adapted to the individual situation, the research partners hope to reduce the waiting times when there are lots of people waiting by 30%. They also aim to reduce the number of incidents of jaywalking by around 25%.

It can help organizations streamline their distributed processes for gleaning information, contacting sources and backend operations like dealing with the advertisers..Controls bias: Bias is a global issue and news media have no escape from it. However, AI assists in reducing the subjective interpretation of the data of the human as its machine learning algorithms are trained to consider accuracy..Robot as news reporters: Despite invading manufacturing, healthcare and marketing industry, robots are now in newsrooms as well.
