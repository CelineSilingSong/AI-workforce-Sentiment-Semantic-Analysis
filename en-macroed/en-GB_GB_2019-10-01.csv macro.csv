People who are self-employed in some of the lowest paid and most popular jobs are at the greatest risk of being displaced by artificial intelligence (AI), according to new research from the University at Buffalo School of Management.





Recently published by the Center for Research on Self-Employment, the study found that with both self-employment and AI investment on the rise, independent sales people, drivers, and agriculture and construction workers are in the greatest danger of having their jobs computerized, because the work is routine and low in technical expertise.
""Those who are self-employed just don't have the same access to AI resources that corporate employees do, which makes it difficult for them to keep up with these technological advancements,"" says Kate Bezrukova, associate professor of organization and human resources in the UB School of Management.
The researchers conducted a systematic review of every study to date on artificial intelligence and the self-employed, and compared those findings to their own research on groups and teams from more than 20 published studies across many work settings. Through this approach, they found that while certain jobs are at risk from AI, not every profession is in jeopardy.
In general, occupations that require employees to work together, negotiate and make decisions are less likely to be eliminated because these attributes are harder for AI to imitate. The careers less at risk from AI are typically those with higher pay, such as lawyers, managers, and business and medical professionals.
The study also found that technical jobs such as maintenance for robots and distribution of hardware for AI may see significant growth.
""It's like when the computer revolution hit decades ago—there was great fear that computers would replace people,"" says Bezrukova. ""But work just shifted and IT positions grew because we needed more support for our computers and networking.""
Looking ahead, the study recommends creating public awareness programs to highlight the opportunities and risks of AI, updating education curriculum to integrate shifting skills and tools, and conducting additional research on the integration of AI in work, specifically for the self-employed.

Lancaster University leads drive to bring Artificial Intelligence to heart of business

2 October 2019 15:09



Key figures from industry, government and academic research came together to address how they all need to adapt and embrace Artificial Intelligence in the future of work.An event organised by Lancaster University Management School’s Centre for Technological Futures at the Work Foundation in London brought together voices from across many sectors.Representatives from the Cabinet Office, BT, the TUC, the British Retail Consortium and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, among others, looked at how they can embrace the opportunities and tackle the challenges Artificial Intelligence offers to the future of both business and society.The event, ‘Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work’, sought to identify opportunities and issues in the use of artificial intelligence within business, as well as its societal applications, through workshops and panel discussions.From left: Work Foundation Associate Lesley Giles; Professor Monideepa Tarafdar, of the Centre for Technological Futures at Lancaster University; and Lancaster University Management School Dean Professor Angus Laing, all speaking at the Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work event at the Work FoundationProfessor Monideepa Tarafdar, director of the Centre for Technological Futures, said: “The future of work increasingly depends on developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence.“While it is interesting to think about AI as being super-intelligent, the reality of failed and high cost AI implementation in organisations points toward the need for understanding and action on a range of managerial/human, technical, ethical, regulatory governance and social issues, as humans partner with machines to get organisational work done.”Fellow Centre Director, Professor Theo Vurdubakis added: “The understanding such issues is limited and needs cross-expertise collaboration from those in industry, government and academia.“We need to ask how we develop robust structures that enable people from different pillars of society to work together in shaping its progress and its influence on business and society.”The event addressed issues such how to manage an increasing skills gap in data science, retaining process expertise, and addressing regulatory, social and ethical concerns to effectively implement AI.Industry practitioners discussed their experiences with AI across sectors from accounting to retail, researchers focused on current problematic issues, and senior policy-makers provide insight on areas of focus and priority for the Government.Recent research from the Centre for Technological Futures and MIT Sloan School’s Center for Information Research – entitled Using AI to Enhance Business Operations – found that businesses that are serious about AI applications spend the money to hire the right staff and develop the business practices that ensure it can improve their business operations, rather than spending money and harnessing massive amounts of data with no obvious benefits.Professor Tarafdar added: “As a collective we have to examine ways forward, with the goal of developing a framework that goes beyond the stereotypical views of AI and focuses on what can be done to better work with it.” Back to News

Recommending content, powering chatbots, trading stocks, detecting medical conditions, and driving cars. These are only a small handful of the most well-known uses of artificial intelligence, yet there is one that, despite being on the margins for much of AI's recent history, is now threatening to grow significantly in prominence. This is AI's ability to classify and rank people, to separate them according to whether they're “good” or “bad” in relation to certain purposes.


At the moment, Western civilization hasn't reached the point where AI-based systems are used en masse to categorize us according to whether we're likely to be “good” employees, “good” customers, “good” dates and “good” citizens. Nonetheless, all available indicators suggest that we're moving in this direction, and that this is regardless of whether Western nations consciously decide to construct the kinds of social credit system currently being developed by China.

This risk was highlighted at the end of September, when it emerged that an AI-powered system was being used to screen job candidates in the U.K. for the first time. Developed by the U.S.-based HireVue, it harnesses machine learning to evaluate the facial expressions, language and tone of voice of job applicants, who are filmed via smartphone or laptop and quizzed with an identical set of interview questions. HireVue's platform then filters out the “best” applicants by comparing the 25,000 pieces of data taken from each applicant's video against those collected from the interviews of existing “model” employees.

PROMOTED
Needless to say, privacy advocates and academics aren't particularly keen on HireVue's ""Hiring Intelligence Platform,"" which is used globally to conduct one million interviews and over 150,000 pre-hire assessments every 90 days. ""It is going to favour people who are good at doing interviews on video and any data set will have biases in it which will rule out people who actually would have been great at the job,” UCL's Anna Cox told the Daily Telegraph.

HireVue's technology is already here, but there are signs that similar systems may end up being wielded in other areas and sectors, to potentially harmful effect. At the end of September, Sky News reported that Academies Enterprise Trust, one of the biggest academy school chains in England, had begun monitoring the mental health of pupils at its 150 schools using a tool called AS Tracking, which uses artificial intelligence to predict self-harm, eating disorders and drug abuse.

On their own, such systems can be beneficial, given that the introduction of AS Tracking in one school in Essex resulted in a 20% reduction in pupil self-harm. However, there's a genuine concern that once schools introduce AI classification and monitoring of pupils in one area, they'll apply it to other areas, eventually using it to select the “best” students and refuse places to the “worst.” This possibility is especially worrying in the case of private schools, or in the U.K., also in the case of academies, which critics argue have been turning schools into businesses.

""With these types of technologies there is a concern that they are implemented for one reason and later used for other reasons,"" said Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, who was speaking to Sky News. ""There is the scope for mission creep, where somebody in a school says this would be a great tool to sort children into different classrooms, or decide which students should go on to university and which shouldn't.""

This is still a fear rather than a reality, but when the use of AI is shown to result in improved results (and improved profits in certain cases), basic economic imperatives will dictate that rising numbers of schools adopt AI-based classification systems more broadly. And the same goes for businesses and organizations in general, as has been highlighted by other recent cases.
For example, the U.K.-based Trades Union Congress complained in April about the growing popularity of AI-based staff-monitoring tools such as Isaak, which as of April kept tabs on approximately 130,000 workers in the U.K. and abroad. Not only does Isaak record employee activity at the micro level (i.e. tracking whether they're typing or not), but it also ranks them according to how collaborative they are, using communication data to determine whether they're “influencers” or “change-makers.” On top of this, it can also compare employee activity data with sales performance figures, furnishing management with a detailed window into who's a 'good' worker and who isn't.
Similar examples can easily be found elsewhere. Montage is another applicant-filtering tool that utilizes artificial intelligence, and as of last October it was being used by around 100 Fortune 500 companies. A number of Fortune 500 companies also make use of Humanyze, which provides a wearable smart device that tracks employee behavior, conversations and movements, and that combines with data from emails and other digital communications to determine how engaged and productive any given worker is.
And to put this in perspective, a study published last year by Gartner found that analytical or AI-based employee-monitoring is currently being used by over 50% of companies that bring in more than $750 million in annual revenues.
No doubt the identification of “good” and “bad” employees is already firmly established practice in many of the world's biggest corporations, but it's likely we'll see the classification of people spread outwards into other areas of society. Most ominously, a September report on ""The Global Expansion of AI Surveillance"" published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that at least 75 out of 176 countries internationally are regularly using AI tech for surveillance purposes, while this ratio increases to 51% of ""advanced democracies.""
This is a startling percentage, and when it emerges that authorities in the United States, for instance, are already using AI to predict where crimes will happen and to maintain a facial recognition database of around half the adult population, the possibility that the use of AI could expand further becomes a very tangible one.
Given that the essential function of AI is to classify masses of data into simplified categories, and given that the vast majority of data comes from people, it's almost inevitable that AI-based tools will be used increasingly to classify people. This may begin as a mostly benign practice, but given the profit-motive and the logic of a competitive global economy, it will be very hard to resist the temptation to use AI in a growing number of domains.
The effect of this might be to increase the fortunes and profits of corporations, as well as to ease the task of governments and authorities in an age of rising political instability, but it's also clear that the widespread use of classificatory AI comes with massive social dangers. Numerous studies have already shown that AI algorithms are only as “objective” and “fair” as the data they're fed, and if little is done to change such bias, their deployment in the years to come might only amount to a means of perpetuating unequal and unjust social structures.

        What CFOs need to know to start AI deployment

            The learning capability can solve some problems for finance teams, but extra effort is needed to make artificial intelligence work.

            By Teresa Leung
3 October 2019
Technology and analyticsPerformance management










The numbers sound promising.
PwC estimates that artificial intelligence (AI) could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030.
In Singapore, 86% of the 150 CFOs recruitment agency Robert Half surveyed earlier this year indicated that they are implementing the technology or have plans to do so in the next 12 months. The benefits those CFOs expect AI to bring include increased efficiencies and productivity (50%), better decision-making capabilities (46%), and enhanced processes (44%), the company noted.
A late 2018 Gartner survey found that 27% of the more than 400 companies polled planned to deploy AI for their finance functions by 2020.
But what is AI?
Enterprise- and consumer-technology companies attach the AI label to a wide range of products — among them chatbots, facial recognition, and even smartphone games that “predict” how you will look when you grow old. So, what is AI, and what would it allow users such as CFOs and their teams to achieve?
While AI is a broad term, it all comes down to data and getting a learning engine to do a better job, according to Eric Thain, co-chair and president at the Artificial Intelligence Society of Hong Kong and general manager of brand development at HK Express, a Hong Kong-headquartered airline.
As machines learn by trial-and-error and/or pattern recognition, data is the fuel for their learning process, Thain said in a phone interview. “The more the data, the better the learning engine works,” he noted.
In addition, machine learning is the natural progression of data analytics when it comes to AI, he said.
“While descriptive analytics tells us what the situation is, predictive analytics tells us about the future based on past data,” he explained. “And then there’ll be prescriptive analytics that tells us what to do when something happens. When narrowed down, AI and data analytics is machine learning at work.”
In Charting the Future of Accountancy With AI, a report by CPA Australia and the Singapore Management University School of Accountancy, machine learning — a subfield of AI and the driver of most of AI’s recent progress — is defined as the use of techniques that enable computers to learn and continually improve without being explicitly programmed.
“In essence, AI and machine learning (in their current form) consist of techniques which learn to recognise patterns in order to make predictions that facilitate decision-making,” the report said.
What can AI do for the finance function?
One way AI can help finance functions is to automate the extraction of data from documents such as invoices and receipts, according to Rahul Chandra, head of South East Asia and Middle East at Intain Fintech, an AI and blockchain solutions provider based in India, Singapore, and the US.
Context-based learning capabilities allow AI tools to recognise common features on different invoices even when those invoices have varied formats, he said in an interview with FM.
Thus, after successfully recognising and classifying a document such as an invoice, an AI tool can extract data such as invoice numbers, amounts payable, bank account numbers, and company names, even if they appear in different places on different invoices.
“Companies denote invoice numbers in different ways such as INV number, invoice number, or purchase number. An AI tool will eventually learn that they refer to the same thing, and there’s no need for employees to manually extract data from documents,” Chandra said.

How much time is required to train an AI tool to extract the correct data? The more invoices that a finance function uses to train an AI tool, the faster it learns, according to Chandra.
While the time required for AI tools to become highly accurate differs, Chandra said it takes one to four weeks for Intain Fintech’s AI tool to become 90% confident in its data extraction work.
Confidence is the probability with which an AI model predicts what it has extracted is accurate; confidence ranges from 0% to 100% — from not so confident to absolutely sure, according to Chandra.
He added that Intain Fintech’s AI solution allows a user to decide “the level of confidence” that requires human intervention, he said.
“For instance, a user can choose to get an alert if the AI tool only has 70% confidence in document recognition,” he explained.
Fully automated finance processes go beyond data extraction
Successful data extraction from documents is not the same as the complete automation of a finance process.
In the invoice scenario, finance functions need to be aware that making the extracted invoice data available to a company’s existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the accounts payable process requires integration between the AI tool and the ERP system, Chandra pointed out.
Integration usually requires an application programming interface (API), which in simple terms is computer code that allows computer applications to communicate with one another. An AI vendor that provides a document recognition tool might also provide an API.
What about forecasting? It might not be that straightforward
According to Charting the Future of Accountancy With AI, forecasting is a task that AI can help in financial planning and analysis (FP&A).
AI analytics tools can generate new insights into costing, pricing, sales, revenue, and cash flow by analysing historical relationships between internal and external drivers such as product portfolios, competitor behaviour, natural events, macroeconomics, and historical performance, the report stated.
While Gartner also sees interest growing in using AI to improve FP&A, it said that only a few organisations are currently using it successfully.
The reason is that AI is not yet built into most FP&A application suites, said Christopher Iervolino, senior director analyst at Gartner.
But to someone like Thain, who comes from the airline industry, revenues forecasting with AI is nothing new and is doable with clean and integrated data.
“The airline industry — which has an enormous amount of customer data — has used predictive analytics to help come up with pricing and revenue strategies for ten to 20 years already,” he said. “Indeed the industry is one of the cases used in university-level AI teaching.”

Start with examining your data
As data and its quality matter, Chandra and Thain advised finance functions to take the following steps if they want to deploy AI for forecasting.
Digitise data. According to Chandra, if you have not digitised your data, you will have to do so before using AI to get any forecasting done.
“The more data you have the better,” he said. “There’s no point to forecast based on a small amount of data because it won’t be accurate.”
While a scanner helps to digitise a paper document, it takes the optical character recognition (OCR) technology to enable computers to read its data and content.
However, OCR can only give users a raw dump of data, Chandra pointed out. Thus, finance teams need to work with IT teams to extract data points such as dates and the different types of numbers in a document, he added.
Clean data. A task harder than data digitisation is data cleansing. “There’s always junk in data,” said Chandra. “This is why data cleansing is important. You don’t want to forecast with incorrect data.”
Data cleansing involves the detection, correction, or removal of inaccurate data from a database, a spreadsheet, or other sources. All these tasks can be done by data cleansing tools offered by different technology vendors, Chandra said.
Before data cleansing is done, one has to define the rules for the task, he said.
After a finance team has come up with the rules, it asks the IT function to implement them. An alternative is to use a tool that allows users to directly apply rules without involving IT, Chandra said.
Integrate data. Data cleansing and data integration combined are 70% of the battle, said Thain. Finance functions need to make sure that data points and data sets are integrated — especially when some of the data needed is captured differently because it comes from other functions — before AI tools can provide the desired analysis and insights, he said. An AI solution provider can help with data integration, he added.
Advice to CFOs
Know what you want to do with AI. The most important question that CFOs need to ask before deployment is what they want AI to do, Chandra said. “You start this by mapping your processes,” he said. “Once you have a correct process map, you start to see the pain points. Some of them might not require you to fix with AI at all.”
Act now. As AI deployment is a big step, CFOs should act now, Thain said.
“Adoption is only half the battle while the other half is about changing the way you and others work and an organisation’s culture. So start talking to people who are knowledgeable about AI,” he said.
After that, CFOs need to have a top-down strategic vision and communicate with the organisation about that properly.
Stay away from a big-bang type of transformation. As AI deployment plus data cleansing is a long and tedious process, one can start by taking baby steps, Chandra noted.
“If there are ten steps, you can start with two steps first and see what benefits you can reap before moving to the next one” he said.

That means AI can contain implicit racial, gender and ideological biases, which prompted an array of federal and state regulatory efforts.Criminal justice In June, Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., offered two amendments to a House appropriations bill that would prevent federal funds from covering facial recognition technology by law enforcement and require the National Science Foundation to report to Congress on the social impacts of AI.""I don’t think we should ban all federal dollars from doing all AI. We just have to do it thoughtfully,"" Beyer told USA TODAY. He said computer learning and facial recognition software could enable police to falsely identify someone, prompting a cop to reach for a gun in extreme cases. ""I think very soon we will ask to ban the use of facial recognition technology on body cams because of the real-time concerns,"" Beyer said.

Other companies have access to the same type of AI technology, but they may not have massive amounts of data to use and apply it to.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a general purpose technology that is quickly reshaping economic activity and human behavior. Modern AI is still in its early days (though the term itself and earlier versions date back to the 1950s). Several estimates suggest that AI could create trillions or tens of trillions of dollars in wealth. Given the wide potential applications of the technology, those numbers seem plausible.
But as with most bursts of technological innovation, the benefits and risks of AI are not distributed equally worldwide. In AI as with other technologies, what we have isn’t really a global economy, but a set of partially connected national economies playing out on the global stage.
How does machine learning work?
Computer programs typically are created by programmers who write down a set of instructions that the computer executes. This works well when software can clearly state a set of rules or processes for doing something straightforward—basic mathematical operations, for instance.
But if we want a computer to carry out a task that doesn’t have a set of easy-to-follow instructions, because we don’t know exactly how to do it or how it can be efficiently done—such as recognizing a face or keeping our balance while catching a football—then we need a different technique.
Machine learning uses statistics to train computers to independently extract patterns from massive data sets, develop their own algorithms based on those patterns, and fine-tune the algorithms’ predictive ability by running them against new data sets.
How does machine learning boost economic growth?
Machine learning can create enormous value in a variety of ways, but probably the simplest way is by ramping up productivity. Any real production process—whether a factory that makes cars or a process that determines the likelihood that a biopsied skin cell is malignant—has thousands of steps. Each one of those steps could be done more efficiently. But to figure out how to do so requires considering possible changes to these thousands of steps, and perhaps rearranging them and adding new ones. This ushers in a cascade of nearly infinite possibilities.
Given this complexity, machine learning is a more efficient way to sift through these possibilities because the algorithms can predict whether a change will improve things. In practice, this means machine learning can yield productivity gains that human beings might not have otherwise imagined or discovered. 
But those algorithms themselves need to be built, maintained, and improved. That involves a set of processes that we call a “machine learning value chain”. The term “value chain” still calls up images of factories and industrial products, but new technologies, such as AI, have value chains too. 
An AI value chain basically includes five steps: data collection, data storage, data preparation and engineering, algorithm training, and algorithm development. That’s not the only way to categorize it, and it’s not the end of the story by any means. But thinking about AI in these terms shows that some countries are in better shape to join the AI competition than others.
How have policymakers approached AI so far?
It wasn’t that long ago that many people in the technology sector were able to convince policymakers that the digital world existed on a plane separate from and independent of governments. The internet of the 1990s, and even through much of the 2000s, was imagined to be a policy-free zone in which the power of technology would simply overwhelm or bypass the power of the state. It’s good that this naive notion is now mostly gone. But that really ups the ante for policymakers, who now have no excuse for simply letting the technology sector carve its own path. 
Policymakers thinking about long-term economic growth as well as military and security issues need to determine which parts of the machine learning value chain are most important, and realistically achievable for their country. Policy will be an important determinant of where countries land in the global machine learning economy over the next decade. That has become increasingly clear in the last year or so, as governments develop AI strategies to position themselves on what may be an even more uneven landscape than the one that late twentieth-century globalization produced.
How will the consequences of AI differ from the effects of globalization?
In simple terms, globalization refers to the increasing mobility of goods, money, ideas, and, to a lesser extent, people across national boundaries. This heightened mobility, in turn, has led many global companies to create cross-national production networks. For instance, the technology and business services firm IBM promoted a vision of a globally integrated enterprise, where work moves (as former chief executive officer Sam Palmisano put it) to where it can be done best, essentially without regard for political borders. 
Right now, the AI and machine learning economy is not evolving that way. That’s partly a function of the global rise in economic nationalism. But in many ways, this difference is also specific to AI. Given AI’s propensity to boost productivity and growth, policymakers see that the technology is poised to bestow significant and possibly sustained advantage on the companies and countries that lead. This makes countries less keen to share AI-related scientific and business knowledge.
AI also has direct military and intelligence applications—autonomous weapons are just one example. Countries have also become sensitive, though in very different ways, to the uses and abuses of very large data sets collected by firms and governments. They are keenly aware of the value of such data and are leery of letting it fall into others’ hands.
Like with the steam engine or other technologies of the past, the basic science and technologies behind machine learning cannot really be controlled or contained. But pieces of the value chain can be at least partially contained within national borders. It is possible to restrict the export of data, and access to bespoke hardware that runs machine learning systems much more efficiently than less specialized hardware. Governments can encourage or discourage the development of markets for certain kinds of machine learning products that can jumpstart AI-powered economic growth. Restricting the movement of the most talented machine learning researchers and engineers (through visa restrictions, for instance) is feasible. And it’s possible, though not easy or cheap, that some technologies could be brought out of the private sector and back into the public and defense sectors, if governments decide it is necessary for national security reasons. 
The bottom line is that no law of nature says that machine learning will diffuse across national borders and be equally available to all countries and companies. There will be leaders and laggards. In the fast-moving technology space, it’s likely that the market leaders will, at least for a time, accelerate ahead of others at an even faster pace, as their initial advantages build on themselves. That has important consequences for global economic inequality, which may start to take a different shape than it has over the last thirty years.
How can policymakers prepare for those new developments in economic inequality?
Globalization has contributed to increased inequality inside many countries. But economic inequality between countries has diminished in meaningful terms. Economist Richard Baldwin coined the term “the Great Convergence” to describe this phenomenon. This convergence was partly driven by Chinese growth and some of its positive effects in other developing nations—all of which were enabled by cross-national production networks and liberalized trade in manufactured goods. The relative increase in wealth among many less developed countries was a geopolitical stabilizer, even as worsening domestic inequality created internal political fractures in many countries.
The machine learning economy looks set to shape a different inequality landscape. First-mover advantages, positive feedback growth loops, and the critical importance of small pockets of highly talented people will combine to create superstar economies. Just as San Francisco and the Bay Area have rocketed ahead of rural California, the countries that lead in machine learning are likely to speed ahead of others, who will find it increasingly hard to catch up. 
This looks like very bad news for poor developing countries, who can no longer count on low-cost manufacturing as the first rung of a ladder to faster growth. There might be an equivalent for machine learning, like labeling data sets, but that is extremely low-value-add work that can be done anywhere in the world over the internet, and from which little, if any, learning occurs that would jump-start the development of more sophisticated and higher-value machine learning activities, like algorithm design and product development. Middle-income countries with more capital may find themselves in a similarly challenging situation. How can they use that capital to avoid being left behind?
The age of industrial globalization had a formula for economic development, but machine learning does not yet. Policymakers need to solve that problem as soon as possible—and that includes policymakers in countries that are winning the race. Leaving everyone else behind only looks good until the losers decide to disrupt or attack the leaders rather than try to compete. Given the vast challenges of digital insecurity that could undermine our collective future, that is not a scenario that anyone should want to see come to pass.

What’s New: Intel and Brown University today began work on a DARPA-funded Intelligent Spine Interface project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to restore movement and bladder control for patients paralyzed by severe spinal cord injuries.


“As a Ph.D. student at Brown, I investigated how to interface the brain with machines as an application. Now at Intel, we’re combining our AI expertise with Brown University’s cutting-edge medical research to help solve a critical medical problem: how to reconnect the brain and spine after a major spinal injury.”
–Naveen Rao, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of the AI Products Group


How It Works: During the two-year program, researchers will record motor and sensory signals from the spinal cord and use artificial neural networks to learn how to stimulate the post-injury site to communicate motor commands. Surgeons at Rhode Island Hospital near Brown University will implant electrode arrays on both ends of a patient’s injury site, creating an intelligent bypass to eventually allow the severed nerves to communicate in real time. Researchers will leverage both Intel AI open source software such as nGraph and Intel AI accelerator hardware to meet the real-time requirements of this application.


“A spinal cord injury is devastating, and little is known about how remaining circuits around the injury may be leveraged to support rehabilitation and restoration of lost function. Listening for the first time to the spinal circuits around the injury and then taking action in real time with Intel’s combined AI hardware and software solutions will uncover new knowledge about the spinal cord and accelerate innovation toward new therapies,” said David Borton, assistant professor of engineering, Brown University.


Why It Matters: The human body is unable to regenerate severed nerve fibers. In the case of a severe spinal injury, the brain’s electrical commands will no longer reach the muscles, which can lead to paralysis. The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center estimates there are 291,000 people with spinal cord injuries living in the United States, with more than 17,000 new cases each year. Over 30 percent of those spinal cord injuries result in complete tetraplegia or paraplegia.

I love Grammarly, the writing correction software from Grammarly, Inc. As a writer, it has proved invaluable to me time and time again, popping up quietly to say that I forgot a comma, got a bit too verbose on a sentence, or have used too many adverbs. I even sprung for the professional version.


Besides endorsing it, I bring Grammarly up for another reason. It is the face of augmentative AI. It is AI because it uses some very sophisticated (and likely recursive) algorithms to determine when grammar is being used improperly or even to provide recommendations for what may be a better way to phrase things. It is augmentative because, rather than completely replacing the need for a writer, it instead is intended to nudge the author in a particular direction, to give them a certain degree of editorial expertise so that they can publish with more confidence or reduce the workload on a copy editor.

This may sound like it eliminates the need for a copy editor, but even that’s not really the case. Truth is, many copy editors also use Grammarly, and prefer that their writers do so well, because they usually prefer the much more subtle task of improving well wrought prose, rather than the tedious and maddening task of correcting grammatical and spelling errors.

As a journalist I use Cisco’s Webex a great deal. Their most recent products have introduced something that I’ve found to be invaluable - the ability to transcribe audio in real time. Once again, this natural language processing (NLP) capability, long the holy grail of AI, is simply there. It has turned what was once a tedious day long operation into a comparatively short editing session (no NLP is 100% accurate), meaning that I can spend more time gathering the news than having to transcribe it.

These examples may seem to be a far cry from the popular vision of AI as a job stealer - from autonomous cars and trucks to systems that will eliminate creatives and decision makers - but they are actually pretty indicative of where Artificial Intelligence is going. I’ve written before about Adobe Photoshop’s Select Subject feature, which uses a fairly sophisticated AI to select that part of an image that looks like it’s the focus of the shot. This is an operation that can be done by hand, but it is slow, tedious and error prone. With it, Photoshop will select what I would have most of the time, and the rest can then be added relatively easily.

What’s evident from these examples is that this kind of augmentative AI can be used to do those parts of a task or operation that were high cost for very little value add otherwise. Grammarly doesn’t change my voice significantly as a writer. Auto-transcription takes a task that would likely take me several hours to do manually and reduces it to seconds so that I can focus on the content. Photoshop’s Select Subject eliminates the need for very painstaking selection of an image. It can be argued in all three cases, that this does eliminate the need for a human being to do these tasks, but let’s face it - these are tasks that nobody would prefer to do unless they really had no choice.

These kinds of instances do not flash “artificial intelligence” at first blush. When Microsoft Powerpoint suggests alternatives visualizations to the boring old bullet points slide, the effect is to change behavior by giving a nudge. The program is saying “This looks like a pyramid, or a timeline, or a set of bucket categorizations. Why don’t you use this kind of presentation?”
Over time, you’ll notice that certain presentations float to the top more often than others, because you tend to choose them more often, though occasionally, the AI mixes things up, because it “realizes” through analysing your history with the app that you may be going overboard with that particular layout and should try others for variety. Grammarly (and related services such as Textio) follow grammatical rules, but use these products for a while, and you’ll find that the systems begin making larger and more complex recommendations that begin to match your own writing style.Close-up view on white conceptual keyboard - NLP (blue key)Getty
You see this behavior increasingly in social media platforms, especially in longer form business messaging such as Linked-In where the recommendation engine will often provide recommended completion content that can be sentence length or longer. Yes, you are saving time, but the AI is also training you even as you train it, putting forth recommendations that sound more professional and that, by extension, teach you to prefer that form of rhetoric, to be more aware of certain grammatical constructions without necessarily knowing exactly what those constructions are.
It is this subtle interplay between human and machine agency that makes AI augmentation so noteworthy. Until comparatively recently, this capability didn’t exist in the same way. When people developed applications, they created capabilities - modules - that added functionality, but that functionality was generally bounded. Auto-saving a word processing document, for instance, is not AI; it is using a simple algorithm to determine when changes were made, then providing a save call after certain activity (such as typing) stops for a specific period of time.
However, work with an intelligent word processor long enough and several things will begin to configure to better accommodate your writing style. Word and grammatical recommendations will begin to reflect your specific usage. Soft grammatical “rules” will be suppressed if you continue to ignore them, the application making the reasonable assumption that you are deliberately ignoring them when pointed out.
Ironically, this can also mean that if someone else uses your particular “trained” word processing application, they will likely get frustrated because the recommendations being made do not fit with their writing style, not because they are programmed to follow a given standard, but because they have been trained to facilitate your style instead.Training is the process of providing input data into machine learning in order to establish the ... [+] parameters from subsequence categorization.Getty
In effect, the use of augmented AI personalizes that AI - the AI becomes a friend and confidant, not just a tool. This isn’t some magical, mystical computer science property. Human beings are social creatures, and when we are lonely we tend to anthropomorphize even inanimate objects around us so that we have someone to talk to. Tom Hanks, in one of his best roles to date (Cast Away), made this obvious in his humanizing of a volleyball as Wilson, an example of what TVtropes.com calls “Companion Cubes”, named for a similar anthropomorphized object from the Portal game franchise. Augmented AIs are examples of such companion cubes, ones that increasingly are capable of conversation and remembered history ( “Hey, Siri, do you remember that beach ball in that movie we watched about a cast away who talked to it?”, “I think the ball’s name was Wilson. Why do you ask?”)
Remembered history is actually a pretty good description for how most augmented AIs work. Typically, most AIs are trained to pick up anomalous behavior from a specific model, weighing both the type and weight of that anomaly and adjusting the model accordingly. In lexical analysis this includes the presence of new words or phrases and the absence of previously existing words or phrases (which are in turn kept in some form of index). A factory-reset AI will likely change fairly significantly as a user interacts with it, but over time, the model will more closely represent the optimal state for the user.
In some cases, the model itself is also somewhat self-aware, and will deliberately “mutate” the weightings based upon certain parameters to mix things up a bit. News filters, for instance, will normally gravitate towards a state where certain topics predominate (news about “artificial intelligence” or “sports balls” for instance, based upon a user’s selections), but every so often, a filter will pick up something that’s three or four hops away along a topic selection graph, in order to keep the filter from being too narrow.
This, of course, also highlights one of the biggest dangers of augmenting AIs. Such filters will create an intrinsic, self selected bias in the information that gets through. If your personal bias tends to favor a certain political ideology, you get more stories (or recommendations) that favor that bias, and fewer that counter it. This can create a bubble in which what you see reinforces what you believe, while counter examples just never get through the filters. Because this affect is invisible, it may not even be obvious that it is happening, but it is one reason why periodically any AI should nudge itself out of its calculated presets.Just as a sound mixer can be used to adjust the input weights of various audio signals, so too does ... [+] machine learning set the weights of various model parameters.Getty
The other issue that besets augmented AIs is in the initial design of model. One of the best analogs to the way that most machine learning in particular works is to imagine a sound mixer with several dozen (or several thousand) dials that automatically adjusts themselves to determine the weights of various inputs. In an ideal world, each dial is hooked up to a variable that is independent of other variables (changing one variable doesn’t effect any other variable). In reality, it’s not unusual for some variables to be somewhat (or even heavily) correlated, which means that if one variable changes, it causes other variables to change automatically, though not necessarily in completely known ways.
For instance, age and political affiliation might not, at first glance be obviously correlated, but as it turns out, there are subtle (and not completely linear) correlations that do tend to show up when a large enough sample of the population is taken. In a purely linear model (the domain primarily of high school linear algebra) the variables usually are completely independent, but in real life, the coupling between variables can become chaotic and non-linear unpredictably, and one of the big challenges that data scientist face is determining whether the model in question is linear within the domain being considered.
Every AI has some kind of model that determines the variables (columns) that are adjusted as learning takes place. If there are too few variables, the model may not match that well. If there are too many, the curves being delineated may be too restrictive, and if specific variables are correlated in some manner, then small variations in input can explode and create noise in the signal. This means that few models are perfect (and the ones that are perfect are too simple to be useful), and sometimes the best you can do is to keep false positives and negatives below a certain threshold.
Deep learning AIs are similar, but they essentially have the ability to determine the variables (or axes) that are most orthogonal to one another. However, this comes at a significant cost - it may be far from obvious how to interpret those variables. This explainability problem is one of the most vexing facing the field of AI, because if you don’t know what a variable actually means, you can’t conclusively prove that the model actually works.Sometimes the patterns that emerge in augmented AI are not the ones we think they are.Getty
A conversation at an Artificial Intelligence Meetup in Seattle illustrated this problem graphically. In one particular deep analysis of various patients at a given hospital, a deep learning model emerged from analysis that seemed to perfectly predict from a person’s medical record if that patient had cancer. The analysts examining the (OCR-scanned) data were ecstatic, thinking they’d found a foolproof model for cancer detection, when one of the nurses working on the study pointed out to them that every cancer patient’s paper records had a © written on one corner of the form to let the nurses quickly see who had cancer and who didn’t. The AI had picked this up in the analysis, and not surprisingly it accurately predicated that if the © was in that corner, the patient was sure to have cancer. Once this factor was eliminated, the accuracy rate of the model dropped considerably. (Thanks to Reza Rassool, CTO of RealNetworks, for this particular story).
Augmentation is likely to be, for some time to come, the way that most people will directly interact with artificial intelligence systems. The effects will be subtle - steadily improving the quality of the digital products that people produce, reducing the number of errors that show up, and reducing the overall time to create intellectual works - art, writing, coding, and so forth. At the same time, they raise intriguing ethical questions, such as “if an AI is used to create new content, to what extent is that augmenting technology actually responsible for what’s created?”
It also raises serious questions about simulcra in the digital world. Daz Studio, a freemium 3D rendering and rigging software product, has recently included an upgrade that analyses portraits and generates 3D models and materials using facial recognition software. While the results are still (mostly) in the uncanny valley territory, such a tool makes it possible to create photographs and animations that can look surprisingly realistic and in many cases close enough to a person to be indistinguishable. If you think about actors, models, business people, political figures and others, you can see where these kinds of technologies can be used for political mischief.
This means that augmentation AI is also likely to be the next front of an ethical battleground, as laws, social conventions and ethics begin to catch up with the technology.
There is no question that artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules, for good and bad, and augmentation, the kind of AI that is here today and is becoming increasingly difficult to discern from human-directed software, is a proving ground for how the human/computer divide asserts itself. Pay attention to this space.

5 Important Reasons Why Artificial Intelligence is Important to You



You have probably heard that artificial intelligence could be used to do lots of impressive tasks and jobs. AI can help designers and artists make quick tweaks to visuals. AI can also help researchers identify “fake” images or connect touch and sense. AI is being used to program websites and apps by combining symbolic reasoning and deep learning. Basically, artificial intelligence goes beyond deep learning. Here are five reasons why AI is important to you.
Artificial Intelligence will create new jobs.
It is no news that AI will replace “repetitive jobs.” It literally means that these kinds of jobs will be automated, like what robots are currently doing in a myriad of factories. Robots are rendering the humans that are supposed to do those tasks practically jobless.
And it goes further than that – many “white collar” tasks in the fields of law, hospitality, marketing, healthcare, accounting, and others are adversely affected. The situation seems scary because scientists are just scratching the surface as extensive research and development of AI. AI is advancing rapidly (and it is more accessible to everybody).
The great news about AI is that it can create new jobs.
Some believe that AI can create even more new jobs than ever before. According to this school of thought, AI will be the most significant job engine the world has ever seen. Artificial intelligence will eliminate low-skilled jobs and effectively create massive high-skilled job opportunities that will span all sectors of the economy.
For example, if AI becomes fully adapt to language translation, it will create a considerable demand for high-skilled human translators. If the costs of essential translations drop to nearly zero, this will encourage MORE companies that need this particular service to expand their business operations abroad.
To those who speak different languages than the community in which they reside, this help will inevitably create more work for high-skilled translators, boost more economic activities. As a result of this, and more people will be employed in these companies due to the increased workload.
Boosting international trade it one of the most significant benefits of our “global” times. So yes, AI will eliminate some jobs, but it will create many, many more.
Artificial Intelligence will improved healthcare.
AI can be used extensively in the healthcare industry. It is applicable in automated operations, predictive diagnostics, preventive interventions, precision surgery, and a host of other clinical operations. Some individuals predict that AI will completely reshape the healthcare landscape for the better.
AI is revolutionizing how the health sector works by reducing spending and improve patient outcomes.
And here are some of the applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare:

Doing repetitive jobs.
Managing medical records and other data.
Digital consultation.
Treatment design.
Medical management.
Virtual nurses.
Precision medicine.
Drug creation, and a myriad of other uses of AI.

Artificial Intelligence will revolutionize agriculture.
AI is also used in the agriculture industry extensively. Robots can be used to plant seeds, fertilized crops and administer pesticides, among a lot of other uses. Farmers can use a drone to monitor the cultivation of crops and also collect data for analysis.
The value-add data will be used to increase the final output. How? The data collected is analyzed by AI on such variables as crop health and soil conditions, boosting final production, and it can also be used in harvesting, especially for crops that are difficult to gather.
Artificial Intelligence will eliminate the need for you to perform tedious tasks.
AI is changing the workplace, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. It is used to do lots of tedious and lengthy tasks, especially the low-skilled types of jobs that are labor-intensive. It means that employees will be retasked away from boring jobs and bring significant and positive change in the workplace.
For instance, artificial intelligence is used in the automotive industry to do repetitive tasks such as performing a routine operation in the assembly line, for example. Allowing a robot to care for well, robotic-tasks, has created a shift in the workforce.
 AI is used to increase auto safety and decrease traffic complications.
Auto accidents are one of the most popular types of accidents that happen in America. It kills thousands of people annually. A whopping 95 percent of these accidents are caused by human error, meaning accidents are avoidable.
The number of accident cases will reduce as artificial intelligence is being introduced into the industry by the use of self-driving cars. On-going research in the auto industry is looking at ways AI can be used to improve traffic conditions.
Smart systems are currently in place in many cities that are used to analyze traffic lights at the intersections. Avoiding congestion leads to safer movements of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence is very useful in all industries as more research is being done to advance it. The advancements in this AI tech will be most useful if it is understood and trusted. An important part of it is that artificial intelligence and related technologies such as drones, robots, and autonomous vehicles can create around tens of millions of jobs over the next decade.
Having more jobs created — not less — will be great news for everyone. More jobs will help boost the GDP of the economy. Advancement in AI and its impressive computational power has already led to the concept of supercomputers and beyond.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is joining forces with two other research powerhouses to pioneer a new $5.5 million research center created by the U.S. Department of Energy to focus on the biggest challenges in artificial intelligence.
The Center for Artificial Intelligence-Focused Architectures and Algorithms, or ARIAA, will promote collaborative projects for scientists at PNNL in Richland, Wash., at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, and at Georgia Tech. PNNL and Sandia are part of the Energy Department’s network of research labs.
ARIAA will be headed by Roberto Gioiosa, a senior research scientist at PNNL. As center director, he’ll be in charge of ARIAA’s overall vision, strategy and research direction. He’ll be assisted by two deputy directors, Sandia’s Rajamanickam and Georgia Tech Professor Tushar Krishna.
The creation of the new center is in line with the White House’s efforts to encourage partnerships in AI research. Last month, Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced the establishment of the DOE Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office to serve as a coordinating hub for all the work that’s being done in his department.
“Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our world,” Gioiosa said in a news release. “You can see this everywhere, from your mobile phone to the development of self-driving cars. AI is also revolutionizing the way we do science and the way we tackle problems important to our nation.”
Gioiosa said that the creation of ARIAA “is part of the strategy for solving some of the most challenging problems by employing novel artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.”

Top research priorities will include AI applications for cybersecurity, electric grid resilience, graph analytics and computational chemistry. Those fields are highly relevant for the Energy Department’s portfolio, and can also yield commercial opportunities for more secure networks and new types of medicines.
ARIAA’s approach will take advantage of an approach known as “co-design,” in which researchers balance the capabilities of hardware and software as they optimize computer architectures and algorithms to address a given challenge.
The co-design approach is particularly well-suited to supercomputers and high-performance computing. And few people know that better than Gioiosa, who was part of the team that built the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer 15 years ago. Now he’s counting on co-design to unlock new capabilities for AI.
“AI promises to yield answers to many problems in a fraction of the time compared to current processes,” Gioiosa said. “But more importantly, AI will allow us to solve problems today, that simply cannot be solved because they are too complex. This is the science of the future.”

Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who announced his startup Vianai Systems a few weeks ago, recently stated, “Over the next 20 to 25 years, AI is going to be ‘a very, very big disruptor’ for Indian society because what one is seeing now in terms of automation and job losses due to automation is just the beginning.”In the past five years, artificial intelligence has taken a huge leap in providing complex solutions and data. Be it facial recognition on high-end phones, or healthcare where it aids doctors analyse complex medical data to diagnose patients.Get connected to Intello LabsArtificial IntelligenceAI’s profound tentacles have now reached social sectors too. Entrepreneurs with expertise in AI have come up with staggering solutions to address issues in agriculture, sanitation, clean drinking water, and other socially relevant issues.Having said that, the number of startups in the field of AI-based solutions has also skyrocketed. According to a news report, a study by tech giant Accenture stated that AI has the potential to add $957 billion, or 15 percent of current gross value added, to India’s economy by 2035.

Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who announced his startup Vianai Systems a few weeks ago, recently stated, “Over the next 20 to 25 years, AI is going to be ‘a very, very big disruptor’ for Indian society because what one is seeing now in terms of automation and job losses due to automation is just the beginning.”

In the past five years, artificial intelligence has taken a huge leap in providing complex solutions and data. Be it facial recognition on high-end phones, or healthcare where it aids doctors analyse complex medical data to diagnose patients.

AI’s profound tentacles have now reached social sectors too. Entrepreneurs with expertise in AI have come up with staggering solutions to address issues in agriculture, sanitation, clean drinking water, and other socially relevant issues.

Having said that, the number of startups in the field of AI-based solutions has also skyrocketed. According to a news report, a study by tech giant Accenture stated that AI has the potential to add $957 billion, or 15 percent of current gross value added, to India’s economy by 2035. Here are a few startups that are using AI for the betterment of mankind.

Several companies have made significant progress in creating smart mirrors, also called digital mirrors or smart displays, that can help you in the dressing room as well as when you’re in the hair stylist’s seat or shopping for makeup.
The Magic Of Smart Mirrors: Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality And The Internet of ThingsAdobe Stock

Technology Behind Smart Mirrors

The silver-glassed mirrors most of us are familiar with today got their start more than 200 years ago in Germany. While they still serve a useful purpose when reflecting your image back to you, some fashion and beauty leaders figured that if you added smart technology to mirrors, they could elevate the customer experience. This vision is now a reality thanks to the significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and gesture recognition technology. These mirrors can adjust your image, including the clothes you wear to your hairstyle, hair color, and makeup to create a very realistic augmented reflection.

Applications of Smart Mirrors

The beauty of a digital makeover is it’s easy to experiment and hit “undo” when you don’t like the results. L’Oréal launched an app called Style My Hair in partnership with ModiFace that allows customers to become a blonde (or any other hair color)—at least digitally—on live video. The technology colors hair strand by strand to create a fully dimensional, realistic look. Not loving blonde? Just swipe on the app and change your color again. This technology is beneficial when a colorist consults with a client regarding what they want and lets the client see—quite effectively—how the color will look on them prior to committing to the real thing.
PROMOTED
YouCam Makeup-Magic Selfie Cam, developed by Perfect Corp., is a similar app that can show you what you’ll look like with a new hair color (and eye color), try on makeup as well as a skincare analysis feature that identifies issues to troubleshoot with a skincare routine. Shopping for cosmetics in real-life can involve taking makeup on and off as you try new shades of highlighter, foundation, blush, lipstick, and eye shadow. Being able to do this virtually prevents any adverse reactions, especially for sensitive skin and makes experimentation easy as you swap between different options.
The same technology can help people see how a new hairstyle will complement their face—or not—before any irreversible cuts are made. It can also be helpful to determine a style for a special occasion or see how a style you saw in a magazine will work with your face shape before you head to the salon.

Coty’s version of the smart mirror is the CES 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree—Wella Professionals Smart Mirror. This mirror allows stylists to provide more personalized consultations. Like the apps discussed above, the Wella Professionals Smart Mirror is able to do a live AR hair color try on and can provide a 360-degree of the style so the client can see what it will look like from all angles. In addition, using facial recognition technology, it can retrieve past styles for each customer, allowing the stylist and client to really assess what worked and what didn't. Also important, the mirror provides a curated feed of content with trending styles and classic looks to help inspire both stylists and customers when trying to determine a new look. It also connects to a mobile app so the stylist and customer can stay in contact in between appointments.

Memory Mirror, a digital mirror created by MemoMi, combines a full-length mirror with high-tech including a 70-inch LCD, computer and HD camera that can record videos so you can save, share and review your try-on sessions. Neiman Marcus installed MemoMi’s mirrors in 34 locations. Another mirror altering the retail experience is the Oak Mirror by Oak Labs. It serves as a digital assistant in a dressing room, allowing customers to request other colors, styles, or accessories from a sales assistant.

Sephora is another beauty retailer that offers a 3D augmented reality mirror. Customers trying out different products can move their face from side to side, and the augmented eye shadow or lipstick stays where it is supposed to creating a very realistic effect. The technology is expected to not only enhance the customer experience but drive sales. When it's easier to experiment with different looks, it makes it easier to discover new products to purchase.
While your haircut, hair color, and makeup choices are important for your overall look, SenseMi expanded the makeover capabilities to create a virtual dressing mirror, too. The company's smart mirror is used in retail stores, and there's a home version that allows you to ""try"" on clothes digitally, plus it’s able to send you reminders about your calendar, tell you the traffic details along your normal commuting route and more. SenseMi even sells a smart table that provides a multi-touch, interactive experience that can be used in hotels, schools, hospitals, and more.
Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality will help to make retail stores more interactive and the online experience more real-life. Perhaps more importantly, with the help of makeover apps and smart mirrors, the days of bad haircuts, and color and makeup choices will be a thing of the past.

Slice to the present and that dread has now been supplanted with a progressively rational methodology where AI is being viewed as an approach to expand human capacities in an undeniably digital time..New AI frameworks have beyond-human cognitive abilities, which a significant number of us fear could conceivably dehumanize the eventual fate of work. Artificial intelligence will surely mechanize most tedious and physical tasks, and part of the quantitative tasks, for example, programming and even data science. Nonetheless, via automating these skills, AI will drive human experts up the range of abilities stepping stool into exceptionally human abilities, for example, inventiveness, social capabilities, sympathy, and sense-production, which machines can't automate. Subsequently, AI will make the working environment progressively human, not less. This is the endowment of AI to Mankind..People and machines can supplement each other bringing about increasing efficiency. This collaboration could increase income by 38% by 2022, as indicated by Accenture Research. At any rate, 61% of business pioneers concur that the convergence of human and machine collaboration is going to enable them to accomplish their vital needs quicker and more effectively..Human and machine collaboration is fundamental for companies. Having the correct attitude for AI means being quiet with the idea of human+machine, leaving the mentality of human Vs. machine behind. Because of AI, production lines are currently requiring somewhat more mankind; and AI is boosting the value of manufacturers and engineers..With the fast adoption of AI and related technologies, in any case, there will consistently be a few occupations that will be done only by humans. And after that, there are others that can be completely automated and can be dealt with intelligent automation. In any case, the most extreme jobs will see a blend of people and machines working together. This space is something named as &quot;the missing middle&quot; by Accenture..There are circumstances where an AI-driven choice all alone isn't sufficient and we additionally need to know the reasons and rationale behind it. These jobs will expect individuals to apply their human abilities and knowledge. Explainable AI supplements and supports people empowering them to improve, to be precise and take faster decisions..As the collaboration among people and machines increases, this space will see more activity. For instance, large enterprises need to deal with countless tasks which means cooperating with various merchants, customers and partners. The dangers required for every one of these associations is extraordinary, and often organizations turn out wrong in view of the complex nature of these associations. Accenture Labs applied Explainable AI and built up a five-stage procedure to clarify the hazard level of projects and agreements at every level, alongside substantial explanations behind these expectations, making it simpler for leaders to make more informed choices..Assigning and Sharing.No one task will be 100% driven by a machine or a human by themselves; rather, every task will have some level of shared association. Organizations should make an assignment allocation structure to characterize jobs and responsibilities and set the guidelines for AI frameworks and workers to facilitate to achieve a task. Augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) will be the main thrust for empowering workers to team up seriously with machines through an intuitive and simple interface. For example, making an interpretation of consumer behavior to business clients, as well as machines..Improved Speed.Speed is too significant in numerous businesses, including finance. The recognition of credit card extortion on the spot can ensure a cardholder that a transaction won't be affirmed if the misrepresentation was included, sparing time and headaches if this is distinguished past the point of no return. As indicated by Daugherty and Wilson, HSBC Holdings built up an AI-based solution that utilizes improved speed and accuracy in fraud detection. The solution can screen a huge number of transactions every day looking for an unpretentious pattern that can flag extortion..This kind of solution is extraordinary for financial establishments. However, they need human collaboration to be ceaselessly refreshed. Without the updates required, soon the algorithms would end up futile for fighting fraud. Data analysts and financial fraud experts must watch out for the product consistently to guarantee the AI solution is at any rate one stage in front of criminals..Humans and machines will cooperate perfectly, supplementing one another. Machines will figure out how to do simple tasks, for example, following procedures or crunching information. They will likewise acknowledge when people are experiencing issues and will be prepared to step in to help or to demand help from a human if the activity is past their abilities..Best performance, truth be told, will be accomplished through collaboration between humans and machines. A genuine model is cancer identification. As indicated by Harvard research, AI algorithms can read diagnostic scans with a 92% precision. People can do it with a 96% precision. Together, 99%!.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
