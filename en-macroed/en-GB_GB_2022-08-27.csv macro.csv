Artificial intelligence jobs took the longest to fill across tech roles in the railway industry in Q2 2022 according to Railway Technology’s analysis of millions of online job advertisements.
Artificial intelligence job ads at these companies were online for an average of 47 days before being taken offline during the quarter, meaning they took 16 days longer to fill than an average job at the same companies.

The figure for Q2 2022 was an increase compared to the equivalent figure a year earlier, indicating that the required skillset for these roles has become harder to find in the past year.
Artificial intelligence is one of the topics that GlobalData, our parent company and from whom the data for this article is taken, have identified as being a key disruptive technology force facing companies in the coming years. Companies that excel and invest in these areas now are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges.

Mobile jobs took the second longest to fill on average at 32.5 days, while cloud came third among the tech themes tracked by GlobalData and which were linked to at least 100 job ads in the railway industry in each of the past five quarters.

The railway industry found it harder to recruit artificial intelligence jobs compared to the wider market, with ads online for 17.5% more time on average compared to similar jobs across the entire jobs market.

At the other end of the scale cybersecurity related positions were the quickest to fill in the railway industry in Q2 2022 with positions closing during that period having been online for an average of 30 days.
GlobalData's job analytics database tracks the daily hiring patterns of thousands of companies across the world, drawing in jobs as they're posted and tagging them with additional layers of data on everything from the seniority of each position to whether a job is linked to wider industry trends.

Technology companies are racing to develop human-level artificial intelligence, whose development poses one of the greatest risks to humanity. Last week, John Carmack, a software engineer and video game developer, announced that he has raised 20 million dollars to start Keen Technologies, a company devoted to building fully human-level AI. He is not the only one. There are currently 72 projects around the world focused on developing a human-level AI, also known as an AGI — meaning an AI which can do any cognitive task at least as well as humans can.
Many have raised concerns about the effects that even today's use of artificial intelligence, which is far from human-level, already has on our society. The rise of populism and the Capitol attack in the United States, the Tigray War in Ethiopia, increased violence against Kashmiri Muslims in India, and a genocide directed toward Rohingya in Myanmar, have all been linked to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms in social media. Social media sites employing these technologies showed a proclivity for showing hateful content to users because it identified such posts as popular and thus profitable for social media companies; this, in turn, caused egregious harm. This shows that even for current AI, deep concern for safety and ethics are crucial.Advertisement:
But the plan of cutting-edge tech entrepreneurs is now to build way more powerful human-level AI, which will have much larger effects on society. These effects could, in theory, be very positive: automating intelligence could for example release us from work that we prefer not to do. But the negative effects could be as large or even larger.

Oxford academic Toby Ord spent close to a decade trying to quantify the risks of human extinction due to various causes, and summarized the results in a book aptly titled ""The Precipice."" Supervolcanoes, asteroids, and other natural causes, according to this rigorous academic work, have only a slight chance of leading to complete human extinction. Nuclear war, pandemics, and climate change rank somewhat higher. But what trumps this apocalyptic ranking exercise? You guessed it: human-level artificial intelligence.Advertisement:
And it's not just Ord who believes that full human-level AI, as opposed to today's relatively impotent vanilla version, could have extremely dire consequences. The late Stephen Hawking, tech CEOs such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates, and AI academics such as the University of California San Francisco's Stuart Russell, have all warned publicly that human-level AI could lead to nothing short of disaster, especially if developed without extreme caution and deep consideration of safety and ethics.
And who's now going to build this extremely dangerous technology? People like John Carmack, a proponent of ""hacker ethics"" who previously programmed kids' video games like ""Commander Keen."" Is Keen Technologies now going to build human-level AI with the same regard for safety? Asked on Twitter about the company's mission, Carmack replied ""AGI or bust, by way of Mad Science!""

A democratic society should not let tech CEOs determine the future of humanity without regard for ethics or safety.

Carmack's lack of concern for this kind of risk is nothing new. Before starting Keen Technologies, Carmack worked side by side with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, the company responsible for most of the harmful impacts of AI described earlier. Facebook applied technology to society without any regard for the consequences, fully in line with their motto ""Move fast and break things."" But if we are going to build human-level AI that way, the thing to be broken might be humanity.
In the interview with computer scientist Lex Fridman where Carmack announces his new AGI company, Carmack shows outright disdain for anything that restricts the unfettered development of technology and maximization of profit. According to Carmack, ""Most people with a vision are slightly less effective."" Regarding the ""AI ethics things,"" he says: ""I really stay away from any of those discussions or even really thinking about it."" People like Carmack and Zuckerberg might be good programmers, but are simply not wired to take the big picture into account.Advertisement:
If they can't, we must. A democratic society should not let tech CEOs determine the future of humanity without regard for ethics or safety. Therefore, we all have to inform ourselves about human-level AI, especially non-technologists. We have to reach a consensus on whether human-level AI indeed poses an existential threat to humanity, as most AI Safety and existential risk academics say. And we have to find out what to do about it, where some form of regulation seems inevitable. The fact that we don't know yet what manner of regulation would effectively reduce risk should not be a reason for regulators to not address the issue — but rather a reason to develop effective regulation with the highest priority. Nonprofits and academics can help in this process. Not doing anything — and thus letting people like Carmack and Zuckerberg determine the future for all of us — could very well lead to disaster.

US manufacturing is poised for a significant resurgence. The supply chain debacles caused by the pandemic have shown the weakness of an over-dependence on a long supply chain, especially one outside the US.

Further, the rising tensions with China have caused the US to question its dependence on Chinese manufacturing for economic success. These issues have changed the commitment of US manufacturing firms to build locally.

PROMOTED
The problem is—American manufacturing is critically short of the labor it needs to drive that revolution. There simply are not enough skilled workers to do the job, nor enough unskilled workers willing to learn.

Necessity truly is the mother of invention, however. The manufacturing labor shortage has paved the way for widespread deployment of some very exciting innovations in Artificial Intelligence for manufacturing. So potent are these developments that McKinskey predicts they will create some $3.7 trillion in value by 2025.

Even if every skilled worker in America was employed, there would still be 35% more unfilled job openings in the durable goods manufacturing sector than skilled workers capable of filling them. Deloitte predicts a shortage of more than two million American manufacturing workers by 2030, representing an opportunity cost of $1 trillion dollars per year.

Left unchecked, things will probably get worse, not better. There are still some 40 million Baby Boomers in the workforce—about 25% of the total workforce, many of whom in “old school” manufacturing roles. As Boomers retire, younger workers are avoiding manufacturing jobs in favor of technology, healthcare, and other opportunities where working conditions and compensation are more attractive.
The United States could quickly ramp up immigration from countries where workers are eager to obtain American employment, but that comes with its own set of challenges, and would require more political sorcery than I can imagine possible. Besides, employers may be wary of training new skilled labor only to see their operations shuttered once again during the next lockdown.
In order to keep the machines turning, American manufacturers need to find alternatives to human labor.
AI Can be a Big Part of the Labor Shortage Solution
Part of the solution to this problem, unsurprisingly, is Artificial Intelligence. As with other industries, it is inevitable that many formerly human jobs will be replaced with AI. But instead of worrying about jobs at risk from AI, in this case you should be thinking about how AI can help keep your operations running and your human staff employed.
Here are just a few of the ways that AI in Manufacturing will help mitigate the labor shortage and revolutionize how products are made on US soil:
Robotic Automation 
Robots have been used for decades in fields like automotive manufacturing and steelworks, where they have performed repetitive production floor operations such as heavy lifting and joint welding. However these conventional robots were designed only to execute very narrowly-defined tasks under extremely predictable circumstances.
Today, artificial intelligence applications like Siemens’ Simatic neural processing unit are empowering robot arms to grasp and manipulate objects regardless of their orientation, speed, or placement. That means that robots and “co-bots” (robotic assistants designed to work alongside humans) can be trained to perform a wide variety of assembly line work, just as humans do. Meanwhile, Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), armed with AI functions like mapping, surface anomaly detection, and object avoidance technology, can transport parts and finished goods through warehouses and factory floors in place of loading crews and forklift operators.
Together, these AI-powered robotic innovations can save at least 75% of the labor costs of using humans alone, enable 24 hour continuous production, and help avoid injury from assembly line dangers, heavy materials handling, and repetitive movements. It is no wonder that modern robotics is already driving a reversal of manufacturing fortunes in places like Singapore and South Korea. Why not do the same in the United States?
Additive Manufacturing 
Another area where AI is helping to alleviate the manufacturing labor shortage is in 3D printing. According to the conventional approach, highly-skilled designers and engineers must leverage years of experience and a “best guess” approach to arrive at the best design solution. But AI now empowers a rapid, generative approach to developing complex and highly optimized design solutions that can be produced quickly through 3D printing.
Machine learning in software systems like Autodesk’s Netfabb, for instance, allow manufacturers to input design parameters and request the most efficient, effective, and manufacturable options. Once a design is selected, AI from companies like NNAISENCE use neural networks and digital twins  to predict, monitor, and eliminate defects in the additive manufacturing process, helping to avoid costly delays and mistakes. AI software like Intellegens’ Alchemite can even be used to imagine new and exotic materials suitable for specific manufacturing and product usage needs.
Were all of these incredibly complex functions to be performed by humans alone, they would require much larger teams of highly-skilled engineers and designers, and would often result in inferior results.
Machine Vision
When you picture a manufacturing assembly line, you probably first envision a conveyor belt of products being whisked from one station to the next, whereupon human workers inspect products as they make their way along. In most manufacturing environments, that really isn’t far off from the truth. It is repetitive, labor intensive, and error-prone work, but it is vital to the quality assurance process.
Enter Autonomous Machine Vision (AMV), led by AI companies like Inspekto and Matroid. Using cameras and AI that recognizes the shape, orientation, and condition of assembly line products under various lighting conditions, AMV systems can count and track items, spot defects, and sort products accordingly, as they race by. This eliminates much of the need for human eyes and hands in the QA process.
Machine vision can also be used to support packing, palletization, and cargo loading, saving labor, time and money. Solutions from companies like RobitIQ and Spiroflow can determine the optimal palletizing method, for instance, whereupon a robotic arm grips and places cartons on pallets automatically.
Production Optimization 
When production machines go down, it often requires specialized analysis and repair agents, often dispatched from the maker, costing time and money. Not only can AI from providers like Vanti and 3DS be used to monitor machine and mold wear so that preventative maintenance can be scheduled for an optimal time, but it can also monitor temperature, humidity, and running variances for different products and materials, so that production machines can be optimized based on current conditions.
When something does go wrong, AI can analyze all of the possible reasons and propose the best probable course of action. That’s something that only a highly experienced human maintenance engineer can do in most factories.
But it isn’t just about maintenance and damage control. AI-powered cloud and edge systems like GE’s Brilliant Manufacturing Suite and Siemens’ Mindsphere are working to connect and manage the entire end-to-end manufacturing process from design to demand planning and material inventory, to energy consumption to endgame logistics.
The Need for AI in Manufacturing is Even Greater Than You Think
Imagine anthropomorphic robots with such a broad range of physical function and AI-powered adaptability that they will be able to do almost any manual labor that humans can currently do. When that happens, what difference will the cost of labor in developing countries make as a competitive advantage? AI-powered manufacturers won’t have to recruit and train nearly as many workers. They will worry less about the next pandemic and lockdown. They will avoid many of the single-source challenges that came along with our current supply chain management crisis. And much more.
As Artificial Intelligence systems are exposed to more and more data, they will continually improve, creating a flywheel effect that will put you right out of business if you miss the train. However, this revolution also has the unique power to wholly rejuvenate American manufacturing, perhaps even making it once again amongst the most competitive in the world.
The AI manufacturing revolution is happening right now, not at some unimaginable point on the horizon. This labor crisis is not a passing annoyance. It is part of the new business landscape that we should expect for years to come. Manufacturers who position AI as the key driver of their success will reap the benefits within our current decade.

When Alan Turing came up with the Turing Test in 1950, it was a test of a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Turing proposed that a computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence (AI) if it can create human-like responses to questions.
Thanks to large language models, we’re now at the point where computers can write text on just about any subject we give them — and for the most part, it’s very convincing and human-like.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Tell it to write a sentence on, “Why does Elon Musk like to knit?” and what it outputs is arguably as good as what any human could write:
Some possible reasons why Elon Musk might enjoy knitting could include the fact that it is a relaxing and meditative activity that can help to clear one's mind, and it also allows for a great deal of creativity and self-expression.
Additionally, knitting can be a very social activity, and Elon Musk may enjoy the opportunity to chat and connect with other knitters.

Summarizing complex text
Examples like this are fun, but the bigger value proposition of using large language models is less about writing wacky prose and more about the summarization of complex text. These use cases are exciting across industries. For instance, AI can distill information about potential prospects for sales intelligence purposes, or it can summarize investment documents in finance. 
However, what I’m particularly interested in is summarizing scientific papers for researchers.
The problem is there is an overload of research being published around the world. More than 4.2 million academic research papers were published in 2020. Even within specialized fields of research, there are hundreds of papers published every year — how can a researcher keep on top of it all while pursuing their own research? A paper’s abstract only hints at the research detail within.
When Meta recently open-sourced its language model, OPT-175B, it sounded promising for academic researchers. It’s said to offer better performance than OpenAI’s GPT-3 and uses just 15% of GPT-3’s compute resources to train it.
Putting models to the test
So how does Meta perform on scientific research?
We tested it first on a technical press release, and this was the summary we received:
​​Forward Looking Statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Artelo undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Investor Relations Contact:
Westwicke Partners on behalf of Artelo Biosciences
Mike Piccinino, CFA
It’s not a great start. The model focuses on the investor legalese at the end of the press release, calculating that it is the most important information reader’s need to know. You might argue that it is important, but it’s not what we’re looking for. The investor contact isn’t even correct, it was fabricated by the model!
Next, we tried it on a paper from the Journal of Electronic Materials:
Journal of ELECTRONIC MATERIALS, Vol. 38, No. 7, 2009 DOI: 10.1007/s11664-009-0701-y (cid:1) 2009 TMS Special Issue Paper thermally. The samples were then pulverized and analyzed by XRD, TGA, and XPS. The XRD patterns showed that CaCo2O4+d crystallizes as a calcium-ferrite-type structure, which consists of a corner- and edge- shared CoO6 octahedron network including one-dimensional double chains. The CaCo2O4+d phase has a ﬁnite density of states at the Fermi level. The XPS results showed that CaCo2O4+d has a composition of CaCo2O4+d = (Ca2CoO3)0.62CoO2. The XPS results also showed that CaCo2O4+d has

[Source: Meta OPT-175B]advertisement
At first glance, it appears to have important information, but there’s clearly superfluous information such as the details of the paper that aren’t important to the summary, and I’d more accurately describe the result as paraphrasing a part of the text rather than summarizing all aspects of it.
Small-scale models outperform
So how does a smaller language model compare? Through experience in the field, we designed our Iris.ai IPG model to have just 25 million parameters — as opposed to 175 billion from Meta and OpenAI — but trained it on millions of domain-specific scientific articles. Our research has shown that this model performs very differently on the same paper:
Metallic temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient s with a large thermoelectric power (s=151lv/kat387k) has a finite density of states at the fermi level. In this paper, we report the crystal structure and physical properties of caco2o4+d. We find a new compound caco2o4+d, which exhibits a large thermoelectric power, even though it has a finite density of states at the fermi level. Motivated by the simple guiding principle mentioned previously, we searched for new phases thermoelectric properties related as a thermoelectric material applicable to high-temperature use.

[Source: Iris.ai IPG]advertisement
You can see the sentence structure is slightly more simplistic than a large language model, but the information is much more relevant. What’s more, the computational costs to generate that news article summary is less than $0.23. To do the same on OPT-175 would cost about $180.
The container ships of AI models
You’d assume that large language models backed with enormous computational power, such as OPT-175B would be able to process the same information faster and to a higher quality. But where the model falls down is in specific domain knowledge. It doesn’t understand the structure of a research paper, it doesn’t know what information is important, and it doesn’t understand chemical formulas. It’s not the model’s fault — it simply hasn’t been trained on this information.
The solution, therefore, is to just train the GPT model on materials papers, right?
To some extent, yes. If we can train a GPT model on materials papers, then it’ll do a good job of summarizing them, but large language models are — by their nature — large. They are the proverbial container ships of AI models — it’s very difficult to change their direction. This means to evolve the model with reinforcement learning needs hundreds of thousands of materials papers. And this is a problem — this volume of papers simply doesn’t exist to train the model. Yes, data can be fabricated (as it often is in AI), but this reduces the quality of the outputs — GPT’s strength comes from the variety of data it’s trained on.
Revolutionizing the ‘how’
This is why smaller language models work better. Natural language processing (NLP) has been around for years, and although GPT models have hit the headlines, the sophistication of smaller NLP models is improving all the time. 
After all, a model trained on 175 billion parameters is always going to be difficult to handle, but a model using 30 to 40 million parameters is much more maneuverable for domain-specific text. The additional benefit is that it will use less computational power, so it costs a lot less to run, too.
From a scientific research point of view, which is what interests me most, AI is going to accelerate the potential for researchers — both in academia and in industry. The current pace of publishing produces an inaccessible amount of research, which drains academics’ time and companies’ resources. 
The way we designed Iris.ai’s IPG model reflects my belief that certain models provide the opportunity not just to revolutionize what we study or how quickly we study it, but also how we approach different disciplines of scientific research as a whole. They give talented minds significantly more time and resources to collaborate and generate value. 
This potential for every researcher to harness the world’s research drives me forward.

AI hiring tools can automate almost every step of the recruiting and hiring process, dramatically reducing the burden on HR teams.
But they can also amplify innate bias against protected groups that may be underrepresented in the company. Bias in hiring can also reduce the pool of available candidates and put companies at risk of not complying with government regulations.







Amazon was an early pioneer in using AI to improve its hiring process in 2018. The company made a concerted effort to weed out information about protected groups, but despite its best efforts, Amazon decided to terminate the program after discovering bias in hiring recommendations. 

What is AI bias and how can it impact hiring and recruitment?
AI bias denotes any way that AI and data analytics tools can perpetuate or amplify bias. This can take many forms, the most common being increasing the ratio of a particular sex, race, religion or sexual orientation. Another form may be differences in hiring offers that increase disparities of income across different groups. The most common form of bias in AI comes from the historical data used to train the algorithms. Even when teams make efforts to ignore specific differences, AI inadvertently gets trained on biases hidden in the data.
""Every system that involves human beings is biased in some way, because as a species we are inherently biased,"" said Donncha Carroll, a partner in the revenue growth practice of Axiom Consulting Partners who leads its data science center of excellence. ""We make decisions based on what we have seen, what we have observed and how we perceive the world to be. Algorithms are trained on data and if human judgment is captured in the historical record, then there is a very real risk that bias will be enshrined in the algorithm itself.""

Bias can also be introduced in how the algorithm is designed, and how people interpret AI outputs. It can also arise from including data elements such as income that are associated with biased outcomes or insufficient data on successful members of protected groups.



Recruiters and their AI hiring tools are both held accountable for violating these anti-discrimination laws and guidelines.







Examples of AI bias in hiring
Bias can get introduced in the sourcing, screening, selection and offer phases of the hiring pipeline.
In the sourcing stage, hiring teams may use AI to decide where and how to post job announcements. Various sites may cater more to different groups than others, which can add bias to the pool of potential candidates. AI may also recommend different ways to word job offers that may encourage or discourage different groups. If a sourcing app notices that recruiters reach out to candidates from some platforms more than others, it may favor placing more ads on those sites, which could amplify recruiter bias. Teams may also inadvertently include coded language, like ""ambitious"" or ""confident leader,"" that has greater appeal to privileged groups.
In the screening phase, resume analytics or chat applications may use certain information to weed out potential candidates that may also be indirectly associated with a protected class. They may look for characteristics the algorithm associates with productivity or success, such as gaps between jobs. Other tools may analyze how candidates perform in a video interview, which may amplify bias toward specific cultural groups. Examples include sports that are more often played by particular sexes and races or extracurricular activities more often undertaken by the wealthy.
In the selection phase, AI algorithms might recommend some candidates over others by using similarly biased metrics.
Once a candidate has been selected, the firm needs to make a hiring offer. AI algorithms can analyze a candidate's previous job roles to make an offer the candidate is likely to accept. These tools can amplify existing disparities in starting and career salaries across gender, racial and other differences.



Government and legal concerns
Government organizations like the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have traditionally focused on penalizing deliberate bias under civil rights laws. Recent EEOC statistics suggest that the jobless rate is significantly higher for Blacks, Asians and Hispanics compared to whites. There are also significantly more long-term unemployed job seekers age 55 and over compared to younger ones.

00:0000:0009:31
Katherine Jones on AI hype

Last year the EEOC and the U.S. Department of Justice published new guidance on steps companies can take to mitigate AI-based hiring bias. The guidance suggested enterprises look for ways that AI could be taught to disregard variables that have no bearing on job performance. It is also important to recognize that AI can still create issues even when precautions are in place. These mitigation steps are important because enterprises face legal ramifications from using AI to make hiring decisions without oversight.
EEOC chair Charlotte Burrows recommends that enterprises challenge, audit and ask questions as part of the process of validating AI hiring software.


Four ways to mitigate AI bias in recruiting
Here are some of the key ways organizations can mitigate AI bias in their recruiting and hiring practices.
1. Keep humans in the loop
Pratik Agrawal, a partner in the analytics practice of Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm, recommended firms include humans in the loop rather than relying exclusively on an automated AI engine. For example, hiring teams may want to create a process to balance the different categories of resumes that are fed into the AI engine. It's also important to introduce a manual review of recommendations. ""Constantly introduce the AI engine to more varied categories of resumes to ensure bias does not get introduced due to lack of oversight of the data being fed,"" Agrawal said.
2. Leave out biased data elements
It is important to identify data elements that bring inherent bias into the model. ""This is not a trivial task and should be carefully considered in selecting the data and features that will be included in the AI model,"" said Carroll. When considering adding a data point, ask yourself if there is a tendency for that pattern to be more or less prominent in a protected class or type of employee that should have nothing to do with performance. Just because chess players make good programmers does not mean that non-chess players couldn't have equally valuable programming talent.
3. Emphasize protected groups
Make sure to weight the representation of protected groups that may currently be underrepresented on the staff. ""This will help avoid encoding patterns in the AI model that institutionalizes what you have done before,"" Carroll said. He worked with one client who assumed a degree was an essential indicator of success. After removing this constraint, the client discovered that non-degreed employees not only performed better but stayed longer.
4. Quantify success
Take the time to discern what qualifies as success in each role and develop outcomes such as higher output or less rework that are less subject to human bias. A multivariate approach can help remove bias that might be ingrained in measures like performance ratings. This new lens can help to tease apart traits to look for when hiring new candidates.

We all use it every day,"" Professor Whittle said.Creative and emotional work just as exposed to automationA 2019 McKinsey & Co report on automation in Australia laid out just how quickly industries are set to change. The authors said by 2030 as many as 5 million Australians may need to change their occupation because of automation, with WA's East Pilbara, Penrith in western Sydney, Mackay in Queensland, West Coast in Tasmania and Port Pirie north of Adelaide among the most exposed local government areas.Even work that was widely thought to be immune to automation, particularly creative and emotional industries, is quickly proving to be just as exposed.Think you can spot content written by AI?You may not have heard of GPT-3, but there's a good chance you've read its work, used a website that runs its code, or even conversed with it through a chatbot or a character in a game.Read moreJust in the last year, AI systems DALL·E and Midjourney have exploded onto the visual arts scene, using massive data sources to generate convincing images in seconds, and sending a ripple of disquiet through arts and entertainment professions.But Professor Whittle said he was not fearful these rapidly emerging technologies could spell the end for workers.""Even things like DALL·E I don't necessarily see as replacing human creativity but rather augmenting human creativity,"" he said.""A good example of this is that somebody used DALL·E to generate the front cover for Cosmopolitan magazine recently, and it sounds a great story right, the first magazine auto-generated by a machine. Cosmopolitan published what it claims is the world's first magazine cover made by AI in June this year.(Hearst Magazine Media)""But if you look at what was actually done, there was over 100 hours of a human being involved in interacting with DALL·E to ensure the outputs being produced matched the style of the magazine and the creative licence of the magazine.""Still, he said automation would change the nature of work — and that will need to be carefully managed.Time to 'double down' on AI policyCSIRO's Data 61 institute co-designed an AI road map with the federal government last year that identified environmental health and infrastructure AIs as technologies Australia is well placed to take the lead on.The research group's chief executive, Professor Whittle, said the jobs summit was a chance to ""double down on that"".""All of these things are opportunities for the country. I wouldn't say we should sit back and take our time,"" he said. ""We should definitely grab them by the scruff of the neck if we want to take the lead.""Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the government needed to coordinate the change.""There are strong pockets of awareness [in government]. Is it part of a coherent narrative that government is guiding and leading and educating on? I think in the recent past that hasn't been the case,"" Mr McKellar said.""As we go into something like the Jobs and Skills Summit next week, I think this is an opportunity for government to reset that narrative.""We need to be competitive."" An automated hospitality worker is already being experimented with at one cafe in Canberra.(ABC News: Donal Sheil)Australia was one of the first nations out of the blocks with its AI ethics framework, but now countries are moving to introduce laws to regulate automation technologies, and in some instances even outright ban them.The European Union Parliament is debating a wide-ranging AI Act that would categorise technologies depending on the risks they pose to social wellbeing, with more stringent obligations on technologies that could be used to significantly disrupt society.Among the proposed changes is an outright ban on facial recognition software, which in Australia was recently being used by retailers Kmart, Bunnings and Good Guys to monitor customers.As countries move to enforce more responsible AI, Professor Whittle said there was also a responsibility to ensure workers were not left out.""If jobs are going to morph, organisations therefore have a responsibility,"" he said.""If they're introducing those technologies they have to be thinking do they need to be doing some reskilling of their employees at the same time.""'AI will be required in every discipline'Despite the challenges, people who know AI well are more optimistic about the potential improvements it could bring, if the country moves quickly.Professor Whittle said even if the technology was rapidly advancing, it would take time to be adopted by business.""I wouldn't say we can kind of sit back and bide our time, there's definitely a sense of urgency about it, particularly in areas where Australia has the potential to lead,"" he said.The same McKinsey & Co report that detailed Australia's exposure to automation also suggested automation would boost the average salary by as much as $15,000 this decade under the most rapid adoption scenario.Conversely, automation could also cause income inequality to grow by 27 per cent without programs to manage the change. Midjourney's slightly abstract interpretation of ""workers receiving a pay rise thanks to automation"".(Midjourney)Mr McKellar said if government and business don't wrangle with AI policy soon, the country would suffer for it.""It will determine what our place is in the world, it will have that sort of impact,"" he said.""There's a lot riding on it.""Shadow Industry Minister Paul Fletcher said there was nothing ""magic"" about the jobs summit, but that the government must seize the opportunity automation presents.""It is important to make the point this is happening over time, it's not happening overnight, and it has been happening for decades,"" Mr Fletcher said.""Ultimately the economists will tell us the best way to have rising wages is to have productivity improvements across the economy.""The ABC made multiple requests for an interview with Industry Minister Ed Husic.Professor Whittle said the jobs summit would be a chance to progress ideas on reskilling workers and educating boards to understand the risks and benefits of automation.""AI is a bit like maths in a way, it's going to be required in every discipline, and so we need to be training up future workers not just to be experts in health or law or manufacturing, or whatever it is, but to have those underlying digital AI skills as well,"" he said.""There's a wonderful quote … in the past jobs were about muscles, currently they're about brains and in the future about the heart.""Posted 27 Aug 202227 Aug 2022Sat 27 Aug 2022 at 5:05pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesSeven 'megatrends' that will shape our lives in the years ahead — and what it all meansThe world's 'first AI robot rapper' has dropped a new trackConcerns raised about new tech that uses AI, cameras to monitor workplace safetyThink you can spot content written by AI?

IoT is concerned with devices talking with one another via the internet, whereas AI is concerned with machines learning from large amounts of data. This blog will explain why IoT and AI must cohabit.Unlike traditional technology, IoT and machine learning make operational forecasts 20x faster with heightened accuracy. This is the reason why businesses that use AI technology see a growth in their revenue numbers — a validation of which can be seen in the graph below:[Revenues generated by businesses using AI from 2018 to 2025 (estimated)]The role of artificial intelligence in IoT’s revolution has helped in a massive revenue boost which also means in the sale of more connected devices.Advantages of AI-Enabled IoTThe Internet of Things’ artificial intelligence provides businesses and consumers with a number of advantages, including proactive intervention, individualized perspectives, and process systems.Artificial Intelligence is a combination of technologies that empower businesses to perform the tasks of humans much faster, efficiently and accurately. Through Artificial Intelligence solutions, companies can strike that balance to support human efforts through automated means.The following image draws a comparison among different technologies and shows which ones are the most trending.The following are a few of the most common commercial advantages of fusing these two emerging innovations:Also Read- IoT in Construction Industry: Challenges, Solutions, Applications, and Use Cases#Enhanced Safety MeasuresConsidering the recent rise in hacking and data and the destruction of priceless data, security and safety are crucial for a corporation.Your private information is safeguarded and kept out of the hands of unauthorized parties by the AI-powered IoT platform. Machine-to-machine communication is being used by a number of businesses to detect incoming threats and respond to cyber terrorists automatically.IoT sensors, for instance, in the banking industry, instantly alert law enforcement to fraudulent behavior in ATMs.#Thriving Business AnalysisThe balance between producers and consumers must be exact.By enabling you to anticipate when you most need to restock, AI helps to improve stock control and reduce inventory stress.
