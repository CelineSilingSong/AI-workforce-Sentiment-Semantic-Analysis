1. Main points


Only one in six (17%) adults said they could often or always tell when they are using artificial intelligence (AI), with men (21%), adults aged 16 to 29 years (31%), and adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (22%) among those more likely to report this; awareness decreases with age, with more than half (55%) of adults aged 70 years and over reporting they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI.
Twice as many adults thought AI brings greater risks than benefits (28%) than those who thought it has more benefits than risks (14%), while 43% thought there are equal benefits and risks to AI adoption.
Around one-third (32%) of adults agreed or strongly agreed that AI will benefit them, with men (38%), adults aged 16 to 29 years (46%), and adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (49%) among those more likely to report this.
When asked about the positive impacts AI could have on their life, adults reported it would improve their access to healthcare (31%) and their shopping experiences (27%), and 25% expected it to increase their access to learning or education.
Over one in three (36%) adults said they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their lives. Reasons given included having limited knowledge about AI or feeling it was irrelevant to their lives, believing AI is untrustworthy and risky, and distrusting the ability and intentions of companies developing or using AI.
Reported negative impacts of AI included the use of personal data without consent (72%), making it difficult to tell whether news or information are fake (68%) and increased chances of experiencing cyber crime (60%). 
Over a quarter (28%) of adults in employment surveyed thought AI could make their job easier, including those working in professional (41%) and managerial (34%) occupations, while 32% reported AI could put their job at risk, including those working in administrative and secretarial (43%) and sales and customer service (41%) occupations.

2. Research background

The rapid development and increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way we live.In September 2021, the government developed a National AI strategy (PDF, 3.5MB) setting out its ten-year plan. This was followed by a consultation process and a white paper published in March 2023, which detailed how the UK intends to support innovation while providing a framework to ensure risks are identified and addressed. The UK government is hosting the first global AI safety summit on 1 and 2 November 2023.To fill important evidence gaps, inform the public, and support AI policy, this article explores adults' perceived awareness of AI use, their views on the benefits and risks of AI, and their expectations about the impact this technology will have on their lives. Our analysis reveals significant differences across population groups and sheds light on perceived and potential inequalities.This article reports differences between groups where these are statistically significant. See Section 9: Data sources and quality for more information.

3. Awareness of AI use

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a variety of ways, including online product recommendations, facial recognition software and chatbots. Figure 1: Examples of the use of AI in daily life

In June 2023, our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) showed that around one in five (19%) adults said they could explain what AI is in detail and over half (53%) could provide a partial explanation.To gain a deeper insight into adults' awareness of AI, we evaluated their perceived ability to recognise when they engage with this technology. We found that around:

one in six (17%) adults reported that they can often or always recognise when they are using AI
one in two (50%) adults reported that they can some of the time or occasionally recognise when they are using AI
one in three (33%) adults reported that they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI
Given awareness of AI use was self-reported, it is possible that adults' perceived ability to recognise when they are engaging with AI differs from their actual ability to do so.Groups that were significantly more likely than other groups to report they can often or always recognise when they are using AI included:

men (21%)
adults aged 16 to 29 years (31%)
adults in ""Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups"" (36%)
non-disabled adults (18%)
adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (22%)
adults working in professional occupations (24%)
More than half of adults aged 70 years and over (55%) and 39% of those without a degree reported they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI.

4. Risks and benefits of AI

We provided respondents with a broad definition of artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section 8: Glossary), and then asked them to consider its benefits and risks. Among all adults: 

14% reported they think there are more benefits than risks
43% reported they think there are equal benefits and risks
28% reported they think there are more risks than benefits
16% reported they don’t know if there are more benefits or risks
Full breakdowns can be found in the accompanying dataset.

5. AI benefits for individuals

Respondents were also asked the extent to which they agree or disagree that artificial intelligence (AI) will benefit them. We found that around:

one in three (32%) adults strongly agreed or agreed that AI will benefit them
one in five (19%) adults disagreed or strongly disagreed that AI will benefit them
one in two (49%) adults neither agreed nor disagreed that AI will benefit them
Groups that were significantly more likely than other groups to strongly agree or agree that AI will benefit them individually included:

men (38%)
adults aged 16 to 29 years (46%) and 30 to 49 years (41%)
adults in the ""Asian or Asian British"" ethnic group (49%)
non-disabled adults (36%)
adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (49%)
adults working in professional occupations (51%) and as managers, directors, and senior officials (48%)
adults living in London (41%) and the South East (35%)
adults living in the least deprived areas of England (36%)
Some of these differences are broadly consistent with findings from our article analysing the UK's digital divide, which shows that women, older age groups, disabled adults, and adults with lower household incomes are less likely to use the internet.

6. Positive and negative impacts of AI

The UK government's 2023 white paper A pro-innovation approach to artificial intelligence (AI) regulation identifies benefits and risks associated with AI. Potential benefits include improvements to public services, high-quality jobs, and scientific and technological advancements. Identified risks include threats to national security, physical and mental health concerns, and ethical challenges.To gain deeper understanding of the public's perceived benefits and risks of AI, we asked respondents to identify ways in which AI could positively or negatively affect their lives.Positive impacts of AIThe most reported ways in which AI could positively affect adults lives were:

improve their access to healthcare (31%)
improve their shopping experiences (27%)
increase their access to learning or education (25%)
Over one-third (36%) of adults, however, did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life. Women (40%), those aged 50 to 69 years (44%), and 70 years and over (57%) were among those more likely to select that option.These adults were asked to describe in their own words why they felt that way. We used thematic analysis to analyse their responses, identifying six overarching themes, and selected representative quotes to illustrate key findings.Limited knowledge or irrelevant to own way of lifeA strong theme was lack of knowledge about AI or feeling it had no or little use to them. Some respondents mentioned they could not think about any positive impacts of AI because of their lack of understanding. 

... don't really understand it, so can't see any benefits to me.


Male, aged 70 years or overOthers mentioned their age (being too old or young) as a reason why they felt AI was not relevant to them. Some said they did not use computers or other devices where they could interact with AI.

As a retired person, I am not sure that I would make much use of it...


Male, aged 70 years or overSome respondents said AI was in its infancy and was, therefore, difficult for them to assess its benefits.This theme was more prevalent among those aged 70 years and over.Untrustworthy and riskyA second strong and multifaceted theme revolved around distrust of AI and the risks it could bring about.Some respondents were concerned about ""being taken over by the internet"" or becoming too dependent on technology.

[AI] like a lot of other things - the internet being one prime example - it is not properly governed/legislated/controlled. It is open to huge abuse, corruption, etc.


 Female, aged 50 to 69 yearsOthers expressed frustration about the lack of aptitude or flexibility of AI, particularly when referring to chatbots, and not being able to access human help when things went wrong. However, it is unclear if the chatbots respondents referred to were powered by AI.A group of respondents raised concerns about AI applications exhibiting biases or using their data without their consent, and the potential for this technology to enable cyber crime or other unlawful activities.

I feel worried about security risks for myself and the younger generation.


 Female, aged 70 years or overAnother group felt AI was dangerous and were afraid of unforeseen and irreparable consequences of the rollout of current and future AI technology.A minority of respondents mentioned that AI benefits depended on its application or that AI benefits seemed small compared with its risks.This theme was more common among adults aged 50 years and over.Distrust in the ability and intentions of companies developing or using AIRespondents expressed distrust in companies' primary motivation to use AI; some felt companies were focused on maximising profits, hence the benefits of AI would not be shared.

It will be used for corporate purposes, to make money for shareholders or to cut costs. Either way, the average consumer is not the main consideration.


 Male, aged 50 to 69 yearsOthers noted that those who develop and manage AI are ""fallible"", raising concerns about the technology itself and its use. Another concern was the perception that companies were hiding behind AI applications to avoid accountability.This theme was more common among those aged 50 years and over.Loss of human interaction and damage to social fabricRespondents were worried about the individual and social consequences of having fewer opportunities to interact with humans, with some feeling that the introduction of AI would lead to ""social disintegration"".

I would prefer to interact with humans. Interacting with AIs makes me feel unimportant and lonely.


 Female, aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among those aged 50 years and over.Loss of jobs and worsening of working conditionsSome respondents felt worried about losing their jobs or, in the case of retired respondents, how job displacement or replacement would affect younger generations. 

I also work as a [occupation] in films and currently there is a strike as studios are proposing to replace [occupation] with AI. I am also an [occupation] and this industry is under threat too.


 Female, aged 30 to 49 yearsA few participants mentioned they did not expect AI to improve job opportunities, but instead feared financial hardship.Others were concerned about increased workload or stress at work, with some describing how it was already happening in their workplace.

Where I work, we have self-service tills. These are taking jobs off people plus theft is higher. They also raise stress levels in the workplace.


 Male, aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among adults aged 30 to 69 years.Inadequate information, regulation, and monitoringConcerns were raised about insufficient monitoring and regulation of AI and the need for fit-for-purpose legislation to ensure AI use is in the public interest. Respondents also voiced a need for more information about AI and for more public debate and consideration.

Much more consideration needs to be given to this and legislation introduced which helps to manage the use of AI (as should also be the case with social media) so that its use is in the public interest rather than commercial and shareholder interests and profits.


 Male aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among adults aged 50 to 69 years.For more methodological details about this thematic analysis, see Section 9: Data sources and quality.Figure 4: Over a third of adults do not think AI could have a positive impact on their lifeProportion of adults reporting positive impacts AI could have on their life, Great Britain, 26 July to 1 October 2023

Notes:

Question: ""In which ways, if any, do you think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a positive impact on your life?”
Respondents were able to choose more than one option.
Base: all adults.
Differences across groups reporting positive impacts of AIThe ways in which adults thought AI could have a positive impact on their life differed by sex, age group and education.SexMen were significantly more likely to report that AI could:

improve their access to healthcare (35%)
increase their access to learning or education (28%)
make their household tasks easier (25%)
make their job easier (25%)
Age groupAdults aged 16 to 29 years were significantly more likely than other age groups to report that AI could increase their access to learning or education (44%). This is possibly because this age group is more likely to still be in education.Adults aged 16 to 29 and 30 to 49 years were significantly more likely than older age groups to report that AI could:

improve their shopping experiences (31% of adults aged 16 to 29 years and 35% of adults aged 30 to 49 years)  
make their household tasks easier (30% of adults aged 16 to 29 years and 29% of adults aged 30 to 49 years)
Adults aged 70 years and over (57%) were significantly more likely than other age groups to report they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life.EducationAdults educated to degree level or equivalent were more likely to report that AI could:

improve their access to healthcare (39%)
improve their shopping experiences (36%)
make their job easier (36%)
increase their access to learning or education (35%)
make their household tasks easier (31%)
Adults without a degree were more likely to report they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life (43%) compared with those educated to degree level or equivalent (20%).Negative impacts of AIThe most common ways in which AI could negatively affect adults' lives were: 

using their personal data without consent (72%)
make it difficult to tell whether news or information are fake (68%)
increase their chances of experiencing cyber crime (60%)
There were few significant statistical differences in how population groups answered this question, which indicates there is more consensus about the negative impacts of AI than the positive ones. Full breakdowns can be found in the accompanying dataset.Figure 5: Around 7 in 10 adults are concerned that AI could use their personal data without consentProportion of adults reporting negative impacts that AI could have on their life, Great Britain, 26 July to 1 October 2023

Question: ""In which ways, if any, do you think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a negative impact on your life?” 
Respondents were able to choose more than one option. 
Base: all adults. 
AI impacts on adults in employmentWhen considering how adults in employment perceived the positive impacts AI could have on their jobs, we found that around:

3 in 10 (28%) think that AI could make their job easier
1 in 9 (11%) think that AI could reduce their working hours without reducing their pay
1 in 13 (8%) think that AI could improve their job prospects
1 in 14 (7%) think that AI could increase their income
When investigating how adults in employment perceived the negative impacts AI could have on their jobs, we found that around:

a third (32%) think AI could put their job at risk
a quarter (23%) think that AI could reduce their income
AI impacts on different occupation groupsWe found that adults working in professional occupations (41%), managers, directors, and senior officials (34%) and associate professional occupations (34%) were significantly more likely to report AI could make their job easier than adults working in all other occupations (see Figure 6). Examples of job titles for each occupation can be found in the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) 2020 coding index.In contrast, adults working in administrative and secretarial (43%), sales and customer service (41%), associate professional (36%), and professional (33%) occupations were significantly more likely to think AI could put their job at risk than adults working in skilled trade (20%) and caring, leisure and other service occupations (18%) (see Figure 7).Recent cross-country analysis from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on labour market exposure to AI found that the UK has a large share of workers in occupations:

with high exposure and high complementarity (AI's potential to complement human labour) (52%)
with high exposure but low complementarity (AI's potential to displace human labour) (32%)
Although the classification of occupations used in the IMF analysis (ISCO-8) is not completely aligned with the classification we used (one-digit SOC), some of our findings resonate with the IMF's estimated impact of AI on the UK labour market.Adults in some high-exposure occupations that are expected to be enhanced by AI, such as professional roles, were also more likely to say AI could make their job easier. In contrast, adults in some high-exposure occupations, which are deemed at higher risk of displacement, such as administrative and secretarial roles, were more likely to say AI could put their job at risk. Adults in occupations that are forecast to be much less exposed to AI, such as those in elementary occupations, appear to be concerned about losing their jobs, possibly because of previous experiences with automation (see our Probability of automation in England article for more information).

8. Glossary

Artificial intelligenceThe following definition of artificial intelligence (AI) was provided for survey respondents:""By artificial intelligence (AI) we mean computer programmes or machines that can learn from data and perform tasks usually done by humans. AI is currently used in a variety of ways, including: 

online product recommendations
facial recognition 
self-driving vehicles
medical diagnostic tools
chatbots that interact in a conversational way and can answer complex questions""
Disability statusTo define disability in this publication, we refer to the Government Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised ""core"" definition of disability. This identifies ""disabled"" as a person who has a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more that reduces their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported.EducationHighest education level, as defined in this government page covering qualification levels, refers to the level of the highest qualification obtained by a respondent. Qualifications have been grouped into the following groups for ease of analysis and communications, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes:

degree or equivalent: level 6 or higher qualification obtained anywhere
below degree level (including GCSEs, A Levels or equivalent)
other qualification obtained in the UK not included in the other categories, or any qualification obtained outside the UK, which is not a degree
none: no formal qualifications
EthnicityThe ethnicity disaggregation used has been chosen to provide the most granular breakdown possible, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes. Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) ethnicity questions are not completely aligned with the GSS harmonised standard. However, the reporting of the five-category ethnicity groups is aligned with this guidance. More information can be found on the GSS harmonised ethnicity page.The five-category ethnicity breakdown includes:

Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani or any other Asian background
Black, African, Caribbean or Black British: African, Caribbean or any other Black, African or Caribbean background
Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups: White and Asian, White and Black African, White and Black Caribbean,  or any other Mixed or Multiple ethnic background
Other ethnic group: Arab or any other ethnic group
White: White British, White Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller, or any other White background
The Index of Multiple DeprivationThe Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in England. The IMD ranks every small area in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area). Deciles are calculated by ranking the 32,844 small areas in England, from most deprived to least deprived, and dividing them into 10 equal groups. These range from the most deprived 10% of small areas nationally to the least deprived 10% of small areas nationally. For this analysis, to ensure robust sample sizes, we have further grouped deciles into quintiles.Statistical significanceThis article presents a summary of results, with further data including confidence intervals for the estimates shown in the charts presented and contained in the associated datasets. Where comparisons between groups are presented, 95% confidence intervals should be used to assess the statistical significance of the change. For more information, see our Uncertainty and how we measure it for our surveys methodology.Standard Occupational ClassificationOccupation is self-reported on the OPN and, therefore, should be treated with caution.Our Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is a common classification of occupational information for the UK, in which jobs are classified by their skill level and content into the following nine major groups:

managers, directors and senior officials
professional occupations
associate professional occupations
administrative and secretarial occupations
skilled trades occupations
caring, leisure and other service occupations
sales and customer service occupations
process, plant, and machine operatives
elementary occupations

9. Data sources and quality

This release contains data and indicators from the Office for National Statistics's (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN).QualityMore quality and methodology information on the OPN and its strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Quality and Methodology Information (QMI). SamplingThe analysis throughout this article is based on adults aged 16 years and over in Great Britain. The latest analysis in this report is based on 12,511 adults from a pooled dataset comprising five waves of data collection, covering the following periods:

26 July to 6 August 2023
 9 to 20 August 2023
 23 August to 3 September 2023
 6 to 17 September 2023
 20 September to 1 October 2023
Pooling fives waves of data together increases sample sizes and allows us to carry out detailed analysis for different groups of the population.WeightingSurvey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population.Weights were first adjusted for non-response and attrition. Subsequently, the weights were calibrated to satisfy population distributions considering the following factors: sex by age, region, tenure, highest qualification, and employment status.For age, sex, and region, population totals based on projections of mid-year population estimates for June 2021 were used. Therefore, the resulting weighted sample is representative of the Great Britain adult population by a number of socio-demographic factors and geography.Qualitative analysisBetween 9 and 20 August, survey respondents who told us that they thought AI could not have a positive impact on their life were asked: ""In your own words, tell us why you don't think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a positive impact on your life"".Inductive thematic analysis, a bottom-up approach whereby themes emerge from the data themselves, was used by two analysts to code the data. For quality assurance purposes, 10% of responses were independently double coded by a third analyst. This ensured codes were correctly classified within each theme, while any differences were resolved through discussion and review until consensus was reached.All survey responses were anonymous and any potentially identifying information has been removed from the quotations. Some quotations have been shortened for brevity.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Professors Jack Stilgoe (University College London) and Jonathan Ives (University of Bristol) for their contribution to the selection and design of the survey questions, and more generally, for their expert guidance and ideas.

Emerging technologies have ushered in a new era of legal complexities for employers. While artificial intelligence and, more recently, generative AI have garnered significant attention, the initial wave of regulation is focusing on automated employment decision tools (AEDTs). This article delves into an overview of AEDTs, the guidance provided by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the unique legal landscape in various jurisdictions, including New York City, Illinois, California, and Maryland. Our goal is to help employers navigate this evolving landscape while emphasizing the importance of automating processes without sacrificing fairness in employment decisions.


The Rise of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the employment lifecycle has become pervasive. As AI becomes integrated into employment decision-making, concerns regarding bias (or perceived bias) imparted by algorithms have taken center stage. Employment decisions, ranging from filtering job applications to making hiring, retention, promotion, and termination choices, have become reliant on these automated tools. The promise of using technology to streamline decision-making is alluring, but it comes with significant risks and, in some cases, imposes compliance requirements on employers who choose to incorporate AI into their processes.

Algorithmic Bias and Regulatory Attention

One of the most significant concerns in the AI-driven employment landscape is algorithmic bias. Just like humans, algorithms are not immune to bias, and this issue has garnered increasing attention from lawmakers and regulators in recent years. For example, President Biden recently signed an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. The order establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, and advances American thought leadership in terms of AI around the world.
PROMOTED
The focus on AI within the employment context has gained momentum, as demonstrated by a joint statement from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Justice (DOJ), EEOC, and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning discrimination and bias. The joint statement underscores three crucial points:


Application of Existing Legal Authorities: The statement affirms that existing laws and regulations are equally applicable to the use of automated systems and new technologies, signaling that agencies will apply existing legal frameworks to AI.
Addressing Harmful Outcomes: It highlights the ways AI can “perpetuate unlawful bias, automate unlawful discrimination, and produce other harmful outcomes,” emphasizing the need for vigilance in AI employment practices.
Protection of Individual Rights: The statement concludes with a commitment from these agencies to vigorously protect individual rights against discriminatory AI practices.

EEOC Guidance on AI in Employment
The EEOC has taken proactive steps to guide employers when using AI in employment decisions. Two essential pieces of guidance have been released:


1/100:28Forbes Leadership

Continue watchingKamala Harris’s Presidential Bid: Triumph Or Trial?after the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
1. Select Issues: Assessing Adverse Impact in Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence Used in Employment Selection Procedures Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: This document addresses the use of AI in employment decisions and the concept of disparate impact. Disparate impact occurs when an employer uses a process that appears neutral but disproportionately affects individuals based on protected characteristics, such as race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The guidance outlines several critical points:


Employers must audit AI tools that significantly contribute to employment decisions to ensure they are not discriminatory.
If there is a possibility that an AI tool imparts disparate impact, employers must demonstrate that using the tool is “job-related and consistent with business necessity” and that there are no less discriminatory alternatives that are equally effective.
Employers who use third-party AI solutions, software, or online tools for employment decisions are not shielded from liability if these tools disproportionately affect individuals in protected classes.
The “four-fifths rule,” which suggests that there should not be more than a 20% variance in selection between members of a protected class, can be used as a benchmark for assessing disparate impact.


2. The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees: The guidance also addresses the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the context of AI. It outlines three ways in which an employer’s AI tools may violate the ADA:


Failure to provide a “reasonable accommodation” in lieu of AI. Employers should ensure that accommodations are available, such as oral exams for individuals with limited manual dexterity.
Screening out a candidate with a disability who can perform essential job functions with a reasonable accommodation. For example, if an AI tool screens out someone with a speech impediment who can perform the job, it likely raises discrimination concerns.
Conducting disability-related inquiries or medical examinations that violate the ADA’s restrictions.


The guidance provides employers with practical steps to comply with the ADA when using AI decision-making tools, including allowing for opt-outs, providing notice before AI use, focusing on essential job qualifications, and reviewing vendor compliance.
State and Local Measures: New York City, Illinois, California, and Maryland
Now, let’s focus on state-specific measures that directly affect employers using AI in employment decisions. These unique legal landscapes add an additional layer of complexity to the use of AI and AEDTs.
New York City: The city’s artificial intelligence and hiring ordinance, effective since July 5th, 2023, impacts employers who use AEDTs that significantly aid in employment decisions. This law prohibits employers from using AEDTs for candidate or employee screening without first conducting a bias audit. Employers must undergo an annual bias audit conducted by an independent auditor and publish the results on their website. Furthermore, employers must give candidates ten days’ notice before using an AEDT for hiring decisions.
Illinois: The state enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2020. This landmark legislation places specific obligations on employers:


Employers must provide prior notice to applicants that AI may be used to analyze video interviews.
Employers must explain how AI works and the types of characteristics it uses to evaluate applicants.
Applicants must give their consent to be evaluated by AI software.
Employers are prohibited from sharing an applicant’s video with others, except those necessary for evaluating fitness for the position.
Candidates can request the deletion of videos after a specified time period.


Recent amendments to this act aim to address racial bias and AI in employment. Employers relying solely on AI to determine in-person interviews must submit demographic information about those not offered in-person interviews and those hired.
Maryland: Maryland’s Facial Recognition Technology law defines “facial recognition service” and “facial template.” Employers must obtain signed waivers that provide an applicant’s consent if facial recognition technology is used during interviews. The waiver must include the applicant’s name, interview date, consent to facial recognition use, and whether the applicant read the consent waiver.
California: While California’s Fair Chance Act is not AI-specific, it influences the use of AI in employment decisions for candidates with a criminal history. Recent revisions expand the definition of an employer to include services that evaluate an applicant’s criminal history on behalf of an employer. This means AI solutions assessing an individual’s criminal history could be subject to compliance requirements under the Fair Chance Act. Additionally, the state’s case law aligns with this approach.
Legislation and Beyond
Dozens of bills were introduced by lawmakers in the 2023 legislative session, although few advanced beyond discussion. For example, a bill that would have imposed specific obligations on California employers to evaluate the impact of automated employment decision tools, though it did not pass, might be reintroduced in future legislative sessions. Employers should monitor developments in this area. Similarly, a bill in Washington, D.C., has reappeared and, although less restrictive than previous versions, still focuses on prohibiting discriminatory actions taken by AI tools in employment decisions. Expect similar bills to emerge in various statehouses in 2024.
As these state and local measures continue to evolve, it’s imperative for employers to stay vigilant and proactive in their approach to AI in employment decisions. While we’ve covered the guidance, regulations, and laws that are in place or emerging, it’s important to understand the practical implications and best practices for employers in this AI-driven landscape.
Balancing Innovation with Compliance
Employers understand that AI can significantly enhance the efficiency and precision of various aspects of the employment process. It offers the potential for substantial gains in terms of speed and accuracy. However, it’s equally important to strike a balance between leveraging AI for its capabilities while also ensuring that the technology aligns with legal requirements and maintains fairness and non-discrimination in employment decisions.
Scoring and predictive analysis represent areas where AI can significantly benefit employment decisions. Many employers are inundated with vast amounts of factual data about their workers, but they often struggle with synthesizing this data effectively. AI tools can provide solutions by assessing an individual’s criminal history and determining recidivism rates, offering insights into the likelihood of reoffending or committing future crimes. Similarly, AI can analyze an individual’s credit history, evaluating the risk based on unsecured debt, mortgages, student loans, and medical bills. It can also examine public records to explain gaps in an individual’s history.
While the benefits of scoring and predictive analysis are evident, there are potential pitfalls. Predictive analysis, especially in the context of criminal recidivism, has faced scrutiny for its accuracy and potential bias. AI models assessing recidivism have been found to be incorrect, particularly for black criminal offenders, highlighting the “bias in, bias out” nature of AI data models. Furthermore, the belief that scoring is impartial can lead to detachment from the human implications of machine-born decisions. From a compliance perspective, the EEOC mandates assessing if predictive analysis or scoring causes a disparate impact. Additionally, from an FTC or CFPB perspective, mechanisms must be created for individuals to challenge and dispute adverse information produced by AI.
Aside from scoring and predictive analysis, the background check industry is considering various ways to use AI to enhance the employment screening process:


Background Check Accuracy: AI could enhance the accuracy of background checks. It may be used to verify identities by matching personal identifiers, helping verify credentials, and conducting geographic analysis to help narrow an individual’s location at the time of a purported crime.
Adjudication Analysis: AI can create continuous learning models for adjudication decisions. By analyzing past adjudication decisions and feedback from human adjudicators, AI can spot patterns and trends that influence decisions.
Quality Improvement: One of the most valuable applications of AI in background checks is the analysis of information disputed by candidates. AI may help identify trends and areas of improvement, leading to higher-quality background reports.


Transparency and Compliance
Transparency and compliance with evolving regulations are paramount. To navigate this terrain successfully, employers should focus on the following five factors:


Transparency: Employers must ensure transparency when implementing AI in their processes. Providing clear and understandable communication to candidates about the use of AI in decision-making is crucial. Candidates should be informed about how their data will be used and how decisions will be made. Transparency builds trust and enables individuals to make informed choices.
Accountability: Employers should establish accountability for AI-driven decisions. This means taking responsibility for the outcomes and actions of automated systems. Understanding the factors that influence AI decisions and being ready to explain or rectify any discrepancies is essential.
Auditing: Regular audits of AI systems can help identify and rectify bias or unintended discrimination. Employers should consider third-party audits to ensure impartiality.
Bias Mitigation: Employers must actively work on minimizing bias in AI models. This includes continuous monitoring, refining algorithms, and ensuring that the data used to train AI systems is representative and diverse.
Fairness and Equal Treatment: Employers should strive for fairness and equal treatment throughout the hiring and employment lifecycle. This includes conducting fair background checks, providing equal opportunities, and ensuring that AI does not lead to unlawful discrimination.


The use of AI in employment decisions is rapidly evolving, and employers must adapt while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. As we look to the future, technology will continue to transform how we make employment decisions. However, the responsibility lies with employers to embrace these changes while upholding the principles of fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination. In a world where technology and human values intersect, the key to success is to harness the power of AI to enhance processes while keeping human ethics at the forefront of decision-making. By achieving this balance, employers can navigate the complex legal landscape and make better, more informed employment decisions.

Unleashing a New Era of Work, with Generative AIAlan Connolly and Maciej Kafel31 Oct 2023 
FacebookTwitterLinkedin
Generative AI within the workplace isn’t just innovation, it is a whole new way of working. Whilst the technology has been around for some time, it hasn’t been so readily available to everyone across the workplace, and it has caused a paradigm shift transforming the very foundation of how we work, collaborate, and perform our daily tasks, promising a future rich in creativity, innovation, and peak performance.
Generative AI is fundamentally changing the way we work. It is poised to create a future of work where human and artificial intelligence work as one to achieve extraordinary outcomes.​
The onus is now on businesses to harness the opportunities the technology presents whilst also understanding its implications on security, data, and people, and to truly rethink new ways of working to fully maximize the benefits.
In less than a year since ChatGPT’s release, generative AI is now discussed in almost every boardroom – the Capgemini Research Institute recently found that 96% of organizations say generative AI is on their agenda – and most are optimistic about its benefits. The next step is to turn optimism into action, and the workplace is at the epicenter of this change.
Hyper-personalization: A game-changer
In the era of generative AI, the workplace will no longer be a one-size-fits-all environment. It’s a dynamic space where services and experiences are tailored to individual preferences, work patterns, and communication styles.
With the ability to analyze colossal amounts of data, Generative AI can create a unique work environment for everyone, allowing new ways of working and opportunities for businesses to rethink the modern workplace. This hyper-personalization redefines digital engagement, collaboration, and personal performance, and transforms how we learn, develop, and perform.
Imagine AI-powered virtual assistants that understand your unique work style and dynamically optimize workflows accordingly.
Or what if you could experience personalized learning paths designed around your unique strengths and weaknesses, providing you with the precise skills you need to excel in ways that work for you so that knowledge and retention are at their maximum.
This augmented human experience shifts the focus towards innovation and creativity, makes work more enriching.
The performance renaissance
Generative AI is not just enhancing personalization; it’s redefining productivity and more excitingly it will have a transformational impact on personal performance. By integrating AI co-pilots into everyday applications, mundane tasks are automated, time is optimized, and errors are minimized. This allows employees to focus on the strategic and creative aspects of their jobs, thereby boosting their performance to new heights.
With performance enhancement copilots such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, employees now have the ability to take their performance to the next level, to be more expressive and impactful in their presentations, more creative and efficient when producing documentation, more analytical across large complex datasets, and more resourceful when engaging with communications channels such as email and instant messaging.
The transformation is all-encompassing, extending to frontline workers as well. AI copilots can optimize the performance of various professionals, from doctors to retail workers. For instance, retail assistants could leverage AI copilots that analyze customer behavior, preferences, and past purchases to provide personalized shopping experiences.
These AI-powered applications can streamline tasks, provide real-time insights, and enable frontline workers to deliver unparalleled service, thereby transforming their roles and enhancing their productivity.
Operational excellence: The new norm
Beyond enhancing workplace personalization and productivity, generative AI is fast becoming the bedrock of operational efficiency, ensuring organizations remain relevant and sustainable.
For example, AI chatbots empower customer service agents to deliver rapid and superior solutions. Agents can be trained to provide better responses, reduce issue resolution times, and gain easy access to information during customer interactions.
The impact extends to the onboarding of new colleagues who can quickly become as effective as senior agents. This not only improves service quality, but also customer perception. Agents have the ability to not only respond, but also to train AI models, further improving data quality and value.
Generative AI’s impact extends to every layer of support, from foundational operations to knowledge management, streamlining processes and reducing the burden on employees.
Our point of view – The Generative AI imperative
The advent of generative AI has ushered in a new era, ready to transform industries across the spectrum. With pace come challenges, and organizations must tread carefully, considering the ethical and social implications of AI. Privacy, security, bias mitigation, accountability, and digital inclusion should all be integral to integrating AI in all its forms across your business.
To harness the transformative potential of generative AI and reinvent the employee experience, a human-centered approach is paramount. Organizations must prioritize the needs and aspirations of their employees, engage in collaborative AI co-creation, and respect individual values and preferences.
Generative AI is not a distant wave but a powerful tide reshaping the employee experience. The extent to which an organization participates will define its future in the ever-evolving market. It’s not a race to be the fastest; it’s a commitment to being in the game, adapting to change or risking obsolescence.
In conclusion, the dawn of generative AI is an inspiring, exciting, and transformative event. It’s about unleashing a whole new way of working, enabling people to be more creative, innovative, and efficient in their roles.

  How to use AI to innovate




Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its presence felt across many industries—and the accounting profession is no exception. While 51% of accounting professionals believe that ChatGPT and generative AI should be applied to tax, accounting, and audit work, opinions are divided about the usefulness of AI tools.
One of the primary concerns centers on how AI will affect accounting jobs and the career outlook for tax professionals. While AI is undeniably changing the face of the industry, it also holds positive implications for the future of accounting.
How is AI affecting accounting?
A growing interest in artificial intelligence is leading more firms to stake an investment in its potential. A Thomson Reuters survey found that 1 in 10 accounting and tax professionals are currently using ChatGPT/generative AI or planning to integrate these technologies into their operations.
Although the adoption rate for AI remains relatively low, the growth potential is high. AI is reshaping the way the industry functions by allowing accounting professionals to work more efficiently and at a faster pace. Some of the most notable impacts include:

Data collection and analysis
Tax research and optimization
Strategic planning and forecasting
Streamlining back-end operations

As an evolving technology, AI is far from perfect, and it still lacks certain capabilities. While the latest version of ChatGPT passed a practice CPA exam, AI primarily remains a tool for aiding accountants and tax professionals, rather than a substitute for human expertise.
Is AI replacing accounting jobs?
Concerns about AI replacing accounting jobs are certainly valid. However, that isn’t happening yet, and it’s debatable whether it will happen at all. The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs Report suggests that the jobs least likely to be lost to artificial intelligence include ones that require “human skills such as judgment, creativity, physical dexterity, and emotional intelligence.”
Accountants must be able to think logically to make informed decisions, use their creativity to find solutions for clients, and communicate effectively with everyone in their professional sphere.
There’s still no direct evidence that accountants are losing jobs to AI, though hiring for back-office roles could be affected as more tasks become automated. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ occupational outlook for accountants and auditors over the next decade calls for the field to increase by 4%—compared with a 3% average growth rate for all occupations.
What is AI automating in accounting?
AI is a web of connected technologies that accountants can use to automate mundane tasks that are essential to day-to-day operations. In doing so, they’re positioned to have more time to dedicate to higher-level activities, such as nurturing client relationships.
Robotic process automation (RPA), for example, is software technology that’s designed to act as a complement to processes performed by a human. Robotic accounting is a form of RPA that relies on software “bots” to perform certain accounting tasks, such as:

Invoicing and account reconciliation
Cash flow reporting and forecasting
Budgeting and bookkeeping
Document management and audit support
Tax research and preparation
Compliance

The use of AI allows accountants to take more of a hands-off approach to these types of activities, without compromising on data security or accuracy. AI is often instrumental in helping to identify errors and improve the overall accuracy of financial statements and reports, while streamlining and standardizing workflows.

Can AI do accounting?
While accounting software and tax preparation programs increasingly include elements of AI, accounting remains largely a human process. Accounting professionals are, however, turning to AI to automate parts of the tax workflow, including manual data entry.
There’s also an opportunity for AI to offer an enhanced client experience. SurePrep, a recent Thomson Reuters acquisition, has created Do It Like Last Year (DILLY), an AI process that utilizes both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify documents. The technology is designed to do so even if the documents in question change—eliminating the need to sift through and carry over information from prior years and shortening the time frame for completing client returns.
Using AI to innovate
Developing a knowledge base about AI will help you understand what it can—and cannot—do to assist your firm, as well as help allay any fears you might have about accounting jobs being replaced by the technology.

        Are companies ready for generative AI?

            Most European financial services companies in a survey expect the technology to make an impact in short order, but not nearly as many have shored up training plans.

            By Bryan Strickland

Strategy and innovationTechnology and analytics



Nearly seven of ten European financial services companies recognise that the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) means a significant portion of their workforce soon will require training, but nearly eight of ten admit their plans for training are, at best, in their infancy.
Responding to the EY European Financial Services AI Survey earlier this month, 77% of executives at 60 financial institutions across Europe said they expect GenAI — technology that can use existing data to generate new content like text, photos, and videos — to affect their company's operations.
Sixty-eight per cent believe that up to one-quarter of their workforce will require related training and upskilling in the next six to 12 months. However, 77% said plans for that training are barely off the ground (35% said there are no plans in place; 42% said plans are ""in their infancy"").
The potential positive impact of GenAI has reached the doorstep — 60% of respondents said their organisation has actively invested in the last six to 12 months, and 75% expect even more spending in the next six to 12 months — but preparations for putting GenAI to work aren't matching that pace.
""Europe's financial leaders are investing in AI technologies, targeting increased productivity, customer benefits, and operational efficiencies. However, the challenge of enabling the workforce to realise and capitalise on potential gains requires in-depth, long-term planning, which is not yet in full force,"" said Ayman Awada, Financial Services Technology Consulting Leader for EY in Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa.
""GenAI technologies and the potential of their applications continue to evolve rapidly. Financial services leaders must ensure that they are adopting a strategic mindset as they manage their investment, both in new technologies and their people. Bringing together the best of human-driven insight, with the breadth of GenAI capabilities, will be fundamental to successful GenAI integration,"" Awada said.
The EY survey was released the same week that CPA.com, the business and technology subsidiary of AICPA, released its GenAI toolkit aimed at equipping accounting and finance professionals.
Participating leaders in the EY survey cited their top concern as limited understanding and experience with GenAI applications and their impact across the workforce (36%).
Although some organisations are off schedule on plans for getting the workforce up to speed on GenAI, a portion are mapping out a new model for the workforce of the future. Thirty-five per cent of executives said they plan to integrate AI training within their graduate programmes, and 25% are planning a more widespread restructuring of roles and responsibilities across entry-level positions.
Survey respondents most often cited an innovative and interdisciplinary mindset and a tech-savvy and experimental approach as the top attributes they will target when recruiting entry-level talent for a GenAI-enabled workforce.

  A research paper released today describes ways generative AI can assist one of the most complex engineering efforts: designing semiconductors.
The work demonstrates how companies in highly specialized fields can train large language models (LLMs) on their internal data to build assistants that increase productivity.
Few pursuits are as challenging as semiconductor design. Under a microscope, a state-of-the-art chip like an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU (above) looks like a well-planned metropolis, built with tens of billions of transistors, connected on streets 10,000x thinner than a human hair.
Multiple engineering teams coordinate for as long as two years to construct one of these digital megacities.
Some groups define the chip’s overall architecture, some craft and place a variety of ultra-small circuits, and others test their work. Each job requires specialized methods, software programs and computer languages.
A Broad Vision for LLMs
“I believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,” said Mark Ren, an NVIDIA Research director and lead author on the paper.
Bill Dally, NVIDIA’s chief scientist, announced the paper today in a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, an annual gathering of hundreds of engineers working in the field called electronic design automation, or EDA.
“This effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,” said Dally at the event in San Francisco. “It shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.”
ChipNeMo Surfaces
The paper details how NVIDIA engineers created for their internal use a custom LLM, called ChipNeMo, trained on the company’s internal data to generate and optimize software and assist human designers.
Long term, engineers hope to apply generative AI to each stage of chip design, potentially reaping significant gains in overall productivity, said Ren, whose career spans more than 20 years in EDA.
After surveying NVIDIA engineers for possible use cases, the research team chose three to start: a chatbot, a code generator and an analysis tool.
Initial Use Cases
The latter — a tool that automates the time-consuming tasks of maintaining updated descriptions of known bugs — has been the most well-received so far.
A prototype chatbot that responds to questions about GPU architecture and design helped many engineers quickly find technical documents in early tests.
A code generator will help designers write software for a chip design.
A code generator in development (demonstrated above)  already creates snippets of about 10-20 lines of software in two specialized languages chip designers use. It will be integrated with existing tools, so engineers have a handy assistant for designs in progress.
Customizing AI Models With NVIDIA NeMo
The paper mainly focuses on the team’s work gathering its design data and using it to create a specialized generative AI model, a process portable to any industry.
As its starting point, the team chose a foundation model and customized it with NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models that’s included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. The selected NeMo model sports 43 billion parameters, a measure of its capability to understand patterns. It was trained using more than a trillion tokens, the words and symbols in text and software.
ChipNeMo provides an example of how one deeply technical team refined a pretrained model with its own data.
The team then refined the model in two training rounds, the first using about 24 billion tokens worth of its internal design data and the second on a mix of about 130,000 conversation and design examples.
The work is among several examples of research and proofs of concept of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, just beginning to emerge from the lab.
Sharing Lessons Learned
One of the most important lessons Ren’s team learned is the value of customizing an LLM.
On chip-design tasks, custom ChipNeMo models with as few as 13 billion parameters match or exceed performance of even much larger general-purpose LLMs like LLaMA2 with 70 billion parameters. In some use cases, ChipNeMo models were dramatically better.
Along the way, users need to exercise care in what data they collect and how they clean it for use in training, he added.
Finally, Ren advises users to stay abreast of the latest tools that can speed and simplify the work.
NVIDIA Research has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide focused on topics such as AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics. Other recent projects in semiconductors include using AI to design smaller, faster circuits and to optimize placement of large blocks.
Enterprises looking to build their own custom LLMs can get started today using NeMo framework available from GitHub and NVIDIA NGC catalog.

Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to save $243.5 billion in production capacity across Indonesia, according to Access Partnership’s The Economic Impact of Generative AI: The Future of Work in Indonesia report.
“The new generation of AI, which is generative AI, helps us to interact with data in new ways,” said Dharma Simorangkir, president director of Microsoft Indonesia. “From summarising text and detecting anomalies to recognising image, its natural language interface allows us to interact with this technology using everyday language, and its ability as a reasoning engine helps us identify patterns and draw insights much faster.”
The Microsoft-funded report also detailed three aspects that require attention, including improving access to and use of AI, managing its risk and encouraging further innovation. According to Microsoft Indonesia, AI needs to continue to be democratised so that new skills can be mastered such as prompting, analytical evaluation and problem solving.
To manage risk, Microsoft will continue to raise awareness of responsible AI usage such as through its Responsible AI Impact Assessment report.
“In a democratic society, one of our fundamental principles is that no one is immune to the law,” said Ajar Edi, director of government affairs at Microsoft Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam. “That’s why we feel it’s appropriate for regulators and policymakers to increase oversight and consider new laws and regulations. We will continue to actively participate by sharing our experiences and insights on responsible AI practices.”
Meanwhile, Microsoft will collaborate with the government and private sector to protect and encourage innovation through the use of AI. It will also drive innovation through its AI Customer Commitments, including the Copilot Copyright Commitment.
“AI can help people focus on essential elements of their tasks, not replace them,” said Simorangkir. “Because, after all, AI can only work with data provided by humans, and is developed to improve human competence.”

 On October 30, 2023, President Biden issued an “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” to address the growing concerns surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The 111-page document identifies several areas of concern with the use of AI, including labor, competition, cybersecurity, education, health, and privacy. The order not only calls on federal agencies to work collaboratively, provide more guidance, and conduct training, but it also urges agencies to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers.
Here are some of the key directives from the executive order:

Orders the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction with outside entities such as labor unions, to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers by addressing job displacement, labor standards, workplace equity, health, and safety, and data collection. Once these best practices are identified, the agencies are expected to adopt these guidelines, to the extent feasible, in their programs. A fact sheet, which was issued before the executive order was released, explains that “[t]hese principles and best practices will benefit workers by providing guidance to prevent employers from undercompensating workers, evaluating job applications unfairly, or impinging on workers’ ability to organize.”


Orders the Secretary of Labor to issue guidance emphasizing that employers must ensure that employees are appropriately compensated for all hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act when using AI tools to monitor or augment employees’ work. Significantly, this marks the first time that the Biden administration has shown any interest in AI-related concerns in the wage and hour context.


Directs the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to produce a report regarding AI’s potential impacts on the labor market, and directs the Secretary of Labor to submit a report identifying options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions caused by AI.


Directs the U.S. Department of Justice to increase coordination with federal civil rights offices on AI and algorithmic discrimination issues, “improve external stakeholder engagement to promote public awareness of potential discriminatory uses and effects of AI; and develop, as appropriate, additional training, technical assistance, guidance, or other resources[.]”


Instructs the Director of the National Science Foundation to “prioritize available resources to support AI-related education and AI-related workforce development through existing programs.”


Encourages the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether to use its existing authorities, including the agency’s rulemaking authority, “to ensure fair competition in the AI marketplace and to ensure that consumers and workers are protected from harms that may be enabled by the use of AI.”


Creates a White House AI Council to help coordinate the efforts of the various agencies to ensure the effective formation and implementation of policies related to AI, including those contained within the executive order.

The executive order puts the onus on the federal agencies to achieve the goals articulated for them. Most agencies will have anywhere from 30 to 365 days to fulfill their respective requirements as outlined in the document.
Even though the executive order is largely focused on the federal workforce, private entities are still affected. For example, companies that develop (or intend to develop) AI tools for the federal government are required to provide the government certain information, reports, and records. Additionally, the executive order leverages the federal government’s pocketbook, as one of the largest purchasers of technology, to ensure the compliance of private companies. These federal procurement procedures provide a method for federal agencies to regulate AI indirectly.
The new executive order continues the approach the Biden administration initially laid out in its “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in October 2022 and Executive Order 13985, which directed agencies to combat algorithmic discrimination and enforce existing laws to protect rights and safety. The new executive order is also the byproduct of continued cooperation with many leading AI companies. In 2023, the White House announced that it had secured voluntary commitments from 15 of the leading AI companies to control the risks posed by AI.
The new executive order also reflects the Biden administration’s “whole of government” approach to aggressively promote a pro-union agenda across the entire spectrum of the government. This “whole of government” approach has relied on executive orders, interagency task forces, councils, interagency agreements, individual agency actions such as rulemaking and enforcement strategies, attempts to influence Congress, and a variety of other means to achieve a pro-union agenda. The new executive order continues this approach. Most notably, the fact sheet that was released before the executive order identifies the dangers of increased workplace surveillance, bias, and job displacement and then explains that mitigating these risks must involve supporting “workers’ ability to bargain collectively.” One of the eight “guiding principles and priorities” of the executive order is explicitly pro-union: “The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers. As AI creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.” In addition, the executive order’s fact sheet emphasizes that the Biden administration’s response to the risks of using AI entails instructing agencies to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms, including if AI tools impinge “on workers’ ability to organize.”
Because the executive order urges agencies to develop AI principles and best practices, employers should stay alert to new guidance and regulations that could affect business operations.

What are people asking about artificial intelligence? What are the most burning questions? What concerns people about A.I.?

As an independent career and executive coach, this is becoming increasingly important to me, because it is to my clients – and now to readers. So I embarked on a journey to find out. During the period of September 26 through October 25, 2023, I aggregated 10 independent surveys and conducted an informal one myself. I then ran this by a long-time colleague of mine, Brad McDaniels, a statistician and data analyst. Therefore, my report is not scientific. For all intents and purposes, this could wind up amounting to no more than another Top 10 list, but it is, I’m confident, a relevant and reliable snapshot of what matters as of today. Note: No answers are offered; this is simply to explore what people want to know.


What people want to know about A.I.: Top 10 questions
The questions appear in bold, followed by my comments.

#10 What are the top A.I. companies in the world?
That’s not a great question, but it’s on every list. In tech, especially tech on steroids, which is what A.I. is, that will change quickly. To get a feel for the current market, OK, but tomorrow’s another day.

PROMOTED
#9 What is deep learning?
If you’re asking this question, you’re most likely in for the duration, but still wet behind the ears. It’s a good question, though, and will serve as a strong foundation.

#8 What is natural language processing (NLP)?
Same story as the previous question.
#7 Will robotics kill jobs or create them?
This tells me there is a real acceptance of A.I., but an uncertainty about the near future. If history is our guide, large-scale technology transformations or disruptions create jobs – and lots of them.

#6 A.I. in gaming and sports betting.
It’s too early to tell if this question means that a lot of people are about to lose their shirts or to start new careers in online gambling.

#5 What is artificial intelligence?
The fact that this question is still so high on the list suggests strongly that we’re still at the early part of the early adopter stage of the innovation-adoption cycle. Maybe not even out of the innovators stage.
#4 What role will A.I. play in health care?
Good question to ask – and to keep asking. There’s so much potential to eradicate diseases, test drugs on computer chips instead of animals or humans, etc. But think of the possible misuse or abuse.
 #3 A.I. in self-driving cars?
This is probably one of the three questions that are closest to home. Many people can taste it. In fact, if your can self-park or keep you in lane, you’ve already got a piece of it.
#2 A.I. in investment and finance.
This isone of the other close-to-home question. I sense that many people see A.I. as the route to wealth they haven’t yet had. I also think they should curb their enthusiasm. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs don’t
And the #1question about A.I….
#1 A.I. and the future of work.
Obviously, the thirds close-to-home question. For some, it; about the future of work, but it’s really about a future that is already here.
One more thing: There’s a missing question that should be obvious by its absence:

America’s diversity has always been our nation’s greatest strength and we must continue to leverage capabilities from all people. People with disabilities have long strengthened our economy and expanded our Nation’s possibilities.
The growing popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening new doors that are enhancing the work capabilities and performance for persons with disabilities. In recognition of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, the Department of Commerce hosted a panel discussion on the intersectionality of AI and neurodiversity and the impact of AI on hiring persons with disabilities as well as promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility by all employees.
During the discussion, panelists stressed how AI can shape careers and improve day to day learning through neurodivergence, machine learning, and technology.
Panelist and Chief Information Officer André Mendes commented that some of the most significant contributions in fields like science, technology, and the performing arts have been given to us by individuals with neurodivergent characteristics.
“Humanity is a spectrum, and that spectrum applies to all of us,” said Mr.  Mendes. “Some of us have challenges that do not fit the norm. However, we all have intersectionality, and we all are more than our job.”
Panelist Victoria Houed, Director of AI Policy and Strategy at the Department of Commerce’s Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, commented on the importance of making data more accessible to persons with disabilities, particularly among unrepresented communities.
“As a black woman, it is important to me to be the voice in the room and get data into the hands of unrepresented communities and people that are just different than the stereotypical community,” she said.
Ms. Elham Tabassi, NIST Associate Director for Emerging Technologies, participated in the panel discussion and stressed that AI systems can serve all people and that it is a shared responsibility for all of us.
“We have a responsibility to make sure our technologies are fair and just,” said Ms. Tabassi. “When we increase the diversity of thoughts and thought process, magic happens.”
Ms. Tabassi was nominated by Time Magazine as one of the most influential people in AI.
Making Commerce services, science, and data more accessible is a top priority for several agencies within Commerce that are utilizing AI to complete their missions. The inventory of Commerce AI Use Cases shows how AI is enhancing the department’s mission and promoting the use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Federal Government.
The mission of the Department of Commerce is to help create economic opportunities for all communities, including people with disabilities. Internal to that goal is hiring and retaining more people with disabilities. At 10.9% percent, Commerce falls below the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission (EEOC) benchmark for federal agencies to have 12% of their total workforce made up of people with disabilities. Yet, at 2.49 percent, Commerce exceeds the EEOC benchmark to have two percent of their workforce be made of up people with targeted disabilities which include persons with blindness, mobility impairments, or are deaf and hard of hearing.
The Biden Administration and the Commerce Department are committed to the equality and diversity of all Americans and creating a workplace and an economy that works for all Americans.

Generative AI Ethics

Generative AI is revolutionizing our creative landscape, unlocking unprecedented possibilities. But at what cost? Dive into the ethical dilemmas of this transformative technology, exploring the fine line between innovation and ethical consideration. 
2022 was a huge year for Generative AI. The release of DALL-E 2 in April showed the public the possibilities of text-to-image Gen AI, while the real game changer arrived in November with the launch of ChatGPT. Both AI-powered tools are developed by OpenAI and have quickly gained attention from the mainstream media and social media because of the incredible possibilities offered and the ease of use. Their human-like output has opened exciting doors in various creative fields but also steered in a host of ethical challenges that society must navigate. 
One of the primary differences between more traditional AI and Generative AI is that the latter can create novel output that appears to be generated by humans. Read the high-impact use cases across six major industries by Deloitte AI Institute.
This opens up exciting opportunities in creative industries and poses some ethical challenges. Let’s have a look at them. 
Is Generative AI ethical? 
The answer is: That it depends! Gen AI has the potential to enhance and elevate human creativity, helping artists find their unique style and creating art in virtually any form, from poetry to music, from digital art to 3D models.  
Research in Generative AI has been going on since the 1950s but has gained popularity just very recently; for this reason, there is still a concerning lack of regulations surrounding it. We must quickly address the ethical issues posed by Gen AI and embed it in our society sustainably. 
Why Gen AI poses a serious issue of copyright violations
Many digital artists are fervently complaining against Generative AI tools like Midjourney and DALL-E, which are able to create in seconds what takes them hours and hours of hard work and years of practice. And some of them are even taking legal action for copyright infringement. The problem lies in the datasets used to train these models: hundreds of thousands of digital artworks are used for training Gen AI without the artists’ consent and knowledge. With DALL-E and other tools, it is even possible to create content by copying the style of a particular artist, posing a serious plagiarism issue.  
But the issues regarding copyright don’t end here. Another important question still open to debate is whether content created by Gen AI should be eligible for copyright protection. Many countries currently don’t consider AI-generated artworks to apply to copyright protection requirements because they do not result from human creativity. However, what if such artworks entail substantial human involvement? In this case, they could be eligible for copyright protection, but it is not so simple to determine who should be the owner. There are three different possibilities: 

AI itself is the creator of the work, in which case the AI owner would have the copyright. 
AI model’s human programmer is the creator, in which case the programmer would be the copyright owner. 
Humans who prepared the AI model’s training data are the creators and copyright owners.

Data privacy violations concerns for Gen AI 
In April 2023, the Italian Data Protection Authority temporarily blocked ChatGPT in the country because of privacy violation concerns. Even though the tool has been restored in Italy after a month, those concerns remain valid, and experts worldwide are still examining the question. 
What privacy concerns does ChatGPT pose? 
Generative AI large language models are trained on data sets that sometimes include personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals. Read the article- Generative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns.
Compared to traditional search engines, this data can be elicited more simply while at the same time being more difficult to locate and request removal. To comply with privacy laws, companies building and training the models must ensure that PII isn’t embedded in the language models and that it’s easy to remove it upon request.

Is Generative AI going to steal our jobs? 
This is perhaps the most asked question since the advent of automation and Artificial Intelligence, and the fear has grown exponentially bigger with the boom of Generative AI trends in the last year. The ethics of human replacement by algorithms and machines is a topic that must be discussed if we want to ensure the sustainable and positive development of these advanced technologies. 
Responses to the issue of unemployment from AI have ranged from the alarmed to the optimistic. What is clear is that the effect of Artificial Intelligence on the market will be disruptive and require huge abilities to adapt. Companies and professionals need to be ready to not be made superfluous and obsolete by the upcoming AI revolution. 
Why it’s important to discuss ethical concerns regarding Generative AI right now? 
Gen AI is an extremely powerful tool able to transform your business, optimize costs and increase efficiency in the workplace. To avoid being left behind and be able to thrive in an ever-changing environment, businesses need to leverage generative AI solutions, invest in new technologies and take the leap towards digitalization. 
But Gen AI also poses major ethical concerns and risks regarding privacy, copyright, and human replacement. Those risks require a comprehensive approach, including a clearly defined strategy, good governance, and a commitment to responsible AI. Generative AI shouldn’t be seen as a threat to human creativity or a competitor but instead as a powerful ally to open up possibilities that weren’t even considered possible. 
Generative AI FAQs


What is Generative AI, and how does it relate to human creativity? 
Gen AI is a type of Machine Learning able to produce human-like content. It is extremely valuable in creative industries, as it can support artists in generating texts, images, music, video, and other media. 



What are the key ethical concerns surrounding Gen AI in the context of creativity? 
The key ethical concerns surrounding Generative AI in creative fields are mainly related to intellectual property rights, ownership, and privacy. There is also a major concern about the possibility that the use of Generative AI in creativity could lead to the loss of jobs for human creators and the devaluation of their skills and expertise.

Is Generative AI genuinely creative or mimicking human creativity? 
According to MIT Technology Review, Generative AI is becoming better and better at mimicking human creativity, but this does not necessarily indicate that it is actually developing this ability, which seems to remain uniquely human for the present moment. To quote Ryan Burnell, senior research associate at the Alan Turing Institute: 
“Proving that machines can perform well in tasks designed for measuring creativity in humans doesn’t demonstrate that they’re capable of anything approaching original thought.” 

How does Generative AI affect creative job markets? 
It is unclear what kind of impact Gen AI will have on the creative industries and the creative job markets. Machines shouldn’t be seen as a threat stealing humans’ jobs but rather as a powerful ally able to enhance human creativity and support artists in their work. 

What are the pros and cons of using Generative AI in creative fields? 
The main pros are: 

Efficiency: Gen AI is much faster than humans, creating artwork in a couple of seconds or minutes. 
Versatility: Gen AI can range across all kinds of media (audio, image, text, video, 3D). 


Cost-effectiveness: Using generative AI can be cost-effective as it reduces the need for hiring additional staff or freelancers for creative projects. 

Cons of using Generative AI in creative fields are: 

Limited creativity: Generative AI mimics human creativity, but it is limited by the data used for its training. 
Lack of human touch: Gen AI lacks the empathy and sensitivity of humans, which may result in weaker art. 
Ethical concerns: all the ethical issues we have explored in this article are risks companies should be aware of when employing Gen AI.

Faculty members have been slower than students to adopt artificial intelligence tools in the last year, despite the buzz across academia about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, according to a new report released today.
Nearly half of college students are using AI tools this fall, but fewer than a quarter (22 percent) of faculty members use them, the report from Tyton Partners finds. The study, sponsored by Turnitin, was conducted in September and included roughly 1,600 students and 1,000 faculty members across more than 600 institutions. 
On AI, “students seem to be more curious about it than instructors, and those using it daily are using it in and out of schools; that made us think it might be ubiquitous moving forward,” said Cathy Shaw, a director at Tyton. “The differential between student use and instructor use will be one to watch.”

Faculty members who are familiar with AI acknowledge the importance of the technology: 75 percent of those regular AI users said they believe students will need to know how to use generative AI in a professional setting in order to succeed.
Despite that, the faculty is taking its time with both adoption and setting policy, the report found.
“I read it less as, ‘I’m resistant, this isn’t my job,’ and I interpret it as, ‘I’m still learning how to use the tool,’” Shaw said.











Generative AI was just inching into academic conversations following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Tyton, an advising firm focused on the “global knowledge sector,” initially polled faculty and students about the technology in March. The study released today provides an update on the fast-changing landscape of AI in academia. Tyton plans to release another update on generative AI usage in spring 2024.
Student and Faculty AI Use
Generative AI use, however low, increased by both students and faculty over the last year, the study found. This spring, just 9 percent of faculty members used AI writing tools, but by this fall that had risen to 22 percent.
Students had a higher adoption rate from the start, and that has increased over time. In spring 2023, 27 percent of students were using AI writing tools, and by the fall, that had jumped to 49 percent. The study defined “adoption” as daily, weekly or monthly usage of generative AI products.











For students, the applications for generative AI writing tools varied depending on how often they used the technology. Daily users’ top use of AI was summarizing or paraphrasing text, followed by organizing their schedule and answering homework questions. For nondaily users (using it weekly or monthly), the top use was understanding difficult concepts, followed by summarizing or paraphrasing text and assisting with writing assignments.
For the faculty members who do use AI, the top use (43 percent) was running prompts through an AI tool to “see” what their students see, with faculty assuming students are running their own prompts. More than a third (35 percent) of faculty members use the tools to teach students how to effectively use generative AI writing tools, and nearly one-third (29 percent) are using the tools to create more engaging, in-class activities.
While other experts have called for policies, or, at the very least, AI advisory boards, to set standards, the study found that students would keep using ChatGPT or other generative AI tools even if they were banned.



According to the study, the majority of students that identify as AI “users” (75 percent) said if their instructor or institution banned generative AI writing tools, they would be at least “somewhat likely” to continue using the tools. Half of students that were “non-users” also stated they would be somewhat likely to use the AI tools if they were banned.
Impact on the Workforce
The disconnect of faculty members believing AI will be important in the job market, while they themselves rarely use it in the classroom, was a standout finding of the report, according to Shaw. She said that next year, the spring study will most likely seek further details on why the faculty is hesitant to adopt generative AI writing tools.
The October report found that 75 percent of faculty members who use AI regularly say they believe students will need to know how to use the technology in a professional setting to succeed in the workforce. Nearly half of faculty members who are “non-regular” AI users, meaning they’ve only experimented with generative AI once or twice, reported a similar belief.
Students had less enthusiasm on AI’s impact at work. The study found that roughly one-third of “non-user” students believe they will need to know how to use the tools to succeed. More than half of students (55 percent) who use generative AI at least monthly believe they will need to know how to use these tools in future workplaces.
“There’s a popular quote: ‘It’s not AI that will take my job, it’s someone who knows how to use AI,’” Shaw said.
Attitudes and Policies
Initial faculty attitudes on the impact of generative AI on work and academic performance have become more positive over the last six months. In the spring of 2023, half of faculty members said they believed generative AI writing tools would have a negative impact on student learning, with that number dropping to 39 percent in fall 2023.
Student opinions on AI’s impact on learning remained largely the same from the spring to this fall. About 26 percent of students said generative AI would have a negative impact on learning, up from 22 percent in the spring.
Despite the increased use among faculty and students, institutions varied on implementing systemwide policies.



About a third (32 percent) of private, four-year institutions rely on instructors to set their own policy, although more than a quarter (26 percent) have institutionwide policies. Public four-year institutions are split on policies: 28 percent say policies at the institution have been set, 25 percent say they do not know if there are any policies and 21 percent said no policies were made at their institution.
Meanwhile, public two-year institutions have the lowest rate of policy adoption: 52 percent said they do not have a policy or do not know if they have a policy.
“It’s concerning, especially since community college is all about access and equity and often preparing students for work,” Shaw said. “[Policy] needs to be more front and center, which is where institution leaders and technology providers can have an opportunity to be the bridge.”
