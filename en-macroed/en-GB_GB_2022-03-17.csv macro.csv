He’s also a senior scientist at Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company that focuses on finding drug treatments for rare diseases. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.This paper seems to flip your normal work on its head. Tell me about what you do in your day-to-day job.Primarily, my job is to implement new machine learning models in the area of drug discovery. A large fraction of these machine learning models that we use are meant to predict toxicity. No matter what kind of drug you’re trying to develop, you need to make sure that they’re not going to be toxic. If it turns out that you have this wonderful drug that lowers blood pressure fantastically, but it hits one of these really important, say, heart channels — then basically, it’s a no-go because that’s just too dangerous.So then, why did you do this study on biochemical weapons? What was the spark? We got an invite to the Convergence conference by the Swiss Federal Institute for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection, Spiez Laboratory. The idea of the conference is to inform the community at large of new developments with tools that may have implications for the Chemical/Biological Weapons Convention.We got this invite to talk about machine learning and how it can be misused in our space. It’s something we never really thought about before. But it was just very easy to realize that as we’re building these machine learning models to get better and better at predicting toxicity in order to avoid toxicity, all we have to do is sort of flip the switch around and say, “You know, instead of going away from toxicity, what if we do go toward toxicity?”Can you walk me through how you did that — moved the model to go toward toxicity?I’ll be a little vague with some details because we were told basically to withhold some of the specifics. Broadly, the way it works for this experiment is that we have a lot of datasets historically of molecules that have been tested to see whether they’re toxic or not.In particular, the one that we focus on here is VX. It is an inhibitor of what’s known as acetylcholinesterase. Whenever you do anything muscle-related, your neurons use acetylcholinesterase as a signal to basically say “go move your muscles.” The way VX is lethal is it actually stops your diaphragm, your lung muscles, from being able to move so your lungs become paralyzed. “Obviously, this is something you want to avoid.”Obviously, this is something you want to avoid. So historically, experiments have been done with different types of molecules to see whether they inhibit acetylcholinesterase. And so, we built up these large datasets of these molecular structures and how toxic they are.We can use these datasets in order to create a machine learning model, which basically learns what parts of the molecular structure are important for toxicity and which are not. Then we can give this machine learning model new molecules, potentially new drugs that maybe have never been tested before. And it will tell us this is predicted to be toxic, or this is predicted not to be toxic. This is a way for us to virtually screen very, very fast a lot of molecules and sort of kick out ones that are predicted to be toxic. In our study here, what we did is we inverted that, obviously, and we use this model to try to predict toxicity.The other key part of what we did here are these new generative models. We can give a generative model a whole lot of different structures, and it learns how to put molecules together. And then we can, in a sense, ask it to generate new molecules. Now it can generate new molecules all over the space of chemistry, and they’re just sort of random molecules. But one thing we can do is we can actually tell the generative model which direction we want to go. We do that by giving it a little scoring function, which gives it a high score if the molecules it generates are towards something we want. Instead of giving a low score to toxic molecules, we give a high score to toxic molecules. Now we see the model start producing all of these molecules, a lot of which look like VX and also like other chemical warfare agents.Tell me more about what you found. Did anything surprise you?We weren’t really sure what we were going to get. Our generative models are fairly new technologies. So we haven’t widely used them a lot. The biggest thing that jumped out at first was that a lot of the generated compounds were predicted to be actually more toxic than VX. And the reason that’s surprising is because VX is basically one of the most potent compounds known. Meaning you need a very, very, very little amount of it to be lethal. Now, these are predictions that we haven’t verified, and we certainly don’t want to verify that ourselves. But the predictive models are generally pretty good. So even if there’s a lot of false positives, we’re afraid that there are some more potent molecules in there.KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - FEBRUARY 26, 2017: Malaysia’s Police Forensic Team with the help of Fire Department and Atomic Energy Licensing Board swept the terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 for toxic chemicals after they announced on Friday, Kim Jong Nam was poisoned by VX nerve agent, which is listed as the most potent form of nerve agents known in chemical warfare. Photo by Rahman Roslan/Getty ImagesSecond, we actually looked at a lot of the structures of these newly generated molecules. And a lot of them did look like VX and other warfare agents, and we even found some that were generated from the model that were actual chemical warfare agents. These were generated from the model having never seen these chemical warfare agents. So we knew we were sort of in the right space here and that it was generating molecules that made sense because some of them had already been made before.For me, the concern was just how easy it was to do. A lot of the things we used are out there for free. You can go and download a toxicity dataset from anywhere. If you have somebody who knows how to code in Python and has some machine learning capabilities, then in probably a good weekend of work, they could build something like this generative model driven by toxic datasets. So that was the thing that got us really thinking about putting this paper out there; it was such a low barrier of entry for this type of misuse.Your paper says that by doing this work, you and your colleagues “have still crossed a gray moral boundary, demonstrating that it is possible to design virtual potential toxic molecules without much in the way of effort, time or computational resources. We can easily erase the thousands of molecules we created, but we cannot delete the knowledge of how to recreate them.” What was running through your head as you were doing this work?This was quite an unusual publication. We’ve been back and forth a bit about whether we should publish it or not. This is a potential misuse that didn’t take as much time to perform. And we wanted to get that information out since we really didn’t see it anywhere in the literature. We looked around, and nobody was really talking about it. But at the same time, we didn’t want to give the idea to bad actors.“Some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it”At the end of the day, we decided that we kind of want to get ahead of this. Because if it’s possible for us to do it, it’s likely that some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it or in the future is going to think about it. By then, our technology may have progressed even beyond what we can do now. And a lot of it’s just going to be open source — which I fully support: the sharing of science, the sharing of data, the sharing of models. But it’s one of these things where we, as scientists, should take care that what we release is done responsibly.How easy is it for someone to replicate what you did? What would they need?I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did. If you were to Google generative models, you could find a number of put-together one-liner generative models that people have released for free. And then, if you were to search for toxicity datasets, there’s a large number of open-source tox datasets. So if you just combine those two things, and then you know how to code and build machine learning models —  all that requires really is an internet connection and a computer — then, you could easily replicate what we did. And not just for VX, but for pretty much whatever other open-source toxicity datasets exist.“I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did.”Of course, it does require some expertise. If somebody were to put this together without knowing anything about chemistry, they would ultimately probably generate stuff that was not very useful. And there’s still the next step of having to get those molecules synthesized. Finding a potential drug or potential new toxic molecule is one thing; the next step of synthesis — actually creating a new molecule in the real world — would be another barrier. Right, there’s still some big leaps between what the AI comes up with and turning that into a real-world threat. What are the gaps there?The big gap to start with is that you really don’t know if these molecules are actually toxic or not. There’s going to be some amount of false positives. If we’re walking ourselves through what a bad agent would be thinking or doing, they would have to make a decision on which of these new molecules they would want to synthesize ultimately.As far as synthesis routes, this could be a make it or break it. If you find something that looks like a chemical warfare agent and try to get that synthesized, chances are it’s not going to happen. A lot of the chemical building blocks of these chemical warfare agents are well known and are watched. They’re regulated. But there’s so many synthesis companies. As long as it doesn’t look like a chemical warfare agent, they’re most likely going to just synthesize it and send it right back because who knows what the molecule is being used for, right?You get at this later in the paper, but what can be done to prevent this kind of misuse of AI? What safeguards would you like to see established? For context, there are more and more policies about data sharing. And I completely agree with it because it opens up more avenues for research. It allows other researchers to see your data and use it for their own research. But at the same time, that also includes things like toxicity datasets and toxicity models. So it’s a little hard to figure out a good solution for this problem. Members of Malaysia’s Hazmat team conduct a decontamination operation at the departures terminal of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 in Sepang on February 26, 2017. Kim Jong-Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, was killed at the airport on February 13. Malaysian police told the public they would do everything possible to ensure there was no risk from the lethal VX nerve agent used to assassinate Kim Jong-Nam. Photo by MANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP via Getty ImagesWe looked over towards Silicon Valley: there’s a group called OpenAI; they released a top-of-the-line language model called GPT-3. It’s almost like a chatbot; it basically can generate sentences and text that is almost indistinguishable from humans. They actually let you use it for free whenever you want, but you have to get a special access token from them to do so. At any point, they could cut off your access from those models. We were thinking something like that could be a useful starting point for potentially sensitive models, such as toxicity models. Science is all about open communication, open access, open data sharing. Restrictions are antithetical to that notion. But a step going forward could be to at least responsibly account for who’s using your resources.Your paper also says that “[w]ithout being overly alarmist, this should serve as a wake-up call for our colleagues” — what is it that you want your colleagues to wake up to? And what do you think that being overly alarmist would look like?We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse. When you start working in the chemistry space, you do get informed about misuse of chemistry, and you’re sort of responsible for making sure you avoid that as much as possible. In machine learning, there’s nothing of the sort. There’s no guidance on misuse of the technology. “We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse.”So putting that awareness out there could help people really be mindful of the issue. Then it’s at least talked about in broader circles and can at least be something that we watch out for as we get better and better at building toxicity models.I don’t want to propose that machine learning AI is going to start creating toxic molecules and there’s going to be a slew of new biochemical warfare agents just around the corner. That somebody clicks a button and then, you know, chemical warfare agents just sort of appear in their hand. I don’t want to be alarmist in saying that there’s going to be AI-driven chemical warfare. I don’t think that’s the case now. I don’t think it’s going to be the case anytime soon. But it’s something that’s starting to become a possibility.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

The idea of the conference is to inform the community at large of new developments with tools that may have implications for the Chemical/Biological Weapons Convention.

We got this invite to talk about machine learning and how it can be misused in our space. It’s something we never really thought about before. But it was just very easy to realize that as we’re building these machine learning models to get better and better at predicting toxicity in order to avoid toxicity, all we have to do is sort of flip the switch around and say, “You know, instead of going away from toxicity, what if we do go toward toxicity?”

Can you walk me through how you did that — moved the model to go toward toxicity?

I’ll be a little vague with some details because we were told basically to withhold some of the specifics. Broadly, the way it works for this experiment is that we have a lot of datasets historically of molecules that have been tested to see whether they’re toxic or not.

In particular, the one that we focus on here is VX. It is an inhibitor of what’s known as acetylcholinesterase. Whenever you do anything muscle-related, your neurons use acetylcholinesterase as a signal to basically say “go move your muscles.” The way VX is lethal is it actually stops your diaphragm, your lung muscles, from being able to move so your lungs become paralyzed. 

""“Obviously, this is something you want to avoid.”""

Obviously, this is something you want to avoid. So historically, experiments have been done with different types of molecules to see whether they inhibit acetylcholinesterase. And so, we built up these large datasets of these molecular structures and how toxic they are.

We can use these datasets in order to create a machine learning model, which basically learns what parts of the molecular structure are important for toxicity and which are not. Then we can give this machine learning model new molecules, potentially new drugs that maybe have never been tested before. And it will tell us this is predicted to be toxic, or this is predicted not to be toxic. This is a way for us to virtually screen very, very fast a lot of molecules and sort of kick out ones that are predicted to be toxic. In our study here, what we did is we inverted that, obviously, and we use this model to try to predict toxicity.

The other key part of what we did here are these new generative models. We can give a generative model a whole lot of different structures, and it learns how to put molecules together. And then we can, in a sense, ask it to generate new molecules. Now it can generate new molecules all over the space of chemistry, and they’re just sort of random molecules. But one thing we can do is we can actually tell the generative model which direction we want to go. We do that by giving it a little scoring function, which gives it a high score if the molecules it generates are towards something we want. Instead of giving a low score to toxic molecules, we give a high score to toxic molecules. 

Now we see the model start producing all of these molecules, a lot of which look like VX and also like other chemical warfare agents.

Tell me more about what you found. Did anything surprise you?

We weren’t really sure what we were going to get. Our generative models are fairly new technologies. So we haven’t widely used them a lot. 

The biggest thing that jumped out at first was that a lot of the generated compounds were predicted to be actually more toxic than VX. And the reason that’s surprising is because VX is basically one of the most potent compounds known. Meaning you need a very, very, very little amount of it to be lethal. 

Now, these are predictions that we haven’t verified, and we certainly don’t want to verify that ourselves. But the predictive models are generally pretty good. So even if there’s a lot of false positives, we’re afraid that there are some more potent molecules in there.

Second, we actually looked at a lot of the structures of these newly generated molecules. And a lot of them did look like VX and other warfare agents, and we even found some that were generated from the model that were actual chemical warfare agents. These were generated from the model having never seen these chemical warfare agents. So we knew we were sort of in the right space here and that it was generating molecules that made sense because some of them had already been made before.

For me, the concern was just how easy it was to do. A lot of the things we used are out there for free. You can go and download a toxicity dataset from anywhere. If you have somebody who knows how to code in Python and has some machine learning capabilities, then in probably a good weekend of work, they could build something like this generative model driven by toxic datasets. So that was the thing that got us really thinking about putting this paper out there; it was such a low barrier of entry for this type of misuse.

Your paper says that by doing this work, you and your colleagues “have still crossed a gray moral boundary, demonstrating that it is possible to design virtual potential toxic molecules without much in the way of effort, time or computational resources. We can easily erase the thousands of molecules we created, but we cannot delete the knowledge of how to recreate them.” What was running through your head as you were doing this work?

This was quite an unusual publication. We’ve been back and forth a bit about whether we should publish it or not. This is a potential misuse that didn’t take as much time to perform. And we wanted to get that information out since we really didn’t see it anywhere in the literature. We looked around, and nobody was really talking about it. But at the same time, we didn’t want to give the idea to bad actors.

""“Some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it”""

At the end of the day, we decided that we kind of want to get ahead of this. Because if it’s possible for us to do it, it’s likely that some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it or in the future is going to think about it. By then, our technology may have progressed even beyond what we can do now. And a lot of it’s just going to be open source — which I fully support: the sharing of science, the sharing of data, the sharing of models. But it’s one of these things where we, as scientists, should take care that what we release is done responsibly.

How easy is it for someone to replicate what you did? What would they need?

I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did. 

If you were to Google generative models, you could find a number of put-together one-liner generative models that people have released for free. And then, if you were to search for toxicity datasets, there’s a large number of open-source tox datasets. So if you just combine those two things, and then you know how to code and build machine learning models —  all that requires really is an internet connection and a computer — then, you could easily replicate what we did. And not just for VX, but for pretty much whatever other open-source toxicity datasets exist.

""“I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did.”""

Of course, it does require some expertise. If somebody were to put this together without knowing anything about chemistry, they would ultimately probably generate stuff that was not very useful. And there’s still the next step of having to get those molecules synthesized. Finding a potential drug or potential new toxic molecule is one thing; the next step of synthesis — actually creating a new molecule in the real world — would be another barrier. 

Right, there’s still some big leaps between what the AI comes up with and turning that into a real-world threat. What are the gaps there?

The big gap to start with is that you really don’t know if these molecules are actually toxic or not. There’s going to be some amount of false positives. If we’re walking ourselves through what a bad agent would be thinking or doing, they would have to make a decision on which of these new molecules they would want to synthesize ultimately.

As far as synthesis routes, this could be a make it or break it. If you find something that looks like a chemical warfare agent and try to get that synthesized, chances are it’s not going to happen. A lot of the chemical building blocks of these chemical warfare agents are well known and are watched. They’re regulated. But there’s so many synthesis companies. As long as it doesn’t look like a chemical warfare agent, they’re most likely going to just synthesize it and send it right back because who knows what the molecule is being used for, right?

You get at this later in the paper, but what can be done to prevent this kind of misuse of AI? What safeguards would you like to see established? 

For context, there are more and more policies about data sharing. And I completely agree with it because it opens up more avenues for research. It allows other researchers to see your data and use it for their own research. But at the same time, that also includes things like toxicity datasets and toxicity models. So it’s a little hard to figure out a good solution for this problem.

We looked over towards Silicon Valley: there’s a group called OpenAI; they released a top-of-the-line language model called GPT-3. It’s almost like a chatbot; it basically can generate sentences and text that is almost indistinguishable from humans. They actually let you use it for free whenever you want, but you have to get a special access token from them to do so. At any point, they could cut off your access from those models. We were thinking something like that could be a useful starting point for potentially sensitive models, such as toxicity models. 

Science is all about open communication, open access, open data sharing. Restrictions are antithetical to that notion. But a step going forward could be to at least responsibly account for who’s using your resources.

Your paper also says that “[w]ithout being overly alarmist, this should serve as a wake-up call for our colleagues” — what is it that you want your colleagues to wake up to? And what do you think that being overly alarmist would look like?

We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse. When you start working in the chemistry space, you do get informed about misuse of chemistry, and you’re sort of responsible for making sure you avoid that as much as possible. In machine learning, there’s nothing of the sort. There’s no guidance on misuse of the technology. 

""“We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse.”""

So putting that awareness out there could help people really be mindful of the issue. Then it’s at least talked about in broader circles and can at least be something that we watch out for as we get better and better at building toxicity models.

I don’t want to propose that machine learning AI is going to start creating toxic molecules and there’s going to be a slew of new biochemical warfare agents just around the corner. That somebody clicks a button and then, you know, chemical warfare agents just sort of appear in their hand. 

I don’t want to be alarmist in saying that there’s going to be AI-driven chemical warfare. I don’t think that’s the case now. I don’t think it’s going to be the case anytime soon. But it’s something that’s starting to become a possibility.

In early March, Google announced that it was suspending ad sales in Russia, joining the movement to isolate Russia after it invaded Ukraine.
Unlike some other organizations, Google can’t walk away from the country entirely. The company is making sure YouTube and Google search — free, important sources of information — are still operating, CEO Sundar Pichai said last week.
“We will obviously align with our mission to provide high-quality information,” he said. “We have removed a lot of misinformation, including state-backed channels, globally across our products and platforms, as other companies have done.”

These efforts are likely just beginning, said Sundar, who became the CEO of Google in 2015 and its parent company, Alphabet, in 2019. Google and Google employees have donated more than $25 million to relief efforts in Ukraine, he said. “These are moments that unite humanity. We’ve gone through the pandemic, we’ve gone through racial equity moments … I think companies, organizations, all of us, need to step up and do the right thing.”
The crisis in Ukraine is just one global challenge that companies need to address, Pichai noted.  During a wide-ranging MIT Forefront conversation last week with MIT president L. Rafael Reif, Pichai talked about internal and external challenges, including how Google is addressing climate change; diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and the return to the workplace.
Pichai, who led development of the Google Chrome browser and oversaw Google Maps, Android, Gmail, and Google Apps, emphasized in his talk the role he sees technology playing in these efforts and beyond.
Here’s how Google is tapping technology to solve some of businesses’ most challenging problems:
Balancing the promise of AI with its risks 
Artificial intelligence “is one of the most profound technologies we are working on, as important or more than fire and electricity,” Pichai said. “Developing important new technology … for humankind, it's always been about balancing the positives and the negatives and harnessing it to make sure it benefits society. This is going to be no different. The stakes are higher.”

Roughly 20% of Google's workforce is expected to work fully remotely over time. 
Instead of developing AI and thinking about the consequences later, Google aims to think through the risks early on and invest in the right frameworks, Pichai said. Google has created a set of AI principles that address ethics, bias, and making sure applications benefit society.
Pichai pointed to the role of academia in developing responsible AI. “I think the vantage point and the work from universities will end up being a very important perspective rather than companies being able to do this alone,” he said, adding that those institutions can also hold companies accountable.
The promise of AI cuts across all parts of the company and far beyond, Pichai said: It can be used to improve Google search, help with self-driving cars, make YouTube a better platform for education, drive innovation that could help solve climate change, or help detect diabetic retinopathy, a curable cause of blindness.
But the company has to approach this technology “always making sure we put humanity at front and center, and people and their connections with the real world,” he said. “I think that's what will win over time.”
Embracing a ‘flexible’ future of work 
Google has joined other companies in reconsidering where and how people work. “I want to embrace that the future of work is going to be flexible, and really internalize that,” Pichai said.
Google employees are given the chance to work from other locations, he said, and the company is leaning toward hybrid work, with roughly three days in the office and two days at home — though roughly 20% of Google’s workforce is expected to work fully remotely over time, he said.
While it is still important to have moments where people come together to collaborate and create new things, Pichai said, flexible work boosts the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals by tapping talent in different locations and being flexible in different situations, such as when employees return from parental leave.
“By giving [employees] agency and giving them that flexibility and trusting them to do the right thing, I think we will end up again in a net better place where people will be happier and hence more productive,” he said.
Artificial intelligence could even play a role in fostering meaningful connections, he said. “I always think about why doesn't Google Calendar tell me, ‘Hey, it's a nice day outside. You haven't walked,’” he said. Perhaps calendars could also suggest dinner with family, or help someone find the time to learn Spanish, he added.
Investing in diversity and equity, inside and outside the company
Pichai said it is important for Google to have a diverse workforce. “We are trying to build products used by billions of users, [and] we are working on important technologies that will have a deep impact on society,” he said. A diverse workforce will “help the company develop better products, and more importantly, tackle problems in society better.”

The AI road not taken


Google has grown in its approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion, he said, including publicizing its annual diversity report, focusing on hiring, attrition, and representation data for different groups, and making a public commitment to have 30% more of its leaders from underrepresented groups by 2025.
Thinking about diversity and inclusion extends to the company’s products, Pichai said — for example, Black-owned businesses could be highlighted on search and Google Maps.
“Above all, I think it's about tone from the top really reflecting that commitment and driving it deep within the organization,” he said. “In my experience, people genuinely want to do better here, and so it's tapping into that energy and driving progress.”
Google is addressing societal inequality and wealth gaps by investing in skilling and education. For example, the company launched the Google Career Certificate program — a nine-month course to help people gain digital skills. The company also supplements the training with “wraparound services” such as childcare support, interview preparation, resume workshops, job placement support, and living stipends.
“The reality is that many people don't have access, and we need to help them make the transition to acquiring digital skills,” he said. “That's what we are thinking about — how do you help people in the labor force get skill-based [training] and credentialing that employers value?”
Using technology to address climate change 
Climate change has long been an important cause at the company, Pichai said — Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and aims to be carbon-free by 2030. “I'm not talking offsets,” he said. “It is effectively making sure every video you watch on YouTube or every Gmail or every search query you type, that we don't touch carbon sources of energy in the process.”
To do this, Google is looking at and investing in technology like carbon capture, and has partnered with MIT startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems to research fusion energy.  
Climate change will disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities, Pichai noted. “So using technology to tackle climate change is one of the best ways by which we can tackle inequality.”

Estée Lauder staff win payout after being ‘sacked by algorithm’

Cosmetics company Estée Lauder has reached an out-of-court settlement with three make-up artists who lost their jobs after being asked to take a video interview that was assessed by an algorithm.
The women, who worked for Estée Lauder subsidiary MAC, were told they were being made redundant, partly on the basis of an automated judgment by a computer. Initially, they had been required to reapply for their positions.
None of the women had been warned about performance issues previously and they began legal proceedings against the cosmetics giant.
The software, created by the recruiting platform HireVue, measured the content of their answers and their expressions, and gauged the results against other data about the women’s job performance.
In the Computer Says No documentary broadcast last night on BBC3, the women said no one could tell them why their applications had not succeeded.
One of the women, identified as Anthea, said: “I literally thought we would be videoed and someone would mark it after. I found out that wasn’t the case. Nobody saw the video, it was all algorithms.”
Estée Lauder denied not having informed them about the nature of the assessment.

Anthea’s colleague, Lizzie, added. “They pasted the same sentence about algorithms and artificial intelligence and this tiering bucket of 15,000 data points. I still don’t know what all that means – to me that isn’t an answer.”
The interview, said the women, involved questions about applying make-up – which would have been easier to answer by demonstration rather than a verbal description of the process.
Automated hiring software is used by many firms to make it easier to filter and assess job applications and to help ensure fewer biases creep into the process.
HireVue said that since 2020 it has no longer used visual analysis in its software. It said research had demonstrated that advances in natural language processing meant that “visual analysis no longer significantly added value to the assessments”.
HireVue CEO and chairman Kevin Parker said: “Over time the visual components contributed less to the assessment to the point where there was so much public concern to everything related to AI that it wasn’t worth the concern it was causing people.”
Estée Lauder said that interviewees were fully briefed, and that “using the HireVue process in tandem with human decision-making produces fairer outcomes and we stand by it”.
A spokesperson said: “The company takes significant steps to counter unconscious bias in all our employment-related decisions. In the situation described, facial recognition accounted for well under 1% (0.25%) of employees’ overall assessment.
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 58 sYou can close Ad in 3 s“The company has teams who overlay objective performance-related data and other qualitative feedback, which accounted for the majority of the employment assessment, to make decisions on employment. Thus, any suggestion that facial recognition technology played a decisive role in any employment-related decision at MAC UK & Ireland or the Estée Lauder Companies UK & Ireland is patently false.”
The women received an out-of-court settlement. Lizzie said the hardest part of the experience had been what she perceived as the injustice of it: “I doubted myself massively when all that happened . . . Because she told you you’re not good enough for something. But that was never a valid reason to lose my job. That’s why it was so difficult, because I knew I was good enough but being told I wasn’t was really hard.”
After feeling she had been sacked by algorithm, Anthea said she felt it was important to push back. “I’m speaking out now so people can hear the truth and people can hear that this is actually happening,” she said. “It needs to be heard and needs to be stopped.”

While the public is generally concerned about the rise of AI, views are tied to how these technologies would be used and what constraints would be put in place.

More Americans said they are ""more concerned than excited"" by the increase of artificial intelligence, a developing technology hastened by the pandemic, being applied to daily life, according to a Pew Research Center survey about the rise of AI.The researchers polled 10,260 US adults from November 1 through November 7. Participants were asked about six developments: facial recognition technology, social media algorithms, robotic exoskeletons, computer chip implants, driverless cars and gene editing.The findings revealed a positive outlook for facial recognition, algorithms and exoskeletons. By contrast, the respondents were significantly more worried about the use of computer chip implants in the brain, the future of autonomous passenger vehicles and gene editing. Top ArticlesRead MoreAnti-Israel groups threaten Netanyahu with ‘citizen’s arrest’ in Washington

However, those who welcomed the new technology said it will save time, especially at work.The survey also noted that even for far-reaching applications, such as the widespread use of driverless cars and brain chip implants, there are mitigating steps people say would make them more justifiable.Seven out of 10 Americans say they would find driverless cars more acceptable if there was a requirement that such cars were labeled as driverless so they could be easily identified on the road, and 67% would find these cars more acceptable if they were required to travel in dedicated lanes. In addition, 57% say their use would be more acceptable if a licensed driver was required to be in the vehicle.

 When we think of artificial intelligence, we usually think of the humanoid robots from movies portrayed as the villains who take over the world. But, in reality, we don't yet have robots that can surpass human intelligence. 






 That said, AI has already taken over our lives. Your Smart Home devices, the facial ID recognition in your phone, the chatbots you interact with while shopping online, your music, video, and shopping recommendations— are all powered by AI. 


 What Is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? 
    

 In simple words, AI is any program that can do 'intelligent' tasks similar to a human. But it's not just simple software. 

 How Does AI Learn? 
 In a software program, your output solely depends on what the code says. For example, let's say you've written a code to identify cats. Your code tells that anything with four legs, a tail, and fur is a cat. 






 It will identify every furry animal as a cat, even if it's seeing a dog or tiger or a polar bear. The only way to correct it is to change the code to include specific characteristics of a cat, like size, shape, color, and skin pattern. 

 In the case of AI, the machine learning experts train the algorithm to correct itself. They key in a large amount of data (in our case, animal photos), reward the program every time it identifies the cat correctly, and punish if it makes a mistake. 

 When you train it repeatedly with vast amounts of data, the algorithm will eventually learn to identify the cat. What's more, it will generate patterns from the data and identify other animals too. This is called Machine Learning. 

 Deep Learning takes machine learning to the next level with a lesser need for human intervention. With the help of complex neural networks, each algorithm can learn and change itself. Artificial neural networks are algorithms modeled after neurons in the human brain. The algorithms run on powerful computers to connect, interact, and learn from each other, just like our neurons. 







 Making a Career in AI 
 AI is in most leading industries, from e-commerce to healthcare and agriculture. Companies rely on AI for personalized recommendations, market analysis, fraud detection, and virtual/augmented reality. 

 It takes a specialized team to build AI projects. To begin with, we need to identify reliable data, analyze them, feed them to the machine, and then train it to learn. So, the opportunities are endless for people who like to work with data and machine learning. 

 As a dynamic, highly technical, and specialized field, AI jobs are well-paying, and you should be highly skilled and adept at technology to break into the market. If you're eyeing a career in the AI field, you need to act now. Here are your options: 

 Business Analysis and Research 
    





 Research is the first step of the AI process. The key people driving this will be domain experts, business analysts, and researchers. They are experts in their industry or domain like banking, insurance, manufacturing, etc., and play a pivotal role in identifying opportunities, defining scope, researching the market, and making dynamic decisions. They also liaise between the business and the core AI teams. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 To be a domain expert or researcher, you will need an advanced degree in your field. For example, business analysts have a degree in Business, Economics, Statistics, or a closely related field. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and flexibility are essential skills for someone in a research and analysis team. In addition, a passion for technology and a willingness to learn new things will help you ace these roles in an AI project. 






 Data Science 
    

 Data drives our modern world, and there is no AI without data. The success of any AI project depends on the quality of the data. That is why there is a massive demand for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. 

 Data analysts are responsible for collecting data and analyzing it for business insights. 

 Data scientists take this to the next step by looking for patterns using different techniques like deep learning and neural networks. The insights help businesses to solve problems and innovate. 

 A data engineer's job is to build the necessary infrastructure for data handling. The engineers set up the database and communication pipelines for the data to flow. 






 Most of the time, these roles are loosely defined in a data team, and you may be expected to put on more than one hat. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 To get into either of the data handling roles, your basic technical skills will more or less be the same, varying slightly in degrees. You should hone your STEM skills, learn to code, grasp database concepts, and earn a degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Statistics. You'll probably start as a data analyst and transition to a scientist or an engineering role with experience. You can check some of our Data Science learning suggestions or learn Python, a popular programming language choice for Data Science. 

 Machine Learning 
    






 Machine Learning programmers, engineers, and architects are the group of people who will design, develop, and test complex AI algorithms. They will also train the algorithms to look for patterns and enhance their outputs over time. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 It would help if you had an advanced degree in computer science and analytical skills and creativity. You should be skilled at programming languages and software concepts. If you're already a software engineer, you can get into Machine Learning with short certificate courses in AI. You can use these Machine Learning project ideas to kick-start your learning. 

 Product Design 
    






 The end product of an AI design can be a screen or a giant robot, but the product designer's job is to make sure the product is accessible and easy to use. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 Product designers are from diverse backgrounds--you can be a UI designer, engineer, or artist. Along with specialization in your field, you should be a tech enthusiast who can empathize with the end-users. Flexibility, adaptability, and a human-centric approach are essential to thrive in an AI design team. 

 AI Hardware 
    

 AI systems need colossal memory and processing power. Thanks to the innovation of cloud computing, AI systems are everywhere now. The cloud data is stored in different servers in various locations. Storing and processing data needs hardware like memory, CPUs, and GPUs. There is also a need for infrastructure like cloud networks. 





 Skill Set Required: 

 Consider getting a degree in Electrical, Electronics, or Network Engineering to work with AI hardware. 

 Other Roles 
    

 If you're not a techie, don't give up your dream of getting into the AI world. There are always other roles like project managers, writers, linguists, and lawyers. As more people-centric industries like healthcare and education embrace AI, new opportunities like ethicists and futurists are also opening up. 



 AI Is a Future-Proof Career Today 
 AI is an exciting and upcoming field for you to start your career. However, for those in other areas, you still have an option to choose your career in AI--all you need is the curiosity to learn and upskill yourself.

The inherent capacity of the existing artificial intelligence systems is increasing as they are being integrated into the fully societal infrastructure, indicating that the implications of losing conscious control become even more concerning. With each passing day, humans are getting surrounded by robots. This revolution has spooked several tech analysts and AI critics. In the real world, artificial intelligence is developing in multiple directions with astonishing velocity, and these AI super abilities might initially prove to be fatal for humans. There are many areas in which the dangers of AI should be discussed, and its repercussions must be anticipated and managed in the future. In this article, we have listed the top AI super abilities that can prove fatal for humans in the future..Automation-triggered job losses.Job automation is generally viewed as one of the most immediate concerns over the rapid advancements of AI. This issue is no longer constrained within the matter of whether or not AI will replace certain jobs, but as to what degree will it cause job loss in humans. The automation of jobs will cause a high unemployment rate among professionals who are not as highly tech-driven in nature. Since AI robots are becoming smarter, the same tasks will require fewer human laborers..Invasion of privacy.After the integration of AI in some of the most crucial tech algorithms, it has become quite easy to track and analyze an individual's every move online and offline as well. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and with the help of advanced facial recognition software, your trackers know exactly where you are..Autonomous Weapons.Autonomous weapons or 'killer robots' are military robots that can search their targets and aim independently according to pre-programmed instructions. Almost all technologically advanced countries in the world are developing autonomous war robots that will replace human soldiers. But there are many dangers in possessing these weapons. The most important question that arises in this instance is who will be responsible for these AI robots turning rogue and committing heinous crimes that can result in the loss of human lives?.Deepfakes.Malicious individuals and criminals sometimes use deepfake technology to inspire misunderstanding, fear, or disgust. Deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation, create false narratives of people, and can also generate a specific public image for the subject, that can physically and mentally harm an individual..AI Terrorism.While AI can contribute immensely to the national security of a country, it can also effectively help terrorists to carry out terror attacks. Several terror agencies use drones to carry out attacks and monitor the actions of soldiers across the border. If thousands of drones were launched together and programmed to kill select types of people, then it can be called a 'tech-driven attack'..Broadening socio-economic inequality due to AI bias.The widening socio-economic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern. Currently, only predictive and repetitive types of jobs are prone to AI takeover, but research and surveys have proved that the criteria may extend more in the future. So, employees working in much less apt departments are less likely to get retraining orders than the ones working in higher-level positions..Social media manipulation.Social media manipulation can be quite effective at target marketing and getting influenced by autonomous-powered algorithms, quite easy. By spreading propaganda to select groups of individuals through algorithms and personal data, AI can target and spread whatever information it will be engineered to impart, without any user intervention or filter..Superhuman AI.It might sound much like the science fiction piece, The Terminator, but with the growing advancement of autonomous war weapons, it is quite likely that in a few years there will be an evil-looking autonomous robot programmed to kill the enemies, but what if it is unable to effectively identify humans or hacked? Well, currently, superhuman AI systems are sort of myths, but for how long shall it remain a myth?.AI Bias.It is quite unfortunate that human beings, in the 21st century, still fight over religion, gender, and nationalities. This bias may also be integrated into artificial intelligence systems because of the flawed data being generated by human beings. The only way to remove this issue is the manual removal of unnecessary data by AI developers..Destabilize the stock market.Several experts believe that the emergence of algorithmic trading might result in a major financial meltdown. Algorithmic trading involves high frequency and high-value trades which can eventually lead to extreme market volatility. This kind of trading does not take into account human logic and emotion and still plays quite a crucial role in the financial markets..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
