Day after day, we hear stories about systems and machines taking on tasks that, until very recently, we saw as the exclusive and permanent preserve of humankind: making medical diagnoses, drafting legal documents, designing buildings, and even composing music.Our concern here, though, is with something even more striking: the prospect of high-level machine intelligence systems that outperform human beings at essentially every task. This is not science fiction. In a recent survey the median estimate among leading computer scientists reported a 50% chance that this technology would arrive within 45 years.Time until machines outperform humans, featured in the report ""Positive AI Economic Futures"". Source: Grace et al., 2018.Importantly, that survey also revealed considerable disagreement. Some see high-level machine intelligence arriving much more quickly, others far more slowly, if at all. Such differences of opinion abound in the recent literature on the future of AI, from popular commentary to more expert analysis.Yet despite these conflicting views, one thing is clear: if we think this kind of outcome might be possible, then it ought to demand our attention. Continued progress in these technologies could have extraordinarily disruptive effects – it would exacerbate recent trends in inequality, undermine work as a force for social integration, and weaken a source of purpose and fulfilment for many people.Experts gather to share their AI visionsIn April 2020, an ambitious initiative called Positive AI Economic Futures was launched by Stuart Russell and Charles-Edouard Bouée, both members of the World Economic Forum’s Global AI Council (GAIC). In a series of workshops and interviews, over 150 experts from a wide variety of backgrounds gathered virtually to discuss these challenges, as well as possible positive Artificial Intelligence visions and their implications for policymakers. Those included Madeline Ashby (science fiction author and expert in strategic foresight), Ken Liu (Hugo Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author), and economists Daron Acemoglu (MIT) and Anna Salomons (Utrecht), among many others. What follows is a summary of these conversations, developed in the Forum's report Positive AI Economic Futures.What will constitute 'work' in a future Participants were divided on this question. One camp thought that, freed from the shackles of traditional work, humans could use their new freedom to engage in exploration, self-improvement, volunteering, or whatever else they find satisfying. Proponents of this view usually supported some form of universal basic income (UBI), while acknowledging that our current system of education hardly prepares people to fashion their own lives, free of any economic constraints.The second camp in our workshops and interviews believed the opposite: traditional work might still be essential. To them, UBI is an admission of failure – it assumes that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society. They can be fed, housed, and entertained – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices. People will be engaged in supplying interpersonal services that can be provided – or which we prefer to be provided – only by humans. These include therapy, tutoring, life coaching, and community-building. That is, if we can no longer supply routine physical labour and routine mental labour, we can still supply our humanity. For these kinds of jobs to generate real value, we will need to be much better at being human – an area where our education system and scientific research base is notoriously weak.Have you read?What role could AI play in the 'return to work' phase?This is how AI can unlock hidden talent in the workplaceCan artificial intelligence help close gender gaps at work?So, whether we think that the end of traditional work would be a good thing or a bad thing, it seems that we need a radical redirection of education and science to equip individuals to live fulfilling lives or to support an economy based largely on high-value-added interpersonal services. We also need to ensure that the economic gains born of AI-enabled automation will be fairly distributed in society.Six AI scenarios that could build a positive futureOne of the greatest obstacles to action is that, at present, there is no consensus on what future we should target, perhaps because there is hardly any conversation about what might be desirable. This lack of vision is a problem because, if high-level machine intelligence does arrive, we could quickly find ourselves overwhelmed by unprecedented technological change and implacable economic forces. This would be a vast opportunity squandered.For this reason, the workshop attendees and interview participants, from science-fiction writers to economists and AI experts, attempted to articulate positive visions of a future where Artificial Intelligence can do most of what we currently call work.These scenarios represent possible trajectories for humanity. None of them, though, is unambiguously achievable or desirable. And while there are elements of important agreement and consensus among the visions, there are often revealing clashes, too.1. Shared economic prosperityThe economic benefits of technological progress are widely shared around the world. The global economy is 10 times larger because AI has massively boosted productivity. Humans can do more and achieve more by sharing this prosperity. This vision could be pursued by adopting various interventions, from introducing a global tax regime to improving insurance against unemployment.2. Realigned companies Large companies focus on developing AI that benefits humanity, and they do so without holding excessive economic or political power. This could be pursued by changing corporate ownership structures and updating antitrust policies.3. Flexible labour markets Human creativity and hands-on support give people time to find new roles. People adapt to technological change and find work in newly created professions. Policies would focus on improving educational and retraining opportunities, as well as strengthening social safety nets for those who would otherwise be worse off due to automation.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Business leaders, computer scientists, and policymakers choose to develop technologies that increase rather than decrease the demand for workers. Incentives to develop human-centric AI would be strengthened and automation taxed where necessary.5. Fulfilling jobs New jobs are more fulfilling than those that came before. Machines handle unsafe and boring tasks, while humans move into more productive, fulfilling, and flexible jobs with greater human interaction. Policies to achieve this include strengthening labour unions and increasing worker involvement on corporate boards. 6. Civic empowerment and human flourishingIn a world with less need to work and basic needs met by UBI, well-being increasingly comes from meaningful unpaid activities. People can engage in exploration, self-improvement, volunteering or whatever else they find satisfying. Greater social engagement would be supported.The intention is that this report starts a broader discussion about what sort of future we want and the challenges that will have to be confronted to achieve it. If technological progress continues its relentless advance, the world will look very different for our children and grandchildren. Far more debate, research, and policy engagement are needed on these questions – they are now too important for us to ignore.Don't miss any update on Future of WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkFourth Industrial RevolutionEconomic GrowthShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

According to a multi-institution research team, predictive analytics thrives with input from both artificial intelligence and humans. 
“Predictive tasks are ubiquitous — any decision-making in any field or facet of life involves predicting the consequences of the available options before choosing them,” paper author and professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross Business School, Scott E. Page, said in a press release.







“Understanding the perils and promises of these assemblages and crafting a proper balance between the two is a major concern moving forward.”
According to Page, concerns arise when removing the human element from data analytics. While humans make medical predictions based on experience, some data, and gut instinct, machines will make predictions based on data and how it was trained.
According to researchers, humans’ approach to predictions is far more nuanced than AI methods. Page explained that although AI handles big data well, humans are better equipped to analyze “thick” data. Rather than examining many data points of the same type of data, like in big data, thick data with few data points can tell a fuller story.
“Big data and thick data working together will produce more accurate collective predictions,” Page said. “Thick data can catch and draw attention to constellations of factors that might slip through the cracks between separated big data variables. Even though big data cast a wider net, that net contains holes.”
The researchers mathematically tested how human and AI inputs might result in different predictions. The team found that typically, AI did not need human input to make accurate predictions.
However, in atypical cases with more unknown or surprise factors, humans assisted in reducing potential AI errors. The results indicated that predictive analytics works best when artificial intelligence and humans work collaboratively.
“So long as humans can continue to identify different attributes, that is, continue to construct thicker data, or better understand atypical cases, they will continue to increase accuracy,” Page said. “Rather than a competition between humans and computers, the future of hybrid predictors will be a complex search for symbiosis.”
The team plans to continue exploring how partnering AI and humans can improve predictive analytic methods.
“The particulars cannot be known, but we can almost certainly predict that the roles and contributions of the participants will both adapt to ever-growing data and greater computational power,” Page said.
“The present and future of cognitive work will surely involve a mangle of humans, algorithms, datasets, subjects, objects, and domains. As they seek to understand the work, these hybrid groups will also shape it.”

Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel HuttenlocherOne of the great promises of technology is that it can do the work that humans find too boring or arduous.In the 19th and 20th centuries, factory machines relieved us of repetitive manual labor and backbreaking farm work. In this century, artificial intelligence has taken care of a few more tasks — curating Spotify playlists, selecting the next YouTube video, vacuuming the floor and so on — but many more mind-numbing activities remain ripe for the picking. The experts promise us that someday, all of our least favorite chores — including complex cognitive ones, like interviewing job candidates or managing global supply chains — will be outsourced to machines.But that day has not yet arrived. Or has it?After finishing “The Age of AI,” a new book about artificial intelligence by Henry A. Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher, I found myself unmoved by the prospect of reviewing it. I’ve read dozens of books about A.I., and while the conceit of this one was intriguing — bringing together a 98-year-old diplomat, a former Google chief executive and an M.I.T. professor — the book itself was a fairly forgettable entry in the genre.ImageThen I got a bright idea. What if I could have an A.I. finish this review, and save myself the trouble?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSo I fired up Sudowrite, an A.I. writing program I’ve been experimenting with recently. The app uses GPT-3, the cutting-edge A.I. system developed by the San Francisco-based OpenAI, which acts as a kind of turbocharged version of Gmail’s autocomplete feature. Provide a snippet of text, and GPT-3 will try to complete it, using everything it has learned from ingesting billions of examples of other people’s writing. It does this with the help of a supercomputer containing some 285,000 processors, and a multilayered neural network that ranks among the world’s most powerful A.I. engines. The authors of “The Age of AI” call GPT-3 one of several promising technologies that are producing a “revolution in human affairs.”I pasted the first several paragraphs of this review into Sudowrite, and asked the A.I. to finish. Here’s what it wrote:Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher’s “The Age of AI” is a bold new book on artificial intelligence that will become the go-to guide for anyone who wants to understand this transformative technology.The authors have examined the full range of AI technologies — from computer vision systems to natural language processing — and written about them in a way that will appeal to both experts and laypeople.One of the most inspiring aspects of this book is its scope. The authors delve deeply into the potential of AI in all areas of human enterprise. They describe the impact of AI on health care, economics, geopolitics, law, urban development, governance, journalism, the military and even the life sciences.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTKissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher are not afraid to explore the darkest side of AI, either. They are clear-eyed about the ways that AI could enable dictators to monitor their citizens and manipulate information to incite people to commit violence.

Subscribe and listen.Although AI is already making our lives better in many ways, Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher caution that it will take us as a species many years to create a system as powerful as we deserve. They wisely suggest that we not lose sight of the values we want to instill in this new machine intelligence.Thank you, GPT-3! Now, a few notes:First, the A.I. wasn’t an unqualified success. It took Sudowrite a few tries. On the first attempt, it spit out a series of run-on sentences that hinted that GPT-3 had gotten stuck in some kind of odd, recursive loop. (It began: “The book which you are reading at the moment is a book on a nook, which is a book on a book, which is a book on a subject, which is a subject on a subject, which is a subject on a subject.”) A few tries later, it seemed to give up on the task of book reviewing altogether, and started merely listing the names of tech companies. (“Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Baidu, Tencent, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, Twitter, Snap, Alibaba, WeChat, Slack.”)But it warmed up quickly, and within a few minutes, the A.I. was coming up with impressively cogent paragraphs of analysis — some, frankly, better than what I could have generated on my own.This speaks to one of the recurring themes of “The Age of AI,” which is that although today’s A.I. systems can be clunky and erratic at times, they are getting better fast, and will soon match or surpass human proficiency in a number of important tasks, solving problems in ways no human would have thought to solve them. At that point, the authors write, A.I. will “transform all realms of human experience.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, while GPT-3 was correct about the scope of “The Age of AI” — with chapters on everything from social media algorithms to autonomous weapons — it failed to note that all of that broadness comes at a cost. The book feels cursory and shallow in places, and many of its recommendations are puzzlingly vague.In a chapter on the geopolitical risks posed by A.I., the authors conclude that “the nations of the world must make urgent decisions regarding what is compatible with concepts of inherent human dignity and moral agency.” (OK, we’ll get right on that!) A brief section about TikTok — an app used by more than a billion people worldwide, whose ownership by a Chinese company raises legitimately fascinating questions about national sovereignty and free speech — ends with the throwaway observation that “more complex geopolitical and regulatory riddles await us in the near future.” And when the authors do make specific recommendations — such as a proposal to restrict the use of A.I. in developing biological weapons — they fail to elaborate on how such an outcome might be achieved, or who might stand in its way.Finally, GPT-3 didn’t address the biggest question about the book, which is why it exists at all. Kissinger, who was 66 years old when the World Wide Web was invented, is not a full-time A.I. practitioner, nor a particularly savvy parser of tech hype. (His last newsworthy foray into the tech world was when he sat on the board of Theranos, the doomed blood-testing start-up.) Schmidt, who spent a decade running Google, is these days preoccupied with trying to scare up military contracts for big tech companies. And while Huttenlocher, the dean of M.I.T.’s Schwarzman College of Computing, may be a bona fide subject matter expert, it’s not clear how much of the book he actually wrote.That said, the book does get some things right. The authors do a commendable job of avoiding what I call “A.I. fatalism” — the belief, sadly common in tech circles, that A.I. is part of an inevitable future whose course we are powerless to change. Instead, they write that “humans still control” A.I., and have the opportunity to “shape it with our values.” They also point out, correctly, that while many people worry about killer robots who achieve human-level sentience and mow us all down with Uzis, a much bigger near-term danger lurks in the innocuous-seeming A.I.s we all use every day, from the feed-ranking algorithms of social media apps to the automated dispatch systems that power Uber and Lyft.“Without significant fanfare — or even visibility — we are integrating nonhuman intelligence into the basic fabric of human activity,” they write.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStill, while it could be a useful summary of A.I. for those just starting to learn about the topic, “The Age of AI” does not advance the ball much. It’s a shame, given how much access the authors presumably had to a who’s who of the A.I. elite. And it makes me wish that…Actually, you know what? It’s sunny outside, my dogs need a walk, and I don’t really feel like finishing this review. Take it away, GPT-3.…It makes me wish that someone out there would crank out a comprehensive survey text on AI, one that’s laser-focused on the technical issues, written by industry mavens who are actually doing this stuff day in and day out, and is written in an engaging, clear, plain-spoken style.I couldn’t have said it better myself.Kevin Roose is a technology columnist for The Times and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.”THE AGE OF AIAnd Our Human FutureBy Henry A.

Commissioned in 1894 for the University of Vienna, ""the Faculty Paintings""—as they became known—were unlike any of the Austrian symbolist's previous work. As soon as he presented them, critics were in an uproar over their dramatic departure from the aesthetics of the time. Professors at the university rejected them immediately, and Klimt withdrew from the project. Soon thereafter, the works found their way into other collections. During World War II, they were placed in a castle north of Vienna for safekeeping, but the castle burned down, and the paintings presumably went with it. All that remains today are some black-and-white photographs and writings from the time. Yet I am staring right at them.Well, not the paintings themselves. Franz Smola, a Klimt expert, and Emil Wallner, a machine learning researcher, spent six months combining their expertise to revive Klimt’s lost work. It’s been a laborious process, one that started with those black-and-white photos and then incorporated artificial intelligence and scores of intel about the painter’s art, in an attempt to recreate what those lost paintings might have looked like.

The idea of machine learning recreating lost or destroyed works is, like the Faculty Paintings themselves, controversial. “My chief concern is about the ethical dimension of using machine learning within the context of conservation,” says art conservator Ben Fino-Radin, “because of just the sheer volume of ethical and moral issues that have plagued the machine learning field.”Trending NowRE:WIRED 2021: What Should the Future of AI Look Like?To be sure, the use of technology to revitalize works of human artistry comes riddled with thorny questions. Even if there was a perfect AI that could figure out what colors or brushstrokes Klimt might have used, no algorithm can generate authorial intent. Debates about this have been raging for centuries. Back in 1936, before Klimt’s paintings were destroyed, essayist Walter Benjamin argued against mechanical replication, even in photographs, saying that “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.” This, Benjamin wrote in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, is what he called a work’s “aura.” For many art lovers, the notion of a computer reproducing that intangible element is preposterous, if not downright impossible.And yet, there is still a lot to be learned from what AI can do. The Faculty Paintings were pivotal in Klimt’s development as an artist, a crucial bridge between his more traditional earlier paintings and later, more radical works. But what they looked like in full color has remained shrouded in mystery. That’s the puzzle Smola and Wallner were trying to solve. Their project, organized through Google Arts and Culture, wasn’t about perfect reproductions; it was about providing a glimpse of what’s missing.For ReelAI Magic Makes Century-Old Films Look NewMatt SimonRE:WIREDTimnit Gebru Says Artificial Intelligence Needs to Slow DownMax G. LevyArtistic FreedomVirtual Museums Challenge the Art World’s Status QuoSuhita ShirodkarTo do this, Wallner developed and trained a three-part algorithm. First, the algorithm was fed some hundred thousand images of art from the Google Arts and Culture database. This helped it understand objects, artwork, and composition. Next, it was schooled specifically in Klimt’s paintings. “This creates a bias toward his colors and his motifs during the time period,” Wallner explains. And finally, the AI was fed color clues to specific parts of the paintings. But with no color references to the paintings, where did these clues come from? Even Klimt expert Smola was surprised by how much detail the writings of the time revealed. Because the paintings had been considered so sordid and weird, critics tended to describe them at length, right down to the artist’s color choices, he says. “You can call it an irony of history,” says Simon Rein, the project’s program manager. “The fact that the paintings caused a scandal and were rejected puts us in a better position to restore them because there was so much documentation. And those kinds of data points, if fed into the algorithm, create a more accurate version of how these paintings probably looked at the time.”The key to that accuracy lies in pairing the algorithm with Smola’s expertise. His research revealed that Klimt’s work during this period tends to have strong patterns and consistency. Studying existing paintings from before and after the Faculty Paintings provided clues to the colors and motifs recurring in his work at that time. Even the surprises Smola and Wallner encountered are corroborated with historical evidence. When Klimt first showed his paintings, critics noted his use of a red that was, at the time, rare in the artist’s palette. But The Three Ages of Woman, painted soon after the Faculty Paintings, boldly uses a red, one Smola believes to be the same color that caused an uproar when first seen in the Faculty Paintings. Writings from the time also raise a hue and cry about the shockingly green sky in another Faculty Painting. Pairing these writings with Smola’s knowledge of Klimt’s particular palette of greens, when fed into the algorithm, is what produced one of the first surprising images out of the AI.“As soon as you see a black-and-white picture, the first thing you do is imagine what it would look like: You assume things about a painting; you see the sky as blue,” Wallner says. As he watched the image generate, a swirling, mysterious green-tinted sky appeared in the rendering on his screen. “That was the shocking part because you see your bias,” he says. “For me, the first moment when I saw these paintings in color was like wow, this is what it looks like!”Franz Smola, an expert on Gustav Klimt, and Emil Wallner, a machine learning researcher, spent six months combining their expertise to revive Klimt’s Faculty Paintings. 
Courtesy of Klimt ProjectKlimt’s isn’t the only work getting an AI resurrection. As part of an ongoing research and conservation program called Operation Night Watch, Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is using machine learning to solve a mystery surrounding Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterpiece The Night Watch. Currently, the painting is about 15 feet wide and 12 feet tall, but that’s much smaller than the artist’s original. It was trimmed on all four sides in 1715 to fit in a new location (the deepest cut was a whopping two feet, taken from the left side). The cut pieces were never found, but Erdmann hoped machine learning could decode Rembrandt’s original vision for the painting.When Erdmann began developing his plan, his strongest data point was a 17th-century scaled-down copy by Gerrit Lundens—a painter known for his faithful reproductions of old masters—that included parts of the Rembrandt currently missing. Erdmann’s design used a series of three neural networks. With the first one, he mapped out visually matching points across both paintings. Seen side by side, scaled to the same size, it was apparent that the Lundens is faithful to the Rembrandt. However, as Erdmann toggled between a digital overlay of the two paintings, it was clear how much distortion and stretching there was in the copy. That’s where the second network came in. It warped the Lundens image, stretching it in some places and compressing it in others until most of the spatial distortion disappeared.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDWith that, the Lundens and the Rembrandt were very closely aligned. But these are still two works created by artists with their own styles. Rectifying that necessitated a third step, the one Erdmann refers to as “sending the neural network to art school.” Through a process called backpropagation, the network learned to render the Lundens in the style of Rembrandt. It created iteration after iteration, getting closer and closer until it plateaued out. Was it a perfect match? No, there’s always a loss, a limit to how close it can get.AdvertisementIllustration: Ineke de Graaff/RijksmuseumLike all new technology, AI and machine learning raise questions around usage and ethics, including when it comes to decades-old artworks. Richard Rinehart, director of the Samek Art Museum at Bucknell University, points out that working with technology has always been about determining our social contracts with it, but AI might be unique in one aspect. “Techno-social contracts have so far been decided unilaterally, but AI may be able to negotiate on its own behalf,” he says. Yet technology has always been at the heart of conservation, across material sciences, chemistry, and color science. “Bringing AI into the mix may signal a potential sea change,” Rinehart adds, “but the concept of applying technology to art is a historically accepted part of the practice, with self-critique as a healthy part of those practices.”Self-critique within the industry is what art conservator Fino-Radin would like to see more of, but their concerns run deeper. They are excited for the creative avenues this technology opens up but are wary of it being confused with restoration and conservation. “Calling AI ‘restoration,’ calling it anything that implies that it’s like bringing the artwork back to life, is a misnomer, it’s overly simplistic,” Fino-Radin says. “This kind of work belongs in the field of what’s being called Digital Art History.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDSmola and Wallner are aware of the criticisms and take pains to explain the scope and limitations of the Klimt project. “We used the photos as they were to make sure that we don’t deviate too much from the original paintings,” says Wallner. Erdmann notes that the goal behind his reconstruction was to let the public see what Rembrandt’s original composition looked like. “When I translate from the Lundens copy into the style of Rembrandt, the AI doesn’t have the ability to put the life and the genius that is Rembrandt back into the painting,” he emphasizes. “I’m not trying to do that. I don’t want to do it.” What you see at the Rijksmuseum today is the cropped painting, all that remains of the original Rembrandt. The printouts of the extended composition were on display only temporarily, from June to October 2021, and were mounted in front of the painting, not flush with it, so there was no mistaking them for the original.Rinehart sees both projects as valuable case studies in how AI can be used effectively in the art world. Instead of shying away from what this technology holds for the future, he hopes for more involvement from everyone—curators, conservators, museums, and the public. “What is important is to invite the public to follow museums along that continuum so that we use these instances to learn to see more clearly the shades of nuance and utility among ‘real’ and ‘simulacrum,’” he says.When technology produces plausible answers to age-old mysteries, does it diminish the aura of the art or artist? Ask the team at Google Arts and Culture and their answer is a straightforward and pragmatic “no.” If anything, they believe their work highlights the Faculty Paintings and heightens the mystery around Klimt, a revolutionary painter known to most only through works from his less rebellious Golden Phase. With Erdmann’s AI reconstruction, people can see Rembrandt’s original, dynamic vision for The Night Watch. Surely, this ability to visualize what is lost is a net gain.Perhaps it all comes back to aura. AI can fill in a lot of art history’s blanks, but it can’t recreate masterworks. Nothing can. “Aura does not offer a binary choice of ‘true authentic original’ versus ‘fake artificiality,’” Rinehart says. It's possible to enjoy being right in front of a painting or looking at it on a computer screen, but they're different, layered experiences. What matters is what we feel when we see them.The WIRED Resilience Residency is made possible by Microsoft. WIRED content is editorially independent and produced by our journalists.

Seen side by side, scaled to the same size, it was apparent that the Lundens is faithful to the Rembrandt. However, as Erdmann toggled between a digital overlay of the two paintings, it was clear how much distortion and stretching there was in the copy. That’s where the second network came in. It warped the Lundens image, stretching it in some places and compressing it in others until most of the spatial distortion disappeared.
With that, the Lundens and the Rembrandt were very closely aligned. But these are still two works created by artists with their own styles. Rectifying that necessitated a third step, the one Erdmann refers to as “sending the neural network to art school.” Through a process called backpropagation, the network learned to render the Lundens in the style of Rembrandt. It created iteration after iteration, getting closer and closer until it plateaued out. Was it a perfect match? No, there’s always a loss, a limit to how close it can get.
Self-critique within the industry is what art conservator Fino-Radin would like to see more of, but their concerns run deeper. They are excited for the creative avenues this technology opens up but are wary of it being confused with restoration and conservation. “Calling AI ‘restoration,’ calling it anything that implies that it’s like bringing the artwork back to life, is a misnomer, it’s overly simplistic,” Fino-Radin says. “This kind of work belongs in the field of what’s being called Digital Art History.”
Smola and Wallner are aware of the criticisms and take pains to explain the scope and limitations of the Klimt project. “We used the photos as they were to make sure that we don’t deviate too much from the original paintings,” says Wallner. Erdmann notes that the goal behind his reconstruction was to let the public see what Rembrandt’s original composition looked like. “When I translate from the Lundens copy into the style of Rembrandt, the AI doesn’t have the ability to put the life and the genius that is Rembrandt back into the painting,” he emphasizes. “I’m not trying to do that. I don’t want to do it.” What you see at the Rijksmuseum today is the cropped painting, all that remains of the original Rembrandt. The printouts of the extended composition were on display only temporarily, from June to October 2021, and were mounted in front of the painting, not flush with it, so there was no mistaking them for the original.
Rinehart sees both projects as valuable case studies in how AI can be used effectively in the art world. Instead of shying away from what this technology holds for the future, he hopes for more involvement from everyone—curators, conservators, museums, and the public. “What is important is to invite the public to follow museums along that continuum so that we use these instances to learn to see more clearly the shades of nuance and utility among ‘real’ and ‘simulacrum,’” he says.
When technology produces plausible answers to age-old mysteries, does it diminish the aura of the art or artist? Ask the team at Google Arts and Culture and their answer is a straightforward and pragmatic “no.” If anything, they believe their work highlights the Faculty Paintings and heightens the mystery around Klimt, a revolutionary painter known to most only through works from his less rebellious Golden Phase. With Erdmann’s AI reconstruction, people can see Rembrandt’s original, dynamic vision for The Night Watch. Surely, this ability to visualize what is lost is a net gain.
Perhaps it all comes back to aura. AI can fill in a lot of art history’s blanks, but it can’t recreate masterworks. Nothing can. “Aura does not offer a binary choice of ‘true authentic original’ versus ‘fake artificiality,’” Rinehart says. It's possible to enjoy being right in front of a painting or looking at it on a computer screen, but they're different, layered experiences. What matters is what we feel when we see them.

Some said they were living in “fear of the brown envelope” showing their case was being investigated. Others said they had received a phone call, without explanation as to why they had been flagged.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has previously conceded that it uses “cutting-edge artificial intelligence” to track possible fraud but has so far rebuffed attempts to explain how the algorithm behind the system was compiled. Campaigners say that once flagged, those being examined can face an invasive and humiliating investigation lasting up to a year.A legal letter has been sent to the DWP demanding details of the automated process that triggers the investigations. Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), which sent the letter with the help of campaign group Foxglove, said a “huge percentage” of the group has been affected by the system. The group believes the government has a legal duty to be transparent about how the algorithm works.Concerns were raised by the charity Privacy International, which first found references in a DWP report to its use of “cutting-edge artificial intelligence to crack down on organised criminal gangs committing large-scale benefit fraud”. A 2019 UN report into the “digital welfare state” said algorithms were “highly likely” to repeat biases reflected in existing data and make them even worse. It added: “Inbuilt forms of discrimination can fatally undermine the right to social protection for key groups and individuals.”The government has until Friday to respond to the legal letter.“We’re tired of the fear of the brown envelope and tired of being repeatedly forced by DWP officials just to justify who we are,” said Rick Burgess of the GMCDP. “It’s time for the DWP to come clean about how this algorithm works and explain why so many disabled people are flagged for investigation. Disabled people need support – not being ground down by a brutal system that assumes we are fraudulent until proven innocent.”Foxglove said: “The DWP algorithm seems to send poor and disabled people to the call centre from hell. The DWP needs to explain exactly how its algorithm works and what is done to eliminate bias – or be taken to court.”Officials stressed that specialist staff were involved in any cases of suspected fraud and error and support was offered to those who needed it. A DWP spokesperson said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the GMCDP in due course.”Explore more on these topicsDisabilityThe ObserverBenefitsManchesternewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden hasn’t done enough to ease age concerns, former top Obama adviser says – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crisis made it imperative for organisations to leverage technology and digitalise certain aspects of business, to thrive. One such technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Over the past few years, AI has matured into a collection of powerful technologies that are reinventing key functionaries, including Human Resources (HR).The implementation of AI in HR management is being viewed as an optimistic opportunity as it brings maximum value at minimum cost. AI emphasizes building tools and machines which nearly exhibit human-level intelligence while making a decision. It is driving faster, easy-to-use HR services and helping HR leaders develop personalized strategies to engage with the workforce remotely.How AI is transforming Human ResourcesAI integration into HR practices will make organisations better because these applications can analyse, predict and diagnose to help HR teams make better decisions. AI can be embedded in functions such as recruitment, training, onboarding, performance analysis, retention, etc. Some of the HRMS have AI-enabled features inbuilt, which make it even easier for HR to work with.AI helps companies to connect with current and prospective employees on a personal level. Helping them hire the right talent and provide them with the necessary support. It is an ideal tool to bring in efficiency and creating an exceptional employee experience.The scope of AI in HR is growing as it is being used to automate, speed up and accomplish a set of repetitive low-value tasks. With AI-powered chatbots handling all the queries and everyday problems, the HR department saves time. The team can thus, place greater focus on more valuable tasks such as HR strategy, HR marketing and employee engagement.The two key areas, talent acquisition and onboarding are also being automated and enhanced by AI. Talent acquired through the AI screening process is often the perfect fit for a role, with relevant skills and experience. AI also helps HR teams personalise their onboarding process to cater to each employee according to their position. It helps them verify documents automatically, get the forms filled and grant device requests. Thus, ensuring a smooth experience.Beyond helping in these core processes, the HR department can leverage the capabilities of AI to ensure the wellbeing of all employees. Devices powered by AI can gauge the mood, anxiety and stress levels of the employees through their voice and expression. They can help HR leaders understand when to step in and provide the necessary help.AI is also adding value to learning and development initiatives taken by the companies. Every individual has their own learning style and AI developments are helping companies spend less time on assessing these learning styles and develop courses that suit the broad array of preferences.The future of AI in Human ResourcesThe future of HR is both digital and human. As the norms continue to evolve to adapt to the current situation, HR leaders are adopting a people-first mindset that prioritises empathy, empowerment and resilience. This new priority of HR requires leaders and their teams to develop fluency in AI, as they reimagine HR processes to be more human, personal and intuitive.Will AI eliminate human beings from Human Resources?The answer is No. AI is a facilitator, not a complete solution. AI will not eliminate human intervention, and in fact, support it. The data-driven insights offered by AI, coupled with human interventions provide optimal solutions for challenges faced by organisations in talent management. In fact, by bringing it in as early as possible, organisations can benefit by hiring the right candidate for the role. The combination of human capabilities and artificial intelligence will also help organisations enable greater satisfaction which is both a moral and an economic imperative for businesses.To meet AI aspirations, in the long run, companies will need to invest in reliable data sets and the right implementation approach. As AI totally changes the structure and workflow in the HR department, companies will also need to have a qualified team to handle and sustain the cutting-edge technologies.The author, Manisha Kelkar, is Chief Human Resources Officer at Nuvoco Vistas Corp Ltd.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

How does a computer know that you’re really you? A few years ago, our phones began to check fingerprints and faces instead of passcodes—the type of biometric scans you used to see only in movies like Mission: Impossible. These methods are now commonplace, but they are also more fallible than you might think.
Naser Al Madi, an assistant professor in Colby’s Computer Science Department, is working with students to refine a potentially more secure way to verify a person’s identity: eye movement. With Ricky Peng ’24, he is exploring how artificial intelligence could help boost the accuracy of this promising technique.
Assistant Professor of Computer Science Naser Al Madi is investigating a potentially more secure way to verify a person’s identity—eye movement—using an eye tracker assembled in his lab to collect and analyze his own data.
It’s hard to imagine anything more unique to you than a fingerprint, or your face. But because these traits are relatively static, they are hackable. If an image can be copied, after all, it can be used to trick a sensor into perceiving it. And with the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, we also need a contact-free way to access public machines like ATMs and ticketing kiosks.
Beyond security and germ concerns, traditional scans won’t work as we become even more seamlessly integrated with our gadgets.
“Electronics are expected to move from cell phones to wearable technology like Google Glass,” Al Madi said, referencing Google’s computer embedded within eyeglasses. “You’re going to interact with a device through vision and through your eyes, and you won’t have a keyboard.” What, in that case, becomes your login signature?
Your moving eye is one option. “We don’t have a motor today that can replicate the movement of the human eye just yet,” said Al Madi. Each person has variations in the way they see, and the six muscles that control the eye can act almost like a password with six digits. But current research based on physical eye movement alone has only been able to identify people with 60-percent accuracy, he added. 
Al Madi and Peng are combining physical movement with cognitive cues to create a reliable and more accurate individual “eyeprint.” Instead of simply gauging how your eye moves as it tracks a dot, for example, machine learning can help deconstruct how a person processes a sentence. So far, they have been able to boost the accuracy of eye movement scans to 73 percent.
As a kid in elementary school during science class, Peng watched a Google video about smart home systems that could be controlled with voice and eye commands. The video made a lasting impression, sparking his interest in automation and robotics. Al Madi’s lab was a natural fit with his interests, so he applied to join. His first project was contributing to an open-source library of code that anyone could use as a toolkit to analyze and process eye movement.
The goal is to get even better accuracy to make eye movement a more realistic option for authenticating users.
Noticing Peng’s talent at writing clear code, Al Madi suggested he take on the eye movement authentication project, which they cleverly titled, “Eyes, Window to the Soul or Key to Your Computer?” and presented at Colby’s Undergraduate Summer Research Retreat in August 2021. Peng spent the summer processing an eye movement dataset called GazeBase, which was collected from more than 300 participants at Facebook Reality Labs. The dataset recorded eye movements among the participants for activities such as reading poetry and watching video.
Peng’s task was to extract, analyze, and model cognitive and linguistic features for the language-based data, such as how long readers lingered on a first word, whether the reader was likely to skip words, and how long the reading took overall.
During the summer, Peng met with Al Madi three or four days a week and also for lunch weekly. In addition to that guidance, it helped that both are night owls.
“Many times, one of us would send an email to the other after 9:00 p.m. and would get a very quick response,” Peng said. “Then we would know we were both working and would start to shoot more emails back and forth to discuss any bugs, progress, or ideas.”
Experienced readers, Peng noted, are likely to skip over common and expected words. He gave an example: “The doctor said excessive drinking could hurt your…” Many readers won’t need to actually read the word “liver” to know that it completes the sentence.
Some eye movements can take as little as 15 milliseconds, Al Madi said, and a sophisticated eye tracker will take 1,000 samples per second. Given enough time and the right task, in theory it’s possible to identify someone based on how they read. But most commonplace devices can’t accomplish this on their own: an average smartphone camera takes just 30 to 60 samples per second. One area of research, Al Madi said, is focused on training software to fill in the frames that simpler cameras wouldn’t capture, making it more feasible for eye-movement tracking eventually to go mainstream.
Having tested the linguistics-processing theory using Facebook’s dataset, Peng and other students are now using an eye tracker assembled in Al Madi’s lab to collect and analyze their own data. The goal is to get even better accuracy to make eye movement a more realistic option for authenticating users.
Ricky Peng ’24 (left) spent last summer processing an eye movement dataset called GazeBase. Peng extracted, analyzed, and modeled cognitive and linguistic features for the language-based data, such as how long readers lingered on a first word, whether the reader was likely to skip words, and how long the reading took overall. 
Even if an algorithm succeeds at identifying someone based on how they read a sentence, the same person won’t necessarily be consistent. If you’ve had your morning cup of coffee, Al Madi noted, or you’re low on sleep, that will affect your eye movement. This variation isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since such small changes can act like a password that changes itself regularly. But any successful system will need to account for such individual variations, making it a remarkably complex problem.
Still, the promise of being able to ditch passwords and scans makes the effort worthwhile. After all, Al Madi said, “nobody can steal your eye movement.”

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — There have been plenty of news reports about labor shortages and businesses unable to fill positions throughout the pandemic. But, there is another side of this story that hasn't gotten enough attention; millions of people looking for jobs and can't get hired because of online algorithms, artificial intelligence, and more.ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska sat down with St. Petersburg resident Elizabeth Longden. She showed us all of the jobs she's applied for on LinkedIn and Indeed. More than a thousand applications were filed on LinkedIn and more than 140 on Indeed.

""There are 128 pages with eight applications per page.""""That's a lot of jobs,"" Paluska said.""Yeah, a lot,"" Longden replied with a half-smile that was more of an acknowledgment of her job woes.""How do you process 1,000 plus rejections?"" Paluska asked.""It's discouraging, and fortunately, there haven't been 1,000 rejections. Most of the places don't even get back to you one way or the other,"" Longden said. ""So yeah, we're looking at less than that. But it's still a big, you know, it's a big confidence blow, especially when you hear, oh, there's a labor crisis. And nobody wants to work. And like, hi, I would like to work.""According to the Bureau of Labor, a record 4.4 million people quit their jobs in September. That's a new all-time high. So, you would think millions of openings would help Longden. But, that's not the case.Longden has a college degree, an insurance license, and a decade of work experience in human resources. In May, like many Americans throughout this pandemic, she was laid off from her company. So she took about a month off to reset and started the search in her field as an operations specialist, people ops, HR, and businesses operations.""Have you ever been in a hole where you lost a job, and you couldn't get another one in the past?"" Paluska asked.""Not where I had lost one and couldn't get another one. I'd had times where I'd moved, you know, and had had trouble finding a job for maybe a month or two. But I was always able to find something,"" Longden said.In September, the Harvard Business School released a study called Untapped Workers: Hidden Talent. The study explains this lack of hiring phenomenon. The lead author, Joseph Fuller, estimating millions of Americans are in the same position as Longden.""So, you have this, this system that systematically excludes people that may not check every box in the employer's description of what they're looking for, but can be highly qualified on multiple parameters, even those the most important for job success, but they still get excluded,"" Fuller, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School said. ""But what happens is, the employer in setting up these filters and ranking systems emphasizes some skills over others, intended to rely on two factors to make a decision.""The job search algorithms and artificial intelligence filter out candidates based on keywords before someone like Longden ever talks to a human being.""And, the algorithms are unforgiving,"" Fuller said. ""If you don't, if you don't have the right keywords, if you're just missing one of those attributes, you can get excluded from consideration even though you check every box on every other attribute they're looking for.""""Whose fault is that the company or LinkedIn or Indeed?"" Paluska asked.""You know, no company sets out to have a failed hiring process,"" Fuller said. ""They provide the tools that their customers regularly ask for. So I think this is a tragedy, without a villain. It's the way companies have gone about it is optimized around minimizing the time it takes to find candidates in minimizing the cost of finding someone to hire. There's some kind of killer variable that is causing the system to say not qualified or not attractive relative to other applicants. The vast majority of those candidates never hear back anything just ghosted.""Longden has been ghosted a lot. One recruiter called her three times in a week asking for her to apply and when she thought she got the job, radio silence. Longden thought he was dead.""I even was like, 'Are you alive?' You know, like, I just want to know, you're okay, you've just totally gone dark,"" Longden said.Longden's job search hell has her skeptical of the entire process.""I've also discovered that there's been a huge uptick in companies wanting pre-work from people. So all in all, I've probably done about 25 hours worth of pre-work for various companies, none of which has been compensated, and none of which I've even gotten a roll-out of,"" Longden said.""Do you think they are using your work for their benefit?"" Paluska asked.""Oh, I'm sure,"" Longden said. ""One of the things I was asked to create was an onboarding process for new employees. So that's what the role at the company would have been doing was onboarding their new employees as they came in. And so, one of the pre-work examples was to create an onboarding process from the offer to the 90-day mark of employment. And I did that. And I'm certain that they're having multiple people do that and pulling what they like best from everyone.""We reached out to LinkedIn and Indeed for comments but did not get a response back.""Two or three quick suggestions for Elizabeth, the first is be very, very aware of language terms, and make your submission. Match what's being asked for, to the greatest degree you can with integrity,"" Fuller said. ""The second thing I would say is, go on something like LinkedIn and look at the profiles of people who got the job you want. And what are they saying they do? What keywords are they using? Is there a regularly referenced tool that they claim expertise in that she doesn't have?""

You might still think of artificial intelligence, or AI, as something quite futuristic, but chances are you are already using it several times a day without even thinking about it. AI is everywhere, from the latest technology in entertainment, to sending a text message.

Prepare to be surprised! Even if you do not yet have a robot tending to your every need, here are ten examples of artificial intelligence hidden in your everyday life.
1. Chatbots
Getting in touch with the customer service department of many companies is a lot easier these days due the development of chatbots. It is likely you’ve used a chatbot when contacting a big brand. After opening the live chat function, you are given a list of options from which to select, then based on which option you choose, you will be given more options.
Some of the most advanced chatbots will even ask you to type a few words about why you are getting in touch. The bot recognizes certain words and uses these to bring you the content you are looking for. They are usually incredibly accurate, and you might even leave feeling like you’ve been speaking to a real person.
2. Social Media

There are many ways social media uses AI,  and many platforms couldn’t function without it. For example, artificial intelligence generates friend suggestions, and it is also used to prevent online bullying by filtering harmful content.
Most of what you see on your newsfeed is also delivered by AI. The technology recognizes the type of content you are most interested in, based on what/who you usually engage with, and then presents you with more of this content at the top of your news feed.
3. Composing a Message
Sending a text or email has become second nature to most of us, so we don’t even think about the technology behind it. Every time you misspell a word, it automatically corrects it, or offers a suggestion, AI is hard at work. Programs like Grammarly and autocorrect use artificial intelligence to detect mistakes and replace them with the correct version.
Some more sophisticated programs also use natural language processing to learn your habits. So, you might see suggested words appear as you type, based on what you usually write.
4. 3D Photographs
3D photos look really impressive, and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. Cameras or apps use AI to analyze the image depth map, to detect which areas of the image have more depth and to then generate the final 3D image.
You can view these photographs on most phones, but not all have had this capacity until recently. Watch this space because this technology could be a lot more widespread in the very near future.
5. Navigation Apps

With a map of the world in our pockets on our smartphones, we’ll never get lost again. But did you know that it is all possible thanks to the use of AI?
When you want to find directions, your phone uses artificial intelligence to plan the best route, and bring you real-time information about traffic and other disruptions. Some navigation apps also use AI to predict where you might be going based on your usual routine, and can even tell you where you parked your car.
6. Facial Recognition
Passcodes are becoming a thing of the past thanks to the invention of facial recognition, which you can use to unlock your smartphone. Facial recognition is also used by apps such as Snapchat to place filters over the face. Those familiar with the app will also know you can even use it to swap over two people’s faces.
7. Spam Filters
You might have never considered how your mailbox decides which emails are junk and which you need to read? Spam filters are yet another job done by artificial intelligence. Many of these filters are now highly effective and can filter out almost 100% of spam emails.
The filters work by recognizing specific words and phrases in a message that are generally associated with spam and junk mail. AI is constantly learning and evolving, so you can expect your inbox to get even cleaner in the future.
8. Video Recommendations
Anyone who has ever watched something on Netflix or YouTube is sure to be familiar with this. Recommendations of what to watch next, are generated by AI based on what you usually enjoy.
Recommendations aren’t just based on genre either – they also include your favorite actors, and you might find different suggestions at different times of day based on what you usually watch at that time.
9. Voice Assistants
Whether you think they are spying on your private conversations or consider them a useful part of your daily routine, voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Home rely heavily on AI. While they are already capable of performing an impressive range of tasks, this technology is expected to keep on growing over coming years.
From adding items to your shopping list to playing your favorite music, or even telling you tonight’s television schedule, AI-powered smart assistants can do some impressive things. Many users have even connected them to their ‘smart home’ system, allowing them to use their voice, and AI, to switch on the lights or control the temperature of their home.
10. Self-Driving Cars

This might not be an everyday experience for us all just yet, but the technology is now available to consumers. Autonomous vehicles may still seem quite futuristic, but they are growing in popularity enormously, with more and more manufacturers getting on board with the technology.
These vehicles use artificial intelligence to respond in real-time, just like a driver would. They can avoid collisions by sensing the environment around them and can even park themselves in both parallel and perpendicular spots. Certain models, including Tesla, can even come and pick you up outside your door, or navigate across the parking lot to fetch you right in front of the store.
These are just ten of the amazing ways artificial intelligence has already made its way into our daily routines. This is an area of technology we can expect will continue to grow and expand in the future, becoming even more integrated into our everyday lives.

RIYADH: During November Digital, the art gallery L’art pur has created a conference entitled ""How do Art and artificial intelligence work together?"".

The French ambassador, Ludvic Pouille, opened the conference by explaining the correlation between art and artificial intelligence.

He said that “The Institut français in Paris founded November digital in the year 2017. This month is dedicated to highlighting the links between these two worlds,” Pouille said.

The gallery has collaborated with the French embassy and Alliance Française in Saudi Arabia to create a special conference with the live performance of the composer SKYGGE to revive the night.

The conference also hosted the two artificial intelligence artists Daniah Al Saleh and Artur Weber who also performed a piece of their AI artwork.

Because SKYGGE is known to use artificial intelligence in his music, the concert was a mix of Artificial intelligence, music, and colourful lights.

SKYGGE explained that this kind of music is welcomed in Saudi more than his home country as he said that the saudi culture is more open to new experiences.

“Saudi culture is very cool and interesting. I think it depends on the culture, like in France they get scared from my work but here they are interested,” he said.

Dania Saleh, AI artist, performed a nine minute silent movie called “fadeaway”, and it was data sets that had been collected from the Egyptian black and white movies.

She said that she was a traditional painter then she was exposed to AI art.

“I studied computational arts, the combination between digital technology and art, I had no idea what it was but I found it very interesting,” Al Saleh added.

Lastly, Weber showed his movie entitled “can you be real with me” that he said was inspired by his own dreams.

The conceptual movie contained a black silhouette of a woman trying to catch a shadow of herself in a way that touches the viewer's emotions  with repeated phrases.

He said that he was inspired by Siri to become an AI artist.

“I decided to get into the AI world when I discovered that there are some programs that you can feed and train to get used to you just like Siri,” Weber explained.

The visitors of the gallery had an interactive experience with art. They got to explore virtual reality art by using the VR glasses and enjoyed interactive comic illustrators.
