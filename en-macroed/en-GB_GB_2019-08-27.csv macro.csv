US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he has since broken ties with it.Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as well as via investments in dozens of third-party companies.Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to become the world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030.Less workMr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think. ""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained.Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said.""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years.""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys.""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs.""Getty ImagesJack Ma is China's second richest man, according to Forbes magazineBy contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern.""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed.""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software.""He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life.""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained.""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start. ""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there.""To avoid such a fate, he said we needed to find a way to connect our brains to computers so that we could ""go along for the ride with AI"" - something he is trying to achieve via one of his latest start-ups.Otherwise, he cautioned, AI would become weary of trying to communicate with humans, as we would be much slower thinkers in comparison.""Human speech to a computer will sound like very slow tonal wheezing, kind of like whale sounds,"" Mr Musk explained.""What's our bandwidth? Like a few hundred bits per second, basically, maybe a few kilobits per second, if you're going to be generous. ""Whereas a computer can easily communicate at a terabit level. So, the computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It'll be like talking to a tree - that's humans.""It will be barely getting any information out.""Musk and Zuckerberg clash over future of AIElon Musk quits AI ethics research groupJack Ma defends the 'blessing' of a 12-hour working dayBy contrast, Mr Ma acknowledged that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time.""Don't worry about the machines,"" he said.""For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man. ""A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy. ""Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from.""Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become ""more creative and constructive"", he concluded that ""my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter"".Mr Musk responded: ""Yeah, definitely not.""It's going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,"" he added.""In fact, there's a strong argument, we're in the simulation right now.""Getty ImagesThe two men were given a range of topics to discuss but the event was unmoderatedTowards the end of the event the two men came together on one point - that concerns about overpopulation were misguided.""Assuming... there's a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,"" said Mr Musk""I want to emphasise this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse.""Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement.""One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we'll see this thing bring big trouble to China,"" he said.""And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you've got a collapse.""However, he suggested, using AI to help people live longer, healthier lives could be part of the solution.

The job portal, which connects freelancers with clients, claims to have more than 34 million people from across 247 countries. According to CEO of Freelancer(dot)com, Matt Barrie, there has been an enormous demand for any skill relating to AI and ML, and is growing continuously.

It has also added skills related to statistics and mathematics, along with mechanical engineering as top trending jobs. ""Overall, there's a heavy tech focus in this quarter's Fast 50,"" the report said.


Here's a narrative of the trending jobs on Freelancer(dot)com during Q2 2019.1/ Customer Service Customer service was the big winner in this quarter's Fast 50 report, with demand for the skill rising 54.78 per cent in Q2 2019 (from 1,913 to 2,961).

He spoke onstage with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., who is building manufacturing facilities in the city.Ma cited electricity as an example of how developments in technology could free up time for leisure. “The power of electricity is that we make people more time so that you can go to karaoke or dancing party in the evening. I think because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time enjoying being human beings.” Advertisement    He went on: “For the next 10, 20 years, every human being, country, government should focus on reforming the education system, making sure our kids can find a job, a job that only requires three days a week, four hours a day. If we don’t change the education system we are in, we will all be in trouble.”Just this year, Ma endorsed the China tech sector’s infamous 12-hours-a-day, six-days-a-week routine, so common it earned the moniker 996. In one blog post, China’s richest man this year dismissed people who expected a typical eight-hour office lifestyle, defying a growing popular backlash.“I don’t worry about jobs,” Ma said Thursday, making an optimistic case that AI will help humans rather than just eliminate their work. “Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It’s the heart where the wisdom comes from.”   Ma said the current education system was outdated — modeled for the industrial period — and that he foresaw a day when machines could outsmart humans in areas of memory and repetitive skills. He said future education systems needed to help people become more creative. Musk agreed with Ma, touting his Neuralink project, which is trying to merge the human brain with AI.“The way education works right now, it’s really low bandwidth, it’s extremely slow, lectures are the worst,” Musk said. “Down the road with Neuralink, you can just upload any subject instantly.

Jack Ma: You’ll Thank A.I. for That Ultra-Short Workweek

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma thinks that artificial intelligence (A.I.) will allow humans to work 12-hour workweeks.  
Ma made that statement while sharing a stage with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.  “I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,” Ma said, adding: “I think that because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time to enjoy being human beings. I don’t think we’ll need a lot of jobs.” (Hat tip to The Washington Post for covering the event.)  
Musk, who helped co-found OpenAI, a semi-non-profit dedicated to mitigating any existential risk from A.I., also offered that computers will surpass humans “in every single way” (per CNBC).  
Ma’s statement about A.I. radically curbing the standard workweek is more than a little ironic, considering how he’s long been a supporter of the brutal “996” workweek, in which someone grinds away from 9 AM to 9 PM six days a week. He’s also framed workers who churn long hours as “blessed.” (Musk also likes to claim that he works more than three times the average workweek, thanks to managing Tesla and private-spaceflight firm SpaceX simultaneously.)  
People have spent nearly the past century predicting that technology will someday kill the need to work “full time.” Way back in 1930, famed British economist John Maynard Keynes theorized that people would eventually work only 15 hours per week. As recently as last year, billionaire Richard Branson suggested that the three-day workweek was within reach. So this isn’t a new concept, to say the least, even long before Ma seemingly thought it was inevitable.  
However, all the technological advancements and machine learning in the world won’t eliminate one key thing about humanity: we like to work. We might not like our current job, and we might bristle at some of the responsibilities shoved upon us on a day-to-day basis, but fundamentally we’re animals who like to do things. That’s why you see technologists worth millions (or even billions) still grinding away at their projects, when they could just as easily spend the rest of their lives on a beach somewhere, watching their company’s stock price fluctuate in-between sips of a tropical drink.  
The bigger issue is A.I. and machine learning taking jobs away entirely. There’s every possibility that automation will reduce and even eliminate the need for humans to do certain tasks—programmers, datacenter administrators, help desk staff, and even data analysts could end up in a battle to the death with software that can replicate much of what they do. Even though many companies aren’t really spending all that much money on A.I. at this juncture, that could quickly change as these A.I. and machine learning tools become more sophisticated.   
It would be great if Ma’s optimistic prediction turns out right, and machines assist people to the point where they only have to work a few hours a week. But what do we do if automation begins wiping out whole industries, and the people who want (and need) to work can’t find jobs?

Billionaire Jack Ma, booster of 12-hour days, now says AI will allow 12-hour weeks

Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has vigorously endorsed China's grueling ""996"" culture, or working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. But now he has an even bolder vision for the future of work thanks to artificial intelligence: the 12-hour workweek. In the future, people may end up working only three days a week, with only four hours of work per day, Ma said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News. In Ma's view, the development of AI could free humanity to partake in activities other than work, with the entrepreneur comparing AI with the advent of electricity.""The power of electricity is that we make people more time so that you can go to karaoke or dancing party in the evening. I think because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time enjoying being human beings,"" he said, Bloomberg reported.  






But, Ma added, the emergence of AI must be paired with an overhaul of the education system to prepare new generations for a drastically changed labor market. Education reform can ensure ""our kids can find a job, a job that only requires three days a week, four hours a day. ""If we don't change the education system we are in, we will all be in trouble,"" he said.The trouble is hereMa's remark about needing to revamp education to adapt to technological shifts underscores an issue that's already affecting the labor market: job losses for workers who have been replaced by tech. One group that has felt the biggest impact is women without a college degree. 






Automation could force millions of women out of their jobs

Decades ago, these workers flocked to offices to work as administrative assistants and other clerical workers. While it's not an issue that's received as much attention as the struggles in manufacturing, the fallout in clerical jobs is ongoing, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting a 5% decline in these workers through 2026. 


That equates to a loss of almost 200,000 jobs, which are mostly filled by women who rely on this type of employment to achieve a middle-class lifestyle. Such workers aren't enjoying shortened workweeks as they are replaced by software. Instead, they're shifting to lower-paying professions, like restaurant servers and home-health aides, that often entail longer work hours.40% of jobs are at riskSo rather than free up more time for karaoke, AI and other forms of automation threaten to displace tens of millions of workers, economists and policy makers warn.""Nearly 40 percent of current U.S. jobs are in occupational categories that could shrink between now and 2030,"" McKinsey researchers wrote in a recent report on the U.S. economy. ""No community will be immune from automation-related displacement.""Workers of all ages will need to retool their skills or else risk getting sidelined, in other words. And the shifting labor dynamics may explain the surge in interest for universal income. Without steady jobs, the least skilled and poorest workers may face a dismal future, even with a 12-hour workweek.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Jack Ma and Elon Musk discuss the peril and promise of artificial intelligence at a Shanghai AI conference. (Xinhua via YouTube)
In the debate over artificial intelligence, whose side is Elon Musk on?
Musk, who’s in charge of SpaceX, Tesla and the Neuralink brain interface venture, sized up the odds with AliBaba founder Jack Ma today during a widely watched one-on-one session at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.
The way Musk sees it, the prospects aren’t great for humans if future AI agents decide to go rogue. That’s despite pronouncements from AI researchers who say machines won’t match humans anytime soon when it comes to general intelligence, as opposed to specialized AI applications such as playing chess or Go.
“The biggest mistake I see artificial intelligence researchers making is assuming that they’re intelligent,” Musk said. “Yeah, they’re not, compared to AI. And so a lot of them cannot imagine something smarter than themselves.”
Musk said future AI agents will be “vastly smarter” than humans. “So what do you do with a situation like that?” he asked. “I’m not sure. I hope they’re nice.”
For his part, Ma saw more promise than peril in AI.
“I’m not a tech guy. I think more about life,” Ma said. “I think AI is going to open a new chapter of the society of the world [in which] people try to understand ourselves better than the outside world.”

Ma said he wasn’t concerned about machines replacing humans in the workplace. “I think that because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time to enjoy human beings. I don’t think we’ll need a lot of jobs,” he said.
He went so far as to say that in the next 20 or 30 years, people could get by working three days a week, four hours a day.  (After the debate, The Washington Post noted that Ma’s prediction struck some Chinese observers as grimly ironic, in light of his past praise of a 72-hour weekly work scheme that’s known as “996” because it involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.)
Ma implied that humans would be able to keep the machines under control. “We invented a computer,” he said. “I never saw a computer invent a human being.”
Musk was far less sanguine. When Ma said “street-smart” people like himself will never be scared of AI and will always think it’s great fun, Musk replied: “I don’t know, man, that’s like ‘famous last words.’ ”
That’s why Musk is putting so much money into Neuralink, which recently reported progress in its effort to create an integrated brain-machine interface.
“If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em,” Musk said. “That’s what Neuralink is about. Can we go along for the ride with AI?”
Other memorable moments from the Musk-Ma meetup:

Ma joked that he wasn’t crazy about the term “artificial intelligence,” even though his company has a network of AI labs around the world, including in Seattle. “I call it ‘AliBaba Intelligence,” he said.
Ma took aim at Musk’s plan to send settlers to Mars on the Starship launch system he’s developing. “It’s great to send 1 million people to Mars, but we have to care about the 7.4 billion people on Earth,” he said. “How can we make the world more sustainable?” Musk replied that his efforts to advance clean energy with Tesla could make a big difference in keeping Earth sustainable, and that his vision for Mars was meant merely to ensure that humanity survives as a multiplanetary species, even if Earth suffers a catastrophe. “To be clear, I’m pro-Earth,” he said.
Musk said it looks as if it’s up to humanity to keep the flame of consciousness burning, at least in our corner of the universe. “There are people out there who think we have found aliens,” he said. “Trust me, I would know. We have not. People ask me if I’ve been to Area 51. OK, please … SpaceX actually has Area 59 — eight better than Area 51.”
Doesn’t the prowess of game-playing programs such as Google’s AlphaGo prove AI’s superiority? Ma said it would be “stupid” to say machines were smarter than humans on that basis, just as it would be wrong to dwell on an automobile’s ability to go faster than a human. He contended that competitions like track and field, or Go and chess, are meant to pit humans vs. humans, not humans vs. machines. “I never, ever play chess or Go with a computer,” Ma said.
Musk noted that he was visiting Shanghai in part to visit Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in China. Some media outlets speculated that Musk would show off the first Tesla electric car produced at the Chinese factory. Musk was also due to launch the Chinese division of his Boring Company tunneling venture.
Musk and Ma agreed that it’s hard to predict the future. Ma said “99.99% of the predictions that human beings had in history about the future — all wrong.” Which led Musk to ask, “Including that one?”

In the last 200 years, we have worried [that] new technology is going to take away all the jobs,” he said in a discussion in Shanghai with Elon Musk, Tesla’s billionaire co-founder. Tesla is building an electric-vehicle factory in the city, and the two were on the stage at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference there. Story continues below advertisementMa has previously courted controversy with his endorsement of the “996” work practices prevalent in China’s tech industry, under which employees are expected to work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.AdvertisementIn remarks earlier this year, Ma said that the opportunity to work such hours was a “blessing” and that without this kind of work culture, China’s economy was “very likely to lose vitality and impetus.”🌎Follow World newsFollowAnother tech titan went further, declaring that the 996 culture was for slackers. Richard Liu, chief executive of rival e-commerce company JD.com, said he works “8116+8” — or 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday to Saturday, then a mere eight hours on Sunday.

But speaking with Musk on Thursday, Ma said that in the future, people will be able to enjoy a much shorter workweek.Story continues below advertisement“In the next 20 to 30 years, human beings will live much longer. Life science technology is going to make people live probably 100 or 120 years,” he said. “That may not be a good thing because you get your grandfather’s grandfather still working hard.”AdvertisementBut it didn’t matter, he said, as the world wouldn’t need a lot of jobs.Artificial intelligence has been around for decades. Is it smart enough now to predict Alzheimer's?

China’s netizens were unimpressed.“Ma has said previously that 996 was a blessing.
