However, as we delve deeper into the AI landscape, we must acknowledge and understand its distinct forms. Among the emerging trends, generative AI, a subset of AI, has shown immense potential in reshaping industries. But how does it differ from traditional AI? Let's unpack this question in the spirit of Bernard Marr's distinctive, reader-friendly style.
The Difference Between Generative AI And Traditional AI: An Easy Explanation For AnyoneAdobe Stock

Traditional AI: A Brief Overview

Traditional AI, often called Narrow or Weak AI, focuses on performing a specific task intelligently. It refers to systems designed to respond to a particular set of inputs. These systems have the capability to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on that data. Imagine you're playing computer chess. The computer knows all the rules; it can predict your moves and make its own based on a pre-defined strategy. It's not inventing new ways to play chess but selecting from strategies it was programmed with. That's traditional AI - it's like a master strategist who can make smart decisions within a specific set of rules. Other examples of traditional AIs are voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation engines on Netflix or Amazon, or Google's search algorithm. These AIs have been trained to follow specific rules, do a particular job, and do it well, but they don’t create anything new.

Generative AI: The Next Frontier

Generative AI, on the other hand, can be thought of as the next generation of artificial intelligence. It's a form of AI that can create something new. Suppose you have a friend who loves telling stories. But instead of a human friend, you have an AI. You give this AI a starting line, say, 'Once upon a time, in a galaxy far away...'. The AI takes that line and generates a whole space adventure story, complete with characters, plot twists, and a thrilling conclusion. The AI creates something new from the piece of information you gave it. This is a basic example of Generative AI. It's like an imaginative friend who can come up with original, creative content. What’s more, today’s generative AI can not only create text outputs, but also images, music and even computer code. Generative AI models are trained on a set of data and learn the underlying patterns to generate new data that mirrors the training set.
PROMOTED
Consider GPT-4, OpenAI’s language prediction model, a prime example of generative AI. Trained on vast swathes of the internet, it can produce human-like text that is almost indistinguishable from a text written by a person.
The Key Difference
The main difference between traditional AI and generative AI lies in their capabilities and application. Traditional AI systems are primarily used to analyze data and make predictions, while generative AI goes a step further by creating new data similar to its training data.

In other words, traditional AI excels at pattern recognition, while generative AI excels at pattern creation. Traditional AI can analyze data and tell you what it sees, but generative AI can use that same data to create something entirely new.

Practical Implications
The implications of generative AI are wide-ranging, providing new avenues for creativity and innovation. In design, generative AI can help create countless prototypes in minutes, reducing the time required for the ideation process. In the entertainment industry, it can help produce new music, write scripts, or even create deepfakes. In journalism, it could write articles or reports. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize any field where creation and innovation are key.

On the other hand, traditional AI continues to excel in task-specific applications. It powers our chatbots, recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and much more. It is the engine behind most of the current AI applications that are optimizing efficiencies across industries.
The Future of AI
While traditional AI and generative AI have distinct functionalities, they are not mutually exclusive. Generative AI could work in tandem with traditional AI to provide even more powerful solutions. For instance, a traditional AI could analyze user behavior data, and a generative AI could use this analysis to create personalized content.
As we continue to explore the immense potential of AI, understanding these differences is crucial. Both generative AI and traditional AI have significant roles to play in shaping our future, each unlocking unique possibilities. Embracing these advanced technologies will be key for businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead of the curve in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.
We have only just started on the journey of AI innovation. Recognizing the unique capabilities of these different forms of AI allows us to harness their full potential as we continue on this exciting journey.

According to the Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra), 87% of the guild’s actors make less than $26,000 per year.‘Bargaining for our very existence’: why the battle over AI is being fought in HollywoodRead moreThe use of AI in the production of film and television – either to write scripts, generate actors’ likenesses, or cut corners in paying creative work, has been a major point of contention in negotiations between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) and Sag and the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Writers have been striking since May; the actors joined earlier this month. The first joint strike since 1960 threatens to bring Hollywood to a complete standstill.The position, first reported by the Intercept, is a new role to “increase the leverage of our machine learning platform”, billed as “the foundation for all of this innovation”. The job lists vague qualifications related to machine learning, but alludes to the company’s farther-reaching goals for AI in “all areas of business”. A separate “machine learning” section on the company’s website says the company will use AI to “shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful” and to “optimize the production of original movies and TV shows”.This is not the only new AI position sought by Netflix. The Intercept reported that the company is also seeking to hire a technical director for generative AI at its gaming studio for up to $650,000 a year. Generative AI can produce text, images and video from input data, which could be used to create original content or for advertising purposes. The company’s generative AI efforts have already borne fruit: earlier this month, Netflix premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, Deep Fake Love, in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create “deepfake” simulations of themselves, and the company’s gaming department has used AI to produce narratives and dialogue.Disney has also listed several machine learning-related positions, though it has not specified the salary range. During a recent earnings call, chief executive Bob Iger, who has called actors’ and writers’ demands for greater compensation “unrealistic”, hinted at potential issues the company could face in integrating AI into their business model. “In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” he said, as reported by journalist Lee Fang.“But it’s also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.”AI has been an intense flashpoint in the first few weeks of the joint strike, especially after Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Sag-Aftra’s chief negotiator, said that studios had “proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for rest of eternity, on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation”.The AMPTP has disputed that description as a “mischaracterization” of their proposal meant to “garner support for its work stoppage.”Explore more on these topicsCultureUS actors' strike 2023Artificial intelligence (AI)NetflixUS writers' strike 2023Film industryComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveKamala Harris campaign announces raising record $81m in first 24 hours of candidacy – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

LIKE IT or not, the age of generative AI is upon us. Anyone with an internet connection now has access to tools that can answer almost every question under the sun, write everything from university essays to computer code and produce art or photorealistic images.
The jury is still out on whether all this represents a stride towards super-intelligent AI. Even if progress stagnates, however, the capabilities available today could profoundly affect the economy, jobs, education, culture and more. So how is the current generation of AI going to reshape the world, and your life, in the next five to 10 years?
Broadly speaking, forecasters are predicting that generative AI will boost economic productivity and growth in advanced economies. A report released by Goldman Sachs in March predicts that generative AI could, within a decade, raise annual global GDP by 7 per cent, which translates to a roughly $7 trillion increase. “The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer,” says the report.
The idea is that AI will make millions of “knowledge workers”, like scientists, editors, lawyers and doctors, more productive within a few years. But the truth is that these things are hard to predict and assess, especially as the output of such workers is notoriously difficult to measure.
One area where generative AI is stoking anxiety is employment, but the picture could be different to previous waves of automation, says Avi Goldfarb…

Changing Workforce Underscores Growth of Artificial Intelligence

              July 26, 2023            











As a disruptive technology, artificial intelligence is also looking to disrupt the workforce, altering the demand for more skilled labor that supplements the use of AI.
According to a HR Today article, a Cengage Group’s 2023 Employability Report surveyed 1,000 graduates who completed a degree or non-degree program in the last 12 months along with 1,000 U.S. hiring decision makers. As AI technology comes to the forefront and is permeating business operations in various sectors, over half of graduates said that AI is forcing them to re-think their skillset and how to best prepare for this technological revolution.
“The workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries,” said Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group. “With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today’s workers for these technological shifts.”
As the trend continues and companies are shifting to hiring AI-related skills, it opens up opportunities for exchange traded fund (ETF) investors. Short-term traders looking to capitalize on the moves can also take advantage of the shift as well.



Trade the AI Trend
In particular, for the short term, consider the Direxion Daily Robotics, Artificial Intelligence & Automation Index Bull 2X ETF (UBOT). UBOT seeks daily investment results equal to 200% of the daily performance of the Indxx Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index, which aims to provide exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed markets expected to benefit from the adoption and utilization of robotics and/or artificial intelligence.
Key characteristics of UBOT:

The Indxx Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index (IBOTZNT) is designed to provide exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed markets that are expected to benefit from the adoption and utilization of robotics and/or artificial intelligence, including companies involved in developing industrial robots and production systems, automated inventory management, unmanned vehicles, voice/image/text recognition, and medical robots or robotic instruments, as determined by the index provider, Indxx.
Companies must have a minimum market capitalization of $100 million and a minimum average daily turnover for the last six months greater than or equal to $2 million in order to be eligible for inclusion in the index.

Plans on the agenda to develop artificial intelligence


Society


July 25, 2023 - 16:42






TEHRAN - The Vice Presidency for Science and Technology has prepared three comprehensive plans to develop artificial intelligence in different sectors.Currently, artificial intelligence is the first priority for the development of technology and is pursued with three programs, IRNA quoted Rouhollah Dehqani-Firouzabadi, the vice president for science and technology, as saying.
Artificial intelligence is a comprehensive technology and affects all other areas of technology, he highlighted.
“The plans in the field of artificial intelligence include scientific development programs that are mostly pursued in universities. The second plan is technology development programs that are pursued in companies that work in the field of artificial intelligence. And the third plan is the creation of a national technology hub in the field of artificial intelligence.""
AI roadmap
Last year, the roadmap for the development of artificial intelligence was drafted after a year of scientific work with the participation of academic and industrial figures from both the public and the private sectors.
The study of the national artificial intelligence development roadmap document started in 2021 at the Research Institute of Information and Communication Technology and was officially completed by the end of November 2022.
The document is presented in two general sections, “application development” and “development of enablers”, Mohammad-Shahram Moein, head of the innovation and development center of artificial intelligence at the Research Institute of Information and Communication Technology, said.
“In the application development section, the main goal is to use artificial intelligence in priority areas such as health, transportation, and agriculture, and in the next priorities, areas such as education, industry, and environment have been considered.
In the development of enablers, we have considered the training of specialized manpower, the development of infrastructure, and the development of the innovation system,” he explained.
The AI roadmap document includes 10 major goals, 9 strategies, and 156 activities for which a ten-year horizon is envisaged, he said.
In order to develop the processing infrastructure, we have started equipping the ultra-fast processing center of the Center for Innovation and Development of Artificial Intelligence. We have also addressed the issues of regulation and standardization, which are very important, in addition to the implementation of service delivery platforms and infrastructures, data markets, and open data.
Moein expressed hope that in the framework of ethical issues while protecting the privacy of individuals, implement the document with the participation of all related institutions and witness its positive impact on the country’s ecology and employment.
Iran’s progress in artificial intelligence
Iran is in 13th place among the top countries in artificial intelligence by the total number of publications in 2021, according to the Nature Index database.
The SCImago ranking database at the University of Granada, Spain, ranks countries and universities based on the number of scholarly articles from higher education institutions in the Scopus database. This ranking uses three indicators of research, innovation, and society in combination.
In the 2020 version of SCImago, the subject of artificial intelligence is a subcategory of computer science, which ranks Iran as 15th in the world and first in West Asia.
Also, in cognitive sciences as a subset of psychology, which is one of the disciplines related to artificial intelligence, Iran ranks 36th in the world and third in West Asia.
In electrical and electronic engineering, which has a part of artificial intelligence, Iran is ranked 15th in the world and first in West Asia.
AI potential to accelerate human development
The UN Secretary-General addressed the Security Council on Tuesday, emphasizing the potential of artificial intelligence to accelerate human development while also cautioning against the malicious use of what is revolutionary new technology.
António Guterres said that if AI became primarily a weapon to launch cyberattacks, generate deepfakes, or for spreading and hate speech, it would have very serious consequences for global peace and security. “Look no further than social media.
Tools and platforms that were designed to enhance human connection are now used to undermine elections, spread conspiracy theories, and incite hatred and violence,” he said.
“Malfunctioning AI systems are another huge area of concern. And the interaction between AI and nuclear weapons, biotechnology, neurotechnology, and robotics, is deeply alarming.”
Importance of science and technology
In July 2022, Peyman Salehi, the deputy science minister, said despite U.S. sanctions, the international activities of Iranian scientists have increased year by year so that more than 35 percent of Iranian articles in Scopus have been multi-national projects.
Science diplomacy is the use of scientific collaborations among nations to address common problems and build constructive international partnerships.
It is a form of new diplomacy and has become an umbrella term to describe a number of formal or informal technical, research-based, academic, or engineering exchanges, within the general field of international relations.
The national budget bill for the current Iranian calendar year 1402, which started on March 21, has earmarked about 37 trillion rials ($75 million) for science and technology.
The bill increased the budget by 35 percent compared to the past year’s budget, ISNA reported.
The Vice Presidency for Science and Technology was formed in 2006 with the aim of creating an environment for supporting knowledge-based companies and providing the ground for the development of technological industries.
A total of 8,034 knowledge-based companies have so far been established across the country.
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei designated the current Iranian calendar year as the year of “Production: Knowledge-Based and Job-Creating.”
Over the past couple of years, the concept of a ‘knowledge-based company’ has changed to a ‘knowledge-based society’, meaning that supporting knowledge-based companies will lead to many social and economic advantages for the public.
The Leader reemphasized the importance of boosting domestic production, as he had done in past years, saying the reason he placed so much emphasis on production was “because it boosts economic growth, it creates employment, it reduces inflation, it increases per capita income and it improves public welfare.”
To this end, the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology has executed and supported several projects toward the goal of boosting knowledge-based production.
Moreover, the development of an innovation ecosystem is on the agenda, according to which 65 houses of innovation have been set up across the country.
The Innovation and Prosperity Fund has paid a total of 240 trillion rials (nearly $500 million) to support knowledge-based companies over the [Iranian calendar] year 1400 (March 2021-March 2022). MG

Signed by more than 9,000 writers, including prominent authors like George Saunders and Margaret Atwood, it asked the likes of Alphabet, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft “to obtain consent, credit, and fairly compensate writers for the use of copyrighted materials in training AI.” The plea is just the latest in a series of efforts by creatives to secure credit and compensation for the role they claim their work has played in training generative AI systems.You DiedGenerative AI in Games Will Create a Copyright CrisisWill BedingfieldStage LeftWhy Hollywood Really Fears Generative AIWill BedingfieldArtificial IntelligenceHollywood’s Screenwriters Are Right to Fear AIWill BedingfieldThe training data used for large language models, or LLMs, and other generative AI systems has been kept clandestine. But the more these systems are used, the more writers and visual artists are noticing similarities between their work and these systems’ output. Many have called on generative AI companies to reveal their data sources, and—as with the Authors Guild—to compensate those whose works were used. Some of the pleas are open letters and social media posts, but an increasing number are lawsuits.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTIt’s here that copyright law plays a major role. Yet it is a tool that is ill equipped to tackle the full scope of artists’ anxieties, whether these be long-standing worries over employment and compensation in a world upended by the internet, or new concerns about privacy and personal—and uncopyrightable—characteristics. For many of these, copyright can offer only limited answers. “There are a lot of questions that AI creates for almost every aspect of society,” says Mike Masnick, editor of the technology blog Techdirt. “But this narrow focus on copyright as the tool to deal with it, I think, is really misplaced.”Featured VideoPro Interpreters vs. AI Challenge: Who Translates Faster and Better?The most high-profile of these recent lawsuits came earlier this month when comedian Sarah Silverman, alongside four other authors in two separate filings, sued OpenAI, claiming the company trained its wildly popular ChatGPT system on their works without permission. Both class-action lawsuits were filed by the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which specializes in antitrust litigation. The firm is also representing the artists suing Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for similar reasons. Last week, during a hearing in that case, US district court judge William Orrick indicated he might dismiss most of the suit, stating that, since these systems had been trained on “five billion compressed images,” the artists involved needed to “provide more facts” for their copyright infringement claims.The Silverman case alleges, among other things, that OpenAI may have scraped the comedian’s memoir, Bedwetter, via “shadow libraries” that host troves of pirated ebooks and academic papers. If the court finds in favor of Silverman and her fellow plaintiffs, the ruling could set new precedent for how the law views the data sets used to train AI models, says Matthew Sag, a law professor at Emory University. Specifically, it could help determine whether companies can claim fair use when their models scrape copyrighted material. “I'm not going to call the outcome on this question,” Sag says of Silverman’s lawsuit. “But it seems to be the most compelling of all of the cases that have been filed.” OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment.At the core of these cases, explains Sag, is the same general theory: that LLMs “copied” authors’ protected works. Yet, as Sag explained in testimony to a US Senate subcommittee hearing earlier this month, models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 do not “copy” work in the traditional sense. Digest would be a more appropriate verb—digesting training data to carry out their function: predicting the best next word in a sequence. “Rather than thinking of an LLM as copying the training data like a scribe in a monastery,” Sag said in his Senate testimony, “it makes more sense to think of it as learning from the training data like a student.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThis is pertinent to fair use, the part of US copyright law that generally protects the unlicensed use of copyrighted works for things like scholarship and research. Because if the analogy is correct, then what’s going on here is akin to how a search engine builds its index—and there’s a long history of Google using exactly this argument to defend its business model against claims of theft. In 2006 the company defeated a suit from Perfect 10, an adult entertainment site, for providing hyperlinks and thumbnails of subscriber-only porn in its search results. In 2013 it convinced a New York court that scanning millions of books, and making snippets of them available online, constituted fair use. “In my view, Google Books provides significant public benefits,” US circuit judge Denny Chin wrote in his ruling. In 2014, a judge found in favor of HathiTrust Digital Library, a spinoff of Google Books, in a similar case.Sag reckons that defendants in similar generative AI lawsuits will use a similar augment: Yes, data goes in, but what comes out is something quite different. Therefore, while it might seem commonsensical that a human reading and a machine “reading” are inherently different activities, it’s not clear the courts will see it that way. And there’s another question mark lingering over whether a machine can make a derivative work at all, says Daniel Gervais, a professor of intellectual property and AI law at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee: The US Copyright Office maintains that only humans can produce “works.”If the arguments from the defense hold, then there’s the matter of where those books came from. Several of the experts WIRED spoke to agree that one of the more compelling arguments against OpenAI centers on the secretive data sets the company allegedly used to train its models. The claim, appearing verbatim in both of the recent lawsuits, is that the Books2 data set, which the lawsuits estimate contains 294,000 books, must, by its very size, hold pirated material. “The only internet-based books corpora that has ever offered that much material are notorious ‘shadow library’ websites like Library Genesis (aka LibGen), Z-Library (aka B-ok), Sci-Hub, and Bibliotik,” the lawsuits claim.The reason OpenAI would plunder pirated data is simple: These sites contain a bounty of the highest-quality writing, on a massive range of subjects, produced by a diverse range of authors. Sag argues that the use of copyrighted works such as books may have helped make LLMs “more well-rounded,” something that may have been difficult if, say, they were only trained on Reddit posts and Wikipedia articles.There's no precedent in the US that directly links fair use with whether the copyrighted works were obtained legally or not. But, says Sag, there's also no stipulation that unlawful access is irrelevant in such cases. (In the European Union, it's stipulated that data-mining operations must get legal access to the information they use.)Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenOne way to look at this problem is to claim that lawful access is irrelevant to inspiration, an argument Masnick recently made on Techdirt. “If a musician were inspired to create music in a certain genre after hearing pirated songs in that genre, would that make the songs they created infringing?” he wrote.Masnick’s worry is that some stricter imagining of copyright infringement, aiming to rein in generative AI, could have an unintended chilling effect on creativity. Earlier this year, the US Copyright Office launched an initiative to investigate AI issues. “I fear that saying ‘we can’t learn from these other artists without compensating them,’ creates really big problems for the way that that art is created and the way that content creators learn,” he says. “The normal way that content creators of all stripes become their own content creators is they see someone else and they are inspired by them.”On the other hand, if someone spends years writing a novel, shouldn't copyright ensure that they are compensated if someone else uses their works for commercial purposes? “You could frame this as undermining the incentives of the copyright system,” says Sag. Simply put, if generative AI systems can scrape copyrighted works without compensating writers and churn out something in a similar style, does that lower the incentives for people to create such works in the first place?These lawsuits, even if they are unsuccessful, are likely to provoke generative AI companies into taking steps to avoid them. These steps are unlikely to make happy reading for artists. These firms could, for example, obtain licensing agreements to use copyrighted works in their training data. It's been widely reported that this would be analogous to how, say, Spotify licenses music—albeit on controversial terms—in a way the original version of Napster didn’t. Drake, for example, could license out his discography so fans can conjure Drake-like AI croonings of their own.Another possible future sees artists asked to opt in to allowing their work to be used as training data. Roblox, which has been cautious with its in-house tools, is considering a model like this for content made by its users, while Adobe has been similarly careful with Firefly, training it on Adobe Stock images and licensed and public domain content. The Associated Press also recently announced a deal to license its news stories to OpenAI.Ultimately, though, the technology is not going away, and copyright can only remedy some of its consequences. As Stephanie Bell, a research fellow at the nonprofit Partnership on AI, notes, setting a precedent where creative works can be treated like uncredited data is “very concerning.” To fully address a problem like this, the regulations AI needs aren't yet on the books.",The Generative AI Battle Has a Fundamental Flaw,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Culture', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/culture/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Intellectual Property', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/intellectual-property/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'The Generative AI Battle Has a Fundamental Flaw'}]",,,culture,True,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/64bf0d2ac859c4a1cdecc4c5/2:3/w_1200,h_1800,c_limit/Generative-AI-Battle-Flaw-Copyright-Culture-1176669763.jpg",,Writers and artists want compensation from AI firms that they claim have trained their models on copyrighted works.

One way to look at this problem is to claim that lawful access is irrelevant to inspiration, an argument Masnick recently made on Techdirt. “If a musician were inspired to create music in a certain genre after hearing pirated songs in that genre, would that make the songs they created infringing?” he wrote.
Masnick’s worry is that some stricter imagining of copyright infringement, aiming to rein in generative AI, could have an unintended chilling effect on creativity. Earlier this year, the US Copyright Office launched an initiative to investigate AI issues. “I fear that saying ‘we can’t learn from these other artists without compensating them,’ creates really big problems for the way that that art is created and the way that content creators learn,” he says. “The normal way that content creators of all stripes become their own content creators is they see someone else and they are inspired by them.”
On the other hand, if someone spends years writing a novel, shouldn't copyright ensure that they are compensated if someone else uses their works for commercial purposes? “You could frame this as undermining the incentives of the copyright system,” says Sag. Simply put, if generative AI systems can scrape copyrighted works without compensating writers and churn out something in a similar style, does that lower the incentives for people to create such works in the first place?
Another possible future sees artists asked to opt in to allowing their work to be used as training data. Roblox, which has been cautious with its in-house tools, is considering a model like this for content made by its users, while Adobe has been similarly careful with Firefly, training it on Adobe Stock images and licensed and public domain content. The Associated Press also recently announced a deal to license its news stories to OpenAI.
Ultimately, though, the technology is not going away, and copyright can only remedy some of its consequences. As Stephanie Bell, a research fellow at the nonprofit Partnership on AI, notes, setting a precedent where creative works can be treated like uncredited data is “very concerning.” To fully address a problem like this, the regulations AI needs aren't yet on the books.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How is generative AI relevant to telecom operators?

Discussion around generative AI has quickly become a mainstay in conference presentations and earnings calls. The predominant thinking is that if you’re an enterprise, including a mobile network operator or other communications service provider, you’ve got to have a plan to put generative AI to work. So, to start, are generative AI tools like ChatGPT relevant to the telecoms set? 
Speaking on a recent webinar hosted by RCR Wireless News, VIAVI Solutions Regional CTO for EMEA Chris Murphy explained that solutions like ChatGPT, Midjourney and the like have garnered so much attention because their outputs are “readily tangible and visualizable…but this is just a start…In specialized areas such as telecoms, generative models are starting to have quite an impact and that impact is only going to grow as time goes on.” Murphy was also quick to point out that these types of generative AI tools are “part of a whole ecosystem of the technology of machine learning and artificial intelligence.” 
Before digging deeper, let’s take a moment to recap types of classic machine learning algorithms that have reached a comparatively high degree of maturity, new innovations in machine learning, and new innovations effectively upgrading tech that’s been around for decades. Mature machine learning algorithms include things like regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Newer machine learning innovations–which are also giving a material boost classic approaches–include things like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, automated machine learning and, of course, content generation. 
As Murphy put it, “There are whole new disruptions in the technology from transfer learning allowing us to train models in a general sense and then apply them to a particular focus area. Reinforcement learning where we can learn to interact with the system in an optimal way, and auto ML where we can automate, to some degree, the generation of the machine learning models and the way we train it to take away some of the expertise that’s needed to generate some of these very interesting applications.” This idea of taking a large, general model then honing the focus for a particular type of business or type of business process aligns with how enterprises are actually using generative AI; enterprises are using models trained on domain-specific, proprietary data rather than the collective knowledge of humanity as it exists online. 
Back to the relevance of ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools to the telecom industry: “We’re starting to see operators implementing large language models for helping their to do their jobs in better, more creative ways.” AT&T, for instance, in June announced Ask AT&T, an internal tool that uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT functionality that uses corporate data in a dedicated cloud tenant provide by Microsoft’s Azure. AT&T employees are using Ask AT&T to streamline software development and coding, and language translation. Other use cases the operator is “exploring” are network optimizing, updating legacy code, customer care effectiveness, HR support, “and fundamentally changing the way we work with the ability to reduce employee meeting time by providing automated summaries and action items.” 
What else can generative AI do for operators? 
The big idea behind generative AI is predicting what’s next. You give ChatGPT a text-based prompt and it tells you which words come next, whether that’s to write a poem, draft an academic essay, supplement web searches or assist in developing code or HR documentation. “When we can predict the future,” Murphy said, “we can come prepared for it ahead of time in spinning up the resources required. If we anticipate an increase in demand, we can run what-if scenarios, for example, to measure our resilience to certain scenarios.”

He continued: “We can generate synthetic data, which is tremendously valuable, for example, for training our models using realistic data without having to collect that realistic data in large volumes. And this all leads into things like digital twin, which is an enabler for all sorts of training scenarios of optimization to drive our telecommunication networks to the next level…ChatGPT is in the collective consciousness, but I guess what I’m saying is that this is just one small piece of what’s going on in the technology, and there’s a lot more that will be at least as important as the large language models are for telecommunications.” For more on this idea of creating a digital twin of the network, read “From real to lab to live—continuous testing in the era of AI.”
Generative AI at the edge
Big picture, 5G is continuing to evolve and continuing to become more complex. Virtualization and disaggregation are happening in tandem with deployment of network workloads in hybrid cloud environments, including distributed clouds deep in the network at radio sites or even at customer premises. This is prompting organizational overhauls wherein operators are establishing DevOps workflows and setting up CI/CD pipelines to take advantage of the network’s flexibility. And all of this is in service of delivering new types of (largely) enterprise-facing services that set the stage for new lines of revenue and more effective network monetization.
Against this dynamic, complex backdrop, data is king. “The data can be aggregated in different ways, everything from subscriber level, the individual user level through to aggregated by network function and network components,” Murphy said. “So we’ve got a lot of data. That’s good news because we’ve got some interesting models, but we have to be careful about how we use the data…If we’re making decisions about how to schedule our data or how to adapt our MIMO, these decisions need to be made right at the edge because those are very short-term decisions based on the channel conditions, for example, and we need to be able to react to those changes.” 
With the goal of leveraging data to predict the future then prepare to react accordingly, the edge is an important focal point in the larger context of 5G monetization. 5G is designed to support low-latency applications over the air interface, but to do this requires moving compute out of centralized data centers and  closer to the people and devices creating the data. “There’s an interesting challenge here of how to deal with the data that we have to squeeze the maximum value out of…So the data that we use for training, it may be generated at the edge and be in large volumes. And we might want to be careful about transferring [that data] to the datacenter for training models which then need to be operated at the edge.” Hence the importance of AI optimized for edge deployments. 
In summary, “We’re lucky to have a lot of data that we can draw on to build the best models, train in the right place, in the optimal place, operate in the optimal place to deliver performance improvements and the ability to deliver the interesting and disruptive services,” Murphy said.

High levels of labor productivity are largely due to the use of new technologies in the processes of producing goods and offering services.

As some of the work done by humans will be taken over by artificial intelligence then perhaps there will be an opportunity to reduce working hours for humans. When this kind of solution is applied then labor productivity should not decline, as productivity will be maintained at a certain level or will increase and employed citizens will have more time for personal activities, leisure, hobbies, for family, dal to develop personal passions, etc. and thus can be more productive and creative during work time.\n\nIn view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:\nIn view of the development of artificial intelligence, which is increasingly replacing humans in the performance of various activities and professions, and in a situation of increasing labor productivity through its greater automation and objectification, should people&#x27;s working time be reduced?\nAccordingly, should people&#x27;s working hours be reduced, for example, from 5 working days per week to 4 working days?\nWith the development of artificial intelligence and the increase in the scale of its applications in the production of goods and the provision of services, should people&#x27;s working time be reduced?\nWill the increase in the scale of applications of artificial intelligence make it possible to reduce people&#x27;s working time?\n\nAnd what is your opinion about it?\n\nWhat is your opinion on this issue?\n\nPlease answer,\n\nI invite you all to join the discussion,\n\nThank you very much,\n\nThe key issues of opportunities and threats to the development of artificial intelligence technologies are described in my article below:\nOPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS AND THE NEED FOR NORMATIVE REGULATION OF THIS DEVELOPMENT\n\nOPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL I... \n\nPlease write what you think in this issue?

But for healthcare providers, &#x22;paperwork&#x22; expands. For a doctor to perform services and be paid by various insurance or reimbursment systems, the doctor may now have to provide documentation about WHY a treatment was chosen as the appropriate measure, what is the literature or experimental justification for the medical procedure? The incremental value of this extra effort is by no means obvious, but a complex medical system may drift towards requiring such new things.

For example if we look upon the working of the IIOT(Industrial Internet of Things), all the manual work or the physical work is done by the robots or the machines or even the M2M level machines if smart devices are not required. In such ecosystems the humans are only only keeping the supervisory controllers or the cyber physical system controllers. They make the algorithm, models, etc. for the machines, this saves a lot of time and human efforts. There are still such jobs that work on the physical layer but are quite scarce, these people are mainly into the maintenance of the machines. We will take another an example that is related to the medical sciences, The drug testing would be faster  and safer if we use AI, for example, if a drug has to be tested on a tissue for let&#x27;s say the researchers are finding a drug that would be more cytotoxic for the tumor that has been growing on the tissue and would be a safer alternative than the existing drugs. To do this process manually it would take many days to find out the results and would be more costly as they have to maintain the health of the tissue artificially int the lab, but if we do it with the help of AI the prediction models would take significantly less time to analyze and predict the result as well as less man power would be needed and it would be more cost efficient.\nConclusion: With the increasing popularity in the field of AI the people won&#x27;t lose jobs, if they are kept updated with the modern technical knowledge. The AI will definitely decrease the number of manual jobs but will open many other. In my perspective the people should adapt to the modern technology and the knowledge associated with it. There is too much more to explore in this field that the people won&#x27;t get chance to reduce their workload. Also the growth in all the sectors would increase exponentially with AI.\n\nThank you\nadityaajmi@gmail.com', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-28T18:19:50+00:00', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/post/Will_the_increase_in_the_scale_of_artificial_intelligence_applications_make_it_possible_to_reduce_human_labor_hours#view=64c406c618d1274fb9095196', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aditya Ingole', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Ingole-4'}}, {'@type': 'Answer', 'upvoteCount': 1, 'text': 'For the first time since 1960, actors and screenwriters are on strike at the same time.\nAs with many of the other strikes that have rippled across the United States over the past three years, this walkout is over demands for better pay and restrictions on their employers&#x2019; use of technology to replace paid work...\nAlthough residuals and the number of episodes have until now been negotiable, perhaps the strike&#x2019;s biggest issue is the studios&#x2019; use of artificial intelligence.\nActors fear studios will use AI to replace actors in the future.

Let&#x27;s delve into this paradigm shift in the milieu of human work engagement.\nAI&#x27;s potential in redefining work hours is a premise we cannot sidestep. With an increasing array of tasks capable of automation, the quantum of human engagement reduces, positing a potential shift to a shorter work week and enhanced leisure space. Nonetheless, the following critical considerations warrant attention:\nOccupational Transmutation: While AI is capable of driving efficiency, it&#x27;s also a catalyst for job displacement, particularly for roles centered around manual and routine tasks. This necessitates societal constructs that help transition individuals impacted by this metamorphosis.\nSectoral Disparity: The penetration and impact of AI vary across industries and job roles. Occupations requiring multifaceted decision-making, innovative ideation, or superior interpersonal skills are less prone to full automation. Consequently, a homogeneous reduction in working hours may not be applicable across the board.\nEconomic Shift: Implementing a reduction in work hours demands a significant alteration in our prevailing economic structures. Despite the potential for augmented leisure, it may concomitantly cause a contraction in income unless remuneration models are recalibrated.\nSociocultural Adaptation: A significant dimension is the societal value associated with work, transcending pure economics to encompass social and psychological constructs. A sizable reduction in work hours would demand a concomitant transition in societal attitudes encompassing work and leisure.\nConsidering these multifaceted elements, the proposition of reduced work hours in light of AI advancements is fascinating, albeit layered with complexity. The viability of such a transformation would likely hinge on myriad factors - the rate of AI evolution, institutional responses, societal adaptation to evolving work-leisure paradigms, and more.\nThis topic undoubtedly merits ongoing scholarly discourse and empirical research.', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-31T18:27:03+00:00', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/post/Will_the_increase_in_the_scale_of_artificial_intelligence_applications_make_it_possible_to_reduce_human_labor_hours#view=64c7fcf64a266d60fe06b825', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Subharun Pal', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subharun-Pal'}}, {'@type': 'Answer', 'upvoteCount': 5, 'text': 'AI has already begun to impact the job and work environment, and this trend will continue.

How does ChatGPT work and do AI-powered chatbots “think” like us?
The large language models behind the new chatbots are trained to predict which words are most likely to appear together – but “emergent abilities” suggest they might be doing more than that

Illustronaut/Alamy
The current whirlwind of interest in artificial intelligence is largely down to the sudden arrival of a new generation of AI-powered chatbots capable of startlingly human-like text-based conversations. The big change came last year, when OpenAI released ChatGPT. Overnight, millions gained access to an AI producing responses that are so uncannily fluent that it has been hard not to wonder if this heralds a turning point of some sort.
There has been no shortage of hype. Microsoft researchers given early access to GPT4, the latest version of the system behind ChatGPT, argued that it has already demonstrated “sparks” of the long-sought machine version of human intellectual ability known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). One Google engineer even went so far as to claim that one of the company’s AIs, known as LaMDA, was sentient. The naysayers, meanwhile, insist that these AIs are nowhere near as impressive as they seem.
All of which can make it hard to know quite what you should make of the new AI chatbots. Thankfully, things quickly become clearer when you get to grips with how they work and, with that in mind, the extent to which they “think” like us.
At the heart of all these chatbots is a large language model (LLM) – a statistical model, or a mathematical representation of data, that is designed to make predictions about which words are likely to appear together.
LLMs are created by feeding huge amounts of text to a class of algorithms called deep neural networks, which are loosely inspired by the brain. The models learn complex linguistic patterns by playing a simple game:…

Women are overrepresented in these sectors — and hold more low-paying jobs than men — so they stand to be more affected, the report finds.Black and Hispanic workers, workers without college degrees, and the youngest and oldest workers also are more likely to have to find new jobs by 2030, the study says.Story continues below advertisementAccording to the report, by 2030, at least 12 million workers will need to change jobs as the industries in which they work shrink — 25 percent more than the institute predicted in a report published in February 2021. Most of those workers will be at the low end of the pay scale, and they probably will need to acquire new skills before they can transition into new industries.AdvertisementThe report says the labor market also will be upended over the next decade by the government’s investments in green technology, the growing demand for health-care workers as the U.S. population ages and the structural changes to the workforce brought about by the pandemic. It says these trends will converge with advancements in artificial intelligence to increase demand for some existing jobs, create new jobs for new industries and make other jobs obsolete.How artificial intelligence could affect the workforce and the global economyToday’s low-wage workers are the most vulnerable to job losses by 2030 across all categories, according to the McKinsey report. It finds that workers earning less than $38,200 could account for almost 80 percent of all potential career transitions in that period. This means that retail salespeople, cashiers and other low-wage workers — among whom a larger proportion are women — are particularly vulnerable.Story continues below advertisementAlthough advances in artificial intelligence will make some jobs obsolete, it also could have some positive effects on existing jobs and create new work opportunities, according to the report. For white-collar workers, automation could mean less time doing rote or technical tasks, and more time spent on creative or strategic work that artificial intelligence cannot do — yet. The report finds that lawyers and civil engineers are among the workers who stand to benefit most. But workers in more-manual fields, such as health care or agriculture, do tasks that cannot be automated as easily.Advertisement“We see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright,” the authors wrote.💻Follow TechnologyFollowBut these fields are male-dominated. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2022, women accounted for only 17.1 percent of civil engineers and 38.5 percent of lawyers.AI learned from their work. Now they want compensation.While new technologies are expected to create new jobs, those jobs may not all be desirable, says Kerry McInerney, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University. Workers who are more likely to be in low-paying jobs with long hours or difficult conditions today could in the future “get pushed into areas like data labeling,” which is the process of adding labels to videos, images or audio that teach machine learning models to recognize what is in them. Those jobs “can be psychologically very harmful,” because of the nature of the material that has to be identified, McInerney says.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe findings align with existing research showing that women will be affected by the waves of workforce automation differently from men.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.The Persian Gulf is enduring life-threatening heat indexes above 140 degreesSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Paul Hollywood is right: Don’t refrigerate breadSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Bob Newhart, who went from standup comedy to sitcom star, dies at 94SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Social anxiety can be limiting.

Here’s How Digital Double Tech WorksMotion capture and detailed face scans allow TV and film production teams to replicate a performer’s likeness. Generative AI is making the process faster and easierBy Lauren LefferAn employee stands in a cage in which dozens of cameras simultaneously capture his image during a presentation of a photogrammetry process at the headquarters of French video games developer and publisher Quantic Dream in Paris. The photogrammetry process is used to develop video games. Christophe Archambault/AFP via Getty ImagesArtsInside the orb, the world is reduced to a sphere of white light and flashes. Outside the orb’s metallic, skeletal frame is darkness. Imagine you are strapped into a chair inside this contraption. A voice from the darkness suggests expressions: ways to pose your mouth and eyebrows, scenarios to react to, phrases to say and emotions to embody. At irregular intervals, the voice also tells you not to worry and warns that more flashes are coming soon.“I don’t think I was freaked out, but it was a very overwhelming space,” says an actor who asked Scientific American to withhold his name for privacy reasons. He’s describing his experience with “the orb,” his term for the photogrammetry booth used to capture his likeness during the production of a major video game in 2022. “It felt like being in [a magnetic resonance imaging machine],” he says. “It was really very sci-fi.” This actor’s experience was part of the scanning process that allows media production studios to take photographs of cast members in various positions and create movable, malleable digital avatars that can subsequently be animated to perform virtually any action or motion in a realistic video sequence.Advances in artificial intelligence are now making it steadily easier to produce digital doubles like this—even without an intense session in the orb. Some actors fear a possible future in which studios will pressure them to sign away their likeness and their digital double will take work away from them. This is one of the factors motivating members of the union SAG-AFTRA (the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) to go on strike. “Performers need the protection of our images and performances to prevent replacement of human performances by artificial intelligence technology,” the union said in a statement released a few days after the strike was announced in mid-July.Although AI replacement is an unsettling possibility, the digital doubles seen in today’s media productions still rely on human performers and special effects artists. Here’s how the technology works—and how AI is shaking up the established process.How Digital Double Tech WorksOver the past 25 years or so, it has become increasingly common for big-budget media productions to create digital doubles of at least some performers’ face and body. This technology almost certainly plays a role in any movie, TV show or video game that involves extensive digital effects, elaborate action scenes or an actor’s portrayal of a character at multiple ages. “It’s become kind of industry standard,” says Chris MacLean, visual effects supervisor for the Apple TV show Foundation.*The photogrammetry booth is an area surrounded by hundreds of cameras, sometimes arranged in an orb shape and sometimes around a square room. The cameras capture thousands of intentionally overlapping two-dimensional images of a person’s face at a high resolution. If an actor’s role involves speaking or showing emotion, pictures of many different facial movements are needed. For that reason, starring performers require more extensive scans than secondary or background cast members. Similarly, larger setups are used to scan bodies.With those data, visual effects (VFX) artists take the model from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. The overlap of the photographs is key. Based on camera coordinates—and those redundant overlapping sections—the images are mapped and folded in relation to one another in a process akin to digital origami. Artists can then rig the resulting 3-D digital double to a virtual “skeleton” and animate it—either by directly following an actor’s real-world, motion-captured performance or by combining that performance with a computer-generated series of movements. The animated figure can then be placed in a digital landscape and given dialogue—technically, it’s possible to use a person’s scans to create photorealistic video footage of them doing and saying things that actor never did or said.Curated by Our EditorsAI Promises Humanity One Last Job.

AcarHumans Find AI-Generated Faces More Trustworthy Than the Real ThingEmily WillinghamGhost in the Sell: Hollywood's Mischievous Vision of AILarry GreenemeierPoem: ‘An Ars Poetica’Allison FunkSpecial effects artists can also apply an actor’s digital performance to a virtual avatar that looks completely different from the human person. For instance, the aforementioned video game actor says he made faces in the orb and recorded his lines in a recording booth. He also physically acted out many scenes in a separate studio with his fellow performers for motion capture, a process similar to photogrammetry but designed to record the body’s movements. When players engage with the final product, however, they won’t see this actor on-screen. Instead his digital double was modified to look like a villain with a specific appearance. The final animated character thus manifested both the actor’s work and the video game character’s traits.Film and television productions have used this process for decades, although it has historically been both labor intensive and expensive. Despite the difficulty, digital doubles are common. Production teams frequently use them to make small adjustments that involve dialogue and action. The tech is also employed for larger edits, such as taking a group of 100 background actors and morphing and duplicating them into a digital crowd of thousands. But it’s easier to accomplish such feats in a convincing way if the original footage is close to the desired final output. For instance, a background actor scanned wearing a costume meant to replicate clothing worn in 19th-century Europe would be difficult to edit into a dystopian future in which their digital double wears a space suit, MacLean says. “I don’t think there’s any way that the studios would have that much patience,” he adds.Yet generative artificial intelligence, the same sort of machine-learning technology behind ChatGPT, is starting to make aspects of the digital double process quicker and simpler.AI Swoops InSome VFX companies are already using generative AI to speed up the process of modifying a digital double’s appearance, MacLean notes. This makes it easier to “de-age” a famous actor in films such as Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which includes a flashback with a younger-looking version of now 81-year-old Harrison Ford. AI also comes in handy for face replacement, in which an actor’s likeness is superimposed over a stunt double (essentially a sanctioned deepfake), according to Vladimir Galat, chief technology officer of the Scan Truck, a mobile photogrammetry company.Galat says advances in AI have made some photogrammetry scans unnecessary: A generative model can be trained on existing photographs and footage—even of someone no longer living. Digital Domain, a VFX production company that worked on Avengers: Endgame, says it’s also possible to create fake digital performances by historical figures. “This is a very new technology but a growing part of our business,” says Hanno Basse, Digital Domain’s chief tech officer.So far living humans have still been involved in crafting performances “by” the deceased. A real-word actor performs a scene, and then effects artists replace their face with that of the historical person. “We feel the nuances of an actor’s performance, in combination with our AI and machine learning tool sets, is critical to achieving photorealistic results that can captivate an audience and cross the uncanny valley,” Basse says, referring to the eerie sensation sometimes caused by something that looks almost—but not quite—human.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersFears of Robot ReplacementThere’s a difference between adjusting a digital double and replacing a person’s performance entirely with AI, says computer engineer Jeong Joon “JJ” Park, who currently researches computer vision and graphics at Stanford University and will be starting a position at the University of Michigan this fall. The uncanny valley is wide, and there’s not yet a generative AI model that can produce a complete, photorealistic, moving scene from scratch—that technology is not even close, Park notes. To get there, “there needs to be a major leap in the intelligence that we’re developing,” he says. (AI-generated images may be hard to tell from the real thing, but crafting realistic still images is much easier than creating video meant to represent 3-D space.)Still, the threat of abuse of actors’ likeness looms. If one person’s face can be easily swapped over another’s, then what’s to stop filmmakers from putting Tom Cruise in every shot of every action movie? What will prevent studios from replacing 100 background actors with just one and using AI to create the illusion of many? A patchwork of state laws means that, in most places, people have legal ownership over their own likeness, says Eleanor Lackman, a copyright and trademark attorney. But she notes that there are broad exceptions for artistic and expressive use, and filmmaking could easily fall under that designation. And regardless of the law, a person could legally sign a contract giving their own likeness rights over to a production company, explains Jonathan Blavin, a lawyer specializing in media and tech. When it comes to protecting one’s digital likeness, it all comes down to the specifics of the contract—a situation SAG-AFTRA is well aware of.The actor who played the video game villain felt comfortable being scanned for his role last year. “The company I worked with was pretty aboveboard,” he says. But in the future, he may not be so quick to enter agreements. “The capabilities of what AI can do with face capture, and what we saw from the [prestrike negotiations], is scary,” he says. The actor loves video games; he was excited to act in one and he hopes to do so again. But first, he says, “I would double-check the paperwork, check in with my agency—and possibly a lawyer.”*Editor’s Note (7/25/23): This sentence was edited after posting to clarify Chris MacLean’s position at the Apple TV show Foundation.Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR), the enterprise work management platform, today unveiled a suite of new capabilities that apply generative AI (GenAI) to Smartsheet’s secure, scalable platform to help enterprises tackle their mission-critical work more strategically and efficiently. The new features are now available to select customers in private beta.


“We believe GenAI will dramatically–and positively–impact how work gets done, from planning to execution to scaling”Post this

As the leader in enterprise work management, Smartsheet is integrating its new GenAI features across its platform to improve how enterprises plan, do, and scale their work. By connecting large language models (LLMs) to customers’ private business data, Smartsheet can securely deliver insights and data visualizations and help build project and portfolio management solutions in response to simple natural language questions.


Smartsheet optimizes its platform to enable our enterprise customers to meet their security and governance needs now and into the future, and it is taking the same approach when applying GenAI. Customers own their information, and that information is never available for other customers to see or use, nor will it be available as training data to underlying LLMs. As Smartsheet continues to apply GenAI to its platform, it will build in ways to ensure customers understand the recommendations and insights AI provides so they can confidently take action without any additional work on their end.


“We believe GenAI will dramatically–and positively–impact how work gets done, from planning to execution to scaling,” said Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO. “Our platform is inherently flexible so it can adapt to how our customers want to work. As we apply powerful GenAI capabilities across the Smartsheet platform, we’re focused on maintaining customer trust through accurate and actionable insights and recommendations.”


From solving real business challenges faster to quickly finding new insights to inform critical business decisions to scaling work across an entire organization, Smartsheet is unleashing the power of its platform with GenAI to deliver even greater value for customers.



Actionable insights in seconds: The new insights feature connects LLMs with customers’ private business data in Smartsheet to deliver sheet-level insights and data visualizations in seconds, while applying a comprehensive approach to security, compliance, and privacy so their data always stays secure. New AI insights synthesize data into helpful insights and visual charts via simple conversational prompts like, “Which programs were over budget last month by department?” Initially, customers can tap into insights about an individual sheet; in the future, insights will be derived from data across thousands of active projects and data stores, unlocking new portfolio-level insights.

Smartsheet has data store capabilities designed to house millions of rows so customers can leverage their large external datasets from other platforms like ERPs and CRMs within the Smartsheet platform. This creates a more connected work environment and the potential for rich new insights into a customer’s business.



Get answers fast–in the context of your work: Need help building, configuring, or extending a solution? The new AI-powered help assistant will enable customers to get a customized response based on where they are in the context of their work. The help assistant provides natural language responses based on the platform’s help, online Community, and supplemental materials. It can also prompt users on how to get started with different features based on where they are in Smartsheet and what they’ve been working on, helping anyone take their Smartsheet solution to the next level.



Accelerate productivity: Smartsheet helps enterprises transform how work gets done across their organization. Smartsheet customers will now be able to tap into GenAI to quickly build sophisticated solutions that fit their unique needs.

The new AI solution builder will quickly find and personalize the right template so customers can get started building sophisticated solutions in seconds. The AI help assistant will also generate formulas based on a simple description of what information a user wants. Formulas drive processes and automation in Smartsheet, but they take time to master. With this new feature, anyone will be able to generate advanced formulas to power their work at scale. Additionally, users will be able to effortlessly generate video captions and image descriptions while easily manipulating images for quick editing in Brandfolder by Smartsheet, streamlining their content management process and saving hours of work.



""There has been tremendous investment in generative AI, but especially in the collaborative work management space,"" according to Wayne Kurtzman, Research VP for social and collaboration at IDC. ""Smartsheet’s generative AI capabilities align with the market need to use generative AI with a wide array of business data to create new forms of efficiencies, productivity, and alignment across an enterprise that were previously not possible.""


“I am very impressed by capabilities demonstrated by the Smartsheet GenAI features, and would be excited to use these in my everyday work at Vertiv,” said Joshua Schnack, VP of Program Management and Business Initiatives at Vertiv. “Based on what I’ve seen so far, these new AI features are powerful and could provide unique value to my Smartsheet experience. I expect that these upleveled capabilities would give me and my whole organization more confidence and insights that will help us make better decisions, more quickly.”


The new GenAI features announced today are only the latest in AI at Smartsheet. The platform’s first AI innovation came over five years ago, and AI fuels experiences across Smartsheet today, like building workflows without writing code and tagging images behind the scenes.


Committed to Developing AI Responsibly

The Smartsheet mission is to empower anyone to drive meaningful change. Integral to that mission is the commitment to developing AI responsibly and ensuring Smartsheet GenAI capabilities are people-centric, fair, trustworthy, and understandable.


Smartsheet customer data will not be commingled, and no customer data will be included in a training data set used by third-party AI model providers. Smartsheet also performs due diligence to ensure the AI model providers it partners with have comprehensive data privacy and security standards that align with its AI principles. Additionally, Smartsheet is committed to ensuring its AI recommendations and insights are easily understood. In the future, customers will be able to ask Smartsheet questions like, “Why did you make that recommendation?” or “How did you reach that conclusion?”

 Generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are producing increasingly convincing visuals. Yet, they rely on vast databases of creatives' work to generate their content. At this point, you might be wondering whether there’s a way to protect your work from AI tools and the answer is: it’s complicated. 







 How Do Generative AI Tools Use Artists' Work? 
 Generative AI tools use machine learning models that are trained to perform actions using large datasets. Let’s say we’re talking about an AI image generator like Midjourney. In this case, the datasets used for training include billions of image and text pairs—from the work of legendary artists like Picasso to pro and amateur creatives alike. 

 AI art generators use these media-text pairings to generate visual content in response to user text prompts. Basically, they use the work of existing artists and match patterns to text pairings (social posts, captions, alt-text, etc.) so users can generate new visuals from prompts like “a starry night sky in the style of Vincent van Gogh” or “a neo-noir scene of a detective drinking whiskey in 1950s Downtown LA”. 



 Why Are So Many Artists Upset? 
 The biggest complaint from creatives is that generative AI tools use their work without permission. They’re not simply using their work to train algorithms, either. 





 The marketing talk about generative AI suggests these tools create unique content, but they don’t. What they really do is combine data from multiple pieces of art and splice it together to generate something that matches the user’s prompt. 

 The term AI generation itself is misleading. AI replication would be more accurate, and the trick with these tools is they replicate large volumes of artwork and blend them together. 

    

 Generative AI tools are designed to replace creatives—and they're doing so by using their artwork. And, as if that's not bad enough, most AI tools do all of this without asking permission, offering any compensation, or even crediting the original creators. 







 Can You Stop Generative AI Tools Accessing Your Artwork? 
 Unfortunately, the only way to prevent AI tools from accessing any of your content is to publish nothing online. It may sound extreme, but this is the reality. Sure, you can use the robots.txt file on your website to block AI tools from scraping your website, or protect your images from AI by opting out of training datasets, but these methods have several limitations. 

 Firstly, commands in the robots.txt file are advisory, meaning sites are under no legal obligation to adhere. Secondly, you would have to block a company like Google from crawling your website, which is basically SEO suicide. And lastly, the robots.txt file only gives you (limited) control over access to your website, it does nothing to protect the content you publish elsewhere: social media, cloud services, and so on. 

 Unfortunately for creatives, the landscape is going to get worse before it gets better. 






 Google's Privacy Policy Could Mean It Uses All Online Content to Train Its AI Algorithms 
 In July 2023, Google updated its privacy policy to say it will use online content to train its AI systems, including Brad, Google Translate, and others. Google uses the phrasing “publicly accessible sources”. Here’s the quote that raised some alarm bells following the update: 


 “For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features, like Google Translate, Bard and Cloud AI capabilities.” – 
Google Privacy Policy



 In other words, Google is now saying that anything you publish online is up for grabs. At the very least, Google makes it easy to compare updates to its privacy policy by highlighting the most recent changes: 






    

 As you can see, the changes in wording are quite subtle, but the implications are significant. Previously, the primary functions of Google’s language models were interpreting search queries and translating text into other languages. 

 Now, the company says it may use all publicly accessible sources to train its full suite of AI models. This includes its generative AI system, Bard, and expands beyond language models to include all of Google's AI tools/features—the most obvious example being image generation. 

 Social Networks Can Use Any Content You Publish on Their Platforms 
 Meta also has unfettered access to everything published on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. This is standard practice for social platforms if you read the T&Cs. As soon as you upload anything to a social network, they have the rights to use and reuse it in any fashion they wish. 





 Plenty of social users have found companies using their images in ads without permission, including creatives. Unfortunately, if that company happens to be the social network you uploaded the image to, the network's parent company, or another brand owned by the same parent company, you're out of luck. 

 For most people, the chances of a platform like Instagram using one of their images for an ad campaign are seriously low. However, Meta is almost certainly using your images, videos, and posts to train its AI algorithms. 

 Services Like Adobe May Access and Use Your Work to Train Their Algorithms 
 In January 2023, Adobe caught some heat for an update to its T&Cs. The language appeared to suggest Adobe could use images uploaded to its cloud services by photographers to train its AI algorithms. 

 The specific wording was as follows: 


 “Adobe may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g. for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services.” 






 To make matters worse, Adobe was automatically opting users into this content analysis system, meaning they had to manually switch it off in their account settings. Understandably, creatives didn’t respond too kindly and Adobe fanned the flames by not initially responding to criticism. 

 Weeks later, Adobe stated that no customer data is being used to train its generative AI tools. The company called the incident a wake-up call and vowed to clear up any confusion by making the wording of its policy more specific. 

 Either way, the fact remains that if Adobe wants to use customer data to train its AI systems, there’s nothing anyone can do about it—other than boycott. At the same time, Adobe is getting its data for tools like Generative Fill from somewhere, so it's using artists’ work, one way or another. 






 Tech Companies Have Almost Unlimited Access to Your Data... for Now 
 As things stand, tech giants like Google and Meta have almost unlimited access to creatives’ data. Scrutiny over their handling of user data is almost as old as the internet, yet privacy regulations are still playing catch-up. 

 It took the European Union until 2018 to implement its GDPR privacy guidelines and they've done little to protect user data. 

 Generative AI is a new minefield altogether with almost no regulations in place to restrict the actions of technology companies in this space. For the time being, companies like Google and OpenAI can do almost anything they want with our data, and this isn’t going to change any time soon. 



 Ultimately, It Will Take Lawsuits and Regulations to Protect Artists From AI 
 Until generative AI and its access to user data are regulated, creatives are almost powerless to stop the technology. The most likely scenario would be changes to copyright laws or, potentially, new data protections related to creative ownership. In either case, it will take a long time to see any new regulations introduced and, then, enforced. 





 The silver lining for creatives is that the lawsuits against generative AI are piling up fast and this could speed up the legal response. The bad news is that some of the tech companies involved have the legal funds to drag these cases through the most time-consuming avenues of due process. 

 In the meantime, the ethical questions hanging over AI art generation will linger.

AWS unveils generative AI tools for QuickSight BI platform


The tech giant introduced two natural language processing features aimed at making dashboard developers more efficient and enabling more business users to work with data.

Published: 26 Jul 2023


 
AWS on Wednesday unveiled new generative AI features for Amazon QuickSight Q aimed at enabling developers and business users to work with data more efficiently by using exclusively natural language.







The capabilities are part of QuickSight Q, a natural language query tool within the QuickSight analytics platform first launched in September 2021. The features were revealed during AWS Summit New York, an in-person event for AWS customers.
AWS is calling the Ask Q and Build for Me options -- which the tech giant said will be generally available soon -- within QuickSight's dashboard creation environment generative BI.
Both were developed using Amazon Bedrock, an AWS service first introduced in April 2023 that provides access to generative AI and large language model capabilities.

New capabilities
One of the main potential benefits of generative AI is enabling more than just data experts to work with their organization's data. Another is increased efficiency by enabling data experts to work more easily with their organization's data.
QuickSight Q's new generative AI features address both.
The Build for Me option is aimed at dashboard developers. By clicking an icon, developers will be able to build and add to dashboards by simply typing commands in natural language, doing in minutes what previously might have taken hours.
Ask Q is a data storytelling tool aimed at business analysts who often need to put in hours to summarize their work in order to share it with colleagues and develop presentations.
By clicking on Ask Q and using natural language to describe the data to summarize, such as sales figures for a given period, narrative summaries are automatically generated that can then be shared and presented. In addition, users are given filtering options that address, for example, the length of summaries and the style, such as full sentences and paragraphs or bullet points.



Natural language query is a significant addition for any business intelligence tool. It makes analytics accessible to a much larger portion of the organization.


David Menninger Analyst, Ventana Research




The simplicity the features enable, meanwhile, make them useful, according to David Menninger, an analyst at Ventana Research.
""Natural language query is a significant addition for any business intelligence tool,"" he said. ""It makes analytics accessible to a much larger portion of the organization.
""No need to know SQL and the concept of joins and subqueries,"" Menninger added, referring to coding terms.
As a result, QuickSight will become usable by more people within organizations already deploying the platform, he continued.
""Building or tuning visualizations with natural language will expand the use of QuickSight in organizations,"" he said. ""For decades, business intelligence tools have been built for analysts, not for the mainstream line-of-business personnel. These new features help address that shortcoming.""
Beyond simplifying the use of QuickSight and enabling more people to use the platform, adding Ask Q and Build for Me to QuickSight's authoring environment make the platform's generative AI capabilities comparable with those introduced by some of QuickSight's competitors, according to Menninger.
To date, BI platforms including Microsoft Power BI, Qlik, Tableau and ThoughtSpot are among the many with generative AI capabilities in the works. Now, QuickSight is also among them.
""Several vendors have delivered or are delivering similar types of natural language features,"" Menninger said. ""These new features put Amazon out front with the leaders -- perhaps leading in some respects, such as building visualizations with natural language and fast followers in natural language query.""
The essential aim of QuickSight's new generative AI capabilities is to both make current BI users more efficient and enable more people within organizations to work with data, according to QuickSight general manager Tracy Daugherty.
For decades, due to a combination of factors including platforms aimed at data experts rather than self-service users and organizations' own lack of data literacy training, BI use within the enterprise has been stuck at around a quarter of employees.
Generative AI has the potential to change that, given its understanding of true natural language rather than a limited set of business terms and commands.
""The motivation is to create a situation where less people need to be trained on BI tools,"" Daugherty said. ""I want every user within an organization to be able to make data-driven decisions. The motivation is to provide tools for individuals in the places they are, so they can get insights from data.""
He added that customer requests provided the impetus for developing generative AI capabilities for QuickSight Q and adding the Build for Me and Ask Q options.
Daugherty noted that dashboard developers wanted to save time while business users wanted to be able to author their own additions to dashboards and more easily develop narratives to share and present their work.

AWS

Amazon QuickSight customers can now build and edit dashboards using natural language rather than code.







Future plans
While Build for Me and Ask Q represent QuickSight's first generative AI capabilities, they are just the start of the generative AI plans AWS has for QuickSight, according to Daugherty.
He declined to divulge specific plans but noted that the roadmap for QuickSight includes adding generative AI throughout the platform.
""We're going to infuse this technology throughout the BI experience,"" Daugherty said. ""This is the starting place. Right now, we're starting with the authoring experience and the stories experience. In BI, there are many other things we can leverage on this front as well.""
Menninger, meanwhile, noted that while QuickSight is now in line with its competitors with respect to generative AI, there are still areas where the platform has room for improvement.
When first introduced in 2016, QuickSight was a basic BI platform but not as full-featured as some others. Its main differentiators were price and its native connection to the rest of the AWS ecosystem. In recent years, additions such as Q and embedded analytics capabilities have added depth to the platform.
Still, however, QuickSight still has room to grow relative to its competition, according to Menninger.
In particular, he noted that QuickSight doesn't yet have some of the decision intelligence capabilities some other platforms now have as central pillars.
""Where I'd like to see more from Amazon is in the area of decision intelligence [such as] helping organizations evaluate different scenarios and how they would impact the business,"" Menninger said. ""As it stand now, with QuickSight and many other vendors, that part of the process needs to be conducted outside of the business intelligence tools and often in spreadsheets.""

Apple is laying the foundation for AI services with the Ajax framework, as well as a ChatGPT-like tool for use, internally

Apple is quietly working on artificial intelligence tools that could challenge those of OpenAI, Alphabet’s Google and others, but the company has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers.
The iPhone maker has built its own framework to create large language models — the AI-based systems at the heart of new offerings like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard — according to people with knowledge of the efforts. With that foundation, known as “Ajax,” Apple also has created a chatbot service that some engineers call “Apple GPT.”
In recent months, the AI push has become a major effort for Apple, with several teams collaborating on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work includes trying to address potential privacy concerns related to the technology.
Apple shares gained as much as 2.3 per cent to a record high of $198.23 after Bloomberg reported on the AI effort Wednesday, rebounding from earlier losses. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner and main backer, slipped about one percent on the news.
A spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.
The company was caught flat-footed in the past year with the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft’s Bing AI. Though Apple has woven AI features into products for years, it’s now playing catch-up in the buzzy market for generative tools, which can create essays, images and even video based on text prompts. The technology has captured the imagination of consumers and businesses in recent months, leading to a stampede of related products.
Apple’s AI integration
Apple has been conspicuously absent from the frenzy. Its main artificial intelligence product, the Siri voice assistant, has stagnated in recent years. But the company has made AI headway in other areas, including improvements to photos and search on the iPhone. There’s also a smarter version of auto-correct coming to its mobile devices this year.
Publicly, chief executive officer Tim Cook has been circumspect about the flood of new AI services hitting the market. Though the technology has potential, there are still a “number of issues that need to be sorted,” he said during a conference call in May. Apple will be adding AI to more of its products, he said, but on a “very thoughtful basis.”
In an interview with Good Morning America, meanwhile, Cook said he uses ChatGPT and that it’s something that the company is “looking at closely.”
Apple’s Ajax
Behind the scenes, Apple has grown concerned about missing a potentially paramount shift in how devices operate. Generative AI promises to transform how people interact with phones, computers and other technology. And Apple’s devices, which produced revenue of nearly $320bn in the last fiscal year, could suffer if the company doesn’t keep up with AI advances.
That’s why Apple began laying the foundation for AI services with the Ajax framework, as well as a ChatGPT-like tool for use internally. Ajax was first created last year to unify machine learning development at Apple, according to the people familiar with the effort.
The company has already deployed AI-related improvements to search, Siri and maps based on that system. And Ajax is now being used to create large language models and serve as the foundation for the internal ChatGPT-style tool, the people said.
The chatbot app was created as an experiment at the end of last year by a tiny engineering team. Its rollout within Apple was initially halted over security concerns about generative AI, but has since been extended to more employees. Still, the system requires special approval for access. There’s also a significant caveat: Any output from it can’t be used to develop features bound for customers.
Even so, Apple employees are using it to assist with product prototyping. It also summarises text and answers questions based on data it has been trained with.
Apple isn’t the only one taking this approach. Samsung Electronics and other technology companies have developed their own internal ChatGPT-like tools after concerns emerged about third-party services leaking sensitive data.
Apple employees say the company’s tool essentially replicates Bard, ChatGPT and Bing AI, and doesn’t include any novel features or technology. The system is accessible as a web application and has a stripped-down design not meant for public consumption. As such, Apple has no current plans to release it to consumers, though it is actively working to improve its underlying models.
Beyond the state of the technology, Apple is still trying to determine the consumer angle for generative AI. It’s now working on several related initiatives — a cross-company effort between its AI and software engineering groups, as well as the cloud services engineering team that would supply the infrastructure for any significant new features. While the company doesn’t yet have a concrete plan, people familiar with the work believe Apple is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.
John Giannandrea, the company’s head of machine learning and AI, and Craig Federighi, Apple’s top software engineering executive, are leading the efforts. But they haven’t presented a unified front within Apple, said the people. Giannandrea has signaled that he wants to take a more conservative approach, with a desire to see how recent developments from others evolve.
Around the same time that it began developing its own tools, Apple conducted a corporate trial of OpenAI’s technology. It also weighed signing a larger contract with OpenAI, which licenses its services to Microsoft, Shutterstock and Salesforce.
Apple’s Ajax system is built on top of Google Jax, the search giant’s machine learning framework. Apple’s system runs on Google Cloud, which the company uses to power cloud services alongside its own infrastructure and Amazon.com’s AWS.
As part of its recent work, Apple is seeking to hire more experts in generative AI. On its website, it is advertising for engineers with a “robust understanding of large language models and generative AI” and promises to work on applying that technology to the way “people communicate, create, connect and consume media” on iPhones and its other devices.
An ideal spot for Apple to integrate its LLM technology would be inside Siri, allowing the voice assistant to conduct more tasks on behalf of users. Despite launching in 2011, before rival systems, Siri lagged competitors as Apple focused on other areas and adopted fewer features in favor of privacy.
In his May remarks, Cook defended the company’s AI strategy, saying the technology is used across much of its product lineup, including in features like car-crash and fall detection. More recently, Cook said that LLMs have “great promise,” while warning about the possibility of bias and misinformation. He also called for guardrails and regulation in the space.
The company expanded its artificial intelligence efforts in 2018 with the hiring of Giannandrea, who previously led search and AI at Google. Since then, Apple hasn’t released many splashy new AI features, but at least two initiatives could help put it on the map.
The company is planning a new health coaching service codenamed Quartz that relies on data from an Apple Watch and uses AI to personalise plans, Bloomberg reported in April. And the company’s future electric car will use artificial intelligence to power the vehicle’s self-driving capabilities.

AI is pretty good at producing C-level writing, but it’s almost never good enough to publish on its own (and doing so can carry with it a host of copyright-related risks.) With a smart human editor/co-author, however, AI-generated work can act as a springboard to quickly producing quality work.
Here’s how to polish, fact-check and rewrite content from ChatGPT and other generative AI technology from prompt to publish
And for the record, except where indicated, this story is 100% human authored.

Write specific prompts.

Better inputs lead to better outputs. The more specific you can be in your initial request to your robot friend, the stronger your results will be.
Rather than simply asking it, “write a blog post about why you should donate to charity,” instead try something like: “Write a 300-word persuasive story explaining why Gen Z should donate to charities that help with food insecurity. Include information about how many people in Indiana are food insecure, the effects of food insecurity on children, and end with a strong call-to-action to donate. Your target audience is people aged 18-25 living in Indianapolis who have never donated to charity before. Cite your sources at the end. Use AP style.”
Yes, this means you’ll take a bit more time on the front-end crafting your prompt, but you’re more likely to get a helpful, effective output.

Ask it to cite sources — and check those sources.

If you ask ChatGPT to cite sources, it will usually append them at the end of the article. Using the prompt above, I got these three sources:
Feeding America. (2021). “Indiana Food Insecurity Rate.” feedingamerica.org/your-local-foodbank/indiana/.
Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. (2022). “Childhood Hunger.” feedingindianashungry.org/childhood-hunger/.
USDA. (2021). “Household Food Security in the United States in 2020.” ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/104600/err-275.pdf.
Take the time to visit each website it offers. Ensure that they exist and that they say what the chatbot says they said — hallucinations are very real. Additionally, see if there might be other interesting nuggets you can pull out with your human judgement that might better suit your needs. Use that research as a springboard to go deeper. Make sure to properly credit the work in your piece as needed using hyperlinks or in-line citation.

Add specific details, anecdotes and emotion.

ChatGPT can only give you general writing, and what separates OK writing from great writing is specificity. It’s why one of the first rules of reporting is to always get the dog’s name. These little details of personality and depth help forge emotional connections — and no robot can do that. Yet.
Think of what generative AI gave you to be an outline. It’s up to you to put meat on the bones. Add specific stories — in our example above, maybe that’s about someone whose life was changed by a food pantry, or a specific organization that needs more help. Add more details that can appeal to your target audience, like emotional triggers that will specifically resonate with people who live in Indianapolis. Give your AI tinman a beating heart.

Edit extensively and skeptically.

AI can be terrible at following directions. For instance, it often flagrantly ignores word count, giving you more than double what you’ve requested. I’ve yet to see it properly follow AP style in a meaningful way. So it’s up to you to hold it accountable and ensure it meets your specifications. Do not trust and always verify. To repeat an analogy, think of AI as an intern on their first day. They can produce some great stuff, but they need strong oversight and guidance to succeed to your specifications.
If a certain phrase strikes you as really strong — Google it. Make sure it isn’t plagiarism. Fact check everything, beyond merely the citations you’ve been given.
And take the time to punch up the language. Remember that generative AI works by guessing the right word to put in a sentence, one after the other. That doesn’t often contribute to scintillating, unique text that gets readers to sit up and take notice. It’s on you to take some time to add your brand voice and the value and insight only you can bring to a piece
By the time you’ve completed these steps, you should have a finished piece that bears little resemblance to what ChatGPT gave you. That’s by design. This unique, factchecked piece stands on the shoulders of ChatGPT, but is your handiwork.
Nice job.

As Hollywood executives insist it is “just not realistic” to pay actors — 87 percent of whom earn less than $26,000 — more, they are spending lavishly on AI programs.
While entertainment firms like Disney have declined to go into specifics about the nature of their investments in artificial intelligence, job postings and financial disclosures reviewed by The Intercept reveal new details about the extent of these companies’ embrace of the technology.
In one case, Netflix is offering as much as $900,000 for a single AI product manager. 
Hollywood actors and writers unions are jointly striking this summer for the first time since 1960, calling for better wages and regulations on studios’ use of artificial intelligence. 



Just after the actors’ strike was authorized, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — the trade association representing the TV and film companies negotiating with the actors and writers unions — announced “a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members.” 
The offer prompted comparisons to an episode of the dystopian sci-fi TV series “Black Mirror,” which depicted actress Salma Hayek locked in a Kafkaesque struggle with a studio which was using her scanned digital likeness against her will. 
“Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.”
“So $900k/yr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for SAG-AFTRA health insurance is just ghoulish,” actor Rob Delaney, who had a lead role in the “Black Mirror” episode, told The Intercept. “Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.”
Among the striking actors’ demands are protections against their scanned likeness being manipulated by AI without adequate compensation for the actors. 
“They propose that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for the rest of eternity in any project they want with no consent and no compensation,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, said. 
Entertainment writers, too, must contend with their work being replaced by AI programs like ChatGPT that are capable of generating text in response to queries. Writers represented by the Writers Guild of America have been on strike since May 7 demanding, among other things, labor safeguards against AI. John August, a screenwriter for films like “Big Fish” and “Charlie’s Angels,” explained that the WGA wants to make sure that “ChatGPT and its cousins can’t be credited with writing a screenplay.”

Protecting Actors’ Likenesses
The daily rate for background actors can be around $200, per the SAG-AFTRA contract. A job posting by the company Realeyes offers slightly more than that: $300 for two hours of work “express[ing] different emotions” and “improvis[ing] brief scenes” to “train an AI database to better express human emotions.”
Realeyes develops technology to measure attention and reactions by users to video content. While the posting doesn’t mention work with streaming companies, a video on Realeyes’s website prominently features the logos for Netflix and Hulu. 
The posting is specially catered to attract striking workers, stressing that the gig is for “research” purposes and therefore “does not qualify as struck work”: “Please note that this project does not intend to replace actors, but rather requires their expertise,” Realeyes says, emphasizing multiple times that training AI to create “expressive avatars” skirts strike restrictions.
“The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring. Industry research goes into commercial products.”
Experts question whether the boundary between research and commercial work is really so clear. “It’s almost a guarantee that the use of this ‘research,’ when it gets commercialized, will be to build digital actors that replace humans,” said Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. “The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring.” He added, “Industry research goes into commercial products.”
“This is the same bait-switch that LAION and OpenAI pulled years ago,” Zhao said, referring to the Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, a German nonprofit that created the AI chatbot OpenAssistant; OpenAI is the nonprofit that created AI programs like ChatGPT and DALL-E. “Download everything on the internet and no worries about copyrights, because it’s a nonprofit and research. The output of that becomes a public dataset, then commercial companies (who supported the nonprofit) then take it and say, ‘Gee thanks! How convenient for our commercial products!’”
Netflix AI Manager
Netflix’s posting for a $900,000-a-year AI product manager job makes clear that the AI goes beyond just the algorithms that determine what shows are recommended to users. 
The listing points to AI’s uses for content creation:“Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation in all areas of the business,” including by helping them to “create great content.” Netflix’s AI product manager posting alludes to a sprawling effort by the business to embrace AI, referring to its “Machine Learning Platform” involving AI specialists “across Netflix.” (Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
A research section on Netflix’s website describes its machine learning platform, noting that while it was historically used for things like recommendations, it is now being applied to content creation. “Historically, personalization has been the most well-known area, where machine learning powers our recommendation algorithms. We’re also using machine learning to help shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful. We use it to optimize the production of original movies and TV shows in Netflix’s rapidly growing studio.”

Netflix is already putting the AI technology to work. On July 6, the streaming service premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, “Deep Fake Love,” in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create AI-generated “deepfake” simulations of themselves. 
In another job posting, Netflix seeks a technical director for generative AI in its research and development tech lab for its gaming studio. (Video games often employ voice actors and writers.)
Generative AI is the type of AI that can produce text, images, and video from input data — a key component of original content creation but which can also be used for other purposes like advertising. Generative AI is distinct from older, more familiar AI models that provide things like algorithmic recommendations or genre tags. 
“All those models are typically called discriminatory models or classifiers: They tell you what something is,” Zhao explained. “They do not generate content like ChatGPT or image generator models.”

“Generative models are the ones with the ethics problems,” he said, explaining how classifiers are based on carefully using limited training data — such as a viewing history — to generate recommendations. 
Netflix offers up to $650,000 for its generative AI technical director role. 
Video game writers have expressed concerns about losing work to generative AI, with one major game developer, Ubisoft, saying that it is already using generative AI to write dialogue for nonplayer characters.
Netflix, for its part, advertises that one of its games, a narrative-driven adventure game called “Scriptic: Crime Stories,” centered around crime stories, “uses generative AI to help tell them.”
Disney’s AI Operations
Disney has also listed job openings for AI-related positions. In one, the entertainment giant is looking for a senior AI engineer to “drive innovation across our cinematic pipelines and theatrical experiences.” The posting mentions several big name Disney studios where AI is already playing a role, including Marvel, Walt Disney Animation, and Pixar.
In a recent earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Iger alluded to the challenges that the company would have in integrating AI into their current business model. 
“In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” Iger said, as recently reported by journalist Lee Fang. “But it’s also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.”
Iger added, “I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.” Though Iger declined to go into specifics, Disney’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings provide some clues.
“It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI.”
“Rules governing new technological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP and how we create our entertainment products,” the filing says. 
While striking actors are seeking to protect their own IP from AI — among the union demands that Iger deemed “just not realistic” — so is Disney. 
“It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI,” Zhao said, “not just potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, but also valuable access to their intellectual property, so that AI models can be trained to replace human creatives like actors, writers, journalists for a tiny fraction of human wages.”
For some actors, this is not a struggle against the sci-fi dystopia of AI itself, but just a bid for fair working conditions in their industry and control over their own likenesses, bodies, movements, and speech patterns. 
“AI isn’t bad, it’s just that the workers (me) need to own and control the means of production!” said Delaney. “My melodious voice? My broad shoulders and dancer’s undulating buttocks? I decide how those are used! Not a board of VC angel investor scumbags meeting in a Sun Valley conference room between niacin IV cocktails or whatever they do.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“Through our partnership with Microsoft, we’re allowing employees globally to leverage Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service technology and expedite the development of new solutions that empower enterprises to strategically use gen AI for business value,” Harsh Kar, Genpact’s global business leader for data and AI told VentureBeat. “Genpact’s strength in AI and advanced analytics, coupled with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure and the flexibility of Azure OpenAI Service, will be a key differentiator for us and critical to how we drive innovation and outsized impact for clients.”
Providing comprehensive training and resources
To support employees accessing Microsoft Azure’s AI tools and foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation, the company said that it will provide employees with comprehensive training programs and resources. 
These resources include Genpact’s online learning platform Genome, its proprietary data literacy initiative DataBridge and a machine learning (ML) incubator. 
As part of its ongoing commitment to invest in AI capabilities, Genpact has also partnered with Google Cloud to establish a gen AI practice. 
Through this partnership, the company will combine its industry and process expertise with Google Cloud’s gen AI capabilities to build custom enterprise LLMs, business processes and augment operations.
The new practice will bring together a cohesive team of Genpact and Google data scientists, data engineers and domain experts. The primary focus will be capitalizing on their shared clients’ cloud, data and analytics modernization journeys. 
Leveraging generative AI to streamline employee productivity
Genpact aims to empower business teams with gen AI use cases, enhancing employee productivity, operational efficiency and agility while addressing day-to-day challenges faced by enterprises. 
The integration of Azure’s cloud infrastructure and the flexibility of the Azure OpenAI Service is expected to accelerate the development of these solutions.advertisement
“As part of Genpact’s gen AI strategy, we consider different stages of AI adoption within the company: incubation of processes, people tools and technology, and eventually democratization,” Kar told VentureBeat. “To keep up with today’s accelerated pace of innovation, equipping all employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to harness gen AI is not good-to-do, but a must-have.”
Genpact expressed a keen interest in employee experience in its collaboration with Microsoft. 
The company highlighted that its experience agency Rightpoint is a leading Microsoft partner responsible for developing and delivering Microsoft-based applications, services and devices to enhance employee experience.
Strengthening gen AI capabilities
Through the new partnership, Genpact aims to further strengthen its gen AI capabilities and collaborate closely with Microsoft to drive actionable business insights and deliver significant impact for its clients.advertisement
Kar emphasized that LLMs form the core of gen AI at Genpact. The company actively utilizes LLM centers of excellence (CoEs) as a central hub for change management, facilitating the design, integration, scaling and democratization of gen AI prototypes into robust enterprise-grade solutions. 
“These LLM CoEs will enable us to develop AI guidelines, evaluate use cases, implement pilot projects and train our employees in new roles of prompt engineers, prompt compliant checkers and customer protection officers — all of which are critical to continue driving value for our clients in today’s data and AI-driven world,” he said. 
Gen AI upskilling
Genpact recently launched a gen AI skill on Genome, which is part of its flagship tech skilling program TechBridge. This initiative aims to prepare employees for the future AI-driven world by enabling them to master LLMs like ChatGPT through compelling use cases and practical applications. 
The company said that more than 10,000 employees have already been trained, with an additional 25,000 actively learning new gen AI skills.
Moreover, the company has unveiled a data literacy initiative called DataBridge, empowering employees to become proficient in data science techniques — the foundational skills needed to leverage gen AI. 
Genpact asserts that more than 78,000 employees have been trained through this program, enabling them to understand and visualize data effectively and utilize this knowledge to guide decision-making for clients and the company.
Ensuring responsible AI development
The company emphasized its commitment to responsible development and utilization of gen AI tools, recognizing their qualitative differences and potential risks compared to traditional AI. 
To address these concerns, the company has invested in a comprehensive strategy that guides all stakeholders from development to production, integrating four key components: data, foundation models, prompt templates and gen AI application.
Genpact acknowledges that foundation models may produce unintended results, sometimes leading to enterprise-grade solutions that pose challenges when deployed. To mitigate this, the company’s safety framework prioritizes diligent engineering to address privacy risks associated with model selection, ensuring consistent and reliable outputs.
Mitigating data drift
Furthermore, the company said its approach addresses data drift issues by employing metrics that engineers evaluate in collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs) and industry specialists. These evaluations encompass data quality, anonymization and overall performance, leading to improved data drift mitigation.
“We continuously partner with engineers and other stakeholders to conduct due diligence on the data collected for fine-tuning models,” said Kar. “Our framework applies guardrails to mitigate risks arising due to biases of pre-trained models in the outputs. For instance, the output robustness test for fairness ensures that the AI-generated output complies with fairness and legal frameworks.”
What’s next for Genpact?
Kar revealed that Genpact is witnessing robust client demand for leveraging generative AI, LLMs, ML technologies and AI more broadly in their business operations. Looking ahead, the company aims to further refine talent in data science, AI, ML and engineering. 
Additionally, Genpact plans to train its current employees through upskilling programs, ensuring a steady stream of skilled professionals to meet evolving client requirements.
“We remain bullish on investing in and identifying ways to leverage AI to improve client value creation and internal efficiency,” Kar told VentureBeat. “To increase our opportunities to collaborate with clients and boost our productivity, we plan to invest consistently in R&D and strategic partnerships with leading technology providers and further enhance our capabilities in AI and generative AI. This includes our partnerships with Google Cloud to launch a gen AI practice and Microsoft to leverage its Azure OpenAI Service platform.”

Paul DavidsonUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:002:07AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenAutomation was already expected to wipe out millions of jobs. The pandemic has accelerated their demise.Nearly 9 million workers switched occupations during the health crisis – from 2019 to 2022 – 50% more than in the prior three years, according to a new study by McKinsey Global Institute.Most left low-wage jobs in food services, customer service, office support and production. Meanwhile, high-wage positions grew in fields such as science, technology, health care, business, legal and management, the report says.By 2030, another 12 million workers are likely to change jobs as low-wage positions continue to dwindle and higher-paying professional roles flourish. All told, that would amount to 25% more occupational shifts in the 2020s than McKinsey predicted just two years ago.""This is an opportunity to help drive upwards economic mobility if we can solve mismatches and connect workers with the training they need for these roles,"" says Saurabh Sanghvi, a McKinsey partner and coauthor of the report.Generative artificial intelligence is hastening the effects of automation but will likely alter the nature of professional jobs rather than eliminate them, at least in the short term, the study says.The far-reaching transformation of the labor market is likely to require a big ramp-up in training programs and new hiring practices, the study says.What is the effect of COVID-19 on the workforce?COVID has driven the faster timetable. Many customer-facing jobs, such as in food service and office support, are going away as Americans shift purchases to e-commerce and fewer workers come to offices. Such industries will account for 10 million of the 12 million occupational changes.By 2030, employment is projected to fall by 1.6 million for clerks, 830,000 for retail associates, 710,000 for administrative assistants and 630,000 for cashiers. All those jobs involve repetitive tasks that could be replaced by automation, the report says.So far, openings for such low-wage jobs have actually increased recently but that’s because many workers in those fields are quitting and fewer are taking positions.Meanwhile, managerial and professional jobs paying more than $57,000 a year have grown by about 3.5 million since the pandemic.But it doesn’t necessarily mean workers in lower-paying fields are climbing to higher levels.“It is unclear how many higher-paying roles were filled by people who moved up and how many were filled by new entrants to the labor force,” the study says.What is generative AI?Generative AI is turbocharging the effects of automation. While AI analyzes data to make forecasts, generative AI can identify patterns to create new content, such as software code, products, images, video and conversations, in the case of ChatGPT.That means automation will affect more types of jobs, including professional, technical and managerial positions. But rather than replace jobs, generative AI should allow workers to do more creative, higher-level tasks, the study says.“When managers automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching,” the report says. “Similarly, researchers could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and synthesize large data sets.""Even without generative AI, automation was projected to take over tasks accounting for 21.5% of hours worked by 2030. With the new technology, that share has jumped to 29.5%, the study says.Generative AI, and automation broadly, should provide a big boost to productivity, or output per worker, the study says. That should mean a faster-growing economy that ultimately bolsters hiring, though probably in new occupations.But workers must receive the training needed to land better jobs and skilled workers must be connected to jobs in other parts of the country, the study says. Rather than focus on credentials, employers should evaluate candidates ""on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic capabilities, and their transferable skills,"" the study says.SherumSecret Revealed: How Gardeners Remove Gravel Weeds 'Faster' Than Other MethodsfSherum|AdAdLearn MoreUndoSumatra Slim Belly TonicSumatra Tonic Awakens Metabolism and Burns Fat OvernightSumatra Slim Belly Tonic|AdAdLearn MoreUndoHotels Bookings | search ads Find the Best Hotels Bookings For Your VacationReady to get away?

But employment experts say the shortcut is risky.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“The question is what sits behind” choosing to white font, said Andreea Macoveschi, senior director of the recruitment process outsourcing practice for global consulting firm Korn Ferry. “Is it lack of integrity or being savvy with tech?”A large majority of recruiters use applicant tracking systems, or software platforms that help manage job openings and candidates, according to market research firm Gartner. And up to half of employers are using AI in some part of the hiring process, Gartner estimates. The result? Technology is speeding up the hiring process but also making it harder for candidates to break through.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s a significant amount of people looking for work, a lot more résumés are coming in and there’s fewer [hiring] resources because most companies have made cuts,” said Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting. “So the ability for a candidate to get seen is pretty low.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planRepublican-led states have challenged the Save program’s legality.

SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.See moreExpand contentSome people started using white font decades ago to help their résumés surface in recruiter searches on online job boards. But the practice is gaining traction again as job screenings become more automated.“I don’t think it’s ever gone away,” said Sachit Kamat, chief product officer at hiring and talent platform Eightfold AI. “It’s probably popular [again] because competition for jobs is high.”How applicant tracking systems workApplicant tracking systems are the job platforms employers use to collaborate on one service. Often, these systems allow for hiring managers and recruiters to find and prioritize candidates based on fit. Some have AI that contextualizes and rates a résumé based on experience and skillsets. Others provide digital filters or searches to help find specific keywords like skills, job titles or certifications. Some systems might automatically prioritize referrals or internal candidates.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhether white font can bypass filters and bots entirely depends on the system an employer is using and how.“Does it work? Yeah,” Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief innovation officer at staffing firm ManpowerGroup, said about some systems recruiters use. “But it might contribute 10 percent or 15 percent of the variability between a résumé that is ultimately accepted versus one that is rejected.”But candidates need to know that their white text may not be hidden. Sometimes applicant tracking systems will input sections of a résumé into the application. If it does that, the text will no longer be white, meaning the recruiter may see whatever you pasted into your résumé if you don’t edit it.Story continues below advertisement“The system doesn’t care what color font you write it in,” said Allyn Bailey, executive director of hiring success services at hiring software company SmartRecruiters. “If it matches a field, it puts it in.”AdvertisementIn the case of SmartRecruiters, the AI ranks résumés beyond just keywords, Bailey said. So if an employer wants a senior-level candidate, it can determine which job titles should be included.New York-based Greenhouse, which supplies hiring software, doesn’t automatically prioritize candidates, as it says this may lead to bias. But it does let recruiters search for keywords. But keyword searches aren’t as common as people may think, said Jon Stross, the company’s president and co-founder.Story continues below advertisement“Generally, they’re looking in chronological order,” he said of recruiters. “They’re just looking at résumés until they get to 10 that look good enough.”Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Eightfold AI’s system would likely read white-colored keywords as extraneous text, Kamat said. That’s because AI is basing its decisions on the entirety of someone’s résumé. So if a keyword is missing, the AI might determine that candidate likely has that skill based on the listed jobs.Advertisement“In the world of AI, the fundamental approach is different,” he said about AI hiring software. “You’re using big data.”Can a system automatically reject my job application?Systems can automatically reject candidates, but someone has to set the parameters first.Story continues below advertisementSome applicant tracking systems have options that let employers automatically reject a candidate who may not be old enough for a specific job or lacks the years of experience.In cases where a system ranks candidates, it only pushes some ahead of others vs. rejecting anyone, software providers said. SmartRecruiters allows employers to set specific parameters to narrow down candidates. So if someone has a qualification, the system might additionally look for a particular skill.“It does not knock anybody out,” Bailey said. “It screens people in.”AdvertisementNot all recruiters use their software’s features. Two recruiters said they review every application, even if it’s only for a minute, to ensure they don’t miss a qualified candidate. Regardless of how recruiters work, a person ultimately decides who gets hired, software providers said. And not all employers have the time or process to send rejections.Story continues below advertisement“People assume that an evil black box is making judgments about them,” Stross said. “What’s really happening is the company is getting a lot of applications, and they’re not getting back to everyone.”Will white fonting help me get a job?White fonting may help your résumé reach human eyes, but it’s not necessarily going to present you as a good candidate. It might actually hurt your chances.“If your résumé doesn’t stand up well, it will quickly be discarded,” said Reynaldo Ramirez, co-founder of Thrive HR. “That could be viewed as very dishonest.”AdvertisementThere’s a good chance recruiters may check for white font by highlighting the entire résumé, said Walker of Thrive. And it could prevent recruiters from forwarding your résumé to others, which happens often.Story continues below advertisement“You might pass the filter,” Chamorro-Premuzic of Manpower said. “But once the recruiter looks at it, they’re going to say … ‘Why should I waste time with them if they’re not even interested?’”Some recruiters say they won’t automatically disqualify a candidate for white fonting if the person is a good fit. But they will ensure you have the actual skills and experience.“If you’re qualified, you’re qualified,” said Tejal Wagadia, who is a senior technical recruiter for a big tech company and is not permitted to disclose her employer. “But if someone told me they [used the technique], I’d have a serious conversation with them about why.”AdvertisementInstead of white fonting, spend five minutes tweaking your résumé to include the experiences, skills and results applicable to the job, says Wagadia. Use the job description as a guide for your résumé. The company will likely list the most important qualifications and experiences first.Focus your efforts on a handful of jobs vs. mass applying, go the extra mile to network and stay away from tricks — as not everyone will view them the same way, experts say.“You want to be trustworthy from the beginning,” said Marisol Maloney, a tech recruiter at defense contractor Firebird AST. “The truth always comes out.”Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI have exploded in popularity in recent years, and we are witnessing the start of a new order for how the world – and the workplace – works.Boston Consulting group recently surveyed nearly 13,000 people — ranging from executive suite leaders to middle managers and frontline employees — in 18 countries to understand their thoughts, emotions, and fears about AI.They found that overall, people were more optimistic than concerned about AI. But there were major differences in opinions on AI between leaders at the top and employees on the frontline.Leaders were much more optimistic than frontline employees about AI (62% vs. 42%), with 80% of leaders saying they use generative AI regularly.Advertisement:“This tale of two cities should inform organizations as they implement AI and generative AI,” the report said. “Leaders should make sure that they do not get ahead of their people and leave their frontline behind.” close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogAs a life sciences and technology hub, Boston is poised to be a major beneficiary of AI jobs, according to a report from the Brookings Institution.

									Boston.com readers are anxious over artificial intelligence									






In the past 10 months, Boston and five other metro areas, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle, accounted for 47% of advanced or generative AI job postings, according to Brookings. As recently as May, Brookings found 60% of new generative AI jobs posted in the top 15 markets, including Boston.Apart from working in the AI sector, incorporating AI into the workplace has become something of a hot-button issue, both for those who fear their jobs will be taken over by the new technology, as well as for those who need AI to leverage their hireability.Among software developers, having knowledge about AI has become so desirable that “the artificial intelligence specialist has become the new ‘it’ girl in Silicon Valley,” Vox reported.“If you take a look at job openings right now on job boards, the job listings are more emphasized on software engineers who have a background in AI,” technical recruiter Eddiana Rosen told Vox. Advertisement:For many, however, AI is something not to be revered, but to be feared in the workplace.Journalists, legal workers, and white collar workers are among some of those most at risk for AI to replace, according to Insider.This is because AI is able to read, write, and understand text-based data well, and many of these jobs are language-oriented roles susceptible to automation.Eager to go directly to the source, Boston Globe columnist Larry Edelman recently asked one of the new chatbots, Google’s Bard, if it would soon be forcing him into retirement.“AI is unlikely to make newspaper columnists obsolete in the near future,” the bot replied. “While AI can be used to automate some tasks, such as writing basic news stories, it cannot yet replace the human skills and judgment that are essential for in-depth reporting and analysis.”But Edelman’s fears weren’t easily appeased: “My gut tells me I’m being gaslighted,” he wrote.And he’s in good company. In May, more than 400 Boston.com readers told us they are anxious over artificial intelligence, with the vast majority expressing concern over the speed with which AI is developing.Advertisement:We want to know how you feel about AI in the workplace. Do you think AI will take over your current job?

New GrammarlyGO Features Empower Students to Use Generative AI Responsibly




Grammarly furthers its commitment to learning with student-focused prompts, guardrails, and the ability to cite generative AI transparently






July 25, 2023 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grammarly, the company delivering AI communication assistance to over 30 million people, 50,000 professional teams, and 3,000 educational institutions daily, today announced new features that guide students in leveraging generative AI to augment—not replace—their critical thinking and communication skills. These features will start rolling out in late August in GrammarlyGO, the on-demand, generative AI-powered tool that works everywhere students do, in time for the 2023/24 school year.


“evaluate the strength of a thesis statement”Post this

With these new features coming to GrammarlyGO, students can learn to use generative AI conscientiously—helping educational institutions uphold academic integrity and prepare students for the AI-connected workplace:



Suggested ideation prompts encourage students to collaborate with generative AI—not let it do the work for them: Academic-focused GrammarlyGO prompts for students will focus on constructive and contextually relevant use cases aimed at helping students overcome the blank page problem, like “brainstorm topics for my assignment” or “build a research plan for my paper.”



Feedback prompts and output explanations support student learning as they write: With GrammarlyGO’s suggested prompts for feedback, students can “evaluate the strength of a thesis statement,” “explore counterarguments,” and more. The outputs will include explanations, giving students a deeper understanding of GrammarlyGO’s recommendations so they can improve their critical thinking and communication skills over time.



Auto-citations simplify citing generative AI, enabling ethical use and transparency for educators: Grammarly will now offer customers the ability to generate a citation for text generated by tools such as GrammarlyGO and ChatGPT. Grammarly already provides auto-citations for popular research websites and plagiarism detection from billions of web pages and ProQuest’s academic databases, helping students cite all their resources effectively and efficiently while in the flow of work.



AI guideline reminders assist students in responsibly using generative AI: GrammarlyGO will discourage students from generating long-form text if they attempt to do so, with messaging within the product that redirects them to ideate with GrammarlyGO instead while reminding them to adhere to their institution’s or instructor’s policies.



""Generative AI is here to stay, but the education industry is grappling with how to approach new technologies in ways that enhance student learning—not detract from it,” said Jenny Maxwell, Head of Grammarly for Education. “When educators prioritize fostering the responsible use of AI in their institutions and courses, they ensure students build critical thinking abilities and AI literacy that the workforce of today demands. With these new GrammarlyGO features, Grammarly demonstrates its continued commitment to higher education, helping institutions and educators set their students up for success through their academic careers and beyond.”


Grammarly has long provided real-time, best-in-class writing suggestions to help students communicate with clarity and confidence wherever they write. Grammarly can now support students throughout their entire writing journey—from early ideation of an essay outline to writing and organizing arguments, revising for clarity and correctness, and more.


Thousands of leading educational institutions, like Berkeley, Cornell University, Harvard Medical School, Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, and IIM Ahmedabad, already trust Grammarly to empower students to achieve better outcomes through effective communication. Grammarly holds enterprise-grade attestations and certifications and a suite of compliances and certifications that put customers first—never selling or renting data. GrammarlyGO also upholds Grammarly’s long-standing commitment to security, privacy, and responsible AI development.

Login This content is produced in commercial partnership with Salesforce AustraliaAs AI and automation usher in a new economic era, every CEO recognises the need to invest to stay competitive. The risk of inertia has ratcheted up as competitive pressures increase and the economic picture darkens.Leaders are challenged to consider how best to use this revolutionary technology and, more importantly - how to do so safely.Harnessing the power of AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences. iStockIncorporating AI-enhanced capabilities across the workforce can achieve greater employee satisfaction and improve productivity and decision-making. Salesforce research shows 71 per cent of Australian employees use or plan to use generative AI at work, but nearly 60 per cent of those who plan to use this technology don’t know how to do so using trusted data sources or while ensuring sensitive data is kept secure.Today, every CEO needs a digital strategy that builds resilience, drives efficiency and growth, and provides trust, security and reliability. Combining AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences, better anticipating their needs and delivering personalisation across every interaction.AdvertisementPractical applications for generative AIMarketers, for example, are already using generative AI to transform how they connect with their customers by powering more automated and personalised campaigns — quickly and at scale. In addition to basic content creation and writing copy, they’re transforming the way marketers analyse data and personalise messaging content.Frank Fillmann is country leader at Salesforce Australia. Sales teams are consolidating their organisations’ data on a single platform and auto-crafting personalised emails tailored to their customers’ needs, making how they work faster, smarter, and more efficient. Personalisation is informed by CRM data, freeing sales reps to focus on building customer relationships, closing new business, and driving revenue.Customer service teams are using generative AI to increase their productivity by providing suggested replies to customer enquiries and by automatically summarising the customer conversation once complete.This additional human capacity can then be redirected towards other revenue-generating areas of the business, increasing staff engagement and retention and increasing business performance.The real power of this technology is that AI can analyse and act on the most valuable data from a company’s most trusted resource, helping teams work smarter and make informed decisions faster. Slack’s State of Work research shows workers adopting AI are 90 per cent to report higher productivity levels. Yet, just 27 per cent of companies currently use AI tools to help increase efficiency.The role of data: avoiding garbage in, garbage outThe next wave of AI innovation is only as good as its data. While leaders understand the importance of data, many struggle to harness its power for better outcomes and decision-making. For many, it’s too complex, not accessible enough and often, they’re unable to generate impactful insights across their organisations.Generative AI will make it exponentially more accessible for everyone to tap into immense troves of trusted data to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently.Integrating AI, real-time data, and CRM allows for personalised content generation and tailored experiences across sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT. This enables businesses to anticipate customer needs, engage prospects, and optimise their operations, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.Take, for instance, a sales leader who can generate visualisations based on natural language prompts that display real-time progress against their quota, along with recommendations for helping them meet goals. Such insights, based on patterns and trends in data that might be too vast or complex for humans to analyse manually, will give employees invaluable time back to focus on getting the job done.We believe the right data strategy will lead to better decision-making, empower greater creativity and boost productivity.The role of trust in the AI revolution There is a real risk for generative AI, if used improperly, to do harm. To limit the potential for bias, hallucinations, and toxic outputs - generated content must be pulled from relevant, representative, and complete sources.It’s crucial to keep a human in the loop on all customer interactions to validate outputs and recommendations before being used. Training workers to take full advantage of the technology and instilling an ethics-first approach is essential for companies wanting to use generative AI to deliver against growing customer expectations.To help other companies with these considerations, Salesforce has released updated guidelines for how to approach responsible generative AI product development. As we have integrated generative AI into our products, these principles have been at the heart of our decision-making.The cost of inertia is rising for companies slow to adopt generative AI. Leaders need to act now to balance risk and innovation. With the right strategy and governance, CEOs can reduce risk, increase their pace of innovation and embrace the advantages of this revolutionary technology.Frank Fillmann is country leader at Salesforce AustraliaGain insights into the week’s biggest tech stories, deals and trends. Sign up to The Download newsletter.Sponsored by Salesforce AustraliaThis content has been funded by an advertiser and written by the Nine commercial editorial team.SaveLog in or Subscribe to save articleShareCopy linkCopiedEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebookCopy linkCopiedShare via...Gift this articleSubscribers can give anyone free access to articles.Gift this article NewSubscribe to gift this articleGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.Subscribe nowAlready a subscriber?

Paylocity’s New Features Include More Generative AI, Pay Data and Self-Scheduling

By Mark Feffer -   July 26, 2023   





Paylocity launched new features including an updated mobile app and enhancements to its generative AI and LMS, as well as a premium product to provide market pay data to aid employers in developing fair and compliant pay strategies.
The new Market Pay product provides data in real time, within the Paylocity platform. The module allows customers to accurately evaluate pay for specific roles, as well as comply with pay equity and job posting requirements in multiple states.
With Market Pay, Paylocity’s pursuing a growing market. The company said at least three-quarters of organizations with 40 – 250 employees, and 80% of businesses with more than 500 workers, use market data to justify their compensation decisions.
The company also extended its generative AI capabilities to help create “compelling and compliant” job descriptions. The newly streamlined process is designed to save time as it supports talent acquisition efforts.
“Paylocity has purposefully built AI and machine learning into our platform to not only improve efficiency, but also improve effectiveness,” said Co-CEO Steve Beauchamp. Learning as it goes, he said, the system uses more data to make real-time recommendations that can have a direct impact on business outcomes.
Employee-Centric Scheduling
Another new premium feature, Advanced Scheduling, allows businesses to build schedules for multiple locations, and includes real-time insights to help ensure coverage and minimize overtime by anticipating the hours needed for future shifts. It also enables companies to identify employees who are approaching or have already reached overtime thresholds.
From the employee’s point of view, Advanced Scheduling’s mobile app offers workers more influence over their schedules by allowing them to swap shifts, claim open shifts and manage their availability, all without manager involvement.
Meanwhile, Paylocity’s LMS now allows employees to create training content – including videos – and easily share it via the platform’s Community function. Once customers assign a course, the LMS takes over learning management by issuing notices and reminders, tracking progress and reporting on course completion. Learning information is tied back to each employee’s individual record, allowing managers to track learning as they would any other task in the system.  
In January, Paylocity integrated Cloudsnap, a solution for joining disparate business applications, into its broader platform. At the time, Paylocity said its goal was to create a source for employee data that can be leveraged across an entire organization.

SHOP-T

-0.58%decrease


 is going all in on artificial intelligence, launching a suite of new AI products for the businesses that pay for its e-commerce platform, as it also automates its own labour force to reduce the work being done by humans.At a semi-annual online product showcase Wednesday, dubbed Shopify Editions, the Ottawa-based company positioned several new tools – out of the nearly 100 updates and features being released – as important steps in a direction that chief executive officer Tobias Lütke had called “the dawn of the AI era” in a recent note to employees.“Shopify believes that there isn’t any corner of the internet that will benefit more from AI than the pursuit of people building and growing their own businesses,” Miqdad Jaffer, Shopify’s director of product for AI, told The Globe and Mail. “There is still so much untapped potential for AI and entrepreneurs, and we’re both excited and deeply committed to making the power of AI accessible to businesses of all sizes.”In February, Shopify first began to dabble in the world of large-language models and neural networks by introducing a new product-description tool called Shopify Magic. It used similar underlying technology that powers ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that has become incredibly popular since its launch late last year by employing computer programs to distribute probability over large sequences of words and generating results in real time based on its learnings.Now, the e-commerce company is adding to Shopify Magic, joining a chorus of global businesses that are striving to cash in on the buzz surrounding fast-growing AI technology.A new AI feature called Sidekick will allow Shopify merchants to perform administrative tasks and tackle creative challenges, such as responding to customer inquiries or helping out with marketing. Earlier this month, when Mr. Lütke released a teaser video for Sidekick, his short clip went viral on Twitter, gaining traction among many retailers.

Shopify is also launching AI-driven e-mail campaigns for its businesses: The new service will require “just a few words to produce engaging, tailored e-mail newsletters, announcements and more,” Mr. Jaffer said. This is expected to reduce the manpower and overhead for many small businesses around the world, according to Shopify, which provides merchants in around 170 countries with services to set up their online stores.But as Shopify announces new AI tools for its merchants, the company is also undergoing a rapid transition as an organization itself, automating several tasks, such as translation and customer services. Many people who work at Shopify have been worried about losing their jobs because of AI-induced redundancies, especially since the company slashed more than 20 per cent of its work force in May – less than a year after Mr. Lütke first apologized for a previous round of job cuts in 2022 and after president Harley Finkelstein had said in February that no more cuts were coming.Still, Mr. Lütke had eased some audience concerns about AI in May at the Elevate tech conference in Toronto, stating that it “replaces tasks, not jobs,” as he spoke on stage with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is behind the advent of ChatGPT and other industry-leading tools such as GPT-4 and DALL-E.Mr. Jaffer would not provide details about Shopify’s plans for further automation at the company and how AI will affect its employment structure.“We’re positive sum thinkers,” he said. “AI technology is creating new opportunities and driving demand for highly skilled software engineers who can design, develop and maintain AI systems and applications.”Gil Luria, managing director and senior software analyst for American investment bank D.A. Davidson, said many companies are incorporating AI into their products and that the new technology will be most helpful for small merchants, which form the bulk of Shopify’s clientele.“A small merchant may not have customer-service capabilities, so the tools Shopify is introducing can help them handle customer engagement in a more automated and professional manner,” Mr. Luria said.Apart from AI, Shopify also unveiled several upgrades in other areas on Wednesday, including its checkout; a new credit card for eligible merchants in the U.S.; and Marketplace Connect, which is a new centralized hub for merchants to connect their operations from different marketplaces where they sell their products, such as Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Etsy.Sign up for our new Business Brief newsletter.A daily look at the most important business stories that are making news and moving markets, written by Chris Wilson-SmithRegister to sign upExplore newsletters","Shopify goes all in on artificial intelligence as it launches new tools for users, automates work force ",,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'url': '/investing/article-us-bond-market-reacts-to-bidens-exit-with-trump-trade-reversal/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'url': '/opinion/letters/article-chrystia-freeland-justin-trudeau-mark-carney/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'url': '/opinion/article-kamala-harriss-early-momentum-shows-theres-a-path-for-democratic/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'url': '/canada/article-the-longtime-connections-kamala-harris-has-to-montreal-and-canada/'}]",bottom-furniture-recommendations-bottom-furniture-more-for-you,,,False,,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/JPIEMJCG35NXHKPTERAGCVEZ5E.JPG?auth=8f96baab278ff7c865e7b63dcbe811c1623a31b93c144869eb9399af4ca4aab3&width=640&quality=80,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.l-article'}",,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', 'productID': 'theglobeandmail.com:access'}",,,,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'url': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/', 'inLanguage': 'en'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail'}",2023.0,4.0

The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is already changing the jobs market. We already witness the different ways in which AI creates art or performs tasks for different professional categories, like architects. But now, we witness an entire man-machine shift. Tasks that only humans could do a few years ago can now be partially or fully automated by simple web tools that anyone can access.
This compilation of data puts all the AI replacing jobs chatter into worrying perspective.






AI Replacing Jobs Statistics: Most Shocking Findings
While there are a few positive predictions among the doom and gloom, the following stats suggest there will be a great and painful upheaval in the jobs market:

AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs.
80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their tasks affected by AI.
77% of businesses are already using or exploring AI.
75% of Chinese citizens would replace politicians with AI.
CEOs of AI firms like OpenAI have signed an open letter warning about the risk of extinction from AI.

AI already in the workplace statistics
These tools replacing human jobs statistics look at how AI is already being used in the workplace.
1. 77% of businesses are already using or exploring AI.
(Source: IBM)
Fears of AI replacing jobs are warranted when 35% of businesses are already using it and 42% are exploring how to use it in the near future. While this doesn’t mean workers are being sacked, this becomes more likely as AI technology advances and is less reliant on human collaboration.
2. Large businesses are twice as likely to use AI than small businesses.
(Source: IBM)
Larger organizations spend more on research and development and have the capital to adopt new technology like AI. However, 41% of small businesses are developing an AI strategy for the future.






3. IT professionals use AI the most in the workplace.
(Source: IBM)
It should come as no surprise that IT professionals are the largest AI user group in the workplace (54%). They are followed by 35% of Data Engineers, 29% of Developers and Data Scientists, 26% of Security Professionals, and 25% of Customer Service staff.
4. There is a 37% rate of adoption of Generative AI in Marketing and Advertising.
(Source: Statista – AI Adoption)
When looking at specific industries, marketing & advertising show the highest rate of adoption of Generative AI (37%). This is followed by Technology (35%), Consulting (30%), Teaching (19%), Accounting (16%), and Healthcare (15%).
5. 81% of office workers think AI improves their job performance.
(Source: SnapLogic)
Of 400 surveyed office workers using AI, the majority felt it was improving their overall performance at work. This includes 61% who say it makes them more efficient and productive, while 49% felt it improved their decision-making.
Meanwhile, 51% say they believe AI enables them to achieve a better work/life balance.
AI replacing jobs statistics: Now and the future
These stats and facts reveal the current landscape of job losses and some shocking predictions for the years ahead.
6. 14% of workers claim to have already lost a job to ‘robots’.
(Source: Socius) 
Research at Brigham Young University in Utah, suggests fears outweigh current reality, but 14% of workers have already had a role replaced by automation. Those who had, suspected the number to be as high as 47%, while those that hadn’t predicted 29%. However, it’s potential job losses in the future that’s drumming up the most fear.






7. In May 2023, 3,900 US job losses were linked directly to AI.
(Source: Challenger Report)
This made up 5% of all job losses in May and was the seventh-highest contributor. In tech, there have been 136,831 job losses this year, the biggest round of layoffs since 2001.
8. British Telecom aims to replace 10,000 staff with AI within 7 years.
(Source: Daily Mail)
As part of a broader program of layoffs, telecom giant BT has announced plans to cut 10,000 staff over the next 7 years with help from AI and other automation strategies. Part of this is due to expanding AI-based customer service technology like help chat bots.
9. Early AI and automation have already driven down wages by up to 70% since 1980.
(Sources: Business Insider, Forbes)
It’s argued that before AI replaces jobs it levels the playing field. Creatives in writing, graphic design, and music, now face less talented competitors who can use AI to improve the quality of their work. In turn, this drives down wages.
This experiment has already been played out since 1980. Between 50% and 70% of decreased wages have been among blue-collar workers who were replaced or degraded by automation and primitive AI.
10. Now it’s Educated, white-collar workers that will be impacted by automation.
(Source: Business Insider)
If it was blue-collar workers that bore the brunt of technology before, it’s educated, white-collar workers making up to $80,000 a year that will be impacted by generative AI.






This is because jobs that use programming and writing skills fall under this bracket and are being automated by the likes of ChatGPT.
11. Overall, AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs.
(Source: Goldman Sachs) 
Due to its ability to produce content indistinguishable from human-output, generative AI systems could degrade or completely replace 300 million jobs with automation. This is the equivalent of a quarter of all work tasks in the US and Europe.
However, due to increased productivity, it could also increase global GDP by 7%. Bots are simply more efficient than humans.
12. 80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their tasks affected by AI.
(Source: OpenAI) 
Research by ChatGPT creators OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania reveals that the majority of the US labor market will be affected, even if it’s just 10% of day-to-day tasks. A smaller percentage of workers (19%) may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.
13. Administrative jobs will be hit the hardest, while manual labor is safe.
(Source: Goldman Sachs) 
Some jobs are more easily automated than others, with administrative tasks to be hit the hardest (46%), and monotonous tasks in the legal profession (44%), as an example. On the other hand, manual labor such as construction (6%) and maintenance (4%), are relatively safe from data-based generative AI.
14. Women may be affected more than men.
(Source: Kenan Institute)
As high as 80% of women’s jobs could be at risk due to 70% of women’s jobs being white-collar and administrative – the main target of AI technology.
Fears about AI replacing jobs statistics
These stats look closer at people’s fears of job losses at the hands of AI.






15. 30% of workers fear their job will soon be replaced by technology.
(Source: PwC) 
In a survey of 52,000 people across 44 countries and territories, almost a third of respondents were concerned that their job could be replaced by tech such as AI within the next 3 years.
39% are worried that their employer is not giving sufficient training in emerging digital and technology skills.
16. In India alone, the fear of AI job losses jumps to more than 70%.
(Source: Microsoft)
Microsoft’s India results for its 2023 Work Trend Index finds that 74 % of Indian workers fear AI will replace their jobs. Nonetheless, as AI continues to roll out, 83% say they will delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.
17. More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds are concerned about AI taking jobs.
(Source: BMG Research)
Young people are more concerned than older people, with 52% of 18 to 24-year-olds worried about how AI will impact their future careers. Older workers may reach retirement before it affects them.
18. 81.6% of digital marketers believe content writers will lose jobs because of AI.
(Source: Authority Hacker)
With the highest AI adoption rate, fears about job replacement are especially high in the marketing industry.  Content writers, in particular, now face competition from AI chatbots that can create passable content from simple topic prompts.






19. CEOs of AI firms like OpenAI have signed an open letter warning about the risk of extinction from AI.
(Source: Safe.AI)
It’s not just job losses we should be concerned about according to AI scientists and other notable figures. Bill Gates, Sam Alman, the CEO of OpenAI, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Stability AI’s Emad Mostaque, and many others have all signed an open letter and ‘statement of risk’.
It states: Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.
AI creating jobs statistics
Although it might not counter the worst predictions of job losses, the explosion of AI will create millions of new jobs too.
20. 72% of companies using AI think it will make their jobs easier.
(Source: PwC)
There is some positivity within companies that have already adopted AI. The vast majority believe it will make work easier rather than taking over roles entirely.
21. AI could create 97 million new jobs by 2025.
(Source: World Economic Forum)
These new jobs will require training and collaborative AI skills as we begin working alongside the technology.
22. Four UK industries are expected to see net job gains due to AI.
(Source: GOV.uk – AI Jobs)






Research in the UK forecasts that the health and social care industry will benefit the most from AI jobs, with approximately 800,000 extra positions created over the next 20 years. Professional & Scientific, Education, and Information & Comms are also expected to see net job gains from AI.
23. 64% of managers and executives plan to hire more professionals to fill AI roles.
(Source: UpWork)
A survey of 1,400 US senior managers through C-suite executives by Freelancer platform UpWork, found that two-thirds will be increasing hiring as a result of generative AI.
AI jobs and government statistics
The role of governments in developing and implementing AI cannot be ignored. Nor can the role of AI within governments themselves.
24. Governments are spending billions on AI research.
(Sources: FedScoop, GOV.UK – AI Spending)
Despite fears from citizens, governments in the US, UK, and other nations are spending heavily on artificial intelligence. US federal spending on AI contracts hit $3.3 billion in 2022, a 250% increase from 2017.
In March 2023, the UK government pledged £1 billion for supercomputing and AI research, as part of a broader £3.5 billion science and tech budget.
25. The United States ranks highest in the Global AI Index.
(Source: Tortoise Media)
The Global AI Index is a ranking of 62 countries that have invested in AI, based on analysis, investment, innovation, and implementation.
The United States is ranked number 1, followed by China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Kenya ranks at the bottom of the 62-country list.






26. The US government is best equipped to deploy AI within government itself.
(Source: Statista – Government AI)
The US also ranks number 1 on the Government AI Readiness Index, which measures the countries best equipped to deploy AI within public services. Singapore comes in second, followed by the UK, and Finland.
China ranks 17th on the index for readiness, but that’s because it is already ahead of most countries in implementation.
27. 75% of Chinese citizens would replace politicians with AI.
(Source: CNBC)
Politicians may be usurped by AI too. Of 2,769 people surveyed from 11 countries, 75% of Chinese citizens would happily reduce the number of parliamentarians in their country and replace them with AI.
51% of Europeans said they would support such a move, while only 40% of Americans would hand over the government to AI.
28. US and EU legislation aims to regulate AI-based job hiring.
(Source: Computer World)
While there isn’t much legal pressure against AI replacing jobs themselves, the US and EU are in the early stages of regulating AI being used in the hiring process. This includes the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act and the EU AI Act.
Ironically, this may save the jobs of recruiters.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere and will only get more sophisticated as time goes on.
As with any disruptive technology, job losses cannot be avoided. However, the transition will still require human collaboration and there are opportunities for those that learn the AI landscape early.
