ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe ShiftA.I.-Generated Art Is Already Transforming Creative WorkOnly a few months old, apps like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are changing how filmmakers, interior designers and other creative professionals do their jobs.Share full article56Read in appCredit...Kevin Roose, via DALL-EBy Kevin RooseOct. 21, 2022For years, the conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley futurists was that artificial intelligence and automation spelled doom for blue-collar workers whose jobs involved repetitive manual labor. Truck drivers, retail cashiers and warehouse workers would all lose their jobs to robots, they said, while workers in creative fields like art, entertainment and media would be safe.Well, an unexpected thing happened recently: A.I. entered the creative class.In the past few months, A.I.-based image generators like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have made it possible for anyone to create unique, hyper-realistic images just by typing a few words into a text box.These apps, though new, are already astoundingly popular. DALL-E 2, for example, has more than 1.5 million users generating more than two million images every day, while Midjourney’s official Discord server has more than three million members.These programs use what’s known as “generative A.I.,” a type of A.I. that was popularized several years ago with the release of text-generating tools like GPT-3 but has since expanded into images, audio and video.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt’s still too early to tell whether this new wave of apps will end up costing artists and illustrators their jobs. What seems clear, though, is that these tools are already being put to use in creative industries.Recently, I spoke to five creative-class professionals about how they’re using A.I.-generated art in their jobs.‘It spit back a perfect image.’ImageCredit...via Collin WaldochCollin Waldoch, 29, a Brooklyn game designer, recently started using generative A.I. to create custom art for his online game, Twofer Goofer, which works a bit like a rhyming version of Wordle. Every day, players are given a clue — like “a set of rhythmic moves while in a half-conscious state” — and are tasked with coming up with a pair of rhyming words that matches the clue. (In this case, “trance dance.”)Initially, Mr. Waldoch planned to hire human artists through the gig-work platform Upwork to illustrate each day’s rhyming word pair. But when he saw the cost — between $50 and $60 per image, plus time for rounds of feedback and edits — he decided to try using A.I. instead. He plugged word pairs into Midjourney and DreamStudio, an app based on Stable Diffusion, and tweaked the results until they looked right. Total cost: a few minutes of work, plus a few cents. (DreamStudio charges about a cent per image; Midjourney’s standard membership costs $30 per month for unlimited images.)“I typed in ‘carrot parrot,’ and it spit back a perfect image of a parrot made of carrots,” he said. “That was the immediate ‘aha’ moment.”Mr. Waldoch said he didn’t feel guilty about using A.I. instead of hiring human artists, because human artists were too expensive to make the game worthwhile.“We wouldn’t have done this” if not for A.I., he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘I don’t feel like it will take my job away.’ImageCredit...Isabella OrsiImageCredit...Isabella Orsi, via InteriorAIIsabella Orsi, 24, an interior designer in San Francisco, recently used a generative A.I. app called InteriorAI to create a mock-up for a client.The client, a tech start-up, was looking to spruce up its office. Ms. Orsi uploaded photos of the client’s office to InteriorAI, then applied a “cyberpunk” filter. The app produced new renderings in seconds — showing what the office’s entryway would look like with colored lights, contoured furniture and a new set of shelves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Orsi thinks that rather than replacing interior designers entirely, generative A.I. will help them come up with ideas during the initial phase of a project.

Subscribe and listen.“I think there’s an element of good design that requires the empathetic touch of a human,” she said. “So I don’t feel like it will take my job away. Somebody has to discern between the different renderings, and at the end of the day, I think that needs a designer.”‘It’s like working with a really willful concept artist.’ImageCredit...Patrick Clair, via DALL-EPatrick Clair, 40, a filmmaker in Sydney, Australia, started using A.I.-generated art this year to help him prepare for a presentation to a film studio.Mr. Clair, who has worked on hit shows including “Westworld,” was looking for an image of a certain type of marble statue. But when he went looking on Getty Images — his usual source for concept art — he came up empty. Instead, he turned to DALL-E 2.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I put ‘marble statue’ into DALL-E, and it was closer than what I could get on Getty in five minutes,” Mr. Clair said.Since then, he has used DALL-E 2 to help him generate imagery, such as the above image of a Melbourne tram in a dust storm, that isn’t readily available from online sources.He predicted that rather than replacing concept artists or putting Hollywood special effects wizards out of a job, A.I. image generators would simply become part of every filmmaker’s tool kit.“It’s like working with a really willful concept artist,” he said.“Photoshop can do things that you can’t do with your hands, in the same way a calculator can crunch numbers in a way that you can’t in your brain, but Photoshop never surprises you,” he continued. “Whereas DALL-E surprises you, and comes back with things that are genuinely creative.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘What if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?’ImageCredit...Shawn Herron, via DALL-EDuring a recent creative brainstorm, Jason Carmel, 49, an executive at the New York advertising agency Wunderman Thompson, found himself wondering if A.I. could help.“We had three and a half good ideas,” he said of his team. “And the fourth one was just missing a visual way of describing it.”The image they wanted — a group of dogs playing poker, for an ad being pitched to a pet medicine company — would have taken an artist all day to sketch. Instead, they asked DALL-E 2 to generate it.“We were like, what if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?” Mr. Carmel said.The resulting image didn’t end up going into an ad, but Mr. Carmel predicts that generative A.I. will become part of every ad agency’s creative process. He doesn’t, however, think that using A.I. will meaningfully speed up the agencies’ work, or replace their art departments. He said many of the images generated by A.I. weren’t good enough to be shown to clients and that users who weren’t experienced users of these apps would probably waste a lot of time trying to formulate the right prompts.“When I see people write about how it’s going to destroy creativity, they talk about it as if it’s an efficiency play,” Mr. Carmel said. “And then I know that they maybe haven’t played around with it that much themselves, because it’s a time suck.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘This is a sketch tool.’ImageCredit...via Sarah DrummondSarah Drummond, a service designer in London, started using A.I.-generated images a few months ago to replace the black-and-white sketches she did for her job. These were usually basic drawings that visually represented processes she was trying to design improvements for, like a group of customers lining up at a store’s cash register.Instead of spending hours creating what she called “blob drawings” by hand, Ms. Drummond, 36, now types what she wants into DALL-E 2 or Midjourney.“All of a sudden, I can take like 15 seconds and go, ‘Woman at till, standing at kiosk, black-and-white illustration,’ and get something back that’s really professional looking,” she said.Ms. Drummond acknowledged that A.I. image generators had limitations. They aren’t good at more complex sketches, for example, or creating multiple images with the same character. And like the other creative professionals, she said she didn’t think A.I. designers would replace human illustrators outright.“Would I use it for final output? No. I would hire someone to fully make what we wanted to realize,” she said. “But the throwaway work that you do when you’re any kind of designer, whether it’s visual, architectural, urban planner — you’re sketching, sketching, sketching. And so this is a sketch tool.”Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Oct. 22, 2022, Section B, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: Artificial Intelligence Already Has a Place in the Toolbox of Creative Professionals.

         — 
    


            Erin Hanson has spent years developing the vibrant color palette and chunky brushstrokes that define the vivid oil paintings for which she is known. But during a recent interview with her, I showed Hanson my attempts to recreate her style with just a few keystrokes. 
    

            Using Stable Diffusion, a popular and publicly available open-source AI image generation tool, I had plugged in a series of prompts to create images in the style of some of her paintings of California poppies on an ocean cliff and a field of lupin. 
    

            “That one with the purple flowers and the sunset,” she said via Zoom, peering at one of my attempts, “definitely looks like one of my paintings, you know?” 
    

            With Hanson’s guidance, I then tailored another detailed prompt: “Oil painting of crystal light, in the style of Erin Hanson, light and shadows, backlit trees, strong outlines, stained glass, modern impressionist, award-winning, trending on ArtStation, vivid, high-definition, high-resolution.” I fed the prompt to Stable Diffusion; within seconds it produced three images. 
    

            “Oh, wow,” she said as we pored over the results, pointing out how similar the trees in one image looked to the ones in her 2021 painting “Crystalline Maples.” “I would put that on my wall,” she soon added.

AI Image/Stable Diffusion



Hanson, who’s based in McMinnville, Oregon, is one of many professional artists whose work was included in the data set used to train Stable Diffusion, which was released in August by London-based Stability AI. She’s one of several artists interviewed by CNN Business who were unhappy to learn that pictures of their work were used without someone informing them, asking for consent, or paying for their use.

            Once available only to a select group of tech insiders, text-to-image AI systems are becoming increasingly popular and powerful. These systems include Stable Diffusion, from a company that recently raised more than $100 million in funding, and DALL-E, from a company that has raised $1 billion to date.  
    

            These tools, which typically offer some free credits before charging, can create all kinds of images with just a few words, including those that are clearly evocative of the works of many, many artists (if not seemingly created by the same artist). Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.  
    

            In just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists.

            But as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).   
    

            “I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion. 
    

        When fine art becomes data 


            The machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.

            Some services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.” 
    

            This practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.

            But datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant.

            A few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling. 
    

            Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said.
    

            But that’s slim comfort to some artists.

        Angry artists 


            Danger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods. 
    

            He is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online. 
    

            “Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”

Tara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said. 
    

            “How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.” 
    

            While the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said. 
    

            “You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.” 
    

            McPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.” 
    

            If he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.

AI won an art contest, and artists are furious




            For starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images. 
    

            Christoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices. 
    

            “A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said. 
    

        Offering artists more control 


            Partners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets. 
    

            In September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.  
    

            Dryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.”

            “I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business. 
    

            Schuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said. 
    

            Hanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.” 
    

            This could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said. 
    

            Theoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below. It’s almost like having my own bespoke Hanson gallery.

Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.   In just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists. But as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).    “I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion.  When fine art becomes data  The machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.  Some services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.”  This practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.  But datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant. A few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling.  Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said. But that’s slim comfort to some artists.  Angry artists  Danger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.  He is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online.  “Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”  Tara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.  “How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.”  While the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said.  “You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.”  McPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.”  If he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.   For starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images.  Christoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices.  “A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said.  Offering artists more control  Partners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets.  In September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.   Dryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.” “I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business.  Schuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said.  Hanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.”  This could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said.  Theoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below. It’s almost like having my own bespoke Hanson gallery.","['business', 'tech']",https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220923162646-erin-hanson-artwork.jpg?c=original,P0Y0M0DT0H8M20S,1876.0,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'dateModified': '2022-07-08T11:27:15Z', 'uploadDate': '2022-07-07T20:09:32Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=business/2022/07/07/nightcap-ai-dall-e-2-art-clip-orig.cnn-business&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_d5e7e9684308816876c58b878d71027d@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H02M10S', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': ""Art critic Jerry Saltz on DALL-E 2: 'This is pretty crapola illustration'"", 'headline': ""Art critic Jerry Saltz on DALL-E 2: 'This is pretty crapola illustration'"", 'description': 'AI and DALL-E 2 is cropping up across Twitter feeds, but is it art?

As a law-firm associate about 20 years ago, Meredith Williams-Range would often be surrounded by bankers boxes filled with documents as well as printouts fanned across conference-room tables.In a familiar ritual back then for young attorneys and paralegals, they would physically thumb through contracts as they helped perform due diligence for merger deals, Williams-Range said. That could sometimes mean weeks of poring over the language for risks to flag to higher-ups and looking for issues to highlight for the parties to negotiate on, like any notable contractual obligations involving third-party suppliers. Today, a lot of those records have long since gone digital, and top law firms like Shearman & Sterling, where Williams-Range is now the chief knowledge and client-value officer, are using artificial intelligence to comb through contract language for such insights and to organize information in those contracts.""As lawyers, we have been trained not to trust anything — so trusting AI is always a difficult conversation to have,"" she told Insider. ""But what you've seen absolutely happen is the clients are driving where AI has either been developed or adopted in any Big Law firm.""

Mergers and acquisitions surged in 2021, when the roughly $5.9 trillion in deals was about 64% higher than in the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. The frenzy led to a windfall of work and revenues for Big Law firms, some of which looked to AI tools to keep pace with the volume of transactions they were advising on, Williams-Range said.Shearman & Sterling uses a wide variety of AI tools for different uses — one of the firm's go-tos for deals due diligence is Kira, a tool owned by Litera, a document-technology company that works with law firms.

The firm White & Case also noted its use of AI, like many firms, to assist with document review for discovery — a key phase of litigation that generates a huge number of documents, including emails, internal memos, and other forms of evidence in a lawsuit. The company uses tools such as Brainspace and Relativity, Janet Sullivan, the firm's global director of practice technology, said.Thomson Reuters, known for its legal-research tools like Westlaw, and other big legal-tech players have ramped up their AI offerings to assist with M&A work and research. The firm has also been acquiring companies that can collaborate, like Practical Law and the document-review tech company ThoughtTrace, combining the legal expertise of human lawyers and writers with AI tech to help train algorithms, Joe Dormani of TR Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Thomson Reuters, said. Some firms are also experimenting with more cutting-edge uses, like helping their attorneys write legal briefs. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, for instance, is piloting the use of Clearbrief, an AI-based Microsoft Word plug-in that suggests improvements as lawyers write briefs, like examples of relevant case law they might not have included that could strengthen their argument, Kate Orr, the global head of practice innovation for Orrick, said.But that doesn't mean young attorneys are being replaced by code just yet, she added.

Earlier this month, the White House waded into this discussion.  Dubbed the “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People,” the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy identified five principles to “guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public in the age of artificial intelligence.”
Although the blueprint has no binding legal effect, it is a bellwether document that celebrates recent efforts to regulate AI and encourages AI designers, regulators, and customers to take a close look at the negative side effects that AI may have on the American public and take steps to mitigate those impacts.
The Five Principles
The blueprint is organized into five separate, but related principles:
(1)  Safe and Effective Systems;
(2)  Algorithmic Discrimination Protections;
(3)  Data Privacy;
(4)  Notice and Explanation; and
(5)  Human Alternatives, Consideration & Fallback.
For each principle, the document outlines associated human protections that should guide the design and use of AI.  The general theme that emerges in each section is that AI should be designed with the human experience in mind, making sure that any use of AI, 1) does not endanger human life; 2) does not subject humans to discriminatory treatment; 3) protects human privacy interests; 4) embraces transparency; and 5) allows humans the opportunity to opt out of AI-driven systems.
Algorithmic Discrimination Protections
Of particular relevance to employers is the section on algorithmic discrimination protections.  The White House recognizes AI’s potential for innovation but explains that all AI systems must have “algorithmic discrimination protections built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use.”  In support of these protections, the blueprint cites a real-world example of a hiring tool “that learned the features of a company’s employees (predominantly men) and rejected women applicants for spurious and discriminatory reasons.” 
The White House lauds the EEOC’s recent technical assistance bulletin that explains how some employment-based AI tools can discriminate against individuals with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  And it highlights industry-driven best practices that have been memorialized in the Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured questionnaire that businesses can use when deciding whether to implement software designed to evaluate workers and applicants.
The blueprint outlines discrimination protection principles that we have seen implemented in various laws throughout the country.  For example, the White House explains that AI tools should be monitored for discriminatory impacts and that the results of such audits “should be made public whenever possible to confirm these protections.”  This is consistent with recent regulation in New York City set to take effect in January 2023 that will require auditing of AI tools used in the workplace.
Above all else, the blueprint emphasizes the need for both designers and users of AI technology to be mindful of discriminatory impacts on protected populations.  It directs designers to build protections into the systems from unintentional proxy-based discrimination, and instructs vendors and customers to assess impacts and take active measures to mitigate discriminatory results.
What the Blueprint Means for Employers 
Although the blueprint is not a binding document, it is symbolic of the increased focus that regulators have on the use of AI in all facets of life, including the workplace.  Employers should be mindful of the principles expressed in the blueprint and should closely monitor developments in the law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Navy is thinking about artificial intelligence in two ways: the infrastructure to make unmanned systems work and technology meant to enhance how sailor and their commanders make decisions, a panel of technical and policy experts said Tuesday.
The output provided by AI is there help the human or supplement manned operations with unmanned assets, said Brett Vaughan, Navy Chief AI Officer, speaking at the U.S. Naval Institute on Tuesday. A human will always be in the loop and play a central role.
“By and large, the AI is there to augment and provide a human decision maker a range of options and recommendations,” Vaughan said.
That’s not to say there are not some decisions the AI system could make, he said. There are situations with unmanned vessels, such as going around a seamount, that the AI can make without needing a human, Vaughan said.
“That just shows you when we talk about offloading or delegating decisions there’s a sliding scale we have to be cognizant of, that’s got to appear in your calculus,” Vaughan said. “That’s where the perspective of the human being helped or the customer, the warfighter, sailor, Marine is important in the design of the code and the capability.”
The Pentagon’s goal for AI is to use it to achieve a competitive advantage, said retired Lt. Gen Michael Groen, former director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
“How do we gain competitive advantage against China, against any of our other opponents and be able to operate with tempo and with precision,” Groen said. “And so this is the real core of what we’re trying to build here today.”
Right now, in the DoD, this looks like pattern recognition and algorithms, as an example, which can help streamline processes or decisions.
As an early operational application, AI is key to the Navy’s ongoing testing of unmanned vessels in the Middle East, U.S. 5th Fleet’s commander Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said last week.
“They’re going to see every single thing that passes, they’re going to take a picture of it. And then they’re going to map using AI — the pattern of life of everything around them as far as they can see. And then when there is something different, they’re going to take a picture of that every second, you’re going to send it back to a Navy command center. And then a human being makes a decision,” he said last week at the Coast Guard Academy.
Already, civilians and the military are used to using AI, he said. Take cars as an example. AI algorithms help a car monitor fuel levels or tire pressure. The same with navigation apps that adjust to say how much traffic is on a route or where one can stop for coffee.
For the military, AI can help show commanders additional opportunities or risks, just like the navigation apps might suggest a different route depending on traffic.
Vaughan’s office never starts with AI, but rather looks at the problem or challenge first and then brings in AI to help address it, if AI is the right tool needed. He currently oversees about 1,000 AI-related projects.
Using AI is going to require the Navy to recalibrate how it does business, he said.
It is different than building hardware like ships, where they are built, go out and come back for repairs. AI requires constant monitoring and verification to make sure the system works properly.
The U.S. is not the only country looking to use AI with its military. Both China and Russia are using AI already, said Sam Tangredi, a professor of national, naval, and maritime strategy at the U.S. Naval War College.
China has said that it wants to be an AI leader, he said, something they could achieve because the country wants to use AI for different reasons.
“They want it for social control, for control of the populace by the Chinese Communist Party. Great incentives to spend a lot of money on it,” Tangredi said.
Russia looks to use AI for autonomy so it can supplement its force, he said.
The U.S. on the other hand is focused on keeping the human in the loop, Tangredi said.
The Chinese are good at human surveillance, Groen said, but it is a question of if Beijing can convert that into a warfighting capability. China has also been interested in AI as a tool for battlefield commanders as a counter to the U.S. operations in the Western Pacific, reported USNI News last year.
“It is necessary to assist command on the battlefield by establishing a wargaming system that can rigorously reflect reality to train an AI system that can deal with distributed lethality,” reads a 2020 Marine Design & Research Institute of China (MARIC).
How well the Chinese can execute on their goals is still an open question, Groen said
“Can they innovate? And then can we innovate faster?” he said. “Can we innovate enough and organize ourselves enough so that we actually have the enterprise that can fight effectively against an opponent that is largely organized, not innovative?”

Researchers Outline AI-Related Clinical Competencies for Health Professionals

A research report published in Academic Medicine outlines artificial intelligence (AI)-related clinical competencies for healthcare professionals in an effort to address practical and ethical concerns raised by the growing interest in and adoption of these tools in clinical settings.







Efforts to create responsible health AI and define guidelines for use have become more common in response to these concerns, but many are focused on the developers of the algorithms. By focusing on the clinician’s side of this issue, the research team highlights the shared responsibility of ethical health AI use among various healthcare stakeholders.
“We started with a formal literature review of the health professions education and informatics literature, finding that there’ve been numerous calls for a list of AI-related competencies, because of the complexity of the tools and the risk of misuse and unintended consequences,” said Bonnie Miller, MD, professor of medical education and administration at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), in the press release. “But we could find no list of competencies, and very scant mention of how clinicians were being trained to use AI-based tools as they’ve begun entering into testing.”
To fill this gap, the researchers selected 15 subject matter experts from across the US and conducted semistructured interviews focused on the use of AI-based tools in healthcare settings.
“In interviews our subject experts expressed a mix of optimism and caution,” noted Regina Russell, PhD, assistant professor of medical education and administration at VUMC, in the press release. “They recognize the great potential of these new technologies to support health, but the need for caution was repeatedly expressed around issues of bias and fairness as AI-based tools are rolled out.”
“It’s well understood that AI-based tools can exacerbate biases present in the data used to train them,” she continued. “With health disparities of all sorts having long been baked into our health system and our society, it’s clear that health professionals will need to develop baseline knowledge, skills and attitudes to work appropriately with these tools.”
Transcripts were coded, thematically analyzed, developed into draft competency statements, and provided to the experts for feedback. The draft statements were then finalized using a consensus approach among the eight members of the research team.
From this process, six competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated.
The six competency domain statements are basic knowledge of AI; social and ethical implications of AI; AI-enhanced clinical encounters; evidence-based evaluation of AI tools; workflow analysis for AI-based tools; and practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools.
This report is the latest effort to create guidelines for responsible and ethical AI use in healthcare.
Last week, the Coalition for Health AI shared progress and published papers defining core principles of responsible AI testing, usability, and safety as part of its work on mitigating bias and promoting equity.
Earlier this month, the White House unveiled its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which outlines five protections Americans should have in the face of the rising use of these technologies.

Prior to Vox, Neel was an editorial fellow at Audubon magazine and an assistant producer at Radiolab.In late September, OpenAI made its DALL-E 2 AI art generator widely available to the public, allowing anyone with a computer to make one of those striking, slightly bizarre images that seem to be floating around the internet more and more these days. DALL-E 2 is by no means the first AI art generator to open to the public (the competing AI art models Stable Diffusion and Midjourney also launched this year), but it comes with a strong pedigree: Its cousin, the text-generating model known as GPT-3 — itself the subject of much intrigue and multiple gimmicky stories — was also developed by OpenAI. Last week, Microsoft announced it would be adding AI-generated art tools — powered by DALL-E 2 — to its Office software suite, and in June DALL-E 2 was used to design the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. The most techno-utopian proponents of AI-generated art say it provides a democratization of art for the masses; the cynics among us would argue it’s copying human artists and threatening to end their careers. Either way, it seems clear that AI art is here, and its potential has only just begun to be explored. Naturally, I decided to try it.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.As I scrolled through examples of DALL-E’s work for inspiration (I had determined that my first attempt ought to be a masterpiece), it seemed to me that AI-generated art didn’t have any particular aesthetic other than, maybe, being a bit odd. There were pigs wearing sunglasses and floral shirts while riding motorcycles, raccoons playing tennis, and Johannes Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring, tweaked ever so slightly so as to replace the titular girl with a sea otter. But as I kept scrolling, I realized there is one unifying theme underlying every piece: AI art, more often than not, looks like Western art. “All AI is only backward-looking,” said Amelia Winger-Bearskin, professor of AI and the Arts at the University of Florida’s Digital Worlds Institute. “They can only look at the past, and then they can make a prediction of the future.” For an AI model (also known as an algorithm), the past is the data set it has been trained on. For an AI art model, that data set is art. And much of the fine art world is dominated by white, Western artists. This leads to AI-generated images that look overwhelmingly Western. This is, frankly, a little disappointing: AI-generated art, in theory, could be an incredibly useful tool for imagining a more equitable vision of art that looks very different from what we have come to take for granted. Instead, it stands to simply perpetuate the colonial ideas that drive our understanding of art today.To be clear, models like DALL-E 2 can be asked to generate art in the style of any artist; asking for an image with the modifier “Ukiyo-e,” for example, will create works that mimic Japanese woodblock prints and paintings. But users must include those modifiers; they are rarely, if ever, the default. DALL-E 2’s interpretation of the prompt “Hokusai painting of Artificial Intelligence” Neel Dhanesha/Vox; Courtesy of OpenAIWinger-Bearskin has seen the limits of AI art firsthand. When one of her students used images generated by Stable Diffusion to make a video of a nature scene, she realized the twilight backgrounds put out by the AI model looked oddly similar to the scenes painted by Disney animators in the 1950s and ‘60s — which themselves had been inspired by the French Rococo movement. “There are a lot of Disney films, and what he got back was something we see a lot of,” Winger-Bearskin told Recode. “There are so many things missing in those datasets. There are millions of night scenes from all over the world that we would never see.” AI bias is a notoriously difficult problem. Left unchecked, algorithms can perpetuate racist and sexist biases, and that bias extends to AI art as well: as Sigal Samuel wrote for Future Perfect in April, previous versions of DALL-E would spit out images of white men when asked to depict lawyers, for example, and depict all flight attendants as women. OpenAI has been working to mitigate these effects, fine-tuning its model to try to weed out stereotypes, though researchers still disagree on whether those measures have worked. But even if they work, the problem of artistic style will persist: If DALL-E manages to depict a world free of racist and sexist stereotypes, it would still do so in the image of the West. “You can’t fine-tune a model to be less Western if your dataset is mostly Western,” Yilun Du, a PhD student and AI researcher at MIT, told Recode. AI models are trained by scraping the internet for images, and Du thinks models made by groups based in the United States or Europe are likely predisposed to Western media. Some models made outside the United States, like ERNIE-ViLG, which was developed by the Chinese tech company Baidu, do a better job generating images that are more culturally relevant to their place of origin, but they come with issues of their own; as the MIT Technology Review reported in September, ERNIE-ViLG is better at producing anime art than DALL-E 2 but refuses to make images of Tiananmen Square. Because AI is backward-looking, it’s only able to make variations of images it has seen before. That, Du says, is why an AI model is unable to create an image of a plate sitting on top of a fork, even though it should conceivably understand each aspect of the request. The model has simply never seen an image of a plate on top of a fork, so it spits out images of forks on top of plates instead.Injecting more non-Western art into an existing dataset wouldn’t be a very helpful solution, either, because of the overwhelming prevalence of Western art on the internet. “It’s kind of like giving clean water to a tree that was fed with contaminated water for the last 25 years,” said Winger-Bearskin. “Even if it’s getting better water now, the fruit from that tree is still contaminated. Running that same model with new training data does not significantly change it.” Instead, creating a better, more representative AI model would require creating it from scratch — which is what Winger-Bearskin, who is a member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma and an artist herself, does when she uses AI to create art about the climate crisis. That’s a time-consuming process. “The hardest thing is making the data set,” said Du. Training an AI art generator requires millions of images, and Du said it would take months to create a data set that’s equally representative of all the art styles that can be found around the world. If there’s an upside to the artistic bias inherent in most AI art models, perhaps it’s this: Like all good art, it exposes something about our society. Many modern art museums, Winger-Bearskin said, give more space to art made by people from underrepresented communities than they did in the past. But this art still only makes up a small fraction of what exists in museum archives. “An artist’s job is to talk about what’s going on in the world, to amplify issues so we notice them,” said Jean Oh, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. AI art models are unable to provide commentary of their own — everything they produce is at the behest of a human — but the art they produce creates a sort of accidental meta-commentary that Oh thinks is worthy of notice. “It gives us a way to observe the world the way it is structured, and not the perfect world we want it to be.” That’s not to say that Oh believes more equitable models shouldn’t be created — they are important for circumstances where depicting an idealized world is helpful, like for children’s books or commercial applications, she told Recode — but rather that the existence of the imperfect models should push us to think more deeply about how we use them. Instead of simply trying to eliminate the biases as though they don’t exist, Oh said, we should take the time to identify and quantify them in order to have constructive discussions about their impacts and how to minimize them. “The main purpose is to help human creativity,” Oh said, who’s researching ways to create more intuitive human-AI interactions. “People want to blame the AI. But the final product is our responsibility.”This story was first published in the Recode newsletter.

The concept of artificial intelligence has been around for millennia, although the actual term was coined during a conference at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire in 1956. Many cultures worldwide have their share of legends, myths, and stories of artificial creatures coming to life, thinking, and behaving like people. These storytellers spun tales of automatons and robots, entertaining (and possibly scaring) their Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese audiences.
Today's storytellers include filmmakers, and plenty of movies out there deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. Sometimes the results are humorous; other times, they're terrifying.
So, in that spirit, we present the top sixteen must-see movies for anyone interested in the field of artificial intelligence. We're offering them in alphabetical order rather than trying to arrange them by some rating system or release dates.
Did we somehow leave out your favorite AI movie? Drop us some feedback and tell us what we overlooked!

2001: Space Odyssey
Let's start things off with a genuine classic. The HAL 9000 is the ultimate blueprint for an actual artificial intelligence: intelligent, logical, controlling, and devoid of emotional constraints. HAL controls and monitors the spacecraft heading to Jupiter, and, well, soon enough, it's talking about not opening the pod bay doors, and things just get worse from there. Also, take each letter in ""HAL"" and advance it one letter up in the alphabet.
AI
How can you possibly have a list of Artificial Intelligence movies and not include AI? You can't! In this Pinocchio-like story, an AI robot called David is brought in as a temporary substitute for a comatose child. Unfortunately, the results are rather downbeat. However, the movie represents an attempt by people to use AI to fill in a role generally associated with a natural person (e.g., a child). And of course, David wants to be an actual human, a desire that gives rise to whether Artificial Intelligence could someday evolve to the point that it has desires and goals.
Blade Runner
Did someone mention a classic AI movie earlier? Blade Runner, an adaptation of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick’s short story “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”, deals with replicants, AI-powered bio-engineered copies of humans. The Artificial Intelligence movie does an admirable job of blurring the line between being human and being an artificial life form, causing the audience to rethink perhaps their ideas on personhood and the morality of how we should treat artificial life.
Chappie
Set in a dystopian future, this AI movie explores what happens when a castoff, damaged police robot is given Artificial Intelligence to such a degree that the titular character forms its own opinions and has emotions. Of course, today's AI learns by interacting with its surroundings, and that's exactly what happens to Chappie, although granted, it's at a much higher level. Still, the movie shows how AI can learn by itself while also exploring ethical issues.
Ex Machina
This Artificial Intelligence movie makes the audience tackle whether AI can be inclined towards good or evil. A programmer, Caleb, wins a one-week visit to the home of his company's genius CEO (Nathan). Once there, Caleb is given a chance to experiment with Nathan's latest creation; an AI named Ava. The movie takes us to some dark places, but it makes people ponder the ethics and morality of performing tests on self-aware life, even if that life was artificially made.

Her
Artificially intelligent operating systems or virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Bixby can make our lives easier and better organized, but what if the technology became so sophisticated that you could even fall in love with it? That's the premise of Her, where a lonely man falls in love with an incredibly sophisticated AI system called Samantha. Her is an interesting AI movie because it revolves around technology already in use; it just happens to be a more advanced model. Her also touches upon how people are increasingly relying on AI
I, Robot
Today, some people fear concepts like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, believing that machines could take over the world one day. This AI movie speaks to those fears, as a supercomputer called VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) turns bad and decides that humans need to be controlled before they do themselves in. The movie is set in another dystopian world, where robots have replaced humans in many public service jobs. Driverless cars, anyone?
Interstellar
This film deviates from the pattern shown thus far on the list. Artificial Intelligence is not the central character but rather represented by two robots called CASE and TARS that help the crew of the Endurance. However, unlike other robots portrayed in science fiction, this pair in no way resembles humanoids. This configuration speaks to the idea of function over form, a possible design strategy for future AI
Moon
Take HAL from 2001 and make him a lot less violent. In this Artificial Intelligence movie, you have GERTY, the AI that helps maintain the lunar base. It also provides Sam Bell, the protagonist and sole crew member, with company. GERTY represents A.I,'s potential as both a resource for operating a facility and a source of comfort and camaraderie.
Robocop
No one would blame you for arching a skeptical eyebrow if someone told you that Robocop contains some deep meaning and thoughts about the morality of AI, and yet here we are. Sure, the AI movie is big, dumb fun. Still, it also touches upon the dangers of weaponizing AI and raises questions about who is creating the programming and what parameters they are employing?

Star Trek: The Next Generation
You just know that Star Trek had to appear on this list somewhere, right? We’re deviating from the “movie” format and throwing a spotlight on one episode of ST:TNG in particular. It’s called “The Measure of a Man,” season two, episode nine, and it’s a magnificent treatment of the moral questions around AI In a nutshell, a Starfleet officer wants to take Commander Data, the super-intelligent android, and disassemble him for study. Data refuses, and the officer insists, saying the android is property of Starfleet. What follows is a trial to determine Data’s fate, and it covers areas like personhood and the ethics and rights of artificial intelligence. ""The Measure of a Man"" is episode nine of season two of Star Trek: The Next Generation and is highly recommended.
Star Wars
And if we are talking about Star Trek, it stands to reason that we need to mention Star Wars and its unique addition to the AI field, astromech droid R2-D2, and human relations cyborg C3-PO. These droids have sophisticated artificial intelligence as well as emotions. However, they and other droids are often treated as servants or inferiors, even as pets. Don't forget that C3-PO often referred to Luke Skywalker as ""Master Luke."" How will society treat sophisticated AI in the future?
The Matrix
Set in a world where artificial intelligence now controls everything, this classic AI movie explores the nature of constructed (virtual) reality. The Matrix touches upon the fear of machines taking over and using us to keep them running.
The Terminator
Here's another dystopian classic. This time, the artificial intelligence is Skynet, an AI designed to automate missile defense that became self-aware on August 29, 1997, and triggered World War III. And, of course, Skynet also creates a cyborg assassin to go back in time, the titular Terminator. This AI movie's main takeaway is that you should design an AI that's reliable and definitely include an ""off"" switch!
WALL-E
Okay, time to lighten things up a little with something more family-oriented and upbeat. However, the movie does embrace a dystopian tone. Earth is filled with garbage, and humanity now lives on giant spaceships and has really let itself go. Machines do all the work, and humans sit there like slugs. However, WALL-E itself (himself?) is the perfect example of an Artificial Narrow Intelligence that exists even today. An A.N.I. is an intelligent system that does one thing exceptionally well, and in WALL-E's case, it's cleaning up garbage. The movie also shows AI as something that eventually saves humanity rather than exercising world domination, creating time-traveling killer cyborgs, or refusing to open the pod bay doors.

Westworld
Let's end the list by returning to killer robots. This entry isn't about the HBO series but the AI movie released in 1973, which eventually inspired the cable show. The film deals with the titular Westworld, an adult theme park dedicated to the Western genre and staffed by robots that help customers live out their fantasies. So, naturally, things go sideways, and the robots rebel against their human masters. The film shows how AI could be used in a deep-dive, immersive entertainment capacity and provides us a cautionary tale of the ethical implications of manipulating AI for our amusement.

When it comes to modernising government agencies, machine learning and artificial intelligence – or AI – provide a range of exciting opportunities. AI can make predictions about potential non-compliance and decide on the optimal response. From a service perspective, it can identify what people need and help them get the right information, the right service and the right support. 
“This can have a profound impact on people’s lives – we’re talking anything from greater convenience to literally life-changing support,” says Darren Menachemson, chief for digital societies and chief ethicist with ThinkPlace.
Despite Menachemson explaining the applications for AI-augmented regulation and servicing are “almost endless”, the technology is not being used to its full potential. “In truth, most implementations of ‘AI’ are not being driven by machine learning,” he says. “Instead, they are just sophisticated applications of more traditional analytics.”
The exception is the Department of Defence. An AusTender keyword search for “artificial intelligence” shows a range of investments in research and development of AI applications since 2015 – including research into AI algorithm assurance, AI and ethics, and a range of proof of concept projects in partnerships with research institutions and industry partners. 
In addition, programs have been established for further partnerships and investment in AI, including the Next Generation Technologies Fund, Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Network and Centre for Advanced Defence Research and Enterprise.
“Artificial intelligence is a key technology enabler for Defence and society at large,” a Defence spokesperson explains. “To effectively harness AI, we need to ensure we pick the right tool for the job at any given instance. “This forms a body of work in itself that Defence is seeking to solve. How do we create an AI that is able to appropriately select the right approach to solve a problem that it faces?”


In addition to using AI within autonomous systems, Defence is researching AI to assist in planning, interpretation of remotely sensed data and other ways to use it within the cyber domain. “We’re also looking at ways that we can accelerate AI uptake, including software frameworks to scale algorithmic development.”
For partners, including industry, Defence is seen as the place to be for research and investment in AI.


“We definitely see Defence as being one of the leaders in AI in the nation,” says Zygmunt Szpak, executive director of Insight via Artificial Intelligence. “Part of the reason for this is that Defence understands that adversaries are doing something in the space, and the nature of Defence is you have to be on top of the latest stuff. Otherwise, you just can’t defend yourself. 
“That’s one of the reasons why we find that a lot of our interesting work is with Defence.” 
Is the Defence investment in AI transferable?
The defence context for AI is “far more austere and challenged” than in other areas in the public sector, Defence says. Its approaches need to operate in environments subject to deliberate adversarial action. But despite this, knowledge gained through Defence research could transfer to other areas of the public sector. 
“Cyber is a great example,” Szpak says. “This is an area of AI Defence is pushing the envelope on and can quite easily be applied in an industry context.” 
Work on explainable AI systems, which better integrate machine learning with human insights and interpretation, is another area with a wider impact on the public sector and industry.
“Organisations will be able to look at key algorithms developed in Defence to port and deploy them in a different space,” says Szpak. “You’re never going to get a particular product, but that knowledge is transferable.” 
But the reverse wouldn’t be true. 
“As these challenges are almost unique to the Defence context, we can be considered a leader in the innovation, science and technology development associated with dealing with these types of challenges,” Defence says. 
“Additional robustness and resilience come with a cost, meaning that the approaches developed to operate in such challenged environments may not be optimal when challenges aren’t present.”
What agencies can learn from Defence
For the public sector, learning about AI from Defence can be a challenge – after all, they operate in a highly classified environment. Having a foot in the door with Defence also helps, with communities of practice providing forums to discuss research.
“There’s a community of interest in Defence around machine learning and AI that I provided a talk to,” Szpak says. “As part of that group, there were some people from other public sector agencies. That tells me that already there is some kind of transfer of knowledge happening between researchers in different parts of the public sector.”
Attending workshops on artificial intelligence hosted by experts working with Defence, such as Szpak, can also help agencies gain the full potential of AI for their operations. Defence is keen to be more open with insights and be seen as a public sector leader, with conferences a key forum for collaboration.
In July, the Defence Science and Technology Group held the Australian Defence Science, Technology and Research Summit, which featured AI as one of three tracks. And a range of AI experimentation programs, including the Army’s Robotics and Autonomous Systems Implementation and Coordination Office, Air Force’s Jericho and Navy’s Warfare Innovation Navy Branch, are all promoting their work publicly.
With expertise in the application of AI, Defence has some key insights to support its successful implementation within any agency.
“To succeed at harnessing AI, the required capabilities include not only access to sufficient computer resources but also people who understand the current technology offerings and ensure it is only applied to the type of problem appropriate for that technology’s maturity,” says a Defence spokesperson. 
“Understanding these limitations also assists in identifying areas in which innovation is required to advance AI, helping to produce more robust solutions. Defence has an AI Centre, which serves in this capacity across the department.”

President Biden on Oct. 17 signed into law the Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act, which aims to improve the Federal workforce’s understanding of AI and ensure its ethical and safe use.
The legislation – introduced by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in July 2021 – will create a training program to help Federal employees responsible for purchasing AI technologies better understand its risks and benefits.
The law requires the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide and regularly update the AI training program. It also encourages the OMB director to work with scholars and experts from the public and private sectors to develop the training.
“When the government purchases AI to improve government functions, we need to know that the AI we buy actually works and meets standards for ethics and safety,” Sen. Portman said in a statement. “That’s why I’m pleased the bipartisan AI Training Act has been signed into law. This law will train our procurement professionals about the ins and outs of AI so they can discern which AI systems are useful to the government and which are not.”
The Senate passed the legislation in December 2021. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., led the bill through the House, which passed it on Sept. 29, 2022.

“If used improperly, artificial intelligence could present a serious threat to the rights and liberties of Michiganders and people across the country. That is why the Federal workforce must better understand how these technologies could impact the safety, security, and freedoms of all Americans,” Sen. Peters said in a statement. “Now that this commonsense, bipartisan legislation has been signed into law, Federal workers will be better prepared to use this technology in a way that is ethical and consistent with our nation’s values.”
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has recommended AI training for the Federal workforce, especially those who procure and manage these technologies.
The law will also help ensure the United States maintains a global leadership role in emerging technologies, as competitors such as China continue to invest in AI, its backers say.
“While emerging artificial intelligence technologies offer promising benefits for our Federal workforce, they also come with serious risks. It is more important now than ever to ensure our Federal workforce is prepared to manage these complicated systems,” said Rep. Maloney. “I’m grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who voted in favor of safeguarding civil rights and civil liberties while ensuring the Federal government can modernize with state-of-the-art technology.”

The measure is meant to ensure that feds understand the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence.






                  Congress
                












































President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill to create an artificial intelligence training program for acquisition workforce into law on Monday. The proposal, called the AI Training Act, cleared the Senate in late 2021 after being introduced by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). The bill passed the House in September and was sponsored by the chair and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and James Comer (R-Ky.).""This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will train our federal workforce to better understand this technology, and ensure that it is used ethically and in a way that is consistent with our nation's values,"" said Sen. Peters in a statement when the bill cleared the House.Now, the Office of Management and Budget is required to set up the training program, meant to ensure that federal employees know both the privacy and discrimination risks of AI, as well as the potential benefits of its use for the government. The training is meant for employees charged with program management, procurement and more.""When the government purchases AI to improve government functions, we need to know that the AI we buy actually works and meets standards for ethics and safety,"" said Sen. Portman. Portman and Peters say that the bill also falls in line with recommendations for more AI training from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which was chartered by Congress in the fiscal year 2019 defense policy bill.

MacArthur FoundationYour browser does not support the audio element.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation recently announced the names of 25 people who won an annual fellowship. The highly selective and prestigious award, which has also been described as a “genius grant,” comes with a no-strings-attached stipend of $800,000, which the foundation describes as “an investment in their potential.” The fellowships are given each year to a diverse array of artists, academics, activists and other pioneers in their fields. Yejin Choi is a 2022 MacArthur Fellow and a computer science professor at the University of Washington. She joins us to talk to us about her efforts to make artificial intelligence capable of common sense reasoning, ethical decision-making and recognizing intent behind the human language.The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer:Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB, I’m Dave Miller. We end today with a newly minted Macarthur Award winner from the University of Washington. Yejin Choi  is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at U. Dub. She received the so-called ‘Genius Grant’ for her work that pushes the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence. She’s trying to teach A-Is to be able to use common sense reasoning, identify information that’s not trustworthy and even make ethical judgments. Yejin Choi joins us to talk about her work. Congratulations and welcome.Yejin Choi: Thank you.Miller: What does ‘common sense reasoning’ mean in the context of Artificial Intelligence?Choi: It broadly refers to what’s easy for humans, everyday knowledge about how the world works, that is strikingly hard for A-I.Miller: What’s an example of something that I can do without quotes ‘thinking about it,’ but that would be hard to get an A-I to do?Choi: In general it’s about obvious knowledge that you and I don’t talk about. For example, a horse has two eyes, not three or four, but we don’t talk about it. So then, if you ask that kind of a question, A-I can struggle.Miller: Is this a question of just not having powerful enough computers, even given how amazingly powerful computers are compared to what they were, say, 20 years ago, or is the problem deeper than that?Choi: Deeper than that – because the computers are more powerful, we do now have some hope that we might be able to investigate this problem. But the actual challenge is very, very deep.Miller: What makes it challenging?Choi: So there’s a fundamental difference between how humans learn about the world, by learning the actual concepts, what it means to…you know, let’s make an example of, for example, an apple, a fruit apple. You know, like, we can eat it, it’s crunchy if you bite into it and it’s just somewhat hard, but not hard enough to sustain a lot of weight.  So we know all of these things and so, say, you’re driving a car and then you see an apple on the ground and then you know that it’s okay to drive over it. But it’s not as okay if you see a sharp metallic object on the ground, but these things may not be written down or spoken out loud by human system-error,  and machines tend to learn by just reading lots of internet data, which, if they have not talked about it, then A-I doesn’t know what to do about it.Miller: So how so what is the challenge in front of you in terms of how do you teach an AI, that’s so literal in so many ways and everything it learns I guess, in the past, it had to be explicitly taught- how do you get it to soak up lost knowledge and knit different pieces of knowledge together and make inferences and do the stuff that humans do without effort?Choi: If we think about how humans learn, we do learn from diverse modes of learning. So we don’t learn only from internet data. In fact, if you imagine having a child to only learn from internet data, I don’t think it would be actually successful in many ways. So we do learn by reading books, reading textbooks in particular, and we do learn by asking questions, especially when a child is learning about new objects. They do ask a lot about what is this, why is this? And so we’re mimicking that sort of exchange of knowledge through declarative form and see how far we can reach.Miller: How far have you gotten in terms of creating an A-I that’s more capable of common sense reasoning?Choi: We’ve made a lot of progress but it’s still far from how robust humans are when it comes to common sense reasoning. But now for example, if we teach machines about X repelling Y’s attack, and then we tell machine that then maybe access the kind of person who’s brave and strong in order to be able to repel Y’s attack as opposed to run away. So we teach that as an example and then ask machine, how about repelling someone’s attack in a chess game? Now it’s a very different situation, it’s intellectual combat. So then machine extrapolates out of the original fist fight context to intellectual fight and say, ‘Oh X might be seen as someone competitive and smart.’ We made that much of the progress.Miller: So the computer could recognize the different contexts and repelling an attack from somebody who’s physically fighting you- it recognizes that’s different than winning at a chess game.Choi: Yeah. So it does recognize that there’s some analogical similarity, but I wouldn’t say that it’s super reliable for all the corner cases. And the thing about life is that it’s full of corner cases that humans are very good at just dealing with.Miller:  ‘Corner cases,’ meaning ‘complicated situations?’Choi: It could be complicated, it could be just obvious corner cases, trivial corner cases. What I mean, so, for example, why would there be an apple on the road when you drive? I mean how often do you actually encounter an apple when you drive? It might have been zero.[Dave Miller, laughing]THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorMiller: Sure. But it’s not unusual for them to be unusual objects, right – I mean like we regularly see stuff that shouldn’t be there. But you’re saying we’re just used to it as humans?Choi: Yeah. And we are ready for a lot of them. We almost always know what to do with them. Say, even if you don’t know what it is, you still know what the common sense reaction should be? Maybe avoid it if possible.Miller: Right. And I guess in the kind of binary question, ‘Do we avoid it or not?’ Can we squash the banana or the apple, or do we avoid the rock that will break our oil pan?Choi: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.Miller: So what are the, what are the potential applications for an A-I that’s more capable of common sense reasoning, setting aside questions of say, an autonomous vehicle that literally could have to make the decision of whether or not to swerve away from an apple. What other real life examples could be really important?Choi: For example, we now have home devices that can speak in natural language and interact with natural language and ask questions, answer questions. And so there was one incident not so long ago, a home device, suggesting a child to touch an electronic socket using a metal coin. That’s just such a bad idea, common sense-wise. Fortunately, the child did have a common sense that it’s a stupid thing to do. But you know, even the conversational A-I systems need this in order to avoid harmful conversations.Miller: How far along are A-Is right now in being able to understand sarcasm. Because, to me, that’s a kind of a language version of the apple in the road. It’s not exactly what it would seem to be.Choi: Yeah. So understanding figurative language, if that figurative language is what a lot of people do use in a very predictable context, then it will have a chance to understand it. If it’s a different kind then it might have a harder time.Miller: As I noted, you’re also working to make Artificial Intelligence capable of certain kinds of ethical decision making. What’s an example of what you’ve been working on?Choi: So surprisingly a lot of everyday decision making has moral implications, even including, you know, not suggesting a child to touch the electronic socket using a metal coin, because if you do, there’s moral consequences.Miller: There’s moral consequences for swerving out of the way of an apple and driving into oncoming traffic as well.Choi: Yeah, that too. So a lot of our seemingly trivial action decisions that we make about everyday actions actually do have moral implications. So the more A-I interacts with humans the closer they interact, it’s unavoidable that it’s going to encounter situations in which the decisions will have some kind of ethical moral implications.Miller: What are you interested in working with, in terms of ethical or moral questions, yourself?Choi: First of all, obvious cases don’t suggest a child to do dangerous things, that I think a lot of people would just agree. Also AI being aware of the questions where people tend to disagree, AI shouldn’t side with just one opinion in those cases, but rather be aware that it’s something that humans are having disagreements about. This includes even the cultural norms – different cultures have different standards, and that’s okay.Miller: When you started your work, especially in trying to push forward with ‘common sense’ reasoning in artificial intelligence, what were the kinds of responses you got from fellow computer scientists?Choi: So, ‘common sense’ was a very hot topic at the beginning of A-I field, which is in the 70s and 80s, and there was a major, I guess, failure – after a while, nothing really worked well. So they then decided that, okay, this is too hard and we will never be able to do this. So don’t work on it, period. And then I thought about it for a couple of years, and then I realized their conclusion is inconclusive when all that research was based on less compute, less data, no crowdsourcing, not the same kind of computational models that we have now. And also, it just seems like it’s inconclusive.Miller: This MacArthur Grant is a real explicit message from a panel of smart people that both, they’re impressed with the work you’ve already done, and they’re excited to see what you are going to do next. What does his grant mean to you?Choi: This was the last thing I expected in my life and I was genuinely at a loss for words, or I wasn’t sure what to think or what to say, for some time and I still cannot believe that it means that it’s okay to be ‘not perfect,’ it’s okay to still have to learn a lot and it’s okay to make mistakes along the way. But I shouldn’t give up.Miller: Yejin Choi, thanks very much and congratulations again.Choi: Thank you.Miller: Yejin Choi is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a 2022 MacArthur Foundation Fellow.
