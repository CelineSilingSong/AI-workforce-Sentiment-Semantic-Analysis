Until recently, artificial intelligence was a thing for science fiction movies and books. However, we are now in the midst of an ever-changing tech world where we are advancing faster than ever before. The future of AI is unknown, but that doesn’t stop people from contemplating. Here are some of the best quotes about the future of AI.

""Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."" -Stephen Hawking, Theoretical Physicist
""It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform. This includes healthcare, education, transportation, retail, communications, and agriculture. There are surprisingly clear paths for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries.""- Andrew Ng, Computer Scientist and Global Leader in AI
PROMOTED
""AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies."" -Sam Altman, Chairman of OpenAI
""I imagine a world in which AI is going to make us work more productively, live longer, and have cleaner energy."" -Fei-Fei Li, Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University

""Machine learning allows us to build software solutions that exceed human understanding and shows us how AI can innervate every industry."" -Steve Jurvetson, Board Member of SpaceX and Tesla
""The development of exponential technologies like new biotech and AI hint at a larger trend - one in which humanity can shift from a world of constraints to one in which we think with a long-term purpose where sustainable food production, housing, and fresh water is available for all."" -Arvind Gupta, Indian Toy Inventor
""What all of us have to do is to make sure we are using AI in a way that is for the benefit of humanity, not to the detriment of humanity."" -Tim Cook, CEO of Apple
""Secrecy is the underlying mistake that makes every innovation go wrong in Michael Crichton novels and films! If AI happens in the open, then errors and flaws may be discovered in time... perhaps by other, wary AIs!"" -David Brin, American Scientist and Author of The Postman
""AI is going to be extremely beneficial and already is, to the field of cybersecurity. It's also going to be beneficial to criminals."" -Dmitri Alperovitch
""Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.""-Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM
""In the long term, artificial intelligence and automation are going to be taking over so much of what gives humans a feeling of purpose."" -Matt Bellamy, Lead Singer of Muse
""The promise of artificial intelligence and computer science generally vastly outweighs the impact it could have on some jobs in the same way that, while the invention of the airplane negatively affected the railroad industry, it opened a much wider door to human progress."" -Paul Allen, Co-Founder of Microsoft
""It's going to be interesting to see how society deals with artificial intelligence, but it will definitely be cool."" -Colin Angle, CEO and Founder of iRobotFollow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website. Nicole MartinNicole Martin is the owner of NR Digital Consulting and host of Talk Digital To Me Podcast.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) renaissance that has so markedly affected the way technology platforms and devices of all kinds have developed this decade was at first met with skepticism.
Thankfully, we’re mostly past the initial misperceptions and we’re now busy applying AI to the coalface of business workflows in every vertical. We now realize that AI isn’t going to make us all redundant overnight, but it is going to channel us towards some new roles in work.
The robots are taking some aspects of our jobs over, but these are the repetitive tasks that we humans regard as part of the monotony of life. Fortunately, these are the definable, containable, measurable and essentially repeatable tasks that robots ‘enjoy’ doing.
The big AI work questions
The questions we must now face to understand the impact of AI in the workplace are:

whose job is going to change and how;
which types of professions will be impacted the most;
where will AI change male and female roles in different ways; and
how will these trends manifest themselves in developed versus developing countries?

Let’s address that last point first. McKinsey & Company’s report on The Future of Women at Work: Transitions in the Age of Automation says that men and women tend to cluster in different occupations in different ways across mature and emerging economies:
This [clustering] shapes the jobs lost and gained due to automation for each. In the mature economies studied, women account for 15% on average of machine operators, but over 70% on average of clerical support workers. In the emerging economies [in the study sample], women make up less than 25% of machine operators on average, but over 40% of clerical support workers.
It starts to become clear that roles in developed economies, which might typically be filled by highly specialized knowledge workers, will initially be less impacted by AI and automation than those that require comparatively simple physical machine operation.
This is not a binary division set in stone though. Over time, digital workflows and the application of data intelligence mean that even lawyers, doctors and actuaries, for example, will also see an increasing degree of their role handled by AI. The difference is, an unskilled or semi-skilled machine operator might see their job displaced in entirety. A skilled worker on the other hand can use the extra time they’re given to focus on value-added actions.
What humans are good at
We know that machines are good at cold, hard repetitive tasks. So that makes them really good at actions performed by rotation and even by conditioning – which is pretty much what Machine Learning is anyway. But it makes them comparatively bad at intuitive empathy on a human level.
If you were diagnosed with some challenging medical symptom, would you be happy hearing about it from a computer-generated readout as opposed to a human being? Even though we are making strides towards affective computing – or Artificial Emotional Intelligence as it is sometimes known – we are a long way off from any technology that can genuinely recognize human emotions and respond to them appropriately. Primary care physicians, caregivers, and therapists are unlikely to be outsourced to technology any time soon.
Part of this discussion highlights the need to understand the difference between Artificial Intelligence that makes decisions and Artificial Intelligence that advises on decisions. AI will change the nature of some work, but it won’t change the fact that people have to rely on ‘gut instinct’ in areas of critical thinking.
Let’s remember that, at a basic level, computers only know what we tell them based upon which datasets they are exposed to. Law firms are employing AI to help identify relevant documents in legal cases, but we still need a human judge to adjudicate a decision.
Chocolate pickle sauce
AI can be used to make music based upon identified beats and patterns. We know that it can even be used to create ‘art’ or at least some form of image based upon a defined request. But there are limits. AI engines directed at cooking have come up with abominations such as chocolate pickle sauce, simply because they fail to grasp the nuances of human taste.
Because of this gap between computer brains and human realities, I would assert that any job group that requires true creativity, such as writers, engineers, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists, musicians et cetera, is probably not going to be automated for a long while, for the most part at least.
Also remember, computers can perform jobs, but they can’t necessarily think. A computer can be programmed to Tweet, post to Facebook and even to create a suggested program of social media activities broken down by platform, time schedule and types of content. But that same computer can’t come up with a communications strategy from scratch for products and services that don’t necessarily even exist yet. True original ‘makers’ and ‘creators’ will find that their jobs are more robot-proof than others, for now at least.
The human-robot future workforce
Until the robots have robots (can we call them robot robots?) of their own to install and maintain them, humans are going to be needed to design, plan, install, manage and maintain any robotics, technology, or AI systems. This takes us back to my point about understanding what technology is capable of – the more familiar you are with the technology, the more valuable you will be in helping implement and maintain it.
For the immediate future – and long before ‘robot robots’ exist – it’s a human-robot future with both of us working in unison. What matters now to us as human beings is that we must realize that change is afoot – and that it is positive change. It is important for us to develop and champion all the creative skills that computer-driven AI and ML may never replace.
If you haven’t thought about your empathy, creativity, ability to develop strategic thinking and be a problem-solving human communicator, then now is your time to shine.
Don’t just sit there like a robot, or a robot might come and sit in your place.

New Northeastern-Gallup poll: People in the US, UK, and Canada want to keep up in the artificial intelligence age. They say employers, educators, and governments are letting them down.

Majorities of people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom think that artificial intelligence will improve their lives, but they believe that higher education, government, and employers are not doing enough to improve their skills.
Fears that the new era of automation will leave educated workers behind are crystallized by a first-of-its-kind survey conducted by Northeastern University and Gallup.
Fewer than 10 percent in each country said their undergraduate education will provide the skills they will need when artificial intelligence displaces millions of people from their jobs.
The global survey of more than 10,000 respondents is the first poll to reveal an international cross-section of opinions about artificial intelligence as economies around the world undergo the transformative move to automation. It follows earlier Northeastern-Gallup polls that focused on American views of artificial intelligence.
“As we prepare for the age of artificial intelligence, people around the world understand that learning will need to become a lifelong endeavor,” said Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern. “This presents enormous opportunities for the higher education sector if we make the right decisions and investments. This can be the golden age of higher education.”
A majority of the public in all three countries believes large businesses and government are not “doing enough to address the need for career-long learning and training.” Majorities in the U.S. and U.K. also believe that higher education is failing to provide lifelong learning opportunities. Only a narrow majority of Canadians disagrees.

Data Visualizations by Tyler Machado and Derrick Henry
Respondents in all three countries cite cost as a major barrier they “face when seeking education or training over the course of your career.”
“It is time to think about ‘college access’ in a completely new way,” added Aoun, “not as a one-time ticket to an undergraduate classroom, but as a lifelong passport to reinvention.”
Asked who should be responsible for making lifelong learning more affordable in order to keep up with advances in artificial intelligence, U.S. respondents overwhelmingly prefer that employers take on the burden. In Canada and the U.K., those polled expressed a preference that governments help pay.

 The poll revealed several differences of opinion among the three countries
In the U.K. and Canada, majorities believe their current skills and education are already outdated or on the verge of becoming redundant. But only 35 percent of Americans admitted to similar fears, with 42 percent expressing confidence that their job skills will never become obsolete.
 Additional differing points of view: 

       Who should bear the responsibility for making lifelong learning more affordable in the artificial intelligence era? Seventy-three percent of Americans want employers to take on that responsibility, while Canadians (64 percent) and U.K. residents (62 percent) believe it should fall on government.


       When asked about the best skills to withstand artificial intelligence, six in 10 respondents in Canada and the U.K. believe teamwork, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are most important in the new era of automation; whereas Americans are split 50-50 between those “soft” skills and technical skills like math, science, coding, and working with data.


       Three-quarters of Canadians and U.K. residents support a universal basic income program to help people who lose their jobs to automation. But 57 percent of Americans oppose the program.

 Among the findings were areas of consensus as well

       Despite concerns that they are not prepared for the new era and the job losses that will result from automation, majorities in all three countries believe that advancements in machine learning will do more good than harm overall. When asked to assess the impact that artificial intelligence “will have on how people work and live in the next 10 years,” large majorities said the consequences will be “very” or “mostly” positive (72 percent in Canada, 70 percent in U.K., 67 percent in U.S.).


       The Northeastern-Gallup poll also reveals a lack of confidence among respondents in the three countries that they will receive the education they need to be prepared for changes to the workforce. Among college graduates, fewer than 10 percent (five percent in the U.S., six percent in U.K., eight percent in Canada) believes their undergraduate education prepared them for using artificial intelligence at work. Among all respondents, only three percent in the United States, 10 percent in the U.K., and 12 percent in Canada “strongly agree” that universities in their countries are preparing graduates for success in the current workforce.


       On the question of whether institutions are addressing the need for lifelong learning, there was agreement that large businesses (71 percent in the U.S., 62 percent in Canada, and 59 percent in the U.K.) as well as government (78 percent in the U.S., 71 percent in the U.K., and  65 percent in Canada) are not responding adequately. Higher education also received failing marks in the U.S. (75 percent) and U.K. (55 percent).


       Asked to compare the importance of lifelong learning versus a one-time advanced degree or certificate, overwhelming majorities preferred education over the course of their careers (95 percent U.S., 94 percent U.K., 92 percent Canada).


       Seven in ten Americans, six in ten Canadians, and six in ten U.K. residents believe the advent of artificial intelligence will eliminate more jobs than it creates. But that is not their only concern economically: Majorities in all three countries view the outsourcing of jobs to other countries as a greater threat than the loss of jobs that will result from artificial intelligence.

 Other key findings include: 

       If their skills become outdated, then strong majorities in all three countries would prefer to be educated by an employer rather than by a university. The sentiments were echoed by human resources officers who participated in the qualitative portion of the survey.


       A majority of Canadians continue to believe in the value of a college degree, but their optimism isn’t shared in the other countries. Forty-one percent of U.K. respondents expect a college degree to diminish in importance over the next decade, and 36 percent of Americans agree with them.


       Majorities in each country favor the development of employer and government-matched lifelong learning accounts.



       When using products or services that employ artificial intelligence, majorities in all three countries said they worry “often” that their personal information is at risk.

June 26, 2019Credit...Katherine StreeterShare full articleRead in appBy Carol GiacomoMs. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.Early in the Afghanistan war, Army Rangers hunting Taliban fighters along the Pakistan border saw a goatherd with a radio, probably reporting their position to the Taliban. Under the rules of war, soldiers can shoot someone informing enemy forces of their location, but these men saw that the goatherd was just a girl.If she had come into the sights of the kind of autonomous robot or drone now under development, rather than of trained snipers, it might not have made the distinction between target and child, and killed her, according to Paul Scharre, who was leading the Rangers that day.Mr. Scharre, author of “Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War,” recounted this episode in a speech earlier this year at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation, laying out the stakes as the artificial intelligence revolution spreads further onto the battlefield.“How would you design a robot to know the difference between what is legal and what is right?” he asked. “And how would you even begin to write down those rules ahead of time? What if you didn’t have a human there, to interpret these, to bring that whole set of human values to those decisions?”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor now, these are hypothetical questions. Two senior Pentagon officials, who spoke to The Times on background because much of their work on artificial intelligence is classified, say the United States is “not even close” to fielding a completely autonomous weapon.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.But three years ago, Azerbaijani forces used what appeared to be an Israeli-made kamikaze drone called a Harop to blow up a bus carrying Armenian soldiers. The drone can automatically fly to a site, find a target, dive down and detonate, according to the manufacturer. For now, it is designed to have human controllers who can stop it.Not long after that in California, the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office tested 103 unarmed Perdix drones which, on their own, were able to swarm around a target. “They are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” the office’s director at the time, William Roper, said in a Defense Department statement. The Estonian-made Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System looks like a mini-tank with guns, camera and the ability to track down and fire on a target. It’s human controlled, but its maker says it’s “autonomous and self-driving with growing A.I. assistance.”“It is well within the means of most capable militaries to build at least relatively crude and simple autonomous weapons today,” Mr. Scharre said in an email exchange after his speech.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs the ability of systems to act autonomously increases, those who study the dangers of such weapons, including the United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts, fear that military planners may be tempted to eliminate human controls altogether. A treaty has been proposed to prohibit these self-directed lethal weapons, but it’s gotten limited support.The proposed ban competes with the growing acceptance of this technology, with at least 30 countries having automated air and missile defense systems that can identify approaching threats and attack them on their own, unless a human supervisor stops the response. The Times of Israel has reported that an Israeli armed robotic vehicle called the Guardium has been used on the Gaza border. The United States Navy has tested and retired an aircraft that could autonomously take off and land on an aircraft carrier and refuel in midair.Britain, France, Russia, China and Israel are also said to be developing experimental autonomous stealth combat drones to operate in an enemy’s heavily defended airspace.The speed with which the technology is advancing raises fears of an autonomous weapons arms race with China and Russia, making it more urgent that nations work together to establish controls so humans never completely surrender life and death choices in combat to machines. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe senior Pentagon officials who spoke to The Times say critics are unduly alarmed and insist the military will act responsibly.“Free-will robots is not where any of us are thinking about this right now,” one official told me.What they are exploring is using artificial intelligence to enable weapons to attack more quickly and accurately, provide more information about chaotic battlefields and give early warning of attacks. Rather than increase the risk of civilian casualties, such advances  could reduce such deaths by overcoming human error, officials say.The United States, for instance, is exploring using swarms of autonomous small boats to repulse threats to larger Navy ships. Yet Pentagon officials say American commanders would never accept fully autonomous systems, because it would mean surrendering the intelligence and experience of highly trained officers to machines.While artificial intelligence has proved a powerful tool in numerous fields, it has serious vulnerabilities, like computer hacks, data breaches and the possibility that humans could lose control of the algorithm.Only 28 countries have supported the call for a treaty banning such weapons, which the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an international coalition of more than 100 nongovernmental organizations, began working for in 2012. In March, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said that “machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement are politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by international law.” He called on a United Nations group to develop means, by treaty, political pressure or strict guidelines, to make that happen.That work is futile unless the United States and other major powers lead the way.

June 29, 2019 
The role of technology is becoming more and more central to our educational infrastructure, with AI-powered systems transforming the way we teach and learn. This is the age of the hi-tech classroom. 
 
 
Since the inception of the institution of education, the methods of teaching and the bond shared between learners and educators have evolved significantly. Teaching methods across the globe have become more structured to give better, more streamlined results. This transformation can be majorly attributed to the ongoing intervention of technology.
On the back of continuous technological advancement, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the teaching-learning process. The relationship between educators and students is changing, where educators have become more approachable and much better at understanding their students’ perspectives. Technology has made learning more collaborative, as teachers and students are working in tandem to achieve better outcomes.
This is shrinking the age-old accessibility gap and enabling tailor-made learning experiences for different learners with varied needs. Artificial intelligence (AI), among many technological applications, has a big role in changing old trends in education space. Let’s see how.
Use in administrative tasks
AI, by definition, focuses on machines that are designed to be intelligent enough to work and react like humans. AI has automated drab administrative tasks and cut down on the time and effort teachers used to put in things like assessing students’ work and grading exams. Though earlier AI-led test grading was limited to only objective-type answers, newer AI systems are being designed to assess subjective answers as well.
With this, teachers can now direct their energies towards engaging with their students and dealing with challenges that they are facing. AI is also helping school admission boards by automating classification and processing of paperwork.
For quality education
In an age when technology is shrinking the world, it is also making quality education more accessible to a larger population in the form of smart content. With advanced applications of AI, educators are setting content as per the local needs of the students in different parts of the country. They often offer education through virtual content like video conferencing, lectures etc.
Even the textbooks have transformed as AI systems are now being used to create digital textbooks for specific topics/subjects. This is helping to engage students of all academic grades and ages. Many educational platforms use AI to enable professors to create electronic curriculums and simplify textbook content through various tools.
Tailoring education 
Each student possesses different learning abilities and pace of absorption. Who would have imagined that in a class full of students, teachers could fully identify each one’s strengths and weaknesses and work on them individually. Now, with the help of AI, they put in place systems that work according to the needs of the students.
If a student faces challenges with a particular topic, the system identifies the areas that need to be focused upon. Then, using predictive analysis, it provides help as and when needed. This helps students work at their own pace and brings out the best in them.
Identifies improvement
It is not uncommon for students to grapple with particularly challenging concepts in their curricula. This is where educators step in to ensure that students’ understanding is not limited. But sometimes even the best of teachers might leave a gap in explaining a concept, which could leave students with half-baked knowledge. AI, on multiple online course platforms, is solving this problem. Adopting a utilitarian approach, it analyses the most prevalent trend among students. If the trend is detracting from the intended goal, AI alerts educators and directs students towards the correct answer.
This way it facilitates educators in building a stronger conceptual foundation for all students alike. It helps students with immediate feedback and stops them in their tracks if they are straying and improves their understanding of the subject.
Universal access 
AI-powered learning system makes classrooms accessible to all, including those in another country. This can be highly helpful to those students who are unable to attend school due to an illness or want to study a different course from the one available in their school.
School education in India has seen substantial progress in recent decades, with efforts at both the Central and State levels. Substantive gains in enrolment have been achieved—Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) is 97% at elementary level and 80% at secondary level, as per recent figures. Although the path is long and full of obstacles, the education pioneers of the country have vowed to take the national education system on a par with the global level.
The role of AI is significantly increasing and creating adaptive teaching-learning techniques. A study states that by 2021, the application of AI in education and learning will increase by 47.5%. Beyond academics, it can also streamline students’ career choices.
As the development of new applications of AI is underway, the education industry is gearing up to be a part of the revolution. With its distinct benefits, AI’s presence is ever swelling and in spite of its anticipated significance in the education space, it might surprise us with even greater value in time to come.

A team at the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute has developed technology they claim can detect tiny algal cells in the ocean before they multiply to create toxic algal blooms.
Toxic algal blooms, also known as 'red tides', pose a risk to human health, damage ecosystems, close fisheries, and hurt the economy. But if a bloom is accurately predicted before it begins, fisheries management can plan for closures in advance.

Shellfish fisheries in particular stand to gain a lot from this type of technology. Shellfish like oysters and mussels are filter feeders, meaning they eat by pumping water through their gills and trapping food particles. With the capacity to filter fifty or more gallons of water in a single day, oysters quickly accumulate the toxic chemicals released by harmful algal blooms. Artificial intelligence technology could inform fisheries management of impending blooms, closing fisheries before any toxic shellfish are collected, thereby preventing fisherman from wasting resources while adding extra protection to consumers.

The technology developed by Nelson can distinguish healthy algal cells from toxic cells, and labels the toxic cells accordingly. Using artificial intelligence is much more efficient than having scientists process samples manually. ""In a sample, there's thousands [of algal cells] and you've got to count them and detect the one or two toxic ones,"" explains Brian Russell, director of the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute. ""[It's a] really challenging job [for] a trained biologist with a science degree and then one to two years training.""

The Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute is not the first group to develop artificial intelligence to track algae, but their strategy is unique. In addition to automating the identification of algae, Russell's team, in collaboration with the Cawthron Institute, have developed a system that takes a photo and records a 'label' every time a different algae is identified. ""So now we're growing this database of all this labelled data,"" says Russel. ""Basically, it's becoming as expert as the scientist and we can scale it and go faster and faster and faster.""
The Cawthron Institute and Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute recently received $6 million of funding for continued efforts studying and tracking algal blooms, and plan to expand their use of artificial intelligence to help understand why whales beach in New Zealand's Golden Bay.

Also, reliance on robots for the smallest chores will make the human brain feeble.In this world, where the youth struggle and toil to get employed for their daily bread, robots could make matters worse.Imagine having robots conversing with humans, wherein the person wastes time trying to make the robot understand what he actually expects from that piece of technology.Robots need a large capital, maintenance, power, etc, while humans do not.If robots ultimately do all the work, and man just sits and monitor them, then it would cause health hazards and make man idle.If an AI-based diagnosis fails to detect the actual illness of the patient, who would be held responsible for it – the programmer or the artificial intelligence itself? Humans agree to work at a much lower income as compared to the heavy costs required to hire a robot which will affect a company’s profits.India has almost 18 million people who are trapped in the major issue of unemployment.So, why we do need robots when humans are willing to work and contribute to society?AGAINST THE ARGUMENT (By Varad Khedekar, Class 10, Thakur Vidya Mandir High School, Kandivli (East), Mumbai)It is often said that necessity is the mother of invention. To make life convenient and achieve advancement, we humans have been working rigorously in every field. Robots and artificial intelligence are some of the current topics of research and development. But a lot of capital is invested to make or buy robots and they need to be maintained and supplied power for their running. Their software and equipment costs are too high.On the other hand, human resources are quite affordable and reliable. Robots have no sense of emotions or conscience and do not have decision-making abilities to handle difficult situations. Automation can be only done when robots are fed with programmes by humans. According to a report in the United Kingdom, robots and artificial intelligence will create more jobs than they take, in the coming years. Robots lack the ability to create or imagine things as ultimately, they are machines under human control.Humans are the ones who develop new ideas and have the potential to turn imagination into reality.Jobs in health, scientific and technical services or research, hospitality etc, cannot be completely taken over by robots. With the use of artificial intelligence, robots can interpret and learn things, but can never beat the ultimate human mind. Robots eliminate dangerous jobs for humans because they can work in hazardous environments. AI would have a low error rate and have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed, resulting in efficient and fast work for humans.In the future, we may see a robotic world, but the master key will always lie in human hands.","{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Attendees watch a demonstration performed by robotic arms at the MWC Shanghai exhibition in Shanghai, China.', 'description': 'Attendees watch a demonstration performed by robotic arms at the MWC Shanghai exhibition in Shanghai, China.', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}"

Oxford Economics: Robots are here and they are after your job

Although robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted global productivity and economic growth, more than 2,030 manufacturing jobs now performed by humans will be lost to innovation in the coming decade, according to a new report released Wednesday (June 26) by United Kingdom’s Oxford Economics.
In a 64-page report entitled “How Robots Change the World,” Oxford CEO and Chief Economist Adrian Cooper said the robotics revolution is rapidly accelerating, as fast-paced technological advances in automation, engineering, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and machine learning converge. The result, Cooper concludes, will transform the capabilities of robots and their ability to take over tasks once carried out by humans.


According to data from the eye-raising report, the number of robots in use worldwide multiplied three-fold over the past two decades, to 2.25 million. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030, with 14 million in China alone.
“The implications are immense, and the emerging challenges for governments and policymakers are equally daunting in their scale,” said Cooper in the report’s foreword.
Cooper continued: “The rise of the robots will boost productivity and economic growth. It will lead, too, to the creation of new jobs in yet-to-exist industries, in a process of ‘creative destruction.’ But existing business models across many sectors will be seriously disrupted. And tens of millions of existing jobs will be lost, with human workers displaced by robots at an increasing rate as robots become steadily more sophisticated.”
For both people and businesses, Cooper said the effects of these job losses will vary greatly across countries and regions, with a disproportionate toll on lower-skilled workers and on poorer local economies. In many places, the impact will aggravate social and economic stresses from unemployment and income inequality in times when increasing political polarization is already a worrying trend.
As noted, every third robot worldwide is now installed in China, which accounts for around one-fifth of the world’s total stock of robots — up from just 0.1% in 2000, the report states. In 2017, China expanded its lead as the world’s largest market for industrial robots, accounting for 36% of global sales, up from 30% in 2016.
If this trajectory of investment continues, robots in use in China by 2030 will dwarf the rest of the world’s stock of industrial androids as it reinforces its position as the world’s primary manufacturing hub. By contrast, though it has grown by around 370,000 units since 2000, the combined robot inventory of the U.S. and Europe has fallen to under 40% of the global share from its peak of close to 50% in 2009.
In Japan, formerly the world leader in automation, the active stock of robots has been reduced by around 100,000 units since the start of the millennium, in line with a rebalancing of its economy away from manufacturing and the migration of many production facilities offshore, especially to China.
Closer to home, the report notes that the most defenseless states to the robot revolution in the U.S. are Oregon, Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and North Carolina. Those “high vulnerability” states are generally associated with steel-making and heavy industry.
On the other hand, most New England states have low vulnerability to the future spread of manufacturing robots, as well as those with a higher reliance on tourism such as Florida, Nevada and Hawaii. Arkansas is listed as a “lower-medium” risk due to the state’s robust tourism sector and fast-growing service sector.
SERVICE SECTOR BOTS ON THE WAY
Although the report highlights how the rise of industrial robots has already reduced manufacturing employment significantly in advanced economies around the world, those blue collars jobs only account for a minor share of total employment in these countries. Instead, according to the latest Oxford estimates, most people work in the sprawling service sector— around three-quarters of all workers.
To date, the adoption rate for physical robots across service industries has been slow for many reasons, which doesn’t count software-only bots and applications that have already gained wide acceptance in powering process automation, the report states. For one, the underlying return on large capital investments can be harder to justify in environments without significant scale. Also, many aspects of service work can prove difficult to automate.
“However, innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computing power suggest a significant acceleration is coming, particularly in the category of logistics systems—led in part by the global expansion of Amazon and other multinational e-commerce companies,” the report states.
To complete the study, Oxford said it brought together a team of economists, econometricians, modelers and technology experts from across its worldwide network of over 250 analysts to conduct an extensive research study to analyze the robotics phenomenon.

The back-end processing staff has reportedly been offered or deployed in new job roles.Accenture’s India operations, which mainly include credit card and mortgage application processing, have been automated with Artificial intelligence and virtual chatbots, according to a ZDNet report. Earlier, the company had 110,000 people onboard to perform the same tasks that have now been automated. However, this has given the company an edge over other in terms of new hires and their training, Amit Bansal, Accenture’s Managing Director, analytics delivery lead APAC told ZDNet. While the company hasn’t disclosed the nature of the new jobs, in the past other IT majors have also sought to retrain and redeploy staff in other areas. For instance, in 2015, Wipro retrained 75,000 in Artificial Intelligence and cognitive technologies under its project NextGen. Of this, the employees that did not qualify for the digital business remained in the technology sector, Wipro CEO, Abidali Z. Neemuchwala told Livemint.A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute has shown that automation will cost India a major transition in jobs over the next 10 years — mostly the clerical and in-service jobs including administrative positions. This shift in roles will affect nearly 11 million working women in India. However, with the advent of automation and new algorithms, many new job roles have been introduced. This is expected to create 133 million new opportunities in the job market, according to the World Economic Forum.Accenture was recently ranked first on the HFS research top ten report for Google AI Services 2019 based on the innovation, execution and client feedback on the Google Artificial Intelligence.See also:Automation will affect women the most in the Indian job market: ReportFinancial services sector to add 47,800 new jobs — Delhi, Mumbai top locationsHere’s how much an IT employee makes in different countries",
