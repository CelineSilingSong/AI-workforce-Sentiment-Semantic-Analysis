San Francisco

         — 
    


            In 2010, artificial intelligence was more likely to pop up in dystopian science-fiction movies than in everyday life. And it certainly wasn’t something people worried might take over their jobs in the near future.
    

            A lot has changed since then. AI is now used for everything from helping you take better smartphone photos and analyzing your personality in job interviews to letting you buy a sandwich without paying a cashier. It’s also becoming increasingly common — and controversial — when used for surveillance, such as facial-recognition software, and for spreading misinformation, as with deepfake videos that purport to show a person doing or saying something they didn’t.
    

            How did AI come to invade so many different parts of our lives over the last decade? The answer lies in technological advancements in the field, combined with cheaper, easier access to more powerful computers.

            Much of the AI you encounter on a regular basis uses a technique known as machine learning, which is when a computer teaches itself by poring over data. More specifically, major developments over the last decade focused on a type of machine learning, called deep learning, that’s modeled after the way neurons work in the brain. With deep learning, a computer might be tasked with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like (and, in fact, it was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012).
    

            “Ten years ago, deep learning was not on anybody’s radar, and now it’s in everything,” said Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington.
    

            AI is still quite simplistic. A machine-learning algorithm, for instance, typically does just one thing and often requires mountains of data to learn how to do it well. A lot of work in the field of AI focuses on making machine learning systems better at generalizing and learning from fewer examples, Domingos said. 
    

            “We’ve come a thousand miles, but there’s a million miles still to go,” he said.
    

            With a nod to those thousand miles already in the technological rear-view mirror, CNN Business took a look back at the last 10 years of AI’s journey, highlighting six of the many ways it has impacted our lives.
    

        Smartphones


            These days, artificial intelligence is all over smartphones, from facial-recognition software for unlocking the handset to popular apps like Google Maps. Increasingly, companies like Apple and Google are trying to run AI directly on handsets (with chips specifically meant to help with AI-driven capabilities), so activities like speech recognition can be performed on the phone rather than on a remote computer — the kind of thing that can make it even faster to do things like translate words from one language to another and preserve data privacy.

            One deceptively simple-sounding example of this popped up in October, when Google introduced a transcription app called Recorder. It can record and transcribe, in real time. It knows what you’re saying and identifies various sounds like music and applause; the recordings can later be searched by individual words. The app can run entirely on Google Pixel smartphones. Google said this was difficult to accomplish because it requires several pieces of AI that must work without killing the phone’s battery life or taking up too much of its main processor. If consumers take a shine to the app, it could lead to yet more AI being squeezed onto our smartphones.
    

        Social networks


            When Facebook began in 2004, it focused on connecting people. These days, it’s fixated on doing so with artificial intelligence. It’s become so core to the company’s products that a year ago, Facebook’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, told CNN Business that without deep learning the social network would be “dust.”

            After years of investment, deep learning now underpins everything from the posts and ads you see on the site to the ways your friends can be automatically tagged in photos. It can even help remove content like hate speech from the social network. It’s still got a long way to go, though, particularly when it comes to spotting violence or hate speech online, which is tricky for machines to figure out.
    

            And Facebook isn’t the only one; it’s simply the biggest. Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks rely heavily on AI, too. 
    

        Virtual assistants


            Any time you talk to Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google’s Assistant, you’re having an up-close-and-personal interaction with AI. This is most notable in the ways these helpers understand what you’re saying and (hopefully) respond with what you want.

            The rise of these virtual assistants began in 2011, when Apple released Siri on the iPhone. Google followed with Google Now in 2012 (a newer version, Google Assistant, came out in 2016).
    








Amazon



            But while many consumers took a shine to Apple’s and Google’s early computerized helpers, they were mostly confined to smartphones. In many ways, it was Amazon’s Alexa, introduced in 2014 and embodied by an Internet-connected speaker called the Amazon Echo, that helped the virtual assistant market explode –— and brought AI to many more homes in the process.
    

            Consider this: During just the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.4 million Alexa-using smart speakers, making up the biggest single chunk (nearly 37%) of the global market for these gadgets, according to data from Canalys.
    

        Surveillance


            As AI has improved, so have its capabilities as a surveillance tool. One of the most controversial of these is facial recognition technology, which identifies people from live or recorded video or still photos, typically by comparing their facial features with those in a database of faces. It’s been used in many different settings: at concerts, by police, and at airports, to name a few.

            Facial recognition systems have come under growing scrutiny, however, due to concerns about privacy and accuracy. In December, for instance, a US government study found extensive racial bias in almost 200 facial recognition algorithms, with racial minorities much more likely to be misidentified than whites.
    

            In the US, there are few rules governing how AI in general, and facial recognition in particular, can be deployed. So in 2019, several cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Somerville in Massachusetts, banned city departments (including police) from using the technology.
    

        Healthcare


            AI is increasingly being used to diagnose and manage all kinds of health issues, from spotting lung cancer to keeping an eye on mental health problems and gastrointestinal issues. Though much of this work is still in the research or early-development stages, there are startups — such as Mindstrong Health, which uses an app to measure moods in patients who are dealing with mental health issues — already trying out AI systems with people.

Two startups in the midst of this are Auggi, a gut-health startup building an app to help track gastrointestinal issues, and Seed Health, which sells probiotics and works on applying microbes to human health. In November, they started collecting photos of poop from the general public that they intend to use to make a data set of human fecal images. Auggi wants to use these pictures to make an app that can use computer vision to automatically classify different types of waste that people with chronic gut-related problems — such as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS — usually have to track manually with pen and paper.
    

        Art


            Can AI create art? More and more often the answer is yes. Over the last 10 years, AI has been used to make musical compositions, paintings and more that seem very similar to the kinds of things humans come up with (though the jury is still out on whether a machine can actually possess creativity). And sometimes, that art can even be a big money maker.

            Perhaps the clearest indication that AI-generated art is gaining popularity came in late 2018, when a blurry, Old Masters-esque piece called “Edmond de Belamy” became the first work produced by a machine to be sold at auction.
    

            The print was created using a cutting-edge technique known as GANS, which involves two neural networks competing with each other to come up with something new based on a data set. In this case, the data set was a slew of existing paintings, while the new thing was the computerized artwork. GANS is also gaining popularity because it can be used to make deepfakes.

It can even help remove content like hate speech from the social network. It’s still got a long way to go, though, particularly when it comes to spotting violence or hate speech online, which is tricky for machines to figure out. And Facebook isn’t the only one; it’s simply the biggest. Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks rely heavily on AI, too.  Virtual assistants Any time you talk to Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google’s Assistant, you’re having an up-close-and-personal interaction with AI. This is most notable in the ways these helpers understand what you’re saying and (hopefully) respond with what you want. The rise of these virtual assistants began in 2011, when Apple released Siri on the iPhone. Google followed with Google Now in 2012 (a newer version, Google Assistant, came out in 2016). But while many consumers took a shine to Apple’s and Google’s early computerized helpers, they were mostly confined to smartphones. In many ways, it was Amazon’s Alexa, introduced in 2014 and embodied by an Internet-connected speaker called the Amazon Echo, that helped the virtual assistant market explode –— and brought AI to many more homes in the process. Consider this: During just the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.4 million Alexa-using smart speakers, making up the biggest single chunk (nearly 37%) of the global market for these gadgets, according to data from Canalys. Surveillance As AI has improved, so have its capabilities as a surveillance tool. One of the most controversial of these is facial recognition technology, which identifies people from live or recorded video or still photos, typically by comparing their facial features with those in a database of faces. It’s been used in many different settings: at concerts, by police, and at airports, to name a few. Facial recognition systems have come under growing scrutiny, however, due to concerns about privacy and accuracy. In December, for instance, a US government study found extensive racial bias in almost 200 facial recognition algorithms, with racial minorities much more likely to be misidentified than whites. In the US, there are few rules governing how AI in general, and facial recognition in particular, can be deployed. So in 2019, several cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Somerville in Massachusetts, banned city departments (including police) from using the technology. Healthcare AI is increasingly being used to diagnose and manage all kinds of health issues, from spotting lung cancer to keeping an eye on mental health problems and gastrointestinal issues. Though much of this work is still in the research or early-development stages, there are startups — such as Mindstrong Health, which uses an app to measure moods in patients who are dealing with mental health issues — already trying out AI systems with people. Two startups in the midst of this are Auggi, a gut-health startup building an app to help track gastrointestinal issues, and Seed Health, which sells probiotics and works on applying microbes to human health. In November, they started collecting photos of poop from the general public that they intend to use to make a data set of human fecal images. Auggi wants to use these pictures to make an app that can use computer vision to automatically classify different types of waste that people with chronic gut-related problems — such as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS — usually have to track manually with pen and paper. Art Can AI create art? More and more often the answer is yes. Over the last 10 years, AI has been used to make musical compositions, paintings and more that seem very similar to the kinds of things humans come up with (though the jury is still out on whether a machine can actually possess creativity). And sometimes, that art can even be a big money maker.  Perhaps the clearest indication that AI-generated art is gaining popularity came in late 2018, when a blurry, Old Masters-esque piece called “Edmond de Belamy” became the first work produced by a machine to be sold at auction. The print was created using a cutting-edge technique known as GANS, which involves two neural networks competing with each other to come up with something new based on a data set. In this case, the data set was a slew of existing paintings, while the new thing was the computerized artwork. GANS is also gaining popularity because it can be used to make deepfakes.","['business', 'tech']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rachel Metz', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-metz'}]",2019-12-23T15:23:44Z,How AI came to rule our lives over the last decade,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191115110957-data-privacy-phone-file.jpg?q=w_3000,h_1918,x_0,y_0,c_fill', 'caption': 'A customer tries an iPhone X at the Apple Omotesando store on November 3, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan.', 'sourceOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Getty'}, 'width': '3000', 'height': '1918', 'creditText': 'Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images', 'dateCreated': '2019-11-15T16:13:38Z', 'dateModified': '2019-11-15T16:13:38Z'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190909104245-apple-iphones-xr-file.jpg?q=w_4928,h_3280,x_0,y_0,c_fill', 'caption': 'General view of the Apple IPhone XR during the Covent Garden re-opening and iPhone XR launch at Apple store, Covent Garden on October 26, 2018 in London, England.', 'sourceOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Getty'}, 'width': '4928', 'height': '3280', 'creditText': 'Stuart C.

The Artificial Inventor Project

December  2019

   
   
   
   




By Ryan Abbott, MD, JD, MTOM, Professor of Law and Health Sciences at University of Surrey, UK, and Adjunct Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCLA, California, USA
In August 2019, our team (see below) announced two international patent filings for “AI-generated inventions.” That is to say, inventions generated autonomously by an artificial intelligence (AI) under circumstances in which we believe that no natural person, as traditionally defined, qualifies as an inventor. These applications list the AI as the inventor and the AI’s owner as the patent applicant and the prospective owner of any issued patents. The European Patent Office (EPO) and United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) have already evaluated these applications on their merits. Both offices found that the applications meet the requirements of patentability to the extent possible prior to the publication of the applications. The applications have also been filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty – which facilitates the process of obtaining patent protection in over 150 countries – and are currently pending examination in a growing number of patent offices.

In 2019, the Artificial Inventor Project team submitted patent applications listing DABUS (a type of AI-based “creativity machine”) as the inventor. This is notable because most jurisdictions only recognize humans as inventors. Their aim? To challenge established norms around inventorship. (Photo: PhonlamaiPhoto / iStock / Getty Images Plus)

The state of play
People have claimed to have secured patents for AI-generated inventions since at least the 1980s, but no one has ever disclosed an AI’s role in such a patent application. Patent offices will not generally object to self-reported inventorship; some of the earliest applicants for AI-generated inventions say their attorneys advised them to list themselves as inventors.

It is important that appropriate policies are put in place to deal with AI-generated works.

There is almost no law on AI-generated inventions. Most jurisdictions  require patent applications to disclose an inventor who is a natural person. This requirement is designed to protect and acknowledge the rights of human inventors. Yet, inventors do not necessarily own their patents; in fact, most patents are owned by businesses. Ownership rights can pass from an individual to a company by contractual assignment or otherwise by virtue of law. For example, in many jurisdictions, ownership passes automatically to an employer if an invention is created within the scope of employment. Even when an inventor does not own a patent, laws requiring a natural person to be listed as an inventor ensure that people receive due credit. However, these laws were created without regard to the future possibility of inventive activity by machines.
Recent developments in copyright law with respect to AI
There has been more discussion about AI-generated works and copyright law. In 1988, the United Kingdom became the first country to provide explicit copyright protection for AI or “computer-generated” works. In circumstances where an otherwise copyrightable work is created but no natural person qualifies as an author, the “producer” of the work is deemed to be the author.
The United States Copyright Office has taken the opposite approach. Since at least 1973, it has applied a “human authorship policy” that prohibits copyright protection of works that are not generated by a human author. That makes it very tempting to take credit for an AI-generated work, such as a song or an artwork, that you think has commercial value – the AI is unlikely to complain.

In IP as well as many other areas of the law, the phenomenon of AI stepping into the shoes of people promises to be profoundly disruptive.

The human authorship policy came into public view with the “Monkey selfies” case , which involved a series of images taken by an Indonesian crested macaque named Naruto. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued on Naruto’s behalf, arguing he should own the copyright in the photographs. However, the case was dismissed because the United States Congress had not authorized animals to sue under the Copyright Act. As a result, the merits of the human authorship requirement have never been tested in court.
Why patent protection for AI-generated inventions is necessary
Patent protection should be available for AI-generated works because it will incentivize innovation. The prospect of holding a patent will not directly motivate an AI, but it will encourage some of the people who develop, own, and use AI. Allowing patents on AI-generated works, therefore, will promote the development of inventive AI, which will ultimately result in more innovation for society.
Also, patents can promote disclosure of information and the commercialization of socially valuable products. Patents for AI-generated works will accomplish these goals as well as any other patents. By contrast, failing to allow protection for inventions generated by AI would mean that, in the future, businesses may not be able to use AI to invent, even when it becomes more effective than people in solving certain problems. Such a scenario would also encourage gamesmanship with patent offices by failing to declare a filing is based on an AI-generated invention.
Beyond providing protection for AI-generated inventions, AI should be listed as an inventor when it is functionally inventing because this will protect the rights of human inventors. Allowing a person to be listed as an inventor for an AI-generated invention would not be unfair to an AI, which has no interest in being acknowledged, but allowing people to take credit for work they have not done would devalue human inventorship. It would put the work of someone who merely asks an AI to solve a problem on an equal footing with someone who is legitimately inventing something new.
Of course, an AI would not own a patent. We have never suggested this, and I am not aware of anyone seriously making such an argument. AI systems lack both legal and moral rights and thus the ability to own property. Moreover, there would be significant costs and no obvious benefits to changing laws to allow AI ownership.  Nevertheless, many of the objections to the Artificial Inventor Project have unfortunately focused on AI ownership.
Again, listing an AI as an inventor is not a matter of providing rights to machines, but it would protect the moral rights of traditional human inventors and the integrity of the patent system. As discussed earlier, it is frequently the case that the inventor of a patent is not its owner. We also believe that an AI’s owner should own any patents on AI-generated inventions, in line with general principles of property ownership as well as rules that apply to other areas of intellectual property (IP) law such as trade secret protections.
Natural persons, AI and inventorship
The argument has been made that for any AI-generated work there is a natural person that qualifies as an inventor. That argument is not persuasive. When someone instructs an AI to solve a problem, that person may qualify as an inventor if he or she formulates or structures a problem in a manner that requires inventive skill but not where a problem is obvious or already understood.
Similarly, a programmer or AI developer might qualify as an inventor where he or she has designed an AI to solve a specific problem or where he or she has been required to skillfully select training or input data. But a programmer is probably not an inventor where he or she has merely contributed to an AI’s general problem-solving capabilities without being aware of the specific problem the AI is being applied to or its ultimate output. The connection is even more tenuous where many programmers spread over time and space are involved in developing an AI.
Finally, the person who recognizes the relevance of an AI’s output may also qualify as an inventor, particularly if the AI suggests many possible options and a person has to use inventive skill to select an optimal solution. However, that does not seem appropriate where the importance of an AI’s output is obvious and no further human activity is necessary.

The creativity machine, DABUS (outlined above) was responsible for generating two inventions, which are the subject of patent applications: a plastic food container based on fractal geometry; and a flashing light (or “neural flame”) to alert emergencies. (Photo: Courtesy of Dr. Stephen Thaler)

The need for appropriate policies to address IP challenges
It is important that appropriate policies are put in place to deal with AI-generated works. Today, inventive AI may be a relatively insignificant part of innovation in economic terms. But AI is improving exponentially, and human researchers are not. Even in the short-to-medium term, this means that inventive AI may become a significant part of research and development. When it does, it will be seriously problematic if we lack clear rules on whether AI-generated inventions can be protected, who, or what, should be listed as an inventor, and who owns these inventions and related patents.

Listing an AI as an inventor is not a matter of providing rights to machines, but it would protect the moral rights of traditional human inventors and the integrity of the patent system.

Inventive AI presents novel challenges to other areas of IP law, such as the standard of the “person skilled in the art” used to evaluate inventive step, a key measure of the patentability of an invention. More on this in Everything Is Obvious (Ryan Abbott, 66 UCLA L. REV. 2, 23-28 (2019)). That test essentially asks whether an average researcher would find a patent application obvious in light of existing relevant information, and if so, the application will be denied. As AI increasingly augments the capabilities of average workers, they will become more sophisticated and knowledgeable. This evolution of the skilled person, in turn, should raise the bar for patentability similar to how, in Europe, the concept has evolved to include skilled persons where team-based approaches to research are the norm.
At some point in the future, when AI transitions from automating human researchers to automating inventive activity on a broad scale, inventive AI might even represent the skilled person. AI capable of routinely automating research will likely find more that is obvious than today’s skilled person. It may be difficult, however, to reason cognitively about what an AI would find obvious. This may require changing the test for inventive step to focus on economic rather than cognitive factors such as long-felt but unsolved needs, concurrent invention, professional skepticism, and so forth. It may even require focusing on the ability of AI to reproduce the subject matter of a patent application. Moving further forward in time, with no obvious limit to the future intelligence of machines, someday everything may be obvious to a super-intelligent AI.
In IP as well as many other areas of the law, the phenomenon of AI stepping into the shoes of people promises to be profoundly disruptive. In my forthcoming book, The Reasonable Robot: Artificial Intelligence and the Law (mid-2020, Cambridge University Press), I consider more broadly how AI behaving in human-like ways will challenge existing legal standards designed to regulate the behavior of people. I argue that a principle of AI legal neutrality, by which the law does not discriminate between people and AI when they are performing the same activities, will tend to improve human well-being.
In addition to myself, the Artificial Inventor Project team includes Robert Jehan at Williams Powell, Malte Koellner at Dennemeyer, Reuven Mouallem at Flashpoint IP, Markus Rieck at Fuchs IP, and Peggy Wu at Top Team. The artificial inventor for these applications, DABUS, was developed by Dr. Stephen Thaler.

Call for comments: impact of AI on IP policy
WIPO:
WIPO is seeking to develop, through an open process, a list of issues concerning the impact of artificial intelligence (Al) on intellectual property (IP) policy that might form the basis of future structured discussions.
Member states and all other interested parties are invited to provide comments and suggestions on a Draft Issues Paper. Comments are welcome on any aspect of the IP system affected by AI.
United States Patent and Trademark Office
In late 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) also announced a request for public comments with respect to both patent and copyright protection for AI-generated works to inform policymaking in these areas.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), automation and machine learning within business practices and how these technologies will affect and influence our workforce has become a common theme of discussion.But the time for talk has passed; now we must act.As business leaders, we understand that implementing these technologies is crucial to remaining competitive. There is no “if” – only “when” and “how much”. Today, we all agree that AI, automation, and machine learning bring tremendous value, in terms of efficiency, speed and flexibility, and we must ensure that our companies implement these technologies to remain ahead of the curve and the competition. Have you read?What skills does the future workforce need?The future of your workforce, so how do you attract millennials? As we integrate these tools into our businesses, it is our duty – and, I might argue, our moral obligation – to also provide our employees with the new skills they need to adapt. This month, as we approach the 50th Annual Meeting in Davos and a new decade, we find ourselves – business leaders from different industries and countries alike – charged with a significant challenge: in the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, how do we build a sustainable workplace that marries this adoption of technology with the changing roles of our employees? I propose we start here – the four areas in which business leaders must focus their attention in order to build a more sustainable workforce: 1. Become advocates for a modernized education system.  I’ve previously said – and I strongly believe – that our education system itself needs to evolve to embrace not only traditional four-year universities but also vocational schools and apprenticeships. By properly investing in educational frameworks that allow for new avenues of learning and skills-gathering, we can make flexible education systems an intrinsic part of the cultural norm and arm employees with the complementary skillsets they’ll inevitably need for sustainable careers. Today, many colleges are focused on honing one’s hard tech skills, but in this digitally native culture, success is built on possessing myriad talents. It’s therefore critical we advocate for curriculums that include both hard and soft skills, such as emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy. We must work to dispel long-held cultural beliefs that education ends at a person’s commencement ceremony. Consider LinkedIn’s 2019 Workforce Learning Report, in which 94% of employees said they’d stay at a company longer if that company invested in helping them learn. If today’s workforce values continuous, multi-faceted learning, our education system must too.What skills will be in demand and which will be in decline by 2022?2. Implement fluid and seamless learning opportunities. The modern workplace will continuously require us to learn new solutions for a variety of fresh challenges and successful businesses will be those that both recognize and cater to employee hunger for lifelong learning. But we need to go beyond simply making education and training available. Gone are the days of large group day-long sessions and lengthy instructional videos; instead, employers must meet employees on the platforms that best align with their habits – encouraging them to pursue skills development programmes that are right for them, at their own pace, and through mediums that are best suited to their learning style. Whether it is webinars, online games, or in-person mentor programmes, we must find ways to seamlessly integrate organic reskilling moments at work, so it does not feel like a “chore,” but rather becomes a fluid and natural aspect of the holistic work experience.The number of days of extra learning required3. Instil a top-down approach to learning. Executives need to “walk the walk” when it comes to reskilling employees whose roles are destined to change – laying the groundwork for a culture of curiosity and continuous learning. The best way to accomplish this is to instill change from the top down. In order to build a sustainable workforce, leaders themselves should show they are not immune to change and should participate in training alongside their direct reports. In fact, data suggests that the number one way learners discover the skills they need to improve in their roles is when their manager provides specific direction or hands-on guidance. At the same time, CEOs can’t be afraid to ask questions or learn from those around them. It is in being vulnerable and curious that we can create a larger company culture wherein workers are encouraged to exhibit more trainable and curious mindsets. Participating in regular skill development and retraining programmes allows all of us to feel more aptly prepared to embrace the workplace of tomorrow. 4. Take advantage of AI and machine learning to optimize reskilling. In the age of AI, success in business will increasingly be linked to the relationship between people and machines, and employee reskilling is no different. Our research suggests that workers are highly receptive to AI-related training, with 80% willing to learn new skills to take advantage of AI in their current jobs. So as AI and machine learning technologies change the types of jobs employees will have, these same technologies can be used to power the training systems and tools that can efficiently reskill employees. Reskilling tools powered by these technologies are scalable, available 24/7 and extremely cost-effective. Rate of automation in the workforceThis is not simply about prioritizing digital technologies to gain a competitive edge – there will always be tasks that simply cannot be accomplished without a human touch. It relates instead to our inherent duty as industry leaders and global stakeholders to better invest in education systems wherein our employees can augment skills for sustainable careers and business leaders can develop a more enriched internal talent pool.Don't miss any update on Future of WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Jobs and the Future of WorkEducation and SkillsFourth Industrial RevolutionForum InstitutionalShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Article • The future has begun
Cancer care 2035: multi-disciplinarity is key
An enthralling insight into the care that could be offered to cancer patients of the future was presented by cancer imaging expert Professor Regina Beets-Tan during her a keynote presentation at the recent British Institute of Radiology congress.
Report: Mark Nicholls





In the session ‘Oncologic imaging: Future perspectives’, the professor outlined what a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) of the future – a team in 2035 – would look like in an era where cancer care will centre on patients, precision medicine, screening and detection of early tumours, minimally-invasive treatment, targeted therapies and imaging, and prolonged survival for patients with metastatic disease. Treatment, she suggests, will feature image-guided precision radiotherapy, surgery, and effective targeted therapies and immunotherapy.



Regina Beets-Tan is Professor of Radiology at the University of Maastricht and the University of Southern Denmark, and also chairs the department of radiology at The Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam
Beets-Tan predicts that the MDT meeting of 2035 would consist of the treating physicians and interventional radiologist along with other diagnostic specialists, to include a geneticist, pathologist, and computer scientist. Such a team will deliver an integrated approach to diagnosis and an integrated solution to a clinical question. ‘The radiologist will be a full arm of his clinical partners and will be working side by side to give best care to the patient, who will be engaged in the treatment decision-making after the risks and benefits had been explained,’ she envisions. ‘Minimally-invasive treatment and organ-preserving treatment, which will improve quality of life, will become part of the spectrum of treatment options because we will see more complete responses to the highly-effective local and targeted therapies.’The radiologist will work together with computer scientists and software engineers to validate Artificial Intelligence (AI) work on high volume, non-complex diagnosis, leaving the radiologist with more time to focus on complex cases and interact closely with clinicians. The interventional radiologist and surgeon will work closely together in image-guided intervention and surgery to provide good local control with less collateral damage. ‘This paradigm shift in personalised medicine will be a move from tissue to molecular risk profiles; from imaging the tumour to imaging the tumour micro-environment,’ she added. ‘Mutation in genes are the drivers of cancer growth and that is what you want to target. Mutational burden and molecular profiles of tumours become the key factor in cancer treatment.’Beets-Tan also discussed the potential of AI to prevent over-treatment with immunotherapy. Costs of immunotherapy and risk of toxicity with combination therapy are high, so AI-powered accurate prediction models of outcome will play an important role.



Fast AI predictionBorders between disciplines will fade; it will be about patients and patient-shared decision-making and the best outcomeRegina Beets-Tan‘Our work in radiomics has shown that AI can predict response to anti-PD-1 at first follow-up. First studies have shown that tracer imaging has the potential to non-invasively map the entire tumour heterogeneity and its response to treatment, which cannot be captured by a single biopsy of only one lesion. We need to keep searching for non-invasive advanced tools that can drive precision,’ Beets-Tan concluded. ‘Borders between disciplines will fade; it will be about patients and patient-shared decision-making and the best outcome. We will have a role as a radiologist that is different from now; we are going to combine our skills in technology with our knowledge of treatment. It is an exciting future for those working in oncology because the new beginning has just begun.’The treatment possibilities she outlined are the future, she stressed but, in 2035, ‘the present’ is a mere 15 years away.Profile:Regina Beets-Tan is Professor of Radiology at the University of Maastricht and the University of Southern Denmark, and also chairs the department of radiology at The Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. Her clinical expertise is in oncologic and abdominal imaging with a research interest in MR imaging of cancer and specifically colorectal cancer, image-guided interventional oncology and AI. She is 2nd Vice President of the European Society of Radiology, Past President of the European Society of Oncologic Imaging and President of the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology. Beets-Tan is also a member of the EU mission board for cancer.

So what exactly is a 'good job,' anyway?




Another take on gigs: Just making ends meet




Scorecard: Nine traits of a good job 








December 19, 2019 04:05 PM











A generation ago, when hulking robots were wheeled en masse onto factory floors and positioned along the assembly line, it was the opening salvo in a long, slow invasion: Automation was coming for our jobs.
The latest front in the workplace revolution isn't the shop floor, however. It's the office—thanks to productivity-boosting software poised to leap forward in coming years with the advance of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
This time it won't be blue-collar workers forced to adapt. College graduates have exponentially greater exposure to the AI revolution than their less-educated counterparts, according to a growing body of research that includes studies by the Brookings Institution, McKinsey and the Pew Research Center.
The list of the most AI-exposed occupations includes the highly paid, from marketers and research analysts to bankers, sales managers and software engineers—even doctors and lawyers.



Yet, unlike the factory-floor takeover in the 1980s, knowledge workers are less likely to see the digital coup coming.
""At first, the (technology) is complementary, because it makes the people in these white-collar jobs more and more productive,"" says Hyejin Youn, an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""But there is a peak to that productivity, and after that you reach the danger of substitution by automation, where it costs you your job.""











The threat is inspiring global debate about the value created from automation—and what to do about a workforce that could be massively displaced. It has emerged in the Democratic presidential campaign, as a central element in technologist Andrew Yang’s long-shot bid. He and others believe a universal basic income will be necessary to offset job losses.
Others think the economy will adapt and new jobs will be created around the capabilities introduced by artificial intelligence. Regardless, a painful period of adjustment seems likely.



 








That prospect can seem far off given the current state of AI, which thrives on crunching large datasets with defined boundaries, and on executing repeatable processes. Right now, that makes it perfect for handling rote busywork.
""It's the stuff where you hear people say, 'I didn't go to college for four years so I could do this,' and that represents a really embarrassingly large percentage of office work today,"" says Sean Chou, CEO of West Loop AI startup Catalytic.
But that's just the first fruits.
AI also can use that analytical acumen for advanced pattern matching, poring through reams of data to draw obscure correlations and make canny predictions. If that reminds you of a financial analyst predicting a company's market performance, or of a legal team searching for a precedent, or of a doctor matching a list of symptoms against a catalog of known ailments—well, you get the idea.
""When parents were encouraging their children to go into the field of medicine or law, they weren't thinking that robots were going to replace some portion of that work one day,"" says Chou. ""But I think that's really going to happen, because when you look at these fact-based professions that draw on patterns, you get into this category where AI is just going to have a tremendous advantage.""
THE PATENTS ARE COMING
To isolate AI from traditional automation, a new Brookings Institution report relied—not without irony—on an algorithm that searched for AI-related patents that could be tied to specific industries.
According to Brookings, one of the sectors with the strongest correlation is professional services. That doesn't necessarily mean that accounting and consulting jobs are doomed, but experts generally agree that even the most optimistic take on AI—the version in which machine learning generates productivity gains that lead to more relaxed work schedules and also creates new, unforeseen job categories that make up for those it devours—will cause substantial temporary upheaval.
The shakeup, according to Brookings' data, will disproportionately affect some demographics that have previously been fairly immune to such trends: men, workers in the prime of their careers, whites and Asians.
Why? Each is overrepresented in the sort of analytical, technical roles that AI seems particularly apt to influence.
""These are things that have been hitherto ground out by well-paid, midlevel executives and their teams but that may now be more easily and accurately produced by AI tools,"" says Mark Muro, the Brookings study's lead author.
In contrast, women are statistically overrepresented in fields such as education and health care, where they are more likely to perform the sort of interpersonal tasks that computers struggle to pull off.
Some sectors of the economy that were heavily affected by the first wave of automation, such as retail and food service, may get a pass during the AI revolution.
Manufacturing, however, is again likely to be heavily affected, which is the chief reason a group of heartland states touching Illinois—Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Kentucky—are among six that Brookings says have the most overall exposure.
Indiana has the highest exposure in the country, according to the report, while Illinois ranks 11th. Chicago ranks 29th among metro areas, while two Michigan cities, Grand Rapids and Detroit, rank third and sixth nationally.
The AI revolution may play out in slow motion. Chou, for example, says, ""Every day, there's something new in AI that's amazing and also something that's so comically bad that you realize we're still really far off.""
For every startling advance, there's a Reddit meme showing self-propelled, robotic vacuums getting hopelessly entangled in toilet paper. There also are examples in history where things didn't work out according to the worst-case scenario: Past economic upheavals, such as the industrial revolution, typically have resulted in new jobs offsetting those lost.
But that doesn't mean it's too early for a reckoning based on AI's potential.
In Britain, politicians have floated the notion of a four-day workweek in response to the efficiency gains brought on by AI and similar technologies, and Yang isn't the only one in the U.S. beating the drum for universal basic income. But thus far, the question of what to do if AI blows up the economy has been largely unexplored.
""There will be individuals who find even more meaningful work than what they had previously and others who don't find work at all,"" says Mike Evans, co-founder of Grubhub and now CEO of Fixer, a tech-enabled home repair service that Evans says he created in part to address the coming labor market upheaval. ""The more meaningful options we're able to create, the less disruptive this will be. This is one of the major challenges our society is going to face in the next one or two generations—it's a massive problem coming at us very quickly.""
Those wishing for a coordinated response can hope that AI's impact on high-status workers gets the attention of boards and investors in a way that past working-world upheavals have not.
""Perhaps there's a greater common cause or common involvement (between executives and affected workers) that may help us think about this more clearly as a society,"" says Brookings' Muro.
Much more certain is that an automated future is coming, whether we're ready or not.
""We can have this philosophical, sociological discussion about whether this is good or bad, or whether we even need to have jobs to be human beings, or whether we can just leave it to the machines and feel good about it,"" says Youn, the Kellogg professor. ""But it's also important to take a step back and see that this really is happening—the things we thought could not be accomplished by machines will be. It's just a matter of time.""
Workers are beginning to take that idea to heart.
""What's most frightening to me is that we're ignoring it,"" says Joy McKinney, a personal financial adviser from Pleasant Prairie, Wis., who attended a December Yang rally in Chicago. ""It hasn't disrupted my business yet, but I'm not naive enough to think it doesn't have that potential. It's like a tsunami that's on course to hit us, and if we're not prepared, there will be casualties.""

So what exactly is a 'good job,' anyway?



Creating and sustaining good jobs is crucial for the Chicago region’s success, as the divide widens between the earnings of those with college degrees and those without. The city has fewer working-class jobs, and a boom in health care and social services has not offset our loss of manufacturing work.  














Another take on gigs: Just making ends meet



People use Uber and other apps increasingly just to supplement full-time jobs, as researchers walk back post-recession findings.

In this Future of Design iteration, Maria Mingallon explains how we can utilise the data we have about our building decisions to make predictions using machine learning.








The third in our Future of Design series – which looks at how new and changing technologies are affecting the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries – sees Maria Mingallon explore what artificial intelligence and machine learning are and what some of the potential benefits may be for the future.


Like electricity or the internet, artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a general purpose technology with the potential to transform productivity, accelerate economic growth and improve wellbeing across the whole of society. It has started, and will continue to, drastically transform the way we work and live. At least, this is what the report ‘Towards Our Intelligent Future’ published by New Zealand AI Forum earlier this year affirms. The report represents over nine months of collaborative work on parallel streams exploring AI adoption, policy and strategy in New Zealand and around the world. It highlights the value of AI for achieving New Zealand’s wellbeing, sustainability and economic goals.
If AI is so great and can do so much for humanity, why does it also provoke such strong reactions against it? Science-fiction thrillers have probably not contributed to promoting the good intentions behind AI. Thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator as a cyborg assassin fighting against AI dominance is an almost inevitable reaction for most of us. After all, who is interested in making a movie about the number of times we benefit from the use of AI-based algorithms when discovering a new song we like? 
Ok, let’s give Hollywood a chance. Do you remember the movie Moneyball? It starred Brad Pitt in the role of Billy Bean who follows the advice of Peter Brand, a young Yale-educated research geek, with a degree in economics who is capable of crunching numbers to come up with suggestions about finding true baseball stars, based purely on data analytics and statistics.
While that is not (yet) AI, the movie does a great job of illustrating the benefits of data analytics, which are the foundation of any AI application. It also demonstrates how toxic our own bias can be, particularly inside boardrooms. Intrigued? This Forbes article expands on why business leaders need to take a proactive approach towards data analytics.
Despite its potential and wide usage, AI suffers from being a ‘suitcase term’ used to refer to everything from complex statistical algorithms to autonomous robots. The difficulty in describing AI succinctly might be one of the reasons why people react poorly to it. They simply don’t understand it. Almost all definitions I have come across include unnecessary verbiage which only contributes to mystifying a technology which, if conveniently democratised, has the potential to help resolve the many crises our planet suffers from.
We often fear what we do not understand; our best defense is knowledge. – Tuvok (Star Trek: Voyager)
We humans fear and criticise what we can’t understand. Nobel Laureate, Bob Dylan, referred to it in his lyrics of ‘The Times are A-Changin’. As Tuvok from Star Trek puts it, knowledge is a great strategy to overcome the fear that comes with novelty. On top of this, education is frequently identified as a barrier to the expansion of almost any new technology. In 2018, AI Forum of New Zealand reported that 44 per cent of survey respondents identified (lack of) education as a key barrier to AI adoption. Kaggle’s 2017 data in Figure 1 below also reports that “lack of data science talent” is the second largest barrier faced at work by data scientists.

Besides AI practitioners, leaders who understand the business context and potential of AI will have a clear competitive advantage. As a McKinsey puts it in their AI guide for executives: “It’s no longer the preserve of artificial-intelligence researchers and born-digital companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix.” AI is a technology which can and will help anyone who understands how to best make use of it.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Without using unnecessary technical language, AI is a technology which aims to replicate how a human brain thinks. In essence, it seeks to replicate how we perceive the world, extract data, analyze it and make decisions based on such data. It is all about how our brains create patterns that merge and join data to construct a version of the world within which we make decisions to take one direction or another.
So, data and data analytics are at the core of any AI application. That is actually the key difference between AI and traditional computing consisting of explicit programming instructions, such as ‘do’ something, ‘if’ a condition is ‘True’. Artificial Intelligence algorithms are fuelled on data. Between raw data and making intelligent informed decisions, there is first training and then learning. That is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI which uses statistical analysis and algorithms to extract insights from large volumes of data. ML is essentially acquiring knowledge based on what has happened in the past.

Think for a moment about how you first learned about the world. When you were a kid, your parents repeated the words ‘daddy’ and ‘mummy’ to you. They did it again and again and again, with slightly different variations such as wearing different clothes, being at the dinner table or while playing with you. They passed on their ‘image’ and the word associated with such image to you until you started pronouncing something that was a ‘good guess’ of what they were actually saying to you. They then smiled and reinforced your behaviour. They were ‘training’ you.
Training of a machine learning model happens in a similar way. Let’s call our ML experiment the ‘family member detection algorithm’. Each data point represents an instance when a family member met you and introduced themselves as ‘mummy’, ‘daddy’, ‘grandad’ and so on. Each time they might have worn different clothes, been in a different location, et cetera. By exposure to these different settings (features) you started recognising what remained constant: the facial traits of the family member in question and their associated position in the family. At some point in your infancy, you were able to recognise your mum and dad and, most importantly, distinguish them from a stranger.

Making predictions
Let me give you another example. Imagine that you would like to buy a home (hopefully not in Auckland where it is pretty difficult to afford anything reasonable). You know that the price of a property is normally directly proportional to the floor area. If you plot those two features you would most likely be able to visualise a ‘trend’, such as the one in Figure 4 below. You could in essence draw a straight line – a linear regression prediction – which, for a given floor area, would give you an idea of the price to expect. You could also choose to plot the points with a different colour based on the number of rooms.

Of course, it is not so simple. There are many other factors that come into play such as number of bathrooms, parking spaces, garden area, neighbourhood, walkability index and perhaps even whether it has a fireplace. These are all ‘features’ of a data set in machine learning terms. Now, instead of plotting just two features as we did above, imagine you plot them all, using a correlation matrix. Have a look at Figures 5 and 6 to visualise the inner relationships between the typical features affecting the price of a house. The ones which are closer to 1.0 indicate a larger impact on the sale price.

Once you have a decent understanding of your dataset, you can start training your model. How do you do that? You basically slice the dataset into two: the test and the training set. There are a number of papers on the subject of how many data entries should go to each set, but a good rule of thumb is 70 per cent for testing, the rest for training. As you may have guessed, the larger and the more accurate your dataset is, the easier it is to train your ML model and the higher the certainty of the predictions it would be able to make. The process of training the model is, in essence, passing on the data entries from the test set and comparing it to the training set, so that when a new entry comes in, it can make an informed guess: a prediction. That is what machine learning is in simple terms.
Hopefully you are still reading because the best part is yet to come. If you’re not a data scientist or a computer programmer, rest assured that almighty Bill Gates still has you in his thoughts! Microsoft Azure has recently launched a tool capable of undertaking machine learning on the cloud without any coding required. They recommend (or even choose for you) the ML algorithm best suited for your needs alongside the cloud computing processing power you would require to execute it.
All you need is to provide your datasets and of course, a clear formulation of what you are trying to predict from your data. A great tutorial from ‘Towards Data Science’ – a blog I recommend you start following – in case you are interested in giving it a go is available here.

Thus, we always come back to the data. Think about the data you have produced today. If you are a designer working in the AEC industry, it is quite likely that you have made decisions as to where to position a grid line, a window, a door, a pipe and what size they needed to be, et cetera. How are those decisions documented? You probably have it in front of you.
Your building information models (BIMs) are much more than mere representations of objects in the three dimensional space. They hold all of your design decisions. For example, the ratio between the location of a window and the overall dimensions of a room might come from past experience or perhaps the results of a sophisticated daylight simulation. Either way, the ratio between those elements is data your BIM hosts.
If you use BIM to document your projects, you are effectively in possession of a data mine, which is still hidden for most. What’s even better, think of all of those other projects you have done this year using BIM. If you were to put them all together, side by side, you would certainly be able to identify patterns, in particular if they are from the same sector (e.g. schools, hospitals). If you used BIM for all of them, chances are you can aggregate them to build your own dataset for training a machine learning algorithm which, next time, can help you predict where a window or a pipe should go and how big they need to be to be code compliant without necessarily running a single simulation.
Okay, that might sound like too big of a dream for now, but one thing is certain and that is the importance of curating your data. Refer to Figure 1 if you need proof. The results of the survey undertaken last year by AI Forum of New Zealand identified ‘dirty data’ as the highest barrier to AI adoption[1]. So showing a little love for those models which host your data assets will certainly pay off in the future. How well you curate your data today matters more than ever before.
Hungry for more? I shall come back to you in the new year with examples of AI in the AEC industry. Until then, I leave you one last resource which will help you in your personal quest to conquer the heart of machine learning: a starting point from the aforementioned Towards Data Science. As the proverb goes in Spanish, “nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena”. Funnily enough, Google Translate AI algorithms have not (yet) been able to grasp a decent translation of such proverb.
Catch up on the others in the Future of Design series here.
