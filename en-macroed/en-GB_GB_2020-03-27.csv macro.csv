However, most leaders are quite excited to implement AI into the company’s business functions to start realizing its extraordinary benefits. While we have no way of knowing all the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning will ultimately impact business functions, here are 10 business functions that are ready to use artificial intelligence. 
10 Business Functions That Are Ready To Use Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

Marketing

If your company isn’t using artificial intelligence in marketing, it's already behind. Not only can AI help to develop marketing strategies, but it's also instrumental in executing them. Already AI sorts customers according to interest or demographic, can target ads to them based on browsing history, powers recommendation engines, and is a critical tool to give customers what they want exactly when they want it. Another way AI is used in marketing is through chatbots. These bots can help solve problems, suggest products or services, and support sales. Artificial intelligence also supports marketers by analyzing data on consumer behavior faster and more accurately than humans. These insights can help businesses make adjustments to marketing campaigns to make them more effective or plan better for the future.

Sales

There is definitely a side of selling products and services that is uniquely human, but artificial intelligence can arm sales professionals with insights that can improve the sales function. AI helps improve sales forecasting, predict customer needs, and improve communication. And intelligent machines can help sales professionals manage their time and identify who they need to follow-up with and when as well as what customers might be ready to convert.
PROMOTED
Research and Development (R&D)
What about artificial intelligence as a tool of innovation? It can help us build a deeper understanding in nearly any industry, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals, financial, automotive, and more, while collecting and analyzing tremendous amounts of information efficiently and accurately. This and machine learning can help us research problems and develop solutions that we’ve never thought of before. AI can automate many tasks, but it will also open the door to novel discoveries, ways of improving products and services as well as accomplishing tasks. Artificial intelligence helps R&D activities be more strategic and effective.
IT Operations
Also called AIOps, AI for IT operations is often the first experience many organizations have with implementing artificial intelligence internally. Gartner defines the term AIOps as the “application of machine learning and data science to IT operations problems.” AI is commonly used for IT system log file error analysis, with IT systems management functions as well as to automate many routine processes. It can help identify issues so the IT team can proactively fix them before any IT systems go down. As the IT systems to support our businesses become more complex, AIOps helps the IT improve system performance and services.

Human Resources
In a business function with “human” in the name, is there a place for machines? Yes! Artificial intelligence really has the potential to transform many human resources activities from recruitment to talent management. AI can certainly help improve efficiency and save money by automating repetitive tasks, but it can do much more. PepsiCo used a robot, Robot Vera, to phone and interview candidates for open sales positions. Talent is going to expect a personalized experience from their employer just as they have been accustomed to when shopping and for their entertainment. Machine learning and AI solutions can help provide that. In addition, AI can help human resources departments with data-based decision-making and make candidate screening and the recruitment process easier. Chatbots can also be used to answer many common questions about company policies and benefits.

Contact Centers
The contact center of an organization is another business area where artificial intelligence is already in use. Organizations that use AI technology to enhance rather than replace humans with these tasks are the ones that are incorporating artificial intelligence in the right way. These centers collect a tremendous amount of data that can be used to learn more about customers, predict customer intent, and improve the ""next best action"" for the customer for better customer engagement. The unstructured data collected from contact centers can also be analyzed by machine learning to uncover customer trends and then improve products and services.

Building Maintenance
Another way AI is already at work in businesses today is helping facilities managers optimize energy use and the comfort of occupants. Building automation, the use of artificial intelligence to help manage buildings and control lighting and heating/cooling systems, uses internet-of-things devices and sensors as well as computer vision to monitor buildings. Based upon the data that is collected, the AI system can adjust the building's systems to accommodate for the number of occupants, time of day, and more. AI helps facilities managers improve energy efficiency of the building. An additional component of many of these systems is building security as well.
Manufacturing
Heineken, along with many other companies, uses data analytics at every stage of the manufacturing process from the supply chain to tracking inventory on store shelves. Predictive intelligence can not only anticipate demand and ramp production up or down, but sensors on equipment can predict maintenance needs. AI helps flag areas of concern in the manufacturing process before costly issues erupt. Machine vision can also support the quality control process at manufacturing facilities.
Accounting and Finance
Many organizations are finding the promise of cost reductions and more efficient operations the major appeal for artificial intelligence in the workplace, and according to Accenture Consulting, robotic process automation can produce amazing results in these areas for the accounting and finance industry and departments. Human finance professionals will be freed-up from repetitive tasks to be able to focus on higher-level activities while the use of AI in accounting will reduce errors. AI is also able to provide real-time status of financial matters to organizations because it can monitor communication through natural language processing.
Customer Experience
Another way artificial intelligence technology and big data are used in business today is to improve the customer experience. Luxury fashion brand Burberry uses big data and AI to enhance sales and customer relationships. The company gathers shopper's data through loyalty and reward programs that they then use to offer tailored recommendations whether customers are shopping online or in brick-and-mortar stores. Innovative uses of chatbots during industry events are another way to provide a stellar customer experience.

The superiority of AI: the scam of the century
Artificial intelligence is just an empty shell, right? Denis Fages, President of VideoTelling, warns us to not give this technology virtues that it doesn’t have - and never will.

I hear so many silly things in reference to artificial intelligence. I work in digital learning and a day doesn’t go by without reading nonsense about the brain and memory. They tell us - in the media and then repeated on social media - that computers are going to “think,” “imagine,” and “create.” They tell us that they are going to make humanity obsolete and that we are going to join the other extinct species like the Neanderthals. What if, instead of foretelling tomorrow’s apocalypse, we tried to learn a little

Big DataBot is watching you

1984 is knocking at our door. This will soon be our future... if we let GAFA condition our existence by “predicting our desires in order to make our lives easier.” With all good intentions, it’s bullshit. It’s just a marketing scheme to sell leads to brands by analysing your data. They put us in boxes in order to manage compartmental marketing scenarios.
Those who “don’t know” are enchanted by the strength of computers. In 1968, a super calculator beat the majority of humans in calculations. Fifty years later, in 2018, while autonomous cars drive on the land and the drones fly in our skies, full of cameras and AI, we are still in the same position. Computers may calculate much faster than humans, but they aren’t at all intelligent.

What is intelligence?

Pick up a dictionary and you will see that there are close to a dozen definitions about intelligence. Here are a couple: “ability to comprehend, to not misinterpret the meaning of words, the nature of things and the significance of events”; “voluntary and reflective activity of men practised in a normal manner, as seen from a point of knowledge and against instinct”; “skill and ability, which is, above all, applied to the choice of reason used to obtain a result”; “correspondence, communication between people who understand each other; complicity.” In the definitions, the dictionary suggests creative intelligence, intelligence from the heart, emotional intelligence, practical intelligence...
So, when we talk about artificial intelligence, what do we mean? The Larousse encyclopaedia says that we design AI by “theories and techniques implemented in order to create machines capable of simulating intelligence.” As Deeper Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, in May 1997, we forgot one thing. Gary was the only one actually playing. Deeper Blue was calculating. The computer predetermined what he would do. And that’s it. We can simulate learning and intelligence, in the way that we programmed the machine to store data and make decisions with it, but it is only a simulation.

What we do... but in a one thousandth of a second

With a closer look, artificial intelligence is actually stupid. Someone who thinks that a computer can think faster or better is depreciating themselves as a being. I would also add that they don’t know much about themselves. A lot of people identify with their body - they mistake their soul as their brain and think of themselves as machines.
Let’s take the time to really analyse our potential. When we think about complex subjects, like creating a marketing strategy, this is what we do: we analyse dozens of pieces of data; we evaluate them, compare them, and choose them according to their importance; we use thousands of understandings accumulated over the course of our lives, as well as education; we take into account all of our feelings; we evaluate the consequences for each person involved in the short term or long term; we make a prediction of all the possible scenarios, according to their probability; we eliminate all the bad solutions and finally we choose what we think is the best for us, our family, our group, our company, and even our country, humanity, and the planet... We also do this in a microsecond, thousands of times per day, every single time that we make a decision.

        5 ways that robots will be part of British life
      



Do androids dream of electric sheep?

That’s the original title of Philip K. Dick’s novel, that became the movie Blade Runner. And it is a big question. A human being can sing in the rain. They can, despite good sense and logic, paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. They can formulate a philosophy in order to understand life. They are creative during the entire day and a good part of the night. Has someone asked Sophia - the robot citizen of Saudi Arabia - what she thought about Picasso’s paintings or Daft Punk’s sound? The best algorithms in the world could never think as fast and as well as a person of sound mind. And it wouldn’t be able to create anything.
Of course, we can simulate creation. We can programme it. We can rearrange creations and additions according to a random sequence that is skilfully programmed... by its programmer. This creation won’t have anything to do with the motives, intentions, motivations and emotions of a human being, artist or not.
Please understand that artificial intelligence is based on cognitive science. Yet they do have ambition (it doesn’t mean that they achieve it) to model perception, intelligence, reasoning, emotions, and even consciousness. I think about Buddhists who spend their entire lives meditating in order to achieve a higher level of consciousness. I ask myself what an algorithm that aspires to reach a superior state of being would look like.

“Science without conscience...”

I am directly approaching this notion of spiritual consciousness, because one risk with AI is the small minority of materialistic scientists who invoke their small ideas on the nature of man. We will end up believing that we are nothing more than a group of synaptic connections, surrounded by a skeleton and some muscles... Basically that we are nothing more than a machine... And therefore, a very strong machine could beat us!
“Science without conscience ruins the soul,” Rabelais warned us. Propaganda started and is going to intensify: “machines will think better than humans because they don’t have emotions. They make less mistakes. A machine will always make better choices. A machine is better at...” Stop! The real danger that we need to watch out for, and the real challenge of AI and robotics is to avoid scenarios like in The Matrix or Terminator. Of course, we can talk about ethics and the laws of robotics...
However, even deeper than that, there is a rebellion to manage. And it’s not about agreeing with the fact that a machine could become more powerful than man. It’s not about preventing the manufacturing of powerful machines, but about recognising the power that each human has. Because “machines are more powerful than humans” could never become true if a handful of people were able to convince everyone else that they aren’t machines, nor pieces of meat living the rat race.
AI is a trick. All good programmers know it. Intelligence is something associated with life. Something that animates life. Humans can try to make a rough copy, but machines will never take over its master.

The battle of a century

“Big Data Bot versus Buddha,” is the match between the coming of age of machines and a spiritual renaissance for humanity. In other words, one day we might have a philosophy that reconciles science and spirituality. Big Data Bot will win against humans if we let the ones who have already succumbed lie to us about our nature, potential, and past. Personally, I have no intention in letting my actions be dictated by a machine. It’s in labouring hard and strong today that humans are conscious and spiritual beings, and that a machine is nothing more than an inert machine that has no control over our fate.
The prettiest robot in the world that contains the most perfected AI is nothing more than a bit of metal without a soul. It was made to be a perfect tool that allows me to use the intelligence of my own body better. And only if it helps me develop my own skills. It’s incidentally a good thing to be currently developing the cobot (collaborative robot that aims at producing robots to assist humans).
For the love of God, let’s stop believing in all the rubbish about the strength of AI. You are intelligent and have a conscience. You are a creative spirit, deep down. And your potential as a spiritual animal is a thousand times bigger than those bloody machines.

There is increasing awareness that the greatest problems with artificial intelligence are not primarily technical, but rather how to achieve value from the technology. This was a growing problem even in the booming economy of the last several years, but a much more important issue in the current pandemic-driven recessionary economic climate.


Older AI technologies like natural language processing, and newer ones like deep learning, work well for the most part and are capable of providing considerable value to organizations that implement them. The challenges are with large-scale implementation and deployment of AI, which are necessary to achieve value. There is substantial evidence of this in surveys.

In an MIT Sloan Management Review/BCG survey, “seven out of 10 companies surveyed report minimal or no impact from AI so far. Among the 90% of companies that have made some investment in AI, fewer than 2 out of 5 report business gains from AI in the past three years. This number improves to 3 out of 5 when we include companies that have made significant investments in AI. Even so, this means 40% of organizations making significant investments in AI do not report business gains from AI.”

PROMOTED
NewVantage Partners 2019 Big Data and AI Executive survey—Firms report ongoing interest and an active embrace of AI technologies and solutions, with 91.5% of firms reporting ongoing investment in AI. But only 14.6% of firms report that they have deployed AI capabilities into widespread production. Perhaps as a result, the percentage of respondents agreeing that their pace of investment in AI and big data was accelerating fell from 92% in 2018 to 52% in 2019.

Deloitte 2018 “State of Enterprise AI” survey—The top 3 challenges with AI were implementation issues, integrating AI into the company’s roles and functions, and data issues—all factors involved in large-scale deployment.

In short, AI has not yet achieved much return on investment. It has yet to substantially improve the lives of workers, the productivity and performance of organizations, or the effective functions of societies. It is capable of doing all these things, but is being held back from its potential impact by a series of factors I will describe below.

What’s Holding AI Back
I’ll describe the factors that are preventing AI from having a substantial return in terms of the letters of our new organization: the ROAI Institute. Although it primarily stands for “return on artificial intelligence,” it also works to describe the missing or critical ingredients for a successful return:


Reengineering
Organization and Culture
Algorithms and Data
Investment


Reengineering—The business process reengineering movement of the 1980s and early 90s, in which I wrote the first article and book (admittedly by only a few weeks in both cases) described an opportunity for substantial change in broad business processes based on the capabilities of information technology. Then the technology catalyst was enterprise systems and the Internet; now it’s artificial intelligence and business analytics.
There is a great opportunity—thus far only rarely pursued—to redesign business processes and tasks around AI. Since AI thus far is a relatively narrow technology, task redesign is more feasible now, and essential if organizations are to derive value from AI. Process and task design has become a question of what machines will do vs. what tasks are best suited to humans.
We are not condemned to narrow task redesign forever, however. Combinations of multiple AI technologies can lead to change in entire “end to end” processes—new product and service development, customer service, order management, “procure to pay,” and the like.
Organizations need to embrace this new form of reengineering while avoiding the problems that derailed the movement in the past; I called it “The Fad that Forgot People.” Forgetting people, and their interactions with AI, would also lead to the derailing of AI technology as a vehicle for positive change.
Organization and Culture—AI is the child of big data and analytics, and is likely to be subject to the same organization and culture issues as the parent. Unfortunately, there are plenty of survey results suggesting that firms are struggling to achieve data-driven cultures.
The 2019 NewVantage Partners survey of large U.S. firms I cite above found that only 31.0% of companies say they are data-driven. This number has declined from 37.1% in 2017 and 32.4% in 2018. 28% said in 2019 that they have a “data culture.” 77% reported that business adoption of big data and AI initiatives remains a major challenge. Executives cited multiple factors (organizational alignment, agility, resistance), with 95% stemming from cultural challenges (people and process), and only 5% relating to technology.
A 2019 Deloitte survey of US executives on their perspectives on analytical insights found that most executives—63%—do not believe their companies are analytics-driven. 37% say their companies are either “analytical competitors” (10%) or “analytical companies” (27%). 67% of executives say they are not comfortable accessing or using data from their tools and resources; even 37% of companies with strong data-driven cultures express discomfort.
The absence of a data-driven culture affects AI as much as any technology. It means that the company and its leaders are unlikely to be motivated or knowledgeable about AI, and hence unlikely to build the necessary AI capabilities to succeed. Even if AI applications are successfully developed, they may not be broadly implemented or adopted by users. In addition to culture, AI systems may be a poor fit with an organization for reasons of organizational structure, strategy, or badly-executed change management. In short, the organizational and cultural dimension is critical for any firm seeking to achieve return on AI.
Algorithms and Data—Algorithms are, of course, the key technical feature of most AI systems—at least those based on machine learning. And it’s impossible to separate data from algorithms, since machine learning algorithms learn from data. In fact, the greatest impediment to effective algorithms is insufficient, poor quality, or unlabeled data. Other algorithm-related challenges for AI implementation include:


Transparency—many machine learning algorithms are not transparent or understandable to human observers. This is particularly true for deep learning algorithms, which may have thousands of abstract features or variables. Lack of transparency may mean lack of trust—by users, executive sponsors, regulators, consumers, and other stakeholders.
Bias—algorithms can be biased against particular groups or individuals. Algorithmic bias is most often derived from biased datasets or samples.
Algorithms may simply be poorly designed, i.e., they don’t fit the data well, they overfit the data, they violate assumptions of statistical distributions, and so forth.
Algorithms may be poorly managed, i.e., it may not clear by whom or for what purpose they were created, they may have drifted (lost fit to the data) over time without being updated, etc.


Investment—One key driver of lack of return from AI is the simple failure to invest enough. Survey data suggest most companies don’t invest much yet, and I mentioned one above suggesting that investment levels have peaked in many large firms. And the issue is not just the level of investment, but also how the investments are being managed. Few companies are demanding ROI analysis both before and after implementation; they apparently view AI as experimental, even though the most common version of it (supervised machine learning) has been available for over fifty years. The same companies may not plan for increased investment at the deployment stage—typically one or two orders of magnitude more than a pilot—only focusing on pre-deployment AI applications.
Of course, with any technology it can be difficult to attribute revenue or profit gains to the application. Smart companies seek intermediate measures of effectiveness, including user behavior changes, task performance, process changes, and so forth—that would precede improvements in financial outcomes. But it’s rare for these to be measured by companies either.
A Program of Research and Structured Action
Along with several other veterans of big data and AI, I am forming the Return on AI Institute, which will carry out programs of research and structured action, including surveys, case studies, workshops, methodologies, and guidelines for projects and programs. The ROAI Institute is a benefit corporation that will be supported by companies and organizations who desire to get more value out of their AI investments
Our focus will be less on AI technology—-though technological breakthroughs and trends will be considered for their potential to improve returns—and more on the factors defined in this article that improve deployment, organizational change, and financial and social returns. We will focus on the important social dimension of AI in our work as well—is it improving work or the quality of life, solving social or healthcare problems, or making government bodies more responsive? Those types of benefits will be described in our work in addition to the financial ones.
Our research and recommendations will address topics such as:


What is the most feasible way to evaluate AI investments?
How should companies address potential job losses from AI?
When companies have achieved substantial financial returns from AI, how have they gone about it?
How can companies create a pipeline for AI projects that increases the likelihood of production deployment?
What are some approaches to making deep learning algorithms more transparent?
What steps have organizations taken to make their cultures more receptive to AI?


Please contact me at tdavenport@babson.edu if you care about these issues with regard to your own organization and are interested in approaches to them. AI is a powerful and potentially beneficial technology, but its benefits won’t be realized without considerable attention to ROAI.

From its epicenter in China, the novel coronavirus has spread to infect 414,179 people and cause no less than 18,440 deaths in at least 160 countries across a three-month span from January 2020 till date. These figures are according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Situation report as of March 25th. Accompanying the tragic loss of life that the virus has caused is the impact to the global economy, which has reeled from the effects of the pandemic.Due to the lockdown measures imposed by several governments, economic activity has slowed around the world, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has stated that the global economy could be hit by its worst growth rate since 2009. The OECD have alerted that the growth rate could be as slow as 2.4%, potentially dragging many countries into recession. COVID-19 has, in a short period of time, emerged as one of the biggest challenges to face the 21st century world. Further complicating the response to this challenge are the grey areas surrounding the virus itself, in terms of its spread and how to treat it.Related: We're In This Together: Business Resources, Offers, And More For MENA Entrepreneurs To Get Through The Coronavirus Pandemic



As research details emerge, the data pool grows exponentially, beyond the capacity of human intelligence alone to handle. Artificial intelligence (AI) is adept at identifying patterns from big data, and this piece will elucidate how it has become one of humanity's ace cards in handling this crisis. Using China as a case-study, China's success with AI as a crisis management tool demonstrates its utility, and justifies the financial investment the technology has required to evolve over the last few years.Advancements in AI application such as natural language processing, speech recognition, data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and others such as chatbots and facial recognition have not only been utilized for diagnosis but also for contact tracing and vaccine development. AI has no doubt aided the control of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped to curb its worst effects.


Related: Here's What Your Business Should Focus On As It Navigates The Coronavirus PandemicSpurred by China's gains in this area, other nations can unite to share expertise in order to expand AI's current capability and ensure that AI can replicate its role in helping China deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic. AI has been deployed in several ways so far, and the following are just seven of the ways in which AI has been applied as a measure to solve the pandemic:1. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AI With an infectious disease like COVID-19, surveillance is crucial. Human activity -especially migration- has been responsible for the spread of the virus around the world. Canada based BlueDot has leveraged machine learning and natural language processing to track, recognize, and report the spread of the virus quicker than the World Health Organization and the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the near and distant future, technology like this may be used to predict zoonotic infection risk to humans considering variables such as climate change and human activity. The combined analysis of personal, clinical, travel and social data including family history and lifestyle habits obtained from sources like social media would enable more accurate and precise predictions of individual risk profiles and healthcare results. While concerns may exist about the potential infringement to civil liberties of individuals, policy regulations that other AI applications have faced will ensure that this technology is used responsibly.2. VIRTUAL HEALTHCARE ASSISTANTS (CHATBOTS) The number of COVID-19 cases has shown that healthcare systems and response measures can be overwhelmed. Canada-based Stallion.AI has leveraged its natural language processing capabilities to build a multi-lingual virtual healthcare agent that can answer questions related to COVID-19, provide reliable information and clear guidelines, recommend protection measures, check and monitor symptoms, and advise individuals whether they need hospital screening or self-isolation at their homes.


Related: The Coronavirus Pandemic Versus The Digital Economy: The Pitfalls And The Opportunities3. DIAGNOSTIC AI Immediate diagnosis means that response measures such as quarantine can be employed quickly to curb further spread of the infection. An impediment to rapid diagnosis is the relative shortage of clinical expertise required to interpret diagnostic results due to the volume of cases. AI has improved diagnostic time in the COVID-19 crisis through technology such as that developed by LinkingMed, a Beijing-based oncology data platform and medical data analysis company. Pneumonia, a common complication of COVID-19 infection, can now be diagnosed from analysis of a CT scan in less than sixty seconds with accuracy as high as 92% and a recall rate of 97% on test data sets. This was made possible by an open-source AI model that analyzed CT images and not only identified lesions but also quantified in terms of number, volume and proportion. This platform, novel in China, was powered by Paddle Paddle, Baidu's open-source deep learning platform.4. FACIAL RECOGNITION AND FEVER DETECTOR AI Thermal cameras have been used for some time now for detecting people with fever. The drawback to the technology is the need for a human operator. Now, however, cameras possessing AI-based multisensory technology have been deployed in airports, hospitals, nursing homes, etc. The technology automatically detects individuals with fever and tracks their movements, recognize their faces, and detect whether the person is wearing a face mask.5. INTELLIGENT DRONES & ROBOTS The public deployment of drones and robots has been accelerated due to the strict social distancing measures required to contain the virus' spread. To ensure compliance, some drones are used to track individuals not using facemasks in public, while others are used to broadcast information to larger audiences and also disinfect public spaces. MicroMultiCopter, a Shenzhen-based technology company, has helped to lessen the virus transmission risk involved with city-wide transport of medical samples and quarantine materials through the deployment of their drones. Patient care, without risk to healthcare workers, has also benefited as robots are used for food and medication delivery. The role of room cleaning and sterilization of isolation wards has also been filled by robots. Catering-industry centred Pudu Technology have extended their reach to the healthcare sector by deploying their robots in over 40 hospitals for these purposes. 


Related: How Managers Can Weather The Impact Of The Coronavirus Pandemic On Their Businesses6. CURATIVE RESEARCH AI Part of what has troubled the scientific community is the absence of a definitive cure for the virus. AI can potentially be a game changer as companies such as the British startup, Exscienta, has shown. Earlier this year, they became the first company to present an AI designed drug molecule that has gone to human trials. A year is all it took the algorithm to develop the molecular structure compared with the five-year average time that it takes traditional research methods.In the same vein, AI can lead the charge for the development of antibodies and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, either entirely designed from scratch or through drug repurposing. For instance, using its AlphaFold system, Google's AI company, DeepMind, is creating structure models of proteins that have been linked with the virus in a bid to aid the science world's comprehension of the virus. Although the results have not been experimentally verified, it represents a step in the right direction.7. INFORMATION VERIFICATION AI The uncertainty of the pandemic has unavoidably resulted in the propagation of myths on social media platforms. While no quantitative assessment has been done to evaluate how much misinformation is out there already, it is certainly a significant figure. Technology giants like Google and Facebook are battling to combat the waves of conspiracy theories, phishing, misinformation and malware. A search for coronavirus/COVID-19 yields an alert sign coupled with links to verified sources of information. YouTube, on the other hand, directly links users to the WHO and similar credible organizations for information. Videos that misinform are scoured for and taken down as soon as they are uploaded.


While the world continues to grapple with the effects of COVID-19, positives can be drawn from the expertise and bravery of healthcare workers, as well as the complementary efforts of AI technology to their endeavors in the above listed ways. As the AI world partners with other sectors for solutions, the light at the end of this tunnel shines brighter, creating the much-needed hope the world needs in these uncertain times.

      UNICEF Innovation Fund Graduate: Afinidata
  

      Using artificial intelligence to provide parents with personalized early childhood education activities
  

Andreana Castellanos, CEO, Afinidata





 









UNICEF/UNI281099/Herwig

















31 March 2020







The UNICEF Innovation Fund is proud to see portfolio member, Afinidata, graduate. They’ve come a long way – from numerous product iterations to deep diving into understanding their ecosystem better, strengthening their business model, and gearing up to take their solution to market. They’re now ready to collaborate at a larger scale – as they find new pathways to work with partners, investors, and the open source community. 

Existing early-childhood education options, such as daycare or private tutors, are often expensive and difficult to scale. There is a large gap for effective, easy-to-access educational tools that are inclusive with lower income families. Imagine if each parent had their own virtual tutor for free to help them provide adequate early-childhood education (ECE) to their children. 
Afinidata uses artificial intelligence to provide parents with a personal assistant that guides them with personalized and effortless early-childhood activities, delivered directly into messaging apps they already use to communicate with family and friends and without requiring any new downloads. 
The past twelve months was one the most impactful years in Afinidata history. After receiving investment from the UNICEF Innovation Fund, our company growth was incredible, changing the path for Afinidata and for the families that use our Virtual Tutor ‘Afini’.
To date we have:

Reached 45,000 families in 10 months.
Delivered over 600,000 educational sessions 
Developed a unique machine learning algorithm with 24% higher usage rate compared to similar applications. 
Formed strategic partnerships with academia Harvard, Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute.

Challenges
The biggest challenges our team faced were user growth sustainability, improved support service to retain users and acquire new ones. All this, while simultaneously testing new functionalities and business models. Also, we didn’t know how to track the Virtual Tutor’s impact. We knew we were reaching families, but how do we retain them? Were we really helping them? Were we giving the solution they were looking for?
These problems were real, and we faced them by tracking little flaws until they were solved. We also expanded our team to make sure specialized people were working on specific problems, bringing solutions and innovation to Afinidata.
Tracking Impact
From the beginning of our development process  we decided to focus on how to track impact by creating a three stage plan.
Phase one - Engagement: we knew we had to engage with parents, persuading them to try Afinidata. If that didn’t happen, we lost. We had to create a relevant solution adapted to their lifestyle that kept them connected with us.
For this, we designed multiple interviews and user tests to discover pains and gains, and worked with parents who already used the Virtual Tutor. Through intense user research, we improved on functionalities, created a solution that doesn’t tell parents what to do, but instead strengthened our relationship with them, making them feel heard so we could later use technology to guide them and give them the best recommendation.
After several iterations, our algorithm and user experience has increased up to 24% more usage rate against other solutions that suggest generic content or based only on child's age and not personalized.

Selva, 2, engages in supervised play-based learning at the Torore centre, a UNICEF-supported Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme.











Phase two - Child’s development through self-reporting milestones: we asked parents to report to us the milestones their child had already achieved using this to create better and personalized content suggestions and to track the Virtual Tutor’s impact on child’s development.
The feedback we have received from parents using Afinidata has been particularly encouraging:




“Afinidata gives me the best activities so I can spend time with my baby. I like it because they’re easy and creative.”
Luisa Hernandez, Parent



“Great activities. I can spend time with my baby while stimulating his brain.”
Karilyn Fuente, Parent and Afinidata user

Amelia keeps a busy schedule. A typical day at work for her could include onboarding a new employee in the morning, managing AWS servers in the afternoon and remotely screening a concerned co-worker for COVID-19 in the evening.
Amelia is not a startup founder in over her head. She’s a “digital worker” created by IPsoft, which develops AI-powered enterprise technology designed to automate repetitive tasks and enable companies to scale their customer service operations. IBM defines a digital worker as “software-based labor that can independently execute meaningful parts of complex, end-to-end processes using multiple skills.” When onboarding new employees, for example, Amelia navigates the process using eight different skills, which include the ability to update payroll information, distribute personalized FAQ documents and manage email addresses.
 
Meet Amelia. Photo via IPsoft.“We’re seeing increased integration between human and digital employees in the workplace to drive positive experiences and outcomes for all of an organization’s stakeholders — customers, partners, employees and shareholders alike,” IPsoft CEO and Founder Chetan Dube said in a recent company press release.
Dube has reason to be bullish on the future prospects of digital workers. A recent IDC study estimates that the contributions of digital workers to the global workforce will grow by 50 percent over the next two years. In addition to administrative work, the study also estimates an uptick in digital workers performing tasks that require reasoning, decision-making skills and the evaluation of information.
IPsoft is getting a jump on this expected surge in demand with DigitalWorkforce.ai, a marketplace for digital workers that launched in February. We spoke with Marie Angselius, global head of communications for IPsoft, about the marketplace and the capabilities of its digital workers, which, yes, all go by the name “Amelia.”
 
Will AI Replace Jobs? Yes, but It Will Also Create Them.Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work 
Marie AngseliusCan you talk about the origins of DigitalWorkforce.ai? When did IPsoft decide to build a marketplace for digital workers, and did the project change or evolve over time?
In 2018, IPsoft launched the embryo of a marketplace based on Amelia’s extensive experience. This was the first off-the-shelf marketplace for AI solutions specifically designed for the banking, telecom, hospitality, insurance and healthcare industries. Back then, our marketplace primarily had reusable components that served to help kick-start projects, which meant our customers still had to do additional work. Our marketplace has since evolved into a full-fledged store where users can browse, interview and onboard digital workers.
 
DigitalWorkforce.ai offers two kinds of digital workers: one that fills the role of an IT service-desk engineer and another that serves as an HR coordinator. What can these “employees” do?
The world of work is changing dramatically, and digital employees will play a key role in helping small businesses run smoothly by managing repetitive requests and processes in the background, like collecting expense reports, troubleshooting equipment and configuring devices. In the future, we’ll also see business owners employ digital employees in a variety of vertical roles, and in the next five years the volume and complexity of tasks that digital workers can handle will only become more impressive and more transformational.
 
These digital workers come with a set of skills out of the box, but they also have the ability to learn on the job. How exactly does that work in practice?
Amelia V4 introduces a new level of end-to-end learning. Previously, building new end-to-end skills had several manual steps including back-end integrations. IPsoft defines these end-to-end processes as those that start with an individual requesting assistance and continuing through conversation to a front- or back-office employee, who then accesses one or more applications to resolve the request. Amelia can observe that entire process and synchronize all the parts into a coherent flow to build an automation which can perform this task without any human involvement.
 
In addition to HR and IT digital workers, IPsoft just rolled out a “COVID-19 assistant.” How exactly does this application work?
IPsoft recently announced the launch of a free digital employee to help screen for indicators of the novel coronavirus. This interactive screening solution was released as a service to communities seeking clear, authoritative information on symptoms and risks. While engaged in conversation, Amelia will assess a user based on their current symptoms and potential risk factors, leveraging the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. 
As more American cities restrict movement, the new Amelia aims to provide the general public, as well as vulnerable populations, with accurate and on-demand information about COVID-19 with no risk of exposure. This version of Amelia also aims to relieve the hospitals, clinics, physicians’ offices and medical care centers from fielding non-urgent questions related to COVID-19.
 
Gartner estimates that 25 percent of digital workers will use virtual employee assistants by 2021. How will DigitalWorkforce.ai evolve to meet this increased need?
According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2018, 133 million new roles may emerge that will be adapted to the new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms. With DigitalWorkforce.ai, the market moves closer to IPsoft’s vision of a symbiotic digital-human workforce, giving companies the ability to fully harness the potential ROI in AI.

A new social music app is pushing the boundaries of music creation by making recording artists out of novices with little to no musical training or traditional talent.
Voisey allows users to choose from a library of beats from around the world, submitted to the Voisey website by producers, and sing their own lyrics and melodies over them. Their vocals are run through in-app vocal effects including auto-tune. The app is designed to make anyone sound like a star.
In 2019 alone, 350,000 original songs were created on Voisey, says co-founder Olly Barnes. Today, the app is live on Apple’s operating system in 22 countries. Producers, singer-songwriters and even average music fans can create professional-sounding, 60-second songs with collaborators from all over the world.
Production and distribution
While Spotify and other streaming platforms allow anyone to share their existing music with the world, Voisey takes it a step further by giving anyone with the app the ability to record and distribute a song on the platform in just minutes.
“I just write the song, I’m like, OK, I put that out … now I’m back to homework,” says Voisey user and Spanish artist, Ana Mancebo, who is currently working towards her bachelor’s degree in business in the United States. “You can pretty much make anyone sound like an artist.”

Making music is innately human and it’s certainly nice for anyone to be able to create it. But these companies aren’t totally altruistic; they are money-making ventures, just like Spotify. 
Voisey doesn’t disclose their user base, but as of January 2020, downloads of the app were growing 60 per cent week on week   — all organic growth, without ads, according to Barnes. The music industry has its eyes and ears on Voisey too   — the producing duo Stargate invested in the app in 2019.
Democratizing pop
Voisey is an app that allows anyone to be a star. The app takes cues from TikTok — users can easily swipe through videos, like, comment and share — but the focus is on writing and producing original music. According to Barnes, 91 per cent of the songs on Voisey are originals. 
Currently, the Voisey app is not monetized — creators are not paid for their content and the company isn’t paid for their service. But a vast catalogue of original music — and people looking for fame — can certainly be lucrative.
And Barnes has big plans for monetization. 
“If we’re where music talent will crystalize for the first time, should we not see if we can help people bypass the traditional machine?” says Barnes. 
He believes that much of the new music created on Voisey will be from first-timers who don’t yet have a music publisher and aren’t yet registered with performing rights organizations (the agencies that collect royalties on broadcast and performed music on behalf of the artists). The company is working on a program to non-exclusively administer music rights for some users on the platform. This means they could potentially take a fee.
Of course, it has been argued that streaming royalties aren’t enough. In the 2010s, streaming services were lauded for democratizing music and bringing back revenue to record labels. Now, as we enter a new decade, it’s becoming clear that this democratization has also created a revenue stream for music streaming services. 
In 2018, Spotify partnered with Distrokid, which charges $19.99 per year per artist to upload unlimited albums and songs to streaming services. And now, Spotify is rolling out paid promotion. There is money to be made from people who want to be artists.
Pay-to-play features
Rights administration is only a small part of Voisey’s monetization strategy. The company is not currently disclosing the model, but Barnes says that it’s inspired by “top-tier mobile games,” and while the core experience will be free, they will charge for an “enhanced” experience. 
Could this include charging creators for certain vocal effects? Or for more than a certain number of songs each month? Or for distribution on streaming platforms? 
Another new music creation technology, Boomy, is already doing some of the things that Voisey might aspire to. 
Boomy helps users make music with artificial intelligence. Users choose from various musical themes and genres, click a button, wait for the artificial intelligence to work its magic and decide if they like what they hear. If they don’t, they can just click “try again” and have something new created for them with the same theme or genre. 
They can also choose to edit, which allows them to make simple changes like drag and drop sections of the song or change the tempo. More than 400,000 tracks have been created using Boomy, according to the counter on its website. 
According to Boomy’s website, with a free account, a user has access to limited downloads, saves and features, and can create and release one single to streaming services. But to unlock more features and increase downloads and saves, a user can sign up for plans from US$2.99 to $9.99 per month.
And 70 per cent of Boomy users have never created a song before using the service, says Alex Mitchell, CEO of Boomy. But for a fee, Boomy will distribute the music they create and help them earn royalties from streams. 



Hundreds of thousands of songs have been recorded and uploaded to music production apps and websites; the ability to monetize this could disrupt the pop music industry.

“There’s an explosion in the streaming music environment, there’s a ton of royalties that are going to be flowing into the music business   …. We want to make sure that you can take advantage of that growth, even if you are somebody who traditionally has not had access to music education, music resources,” says Mitchell. 
Mitchell says that on average, royalties are around US$50 to $100 for the last couple of months.
Not too shabby for the creator, for as little as $2.99 per month and a few clicks-worth of their time. And not too shabby for Boomy, which in addition to upgrades, also takes a percentage of royalties from free users. 
There is certainly still money to be made in the music business, but it remains to be seen if it is for the users of new music technologies, the companies behind those music technologies, traditional music business stakeholders or a combination of these.

[+] seriously. His pioneering work laid the foundation for the fields of digital computing and AI as we know them today.Heritage Images/Getty Images
In the most direct sense, artificial intelligence is an engineering challenge. The mathematics underlying today’s cutting-edge AI algorithms is complex. The amount of computing resources required to train state-of-the-art AI models is formidable. AI is driving a whole new generation of R&D innovation in silicon.


Yet the field of artificial intelligence reaches far beyond engineering. By promising widespread automation, AI prompts fundamental questions about how we want to organize our economy and society. The pursuit of AI brings us face to face with basic, intimate questions about consciousness, intelligence, creativity: in short, what it means to be human.

Anyone hoping to get her arms around what artificial intelligence will mean for the world in the twenty-first century must engage with questions and perspectives from across engineering, psychology, economics, sociology, and philosophy.

PROMOTED
Below we present a selection of quotes on these topics from many of the world’s greatest thinkers. The hope is that these quotes will help illuminate the scope of the field, the contours of the challenges ahead, and the enormity of the stakes.

“The ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”

—Attributed to John von Neumann, 1958 (the first known use of the word “singularity” in the context of technological progress)

“For more than 250 years the fundamental drivers of economic growth have been technological innovations. The most important of these are what economists call general-purpose technologies — a category that includes the steam engine, electricity, and the internal combustion engine. The most important general-purpose technology of our era is artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning.”
—Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, 2018

“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It is really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.”
—Sebastian Thrun, 2013

“The hardest problems we have to face do not come from philosophical questions about whether brains are machines or not. There is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains are anything other than machines with enormous numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical laws. As far as anyone can tell, our minds are merely complex processes. The serious problems come from our having had so little experience with machines of such complexity that we are not yet prepared to think effectively about them.”
—Marvin Minsky, 1986

“If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn't.”
—Attributed to Emerson M. Pugh, 1977

“Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.”
—Alan Kay

“The human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines’ decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control.”
—Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber), 1995

“In the literal sense, the programmed computer understands what the car or the adding machine understand: namely, exactly nothing.”
—John Searle, 1980

“It is customary to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.”
—Alan Turing, 1951

“How do you know that when I speak to you, what you call ‘thinking’ is going on inside me? The Turing test is a fantastic probe — something like a particle accelerator in physics. Just as in physics, when you want to understand what is going on at an atomic or subatomic level, since you can’t see it directly, you scatter accelerated particles off the target in question and observe their behavior. From this you infer the internal nature of the target. The Turing test extends this idea to the mind. It treats the mind as a ‘target’ that is not directly visible but whose structure can be deduced more abstractly. By ‘scattering’ questions off a target mind, you learn about its internal workings, just as in physics.”
—Douglas Hofstadter, 1981

“Artificial intelligence is one of the most profound things we're working on as humanity. It is more profound than fire or electricity.”

We are implementing a leading, cutting-edge Facial Recognition system for access control at the campus and student residences. The safety of students and staff is one of our top priorities and we would like to ensure that there are stricter controls at the entrances of the campus to ensure that only authorised members gain access. Over the years, we have had criminal incidences and we aim to reduce these incidences to zero by implementing the facial recognition system. This exciting project was named #YourFaceIsTheKey upon kick-off in 2019. Only each individual’s face will gain them access to the campus and residences. We are not removing the current card reader functionality, but as an additional security measure, individual’s faces will be scanned and validated. If individuals are swiping a card, but the scanned profile does not match the profile of the scanned student or staff card, access will be denied. We will share more information and a demonstration on how the system will work in the coming weeks. The system will apply to all students, service workers, administrative staff and management. We will also accommodate other stakeholders like school learners, some members of the community as well as contractors who enter the campus for once-off or regular project work. We started with student registration earlier this year, along with the issuing of student cards. To date, we have registered just over 12 000 students in preparation for the new system. If you have not registered yet, please visit the registration desk upon your next visit to the campus later in April. All student registrations will be shut down during the COVID-19 21-day lockdown period (26 March – 16 April). We will continue to share updates via email, on our Facebook page and on the website. We also have a radio advert playing on a regular basis, so please tell your fellow staff, students and friends to listen closely for news about the project. We plan to have exciting awareness days where more information about the project, will be shared. Availability of more information on the awareness days will be determined by the progress of the current COVID-19 status. We are very proud of this achievement. The implementation of this project will not only enable us to provide our staff and students at UNIVEN with a safer work and learning environment, but we will also be the first university in Africa to implement Facial Recognition for Access Control. We have the opportunity to be the leaders in technology and to lead fellow universities and institutions by example, and we are extremely proud of this. The success of this project not only depends on the IT, Campus Security and Installation teams, but it also depends on the staff members and students of UNIVEN. We need you to support us in our efforts to create a safe working and learning environment. Safety starts with YOU. Safety starts with ME. For more information, please contact Mr Sam Khoza, Director of the Department of Information and Communication Technology at 015 962 8102 / 072 249 1288 or email to sam.khoza@univen.ac.za Issued by: Department of Communications & Marketing University of Venda Tel: (015) 962 8525 Date: 27 March 2020    Share    Tweet            Share        Messenger         Whatsapp        Email          Print Related:  General Regulations –  Admission, Registration and Examination of Students  Department of Business Information Systems – Faculty of Management, Commerce and Law",,,,,,,,

ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) is the wave of the future. This area of computer science emphasising the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans is heavily influencing and taking over the way we get on with daily life.Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is conducted. More importantly, it is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is done, being already widely used in applications including automation, data analytics and natural language processing. On a bigger spectrum, from self-driving cars to voice-initiated mobile phones and computer-controlled robots, the presence of AI is seen and felt almost everywhere. As more industries shift towards embracing the science of incorporating human intelligence in machines so the latter can function, think and work like humans, the demand for human capital with the relevant skill and expertise correspondingly increases.

 As such, the question is, how do engineering students ride this wave and make the most of it? AI has a high learning curve but the rewards of a career in AI far outweigh the investment of time and energy. Unlike most conventional careers, AI is still in its infancy stage although several modern nations have fully embraced the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Taking this into account, UCSI University has taken the initiative to develop the Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) programme. The nation’s best private university for two years in a row, according to the two recent QS World University Rankings exercises, proactively defines its own AI curriculum to offer educational content that can help increase the supply of AI engineers with job-ready graduates and real world experiences. The AI programme at UCSI consists of a number of specialisations and several overlapping disciplines, including mathematical and statistical methods, computer sciences and other AI core subjects to provide a conceptual framework in providing solutions for real-world engineering problems. The first two years covers core theoretical knowledge such as mathematics and statistics, algorithm design and computer programming, as well as electrical and electronics. Students will progress to the AI subfields by selecting the specialisation elective tracks covering emerging areas such as machine learning, decision-making and robotics, perception and language and human-AI interaction, among others.‘We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system, ’ says Ang. UCSI Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment dean Asst Prof Ts Dr Ang Chun Kit pointed out that AI was “unavoidably” the way forward. “We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system. “This programme was developed with a vision to provide the foundation for future growth in producing more complex and high-value products for industry sectors in Malaysia, ” he said. Leading the faculty in which 46 of its members have PhDs, Ang emphasised the university focuses on research attachment abroad and has established partnerships with key industry players. The faculty also stands out in terms of receiving grants to advance high impact projects. Students from the faculty are also annually selected for researches at world-renowned universities such as Imperial College London and Tsinghua University. The faculty also strives to give students field experience through internships at various top companies. An example would be Harry Hoon Jian Wen, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student. He was selected to go to the University of Queensland for a research attachment while also successfully completing his internship at Schneider Electric.
