AI is considered the most disruptive technology, according to Gartner’s 2019 CIO Survey (it includes over 3,000 CIOs from 89 countries). So yes, this is big reason why there has been a major increase in adoption and implementation.

Yet there is a bottleneck that could easily slow the progress – that is, finding the right talent. The fact is that there are few data scientists and AI experts available.
“In our recent State of Software Engineer report, we found that demand for data engineers has increased by 38% and demand growth for machine learning engineers has increased by 27% in the last year,” said Mehul Patel, who is the CEO of Hired. “Based on data from our career marketplace, we believe the difficulty of recruiting for tech talent with specialized skills in machine learning and AI will continue to become increasingly competitive. Machine learning engineers are commanding an average salary of 153K in the SF Bay Area, which is nearly 20K above the global tech worker’s average salary.”
Actually, this is why one approach is to acquire companies that have strong teams! This appears to be the case with McDonald’s, which recently paid $300 million for Dynamic Yield. It’s an AI company that helps personalize customer experiences.
PROMOTED
But of course, this option has its issues as well. Let’s face it, acquisitions can be difficult to integrate, especially when the target has a workforce with highly specialized skillsets.
So what are other approaches to consider? Well, here’s a look at some ideas:
Automation: With the growth in AI, there has also been the emergence of innovative automation tools, whether from startups or even the mega tech operators. For example, this week Microsoft introduced a new set of systems to streamline the process.
“The biggest and most impactful way that organizations can leverage their current team for data science is to implement a data science automation platform,” said Dr. Ryohei Fujimaki, who is the founder and CEO of dotData. “Data science automation significantly simplifies tasks that formerly could only be completed by data scientists, and enables existing resources -- such as business analysts, BI engineers and data engineers -- to execute data science projects through a simple GUI operation. Automation of the full data science process, from raw business data through data and feature engineering through machine learning, is enabling enterprises to build effective data science teams with minimal costs, using their current talent.”
Now this does not mean that a platform is a panacea, as there still needs to be qualified data scientists. But then again, there will be far more efficiency and scale with AI projects.
“If organizations have data scientists already, an automation platform frees up highly-skilled resources from many of the manual and time-consuming efforts involved, and allows them to focus on more complex and strategic analysis,” said Ryohei. “This empowers data scientists to achieve higher productivity and drive greater business impact than ever before.”
Reskilling: If you currently have employees who are business analysts or have experience with data engineering, then they could be good candidates to train for AI tasks. This would include focusing on skills like Python and TensorFlow, which is a deep learning framework.
“From a training and learning perspective, there are an abundance of online resources via Coursera, Udacity, open.ai, and deeplearning.ai that can help companies develop their employees’ AI/ML skills,” said Mehul. “Additionally, it will be valuable for a company to acquire someone with existing experience in AI to be a leader and mentor for developing employees. The interesting thing about AI/data science is that you don't need to be an experienced software engineer to do it.  The field is so exciting because of the diversity of talent and backgrounds spanning science, engineering, and economics.”
But the training should not just be for a small group of people. It should be company-wide. “Without a data-driven culture and mindset, data science and AI cannot be truly implemented,” said Ryohei. “It is important for enterprise leaders and business teams to understand how to best work with the data science team to meet the organization’s key business objectives. While the business stakeholders do not need to be data experts, they need to know ‘How to use’ AI and ‘How it changes their businesses.’”

			How artificial intelligence and robotics are changing our lives		

 May 3, 2019 
 
				Dominic Lill			

  AI,  artificial intelligence,  employees,  productivity,  robotics

At this present moment in time, humanity stands on the cusp of a revolutionary change; a change that is happening through our own creations, and in which is beginning to transform every aspect of the way we live; artificial intelligence and robotics. 
This integration of artificial intelligence and robotics into more and more aspects of our everyday lives has the potential to be both a salvation for some, whilst also the downfall for others. 

Not only will this technological revolution improve medicine, crime prevention and the way countries both protect and defend themselves, but it will also take the jobs of many different people, becoming the cheaper, (and in many ways) more efficient replacement for employees with the potential for human error. 
Whilst the AI and robotics field have not yet seen the creation of sentient machines, as the typical Sci-Fi films would lead you to believe, the machines civilisation uses daily are getting increasingly smarter, and furthermore increasingly entangled into our everyday lives. From the likes of our smartphone’s live-in assistants (Siri), to robot surgeons, artificial intelligence is gaining an increasing presence in the lives of each and every one of us, changing our lives for the better and for the worst. 
One of the more trivial influences AIs and robotics have had on people’s lives during this period of technological revolution would be the gaming industry. AI advancements in this field have learnt how to play numerous different games to impressively skilled levels – for example, an AI created by Google’s DeepMind learnt how to play chess in under four hours. 
Not only does teaching AIs such strategies give those online someone to play with, but also, as Max Tegmark claimed in his book Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, it can further ‘challenge the best human strategists even beyond game boards. For example, with investment strategy, political strategy and military strategy. Such real-world strategy problems are typically complicated by human psychology.’ 
Another huge area that has, and will continue to be, massively affected by artificial intelligence and robotics is the work sector. Big companies are starting to look at replacing their delivery staff with drones, and proof-readers are increasingly becoming a thing of the past with the likes of AI powered applications. There are many benefits to using AIs in these types of jobs, the main one being that it eliminates the chances of human error, and further ensures a more efficient and successful outcome in that specified sector of a company. 
However, although replacing human staff with such AIs can lead to an increased efficiency and thereby productivity, it can also cause mass unemployment and further significantly decrease the quality of life for those in the industry. Therefore, although the incorporation of AIs and Robotics within the work sector can significantly improve the rates of efficiency and productivity, it also has the potential to cause a sharp increase in unemployment rates.
Another, potentially more controversial, way in which artificial intelligence and robotics are changing our lives would be through the sex industry. One of the latest technological advancements in this field has seen the creation of robotic sex dolls, with the goal for models to become more lifelike getting closer and closer with each new development. Some of the AIs in this area can now offer a more emotionally-driven connection with its customers, by now having the ability to flirt as well as making a spectrum of different reactionary facial expressions. Research from Online Casino Betway predicted that by 2025 there will be sexual compatibility between AI and humans.
Robotic sex dolls have
however been a cause for concern since their creation, with experts in the
field of robotics and the ethics surrounding them claiming that such products
have the potential to damage real-life relationships. These types of robots do
not accurately portray real life people, but rather a submissive and
unrealistic alternative that can damage its user’s perception of a real sexual
relationship and subsequently cause issues in forming such bonds outside of
their robotic dolls. 
A more overtly positive way in which artificial intelligence and robotics have changed our lives for the better would be through its advancements in the medical field. Over the past decade, hospitals have been using robots to perform certain tasks during surgery that require intense precision, and have little room for human error. 
The types of robotics used in operating theatres are not self-operated, but rather are controlled by surgeons. However, as artificial intelligence develops further, the future may see robotics in the medical field operate such complex tasks as patient diagnoses; with built-in algorithms able to efficiently sift through mass amounts of data, reducing the amount of deaths caused by medical record mix-ups.

The drug, sold under the brand name Lamisil by pharma giant Novartis, had come onto the market in 1993 for the treatment of fungal skin infections and thrush. But three years later, the agency had received a number of reports of suspected adverse reactions, including 11 reports of liver toxicity. By 2008, three deaths from liver failure and 70 liver reactions had been pinned on oral terbinafine.Researchers in Canada identified the biochemical culprit behind terbinafine’s liver toxicity—a compound called TBF-A that appeared to be a metabolite of terbinafine—in 2001. Clinicians quickly learned to monitor and manage this potential toxicity during treatment, but no one could work out how the compound actually formed in the liver, or could experimentally reproduce its synthesis from terbinafine in the...Then, in 2018, graduate student Na Le Dang at Washington University in St. Louis hit upon a way to use artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, a machine learning algorithm—to work out the possible biochemical pathways terbinafine takes when it is metabolized by the liver. Trained on large numbers of known metabolic pathways, the algorithm had learned the most likely outcomes when different types of molecules were broken down in the organ. With that information, it was able to identify what no human could: that the metabolism of terbinafine to TBF-A was a two-step process.It’s really our ambition to automate as much as possible, so the chemists are just focusing on the much higher level, the difficult problems, the strategy.—Adrian Schreyer, ExscientiaTwo-step metabolites are much more difficult than direct metabolites to detect experimentally, which is likely why this potentially lethal outcome wasn’t flagged until after the product was on the market, says S. Joshua Swamidass, a physician scientist and computational biologist at Washington University and Dang’s supervisor. The discovery not only shed light on a long-standing biochemical mystery, but showed how the use of AI could more broadly aid drug discovery and development.Given enough data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions or classify new data much faster than any human. “A lot of the questions that are really facing drug development teams are no longer the sorts of questions that people think that they can handle from just sorting through data in their heads,” Swamidass says. “There’s got to be some sort of systematic way of looking at large amounts of data . . . to answer questions and to get insight into how to do things.”AI is well positioned to handle the complexity of the rules that must be applied to understand these data, too, says Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist at MIT and a scientific advisor for drugmaker Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. “When we study chemistry, we definitely study a lot of rules and we understand the mechanism, but sometimes they’re really, really complex,” she says. “If [a] machine is provided with a lot of data, and the problem is formulated correctly, it has a chance to capture patterns which humans may not be able to capture.”Machine learning couldn’t have matured at a better time for the pharmaceutical industry, says Shahar Keinan, cofounder and chief scientific officer at Cloud Pharmaceuticals, a company focusing on AI–based drug discovery. She argues that the steady decline in the number of new drug targets, new mechanisms, and novel first-in-class drugs coming to market each year is an indication that the current system of drug discovery is insufficient to meet modern challenges. “Right now, you need to do more work to get to those kind of first-in-class [drugs],” she says. “The way to overcome that . . . is to find something new in what [data] we have, and this is where artificial intelligence will come in.”The pharmaceutical industry and its investors seem to agree. Last year Cloud Pharmaceuticals entered into a drug discovery collaboration with pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline. And UK-based BenevolentAI, which describes its mission as “accelerating the journey from data to medicine” in areas ranging from drug discovery to clinical development, recently earned an eyebrow-raising multibillion-dollar valuation.Using artificial intelligence to design better drugsMore than 450 medicines worldwide have been withdrawn from the market post-approval in the last half century as a result of adverse reactions, with liver toxicity the most common side effect. But the metabolism of compounds by organs such as the liver is extremely complex and, as in the case of terbinafine, difficult to anticipate.This is exactly the sort of problem that machine learning can help solve—and the data are already available to help that process. For example, the US federal government’s Tox21 program, a collaboration among the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, maintains a large data set of molecules and their toxicity against key human proteins—perfect fodder for AI to digest in search of patterns of association between structure, properties, function, and possible toxic effects, Keinan says.Cloud Pharmaceuticals is one company that makes use of these data as part of their workflow. “Now you can train a machine learning algorithm on this data set, then a new molecule comes along, and you can just use your prediction to say, ‘Is this molecule toxic or not?’” says Keinan.As well as identifying potential toxicities, machine learning algorithms could predict how a candidate molecule will respond to different physical and chemical environments, and so help drug developers understand how that molecule might behave in various tissues in the human body.If a machine is provided with a lot of data, and the problem is formulated correctly, it has a chance to capture patterns which humans may not be able to capture.—Regina Barzilay, MITA group led by physical chemist Scott Hopkins of the University of Waterloo, in collaboration with researchers at Pfizer, has been training an algorithm to do just that, using data on 89 small-molecule drug candidates obtained by performing a type of spectrometry that measures how quickly molecules absorb or lose water.“If our drug molecule absorbs a lot of water very quickly and doesn’t give it up, it tells us that that drug is going to be very soluble in water,” Hopkins says. “It’s going to dissolve easily in your stomach and enter your bloodstream fairly quickly.” After the algorithm learned the associations between certain molecular structures and solubility from those 89 molecules, it was able to accurately predict the key properties of a similar molecule, the team reported at the end of last year.Although screening for potential toxicities and for biochemical properties are essential sub-tasks in the process of drug development, a more tantalizing question is whether AI could suggest the structure of a new therapeutic molecule from scratch.At Maryland-based biotech Insilico Medicine, CEO Alexander Zhavoronkov and colleagues are using a type of algorithm called a generative adversarial network to help develop entirely novel small-molecule organic compounds aimed at treating everything from cancer to metabolic disease to neurodegenerative disorders. This algorithm consists of two deep neural networks pitted against one another, Zhavoronkov explains.The first deep neural network has the challenge of coming up with outputs—molecular structures—in response to a series of inputs, namely the desired functional and biochemical characteristics of those structures, such as solubility, targets, or bioavailability. The other deep neural network has the job of critiquing those outputs. “They engage in this adversarial game,” Zhavoronkov says. “They basically kind of compete with each other . . . and in this process, after many, many iterations, they learn to generate something new.”Insilico Medicine recently synthesized its first molecule from this process in partnership with China-based pharmaceutical company Wuxi AppTec. The two companies have now entered into a collaboration agreement to test other candidate molecules designed by the adversarial network approach for multiple orphan drug targets.Other companies, such as Exscientia, a UK-based, AI-driven drug discovery company, are bringing machine learning to bear on the entire process of drug discovery. Exscientia is building a platform that aims to mimic the decision making of a medicinal chemist while also learning from human medicinal chemists’ input. “It’s really our ambition to automate as much as possible, [so] the chemists are just focusing on the much higher level, the difficult problems, the strategy,” says Adrian Schreyer, chief technology officer at the company. This means the biological targets and the molecules designed to bind them will all be influenced by the outputs of their AI platform.But there is still a human hand on the tiller. The algorithm “is fairly autonomous in terms of generating compounds, [but] the final selection is done by chemists,” Schreyer says. This is partly because the patent system demands a human name to an invention, but also because the selections that the chemists make from the AI-generated options can be fed back into the algorithm to fine-tune its decision-making protocol for the next time. “If you see twenty to thirty compounds and [humans] pick ten . . . by virtue of the decision making you can see what’s preferable, you can use that process itself to build a machine learning model.”Exscientia’s approach has generated considerable interest from the pharmaceutical industry, with Roche investing up to $67 million in a drug-discovery collaboration with the company. Another recent financing round has earned the company $26 million in investment from companies including Celgene Corporation and GT Healthcare Capital Partners.The limitations of artificial intelligenceDespite progress in using AI for drug development, it’s not time for humans to step out of the process just yet, says Barzilay. For now, she explains, AI in pharma is analogous to a smart kitchen: “You have a microwave, and you have a coffee machine, and you have this and that, but none of it actually cooks you the dinner. . . . You need to put it all together to make a dinner, even though all these things can help you to do it faster and better.” While Barzilay and colleagues are part of a pharma-funded research collaboration with MIT to bring AI into drug discovery, she points out that machine learning has not yet brought a molecule to market. “It just assists humans to do a faster and better job in various sub-tasks, but we still don’t have AI coming up with new drugs at this point,” she says.Artificial intelligence is also limited by the quality of the inputs—in particular, the quality of the data that it learns from, says Schreyer. “If the data is flawed, then the results are likely to be flawed as well, which can be a problem if you get data from third parties,” he says. Experimental data are not perfect measurements of the real world, and there are always assumptions and fitting involved. If the algorithm and its users do not sufficiently take those biases and weightings into account, then the outputs will also be biased.One tantalizing question is whether AI could suggest the structure of a new therapeutic molecule from scratch.Sometimes data can be lacking altogether, particularly for recently discovered molecules. At Cloud Pharmaceuticals, researchers are getting around this problem by using computational chemistry to design a range of molecules that could fit a particular biological target, then using that range as the data set that the machine learning algorithm can learn from to help design new candidate molecules.Another issue for some researchers is the so-called “black box” nature of the algorithms themselves: data goes in, answers come out, but the internal workings remain a mystery. Swamidass says that this presents a fundamental conflict for scientists. “What does it mean to be applying black-box methods in fields that are all about understanding what’s inside of a black box?” he says. “We don’t want to just have something that works in science, we want to understand the underlying processes there.”But Barzilay says that the relationships between inputs and outputs might often go beyond human comprehension. “When we’re talking about complex organic reactions with different solvents and different temperatures and other things, then it becomes really difficult even for the experienced human to predict what is the right outcome, so what does it mean [to] give an explanation?”There is unquestionably a lot of hype around the potential of AI in drug discovery—Swamidass likens this period to the internet boom of the late 1990s. But many, such as Schreyer, are excited about the possibilities that this new technology offers, particularly when it comes to finding novel therapeutics for difficult-to-treat diseases.“If you can improve . . . how efficiently you do drug discovery fivefold, tenfold, or even more,” he says, “then from an economic perspective . . . you’re able to take on more risky projects because the cost of failure is much lower.”Bianca Nogrady is a freelance science writer based in Sydney, Australia.Interested in reading more?Become a Member ofReceive full access to digital editions of The Scientist, as well as TS Digest, feature stories, more than 35 years of archives, and much more!Join for free todayAlready a member?Login Here",,,,The Scientist,https://www.the-scientist.com/assets/logo_plain.svg,True,English,https://www.the-scientist.com/artificial-intelligence-shakes-up-drug-discovery-65787,"Modified from © istock.com, the scientist staffAustralia’s government drug safety watchdog sounded the alarm about the oral antifungal agent terbinafine in 1996. The drug, sold under the brand name Lamisil by pharma giant Novartis, had come onto the market in 1993 for the treatment of fungal skin infections and thrush. But three years later, the agency had received a number of reports of suspected adverse reactions, including 11 reports of liver toxicity. By 2008, three deaths from liver failure&nbsp;and 70 liver reactions had been pinned on oral terbinafine.Researchers in Canada identified the biochemical culprit behind terbinafine’s liver toxicity—a compound called TBF-A that appeared to be a metabolite of terbinafine—in 2001. Clinicians quickly learned to monitor and manage this potential toxicity during treatment, but no one could work out how the compound actually formed in the liver, or could experimentally reproduce its synthesis from terbinafine in the lab.Then, in 2018, graduate student Na Le Dang at Washington University in St. Louis hit upon a way to use artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, a machine learning algorithm—to work out the possible biochemical pathways terbinafine takes when it is metabolized by the liver. Trained on large numbers of known metabolic pathways, the algorithm had learned the most likely outcomes when different types of molecules were broken down in the organ. With that information, it was able to identify what no human could: that the metabolism of terbinafine to TBF-A was a two-step process.It’s really our ambition to automate as much as possible, so the chemists are just focusing on the much higher level, the difficult problems, the strategy.—Adrian Schreyer, ExscientiaTwo-step metabolites are much more difficult than direct metabolites to detect experimentally, which is likely why this potentially lethal outcome wasn’t flagged until after the product was on the market, says S. Joshua Swamidass, a physician scientist and computational biologist at Washington University and Dang’s supervisor. The discovery not only shed light on a long-standing biochemical mystery, but showed how the use of AI could more broadly aid drug discovery and development.Given enough data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions or classify new data much faster than any human. “A lot of the questions that are really facing drug development teams are no longer the sorts of questions that people think that they can handle from just sorting through data in their heads,” Swamidass says. “There’s got to be some sort of systematic way of looking at large amounts of data . . . to answer questions and to get insight into how to do things.”AI is well positioned to handle the complexity of the rules that must be applied to understand these data, too, says Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist at MIT and a scientific advisor for drugmaker Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. “When we study chemistry, we definitely study a lot of rules and we understand the mechanism, but sometimes they’re really, really complex,” she says. “If [a] machine is provided with a lot of data, and the problem is formulated correctly, it has a chance to capture patterns which humans may not be able to capture.”Machine learning couldn’t have matured at a better time for the pharmaceutical industry, says Shahar Keinan, cofounder and chief scientific officer at Cloud Pharmaceuticals, a company focusing on AI–based drug discovery. She argues that the steady decline in the number of new drug targets, new mechanisms, and novel first-in-class drugs coming to market each year is an indication that the current system of drug discovery is insufficient to meet modern challenges. “Right now, you need to do more work to get to those kind of first-in-class [drugs],” she says. “The way to overcome that . . . is to find something new in what [data] we have, and this is where artificial intelligence will come in.”The pharmaceutical industry and its investors seem to agree. Last year Cloud Pharmaceuticals entered into a drug discovery collaboration with pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline.

Developed with Microsoft Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, Teleopti’s WFM chatbot, Grant, is the next recruit for intraday automation and enhanced employee self-service
Teleopti today launched Grant, the workforce management (WFM) chatbot developed to help companies revolutionize their intraday automation with AI-optimized employee self-service. Teleopti’s bot assistant leverages Microsoft Azure Bot Service to deliver a more agile, efficient process for internal communication and customer service staffing. Driving intraday operations with AI technology allows companies to improve every aspect of their customer service organization from their business processes to how their employees work.
Meet Grant
Teleopti’s incorporation of chatbot technology into WFM processes offers the next step for many companies looking to evolve both their intraday operations and employee empowerment. Available to Teleopti Azure cloud customers, Grant is an organization’s own WFM concierge, handling all processes related to schedule requests. Grant analyzes current staffing alongside employees’ unique skills and schedules to provide chat notifications when voluntary time off is available.  If additional support is needed, Grant will soon be able to provide notifications when overtime hours are on offer. Infused with natural language processing, staff can chat with Grant and let him know if they wish to accept the schedule options. Grant then automatically submits the schedule request for them. 
“Employee engagement has always been at the core of our development focus, but it isn’t a static, one-size-fits-all matter, which is why we are constantly innovating around how to push the boundaries of WFM and employee-engagement functionality,” says Olle Düring, CEO at Teleopti. 
Recruiting Grant as a WFM assistant helps not just frontline employees to achieve a better work-life balance with more freedom in their schedule, but it also means management and the WFM team can achieve flexible intraday planning. Staffing can be adjusted to meet incoming demand without exhaustive manual monitoring, all while lowering HR costs. The organizations’ overall customer experience is also enhanced as Grant helps the company meet customers in the right place, at the right time, with skilled people who feel empowered in their working day.
Olle Düring continues, “New technological opportunities, such as chatbots, offer clear benefits for automating customer communication. With our 100% focus on WFM we’re taking these innovations into workforce management.  Developing WFM embedded with machine learning and bot technology helps our customers improve their planning and operations, as well as create more empowering self-service for their teams.” 

Built with Microsoft Cognitive Services 
Following workshops and bi-weekly check-in sessions with Microsoft’s AI Services team, Teleopti’s R&D team built Grant using Microsoft Cognitive Services. Azure Bot Framework was a natural fit with its acceleration of intelligent bot creation, ability to scale on demand and integration of Teleopti’s cloud WFM solution with Microsoft Azure. Microsoft’s LUIS Language Understanding has also been crucial as the machine-learning based service enables Teleopti to build natural language chat conversations between Grant and the employee.
“We’re excited to see Teleopti using Microsoft Azure to transform their business with AI,” said Eric Boyd, corporate vice president, Azure AI, Microsoft.  “By infusing their apps with Azure Cognitive Services, Teleopti has built an intelligent Workforce Management chatbot that can interact with employees in a natural way, helping drive better workforce management and stronger employee engagement.”

Grant’s Growth & Competence Development
Mattias Engblom, CTO at Teleopti concludes, “Like all new recruits, we are excited for Grant’s development and growth. The joy of AI is that Grant’s conversations will continue to become more complex as he learns from his chats with employees. Just like all our iterative development processes, we will also listen to the input from customers to develop the areas where they have the greatest need for Grant’s assistance.”

Blame the machines.A pun generator might not sound like serious work for an artificial intelligence researcher---more the sort of thing knocked out over the weekend to delight the labmates come Monday. But for He He, who designed just that during her postdoc at Stanford, it’s an entry point to a devilish problem in machine learning. He’s aim is to build AI that’s natural and fun to talk to---bots that don’t just read us the news or tell us the weather, but can crack jokes or compose a poem, even tell a compelling story. But getting there, she says, runs up against the limits of how AI typically learns.Gregory Barber covers cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence for WIRED.Neural networks are natural imitators, learning patterns of language by scouring vast amounts of text. If coherency is your aim, that approach works well---so well, in fact, that recent advances have sparked an ethical debate about whether people could abuse AI to generate convincing fake news. But the resulting prose is as dry as the newspaper text and Wikipedia articles typically used to train them. Neural networks, in other words, are rule-abiding to a fault, and that makes them terrible jokers. A well-crafted joke teeters at the edge of coherency without wading into nonsense, He says, and neural networks simply don’t have the sense to strike that balance. Besides, the whole point of creativity is to be, well, novel. “Even if we had a long list of puns it could learn from, that would miss the point,” she says.Instead, He and her team, which included Nanyun Peng and Percy Liang, tried to give their AI some creative wit, using insights from humor theory. To anyone who’s dared craft a pun, the intuition will sound familiar. For a pun to work, He decided it needs to be surprising in a local context (“stopped to get a hare cut” makes little sense on its own) but also have an “aha” factor that ties it all together (in this case, thanks to the word “greyhound”). He and her team anoint this tension with proper academese: the “local-global surprisal principle.” To make a pun, the neural network is given a pair of homophones (hair/hare) and generates a sentence that’s ordinary with the first word, but elicits surprise when the second word is swapped in. Then, to pull it back from the cusp of gibberish, it inserts another word that gives the overall sentence a bit more logic.AdvertisementResearcher He He created a method to generate puns by editing a bland sentence to produce comedic tension.

According to the crowdworkers who rated the puns, the results were … not great for the machines, at least by human standards. While He’s system produced puns that were much funnier than a previous AI-driven attempt, it only beat the humans 10 percent of the time. Plus, the puns were stuck in a rather rudimentary structure (and struggled at times with grammar). Some examples:Trending NowWill AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li & Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas ThompsonThat’s because negotiator got my car back to me in one peace.Even from the outside, I could tell that he’d already lost some wait.Well, gourmet did it, he thought, it’d butter be right.“We’re nowhere near solving this,” He says.Still, Roger Levy, director of MIT’s computational psycholinguistics lab, says the approach is a promising step toward building AI with a bit more personality. “Humor is an intrinsically challenging aspect of studying the mind. But it’s also fundamental to what makes us human,” he says.

Blame the machines.
A pun generator might not sound like serious work for an artificial intelligence researcher---more the sort of thing knocked out over the weekend to delight the labmates come Monday. But for He He, who designed just that during her postdoc at Stanford, it’s an entry point to a devilish problem in machine learning. He’s aim is to build AI that’s natural and fun to talk to---bots that don’t just read us the news or tell us the weather, but can crack jokes or compose a poem, even tell a compelling story. But getting there, she says, runs up against the limits of how AI typically learns.
Neural networks are natural imitators, learning patterns of language by scouring vast amounts of text. If coherency is your aim, that approach works well---so well, in fact, that recent advances have sparked an ethical debate about whether people could abuse AI to generate convincing fake news. But the resulting prose is as dry as the newspaper text and Wikipedia articles typically used to train them. Neural networks, in other words, are rule-abiding to a fault, and that makes them terrible jokers. A well-crafted joke teeters at the edge of coherency without wading into nonsense, He says, and neural networks simply don’t have the sense to strike that balance. Besides, the whole point of creativity is to be, well, novel. “Even if we had a long list of puns it could learn from, that would miss the point,” she says.
Instead, He and her team, which included Nanyun Peng and Percy Liang, tried to give their AI some creative wit, using insights from humor theory. To anyone who’s dared craft a pun, the intuition will sound familiar. For a pun to work, He decided it needs to be surprising in a local context (“stopped to get a hare cut” makes little sense on its own) but also have an “aha” factor that ties it all together (in this case, thanks to the word “greyhound”). He and her team anoint this tension with proper academese: the “local-global surprisal principle.” To make a pun, the neural network is given a pair of homophones (hair/hare) and generates a sentence that’s ordinary with the first word, but elicits surprise when the second word is swapped in. Then, to pull it back from the cusp of gibberish, it inserts another word that gives the overall sentence a bit more logic.
Next, He staged a pun contest, pitting the AI against (human) humorists. According to the crowdworkers who rated the puns, the results were … not great for the machines, at least by human standards. While He’s system produced puns that were much funnier than a previous AI-driven attempt, it only beat the humans 10 percent of the time. Plus, the puns were stuck in a rather rudimentary structure (and struggled at times with grammar). Some examples:
That’s because negotiator got my car back to me in one peace.
Even from the outside, I could tell that he’d already lost some wait.
Well, gourmet did it, he thought, it’d butter be right.
“We’re nowhere near solving this,” He says.
Still, Roger Levy, director of MIT’s computational psycholinguistics lab, says the approach is a promising step toward building AI with a bit more personality. “Humor is an intrinsically challenging aspect of studying the mind. But it’s also fundamental to what makes us human,” he says. Four years ago, Levy described a computational approach to predicting whether a pun is funny---work that would eventually become the foundation for He’s joke-generation method. Levy says he had planned on testing something like the local-global surprisal principle, which is more fine-tuned than the theories used in his paper. The concept made sense, intuitively, but he didn’t yet have the data to prove it. “It’s really cool to see that actually pan out,” he says.
More broadly, the humor research highlights the need to bring more human intelligence to neural nets, Levy says. Recently, he’s been using surprise as a way to study other aspects of how AI understands language. “Surprisal is one of the most central concepts in both AI and cognitive science,” Levy says. In humans, it reflects when we encounter new or unexpected information, and can be measured with a proxy, like tracking eye movements as we read.

            Is it ethical to replace a worker with a robot?
    

            This was a question asked at a panel discussion at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference Tuesday. Machines have already begun replacing jobs, ranging from factory workers to baseball umpires to lawyers. 
    

            Most of the people on the panel said they believed it was ok. Pedro Domingos, head of machine learning research at investment firm the D. E. Shaw Group and professor at the University of Washington, explained that, as a result of artificial intelligence, there will be more demand for existing jobs, and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. This is similar to how we couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, and now millions make a living doing that today, he said. John Kelly III, executive vice president of IBM, was similarly optimistic, adding, “Man and machine working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently.”

            I am skeptical of these claims. Automation can contribute to the rise of precarious work, such as contractors and freelancers who lack full-time benefits. Artificial intelligence likely will not create entirely new fields of expertise or careers as computers did for computer scientists. And humans and machines working together can be more complicated than either working alone. For example, an autonomous car that uses “level three technology” drives itself in most situations but hands control back to a human driver in emergency situations. This setup requires humans not to be lulled into distraction while the car is driving autonomously, as was the case in a fatal accident involving an Uber self-driving test car in Arizona.

            First, let humans and machines play to their moral strengths — algorithms are often good at achieving utilitarian outcomes, such as doing the most good for the most people. But humans are often good at enforcing moral rules, such as making sure not to discriminate based on race and gender. Plenty of algorithmic programs designed to do good, like Google Translate, are prone to racial or gender bias, which require humans to step in and correct course. 
    

            Second, let robots do the robotic work and let humans do the rest. For example, a study demonstrates how an artificial intelligence platform and human experts working together fare better at identifying cyberattacks than either humans or machines working alone. This is because the platform does the dull, rote work of sifting through tons of data, while the human experts sample the platform’s output, identifying anomalous cases and feeding that back to the platform, which then improves on detecting cyberattacks. 
    

            Last, divide up social work. Despite our tendency to dislike robots in social contexts, outsourcing some social interaction to robots can reduce burnout in jobs that require managing others’ emotions. For example, research shows that automated customer service systems can efficiently route customers to human operators, managing the frustrating parts of the call (such as user authentication) that can free up the human agents to handle the more substantive issues.
    

            Machines have already infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and we must learn to live with them. In considering the ethics of this novel arrangement, the most ethical thing we can do is continue to embrace and value humanity, reminding ourselves that as advanced as technology gets, it will always be learning from us rather than the other way around.

Legal regulation of AI weapons under international humanitarian law:  A Chinese perspective

May 2, 2019, Artificial Intelligence and Armed Conflict / Law and Conflict / The most read blog posts in 2019 / Weapons 9 mins read                        
Qiang Li  Associate Professor, Military Law Institute at China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL)Dan Xie  Distinguished Professor, Military Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) 




 
Arguably, international humanitarian law (IHL) evolves with the development of emerging technologies. The history of IHL demonstrated that any adoption of new technologies presents challenges to this body of law. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the tendency has become even more apparent when humans attempt to achieve the military use of such technology. When it comes to weapons, a combination of weapons and AI technology has increasingly drawn attention from the international community.
Following the high-tech weapon systems such as cyber-attack software and armed drones, combat robots of various types have been developed and employed.[1] Potentially, artificial intelligence will not only significantly increase the efficiency and lethal effect of modern kinetic weapons, but also will partially restrict or even completely eliminate human interventions in all aspects of strategy design, battle organization and tactics implementation.
AI weapons—also known as autonomous weapon systems (AWS), which have been defined by the ICRC as weapons that can independently select and attack targets, i.e., with autonomy in the ‘critical functions’ of acquiring, tracking, selecting and attacking targets—have raised a series of issues both legally and ethically. It is debatable whether such weapons/weapon systems with the functions of learning, reasoning, decision-making and the ability to act independent of human intervention should be employed in future battlefields. In all circumstances, they must be employed in accordance with the principles and rules of IHL.
Legal review before employment
The First Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions (AP I)—to which China is a party—provides that States must fulfil their obligations to determine whether the employment of a new weapon, means or method of warfare would be prohibited by IHL or any other relevant rules of international law in some or all circumstances in the study, development, acquisition or adoption of that weapon (Art 36 API). More specifically, the legality of new weapons must be assessed using the following criteria:

First, are the new weapons prohibited by specific international conventions, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention or Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons?
Second, would such weapons cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering, or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment (Art 35 API)?
Third, will such weapons likely have the effects of indiscriminate attacks (Art 51 API)?
Lastly, will such weapons accord with the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience—the Martens Clause (Art 1(2) API)?[2]

This means that AI weapons must be incorporated in the legal framework of IHL with no exceptions. The principles and rules of IHL should and shall be applied to AI weapons.
Precautions during employment
Humans will make mistakes. The same is true for machines, however ‘intelligent’ they are. Since AI weapons are designed, manufactured, programmed and employed by humans, the consequences and legal responsibilities arising from their illegal acts must be attributed to humans. Humans should not use the ‘error’ of AI systems as an excuse to dodge their own responsibilities. That would not be consistent with the spirit and value of the law. Accordingly, AI weapons, or weapon systems, should not be characterized as ‘combatants’ under IHL and consequently take on legal responsibility. In any circumstance, the wrongful targeting made by AI weapon systems is not a problem of the weapon itself. Therefore, when employing AI weapons systems, programmers and end users are under a legal obligation to take all feasible precautionary measures ensuring such employment in accordance with the fundamental rules of IHL (Art 57 API). 
Accountability after employment
If humans are responsible for the employment of AI weapons, who, of these humans, holds responsibility? Is it the designers, the manufacturers, the programmers or the operators (end users)? In the view of many Chinese researchers, the end users must take primary responsibilities for the wrongful targeting of AI weapons. Such an argument derives from the Article 35(1) of AP I which provides ‘in any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited’. In the case of full autonomy of AI weapon systems without any human control, those who decide to employ AI weapon systems—normally senior military commanders and civilian officials—bear individual criminal responsibility for any potential serious violations of IHL. Additionally, the States to which they belong incur State responsibility for such serious violations which could be attributable to them.
Moreover, the targeting of AI weapon systems is closely tied to their design and programming. The more autonomy they have, the higher the design and programming standards must be in order to meet the IHL requirements. For this purpose, the international community is encouraged to adopt a new convention specific to AI weapons, such as the Convention on Conventional Weapons and its Protocols, or the Convention against Anti-personnel Mines and Convention on Cluster Munitions. At the very least, under the framework of such a new convention, the design standards of AI weapons shall be formulated, States shall be responsible for the designing and programming of those weapons with high levels of autonomy, and those States that manufacture and transfer AI weapons in a manner inconsistent with relevant international law, including IHL and Arms Trade Treaty, shall incur responsibility. Furthermore, States should also provide legal advisors to the designers and programmers. In this regard, the existing IHL framework does not fully respond to such new challenges. For this reason, in addition to the development of IHL rules, States should also be responsible for developing their national laws and procedures, in particular transparency mechanisms. On this matter, those States advanced in AI technology should play an exemplary role. 
Ethical aspect
AI weapons—especially the lethal autonomous weapon systems—pose a significant challenge to human ethics. AI weapons do not have human feelings and there is a higher chance that their use will result in violations of IHL rules on methods and means. For example, they can hardly identify the willingness to fight of a human, or understand the historical, cultural, religious and humanistic values of a specific object. Consequently, they are not expected to respect principles of military necessity and proportionality. They even significantly impact universal human values of equality, liberty and justice. In other words, no matter how much they look like humans, they are still machines. It is almost impossible for them to really understand the meaning of the right to life. This is because machines can be well repaired and programmed repeatedly, but life is given to humans only once. From this perspective, even though it is still possible when employing of non-lethal AI weapons, highly lethal AI weapons must be totally prohibited on both international and national levels in view of their high-level autonomy. However, it should be acknowledged that this may not be persuasive reasoning, because it is essentially not a legal argument, but an ethical one. 
Concluding remarks
We cannot predict whether AI will completely replace human resources and so-called robotic wars will emerge. However, it must be observed that there exists a huge gap between nations in terms of AI technological capabilities. It is still an unreachable goal for most countries to procure and militarily use such capabilities. In other words, some States may have the potential to employ AI weapons on the battlefield, while others may not. In such cases, it will inevitably be required to assess the legality of AI weapons and their employment, and IHL will be resorted to. And as a result, the imbalance in military technologies will probably cause the divergency in the interpretation and application of existing IHL rules. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the applicability of IHL to AI weapon systems is beyond all doubt.

Like any other industry, the auto sector is leading in the usage of new age manufacturing technology which surely effects the existence of labor force..Away from this Machine Vs Human discussion, Japan is flipping the conventional debate. Instead of considering AI as a job killer, the country is embracing technology in order to save the industry job crisis for existing employees..Ran Poliakine, Co-founder of a new AI manufacturing consortium said, &quot;Japan has seen eight consecutive years of population decline, which is expected to continue as many of its inhabitants are aging out of the workforce. Researchers predict that by 2036 one in three people will be elderly. This paves the way for AI innovation by delegating easily automated jobs – that will soon be much harder to fill – to machines.&quot;.Japan has been a breeding ground for robotics and AI development. According to the National Institute of Population and Society Security Research, the population of 127 million people in Japan will decline up to 100 million marks by 2049, raising the issue of economic existential survival..A Honda Motor Corporation affiliation Musashi Seimitsu recently declared the shaping of Musashi AI consortium. The consortium will be in collaboration with an Israeli tech entrepreneur Poliakine and SixEye Interactive..The Musashi AI Consortium is aiming to blend best AI-technological minds, software engineering, mathematics, and physics to hail its vision for Industry 4.0. The vision presents a combo of human workforce along with advanced robotics and AI to gear up the inspection and materialistic handlings. According to KPMG, Industry 4.0 is expected to pitch a $4 trillion market by 2020..An entrepreneurial expert said, &quot;The Japanese government is embracing this vision adopting a new initiative called 'Society 5.0,' which adapts a new economic model and broader societal vision of fully incorporating the technological innovations of the fourth industrial revolution, including infrastructure, fintech, healthcare, logistics, and AI.  This will be a big highlight of the G20 Summit, which Japan is hosting for the first time later this year.&quot;.Additionally, Musashi AI is speeding up the process for demonstrating two new AI-centric prototypes –.•  An automatic inspection system based on artificial intelligence and cutting-edge optics.•  A fully self-driving automated forklift, which navigates on its own to perform functions that previously required human interaction..Well, in Japan at least the breakthrough artificial intelligence is being considered as good news for sure..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Albeit artificial intelligence is as yet a work in advancement, we have seen what it can do and the favorable circumstances that accompany the new innovation..While it's regularly mythologized in popular culture and treated like an extraordinarily destabilizing economic power, AI is a great deal like some other innovation. As an ever-increasing number of organizations have created AI applications, competition and adoption rates have expanded, driving down expenses and making AI accessible to a lot more extensive range of organizations. Small companies represent the greater part of net job creation and more than 40% of GDP in the United States. The engineers of AI solutions want their products to be accessible to the business visionaries who fuel this huge engine of economic movement..You can utilize AI to build customer retention, NPS, sales close rate and pre-qualify leads. It's difficult to know where AI will be in 10 years or two. In any case, it's as of now playing a major role in many business' day to day activities. It can play a major, advantageous job in your business too, currently and in the future too. Let's look at how AI can be used by businesses..Data collection and Analysis.At the point when small enterprises approach advanced statistical tools, they can study their clients and find new ones. Take the case of regression analysis, which enables you to make connections between a wide cluster of factors and decide how they're affecting your business. From figuring out what keeps clients returning to your business to helping you find new market niches; AI is a flexible statistical tool..Artificial intelligence has additionally made it possible for small ventures to gather a lot of data in any case. From sentiment analysis to ML algorithms that track customer preferences and habits, organizations like Facebook enable organizations of all sizes to utilize chatbots, which depend on ML, ground-breaking data gathering systems are presently accessible to organizations large and small..Business Processes.Artificial Intelligence can build the effectiveness of an organization by taking care of business procedures, for example, workflows and supply chains. Fundamentally, you need them to do the truly difficult work and thorough analysis, distinguish the territories that need improvement. Toward the end, assets are utilized better meaning a decrease in losses and cost of production..As indicated by Forbes, organizations that integrate artificial intelligence into their business procedure management can possibly drop the utilization of materials utilized in assembling by 4% and increase productivity by 20%..Emotional Analysis.Emotional AI, otherwise called affective computing, is a cycle of AI equipped for recognizing human feelings and reacting to those feelings likewise. And keeping in mind that it's not impeccable yet, the innovation is amazing. One examination from the University of Ohio asserts that AI is currently greater at distinguishing feelings than people are – a noteworthy accomplishment considering a huge number of long stretches of advancement for that sort of thing. It is believed these emotionally smart bots can change your business tasks and just as Annette Zimmermann said in 2018 that by 2022, our personal device will know more about your emotional condition than your own family..Marketing with AI.From wiping out the requirement for employees to do mechanical assignments, for example, data preparation to cutting edge data analysis which is also referred to as the top future AI application, AI is on a very significant stage evolving marketing..This is similarly as valid for small ventures for what it's worth for the biggest organizations on the planet. While small companies used to be restricted to whatever advertisements they could bear the cost of in nearby markets, they currently can contact a tremendous group of audience on the web. They can utilize AI-based advertising platforms that have been created by enormous organizations like Facebook and Google to target explicit buyers who are open to their message. They can gather and analyze buyer information from numerous channels. What's more, they can do the majority of this without a multitude of marketers..Customer Support.Today, a lot of entrepreneurs are as of now utilizing chatbots to answer client queries 24 hours per day seven days a week. Clients are constantly fretful and consequently require full focus paying little heed to the point they are in their buying journey. Utilizing artificial intelligence would save time for your employees with the goal for them to deal with significant issues that expect human to human communication abilities. Moreover, artificial intelligence would cater to global customers who are out of your time zones as opposed to hanging tight for customer care operators to report to work for them to answer a question..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
