Today the word “Luddite” describes anyone who opposes technology. The Luddites were English weavers and textile workers who destroyed weaving machinery to protest the automation of jobs in the Industrial Revolution.
The CIO job is arguably to provide data, infrastructure and tools to increase the productivity of people. Innovative technology means changes in how people do those jobs. With disruptive innovations this often means job destruction.
People largely accept this because it feels like you cannot stop progress. But also, because there was a feeling that progress will create other, often better paying jobs and we tend to remain confident that we personally benefit from all the upheaval.
 
 
 













 
 

Artificial intelligence and an interconnected series of other automation technologies are going to put that confidence to the test. Machine learning, robotics, IoT sensors and self-driving vehicles are just some of the technologies that can accelerate the reduction of labor and effort, even among high paying white collar and technical jobs.

The World Economic Forum predicts that over 5 million jobs will be automated by 2020. Gartner Group recently announced that they expect five hundred thousand more jobs will be created than will be eliminated by that point. But this more optimistic view is still the minority prediction. Another group of experts believes that 40% of the world’s 500 biggest companies could disappear.
AI projects have all the traditional barriers that CIOs have faced with other technologies – resistance to change, immature, complex technology, trouble aligning requirements across the organization – but have the added challenge of remarkably bad press. How do CIOs get buy in from their partners across the enterprise if they become viewed as primarily focused on technology that will destroy jobs, albeit in the name of efficiency?
 
 
 













 
 

Expect resistance. If your corporate culture still equates career success and influence with the size of budgets and staff, then there will be people that won’t get on board. You will not win over everyone.
If AI is to develop further, investment will be needed…and that will have to come from increased profitability. Focus on revenue generating project and projects that improve efficiency of staff before painting a vision of empty offices.
Partner with human resources early and often
Access to top talent is as critical to AI success as with any other initiative that IT owns. But HR is also an essential partner in ensuring effective communication across the enterprise and to transition people between roles. Encourage staff and management goals that encourage efficiency, quality and profits. Mangers with goals that focus on effort instead of business outcomes are much more likely to resist new technology.
 
 
 













 
 

Partner with HR to evaluate how you eliminate jobs. AI has the potential to shift staffing strategies for many industries fundamentally and permanently. The cost benefits can be huge and long-term. Argue to proactively reinvest some of it back into retraining and outplacement programs. Argue for more generous severance programs. It will lengthen the period for a return on your AI investments, but argue for senior leadership to look at the big picture. Your organization if people view it as being sensitive to the human impact.
Be the evangelist
Adding to the problem, the AI industry is doing a terrible job of PR. There is no single, high-profile person driving the vision for the huge benefits we will get out of AI related technologies. Instead we have celebrities like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates expressing alarm and news stories in major media outlets that reference Skynet from the Terminator films.
Stories abound about AI improving everything from medical care to customer service. There are real benefits so highlight that. Transformation is not built on technology alone. It is built on shared vision and enthusiasm. The CIOs need to paint a picture that envisions this new world. Not only is this new world inevitable, but it is also massively beneficial.
 
 
 













 
 

Win over key influencers across the enterprise
Get buy-in in advance of initiative from business leaders and those with organizational influence. Enlist them to help you spread the word and set the tone. Understand their goals and listen for ways to demonstrate improvements that they value and will celebrate. Leave a positive impact on employees, by giving them new job opportunities.
Do not forget to engage managers and ensure they feel good about the initiatives. Their jobs are tough, and automation is a new set of tools that will help them to do those jobs better. By handing over their mundane jobs to AI can add quality to their lives.
Manage expectations
Expectation for AI are sky high. We still need to hit the Gartner “trough of disillusionment” where difficult reality makes public opinion turn pessimistic on a technology before it matures. There will be errors and mistakes and delays. Every complex initiative has them. Keep people focused on the vision and ensure your influencers stay in line. Communicate often and share the small victories. Promise progress not immediate revolutions.
 
 
 













 
 

Automation is transforming many parts of our world. It is necessary, and your organization needs to be a leader. But the path will be difficult and there will be a human toll. Stay focused on communicating with people and you can lead the way without creating that new generation of Luddites.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of work and organizations was a hot topic for visitors to MIT Sloan Management Review’s website in 2017. Although MIT SMR publishes content on a wide range of management topics, 25% of the 20 most-read pieces of new editorial content on the MIT SMR website in 2017 dealt with AI — including the most popular article from the magazine, the most popular report, and the most popular blog post.
But AI wasn’t the only subject on readers’ minds in 2017. Other widely read pieces of new content addressed timely issues like digital transformation and design thinking — as well as perennially important topics such as innovation, strategy execution, problem formulation, and negative emotions in the workplace.
1.	The Jobs That Artificial Intelligence Will Create
A study by Accenture predicts that several new categories of jobs will emerge as AI is deployed.
2.	Reshaping Business With Artificial Intelligence
This report from MIT Sloan Management Review and the Boston Consulting Group aims to present a realistic baseline that allows companies to compare their AI ambitions and efforts to those of other companies.
3.	Analytics as a Source of Business Innovation
This 2017 MIT Sloan Management Review report on data and analytics, which was sponsored by SAS, found that the percentage of companies deriving competitive advantage from analytics increased for the first time in four years.
4.	The Smart Way to Respond to Negative Emotions at Work
Many executives try to ignore negative emotions in their workplaces — but author Christine M. Pearson suggests that tactic can be counterproductive and costly.
5.	Achieving Digital Maturity
In this 2017 report on digital business, MIT SMR and Deloitte found that digitally maturing companies are achieving success by increasing collaboration, scaling innovation, and revamping their approach to talent.
6.	The Most Underrated Skill in Management
In this article, Nelson P. Repenning, Don Kieffer, and Todd Astor argue that there are few management skills more powerful than the discipline of clearly articulating the problem you seek to solve before jumping into action.
7.	How Big Data Is Empowering AI and Machine Learning at Scale
Big Data is powerful on its own, as is artificial intelligence. What happens when the two are merged?

AloneBy Andrew BurtJan. 4, 2018Share full articleRead in appCredit...Kiyoshi Ota/BloombergDecember was a big month for advocates of regulating artificial intelligence. First, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Future of A.I. Act, the first federal bill solely focused on A.I. It would create an advisory committee to make recommendations about A.I. — on topics including the technology’s effect on the American work force and strategies to protect the privacy rights of those it impacts. Then the New York City Council approved a first-of-its-kind bill that once signed into law will create a task force to examine its own use of automated decision systems, with the ultimate goal of making its use of algorithms fairer and more transparent.Perhaps not coincidentally, these efforts also overlap with increasing calls to regulate artificial intelligence along with claims by the likes of Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking that it poses a threat to humanity’s literal survival.But this push for broad legislation to regulate A.I. is premature.To begin with, even experts can’t agree on what, exactly, constitutes artificial intelligence. Take the recent report released by the AI Now Institute, aimed at creating a framework for ethically implementing A.I. While itself focused on A.I., the report also acknowledges that no commonly accepted definition of A.I. exists, which it describes loosely as “a broad assemblage of technologies … that have traditionally relied on human capacities.”“Artificial intelligence” is all too frequently used as a shorthand for software that simply does what humans used to do. But replacing human activity is precisely what new technologies accomplish — spears replaced clubs, wheels replaced feet, the printing press replaced scribes, and so on. What’s new about A.I. is that this technology isn’t simply replacing human activities, external to our bodies; it’s also replacing human decision-making, inside our minds.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe challenges created by this novelty should not obscure the fact that A.I. itself is not one technology, or even one singular development. Regulating an assemblage of technology we can’t clearly define is a recipe for poor laws and even worse technology.Indeed, the challenges A.I. poses aren’t entirely new. We’ve already successfully regulated it in the past — we just didn’t call it “artificial intelligence.” In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the financial industry began to rely on complex statistical modeling and huge computerized databases to make credit decisions, automating what had been a more manual process of approving or denying credit to borrowers.Those ethical and legal challenges associated with these models so captivated the public’s attention that in the summer of 1970, Newsweek ran a cover story titled “Is Privacy Dead?” detailing the “massive flanking attack” of computers on modern society. Growing awareness of that threat led to broad appeals that echo modern proposals to regulate A.I. “Eventually we have to set up an agency to regulate the computers,” Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina said in 1970.But instead of regulating all computers, the government sought a targeted approach tailored to specific problems, passing regulations like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1974. That act was meant to reduce credit discrimination against minority groups and to increase consumers’ ability to understand what the models were doing — if consumers didn’t like their credit score, thanks to the act they could at least know how it could be improved.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat law and others offer valuable lessons today, illustrating the importance of focusing on specific issues — in this case, transparency in credit decisions — and tailoring their solutions accordingly. Any regulation aimed at the range of systems we call “A.I.” should seek to be just as specific.With the thorny exception of cybersecurity, the way the United States regulatory system has approached information technology is arguably the most successful model for regulating technology in existence — fostering innovation while ensuring that the technology we use doesn’t break or seriously jeopardize our safety. The backbone of this approach comprises regulations tailored to the explicit problems created by any given technology.Within the United States’ vast framework of laws and regulatory agencies already lie answers to some of the most vexing challenges created by A.I. In the financial sector, for example, the Federal Reserve enforces a regulation called SR 11-7, which addresses the risks created by the complex algorithms used by today’s banks. SR 11-7’s solution to those challenges is called “effective challenge,” which seeks to embed critical analysis into every stage of an algorithm’s life cycle — from thoroughly examining the data used to train the algorithm to explicitly outlining the assumptions underlying the model, and more. While SR 11-7 is among the most detailed attempts at governing the challenges of complex algorithms, it’s also one of the most overlooked.This is not, of course, to suggest that artificial intelligence should never be regulated. But if the past is any guide, treating it as a collection of separate technologies, in separate sectors, is destined to be the most effective way to control the benefits it creates — and the dangers it poses.Andrew Burt is chief privacy officer and legal engineer at Immuta, a data management platform for data science, which enables companies to create and manage A.I. and machine learning models.

Let the robots have the damn jobs—all of them!

The past year was marked with increasing concerns about the effects artificial intelligence and automation will have on human employment and labor. Not a month goes by without one (or ten) articles warning about robots driving humans into unemployment and causing economic and social chaos.
But maybe we’re looking at things from the wrong perspective, through the lens of the laws that govern our current world. In a world where robots perform all tasks, many of the rules that we live by today might become obsolete. And it might not be such a bad thing.
RELATED: How artificial intelligence will disrupt the employment landscape
The value of human labor
In today’s world, we value most products (or services) by their scarcity and the human labor that goes into them. For instance, diamonds are scarce and that’s why they’re so expensive. But in most cases, we’re paying for the human labor that goes into creating goods and services. For example, when you buy grocery, you’re not paying for the scarcity of food. You pay for it because a lot of human labor goes into producing it, packaging it, transporting it and selling it to you in the store.
By human labor, I do not necessarily mean physical toil. It can also be cognitive functions. When you acquire a software or an online service, you pay for it because a lot of human labor goes into programming it and maintaining it. Those services in turn must pay for other services that support them and are running on human labor.
Each of us has a specific set of skills, which we sell to afford other people’s skills. For instance, I develop software and write articles to earn money and buy food and pay the rent. These activities account for a considerable part of our everyday lives. We’re still in a better situation than our ancestors, who had to spend the entire day hunting for food.

With artificial intelligence and machine learning earning a more prominent role in every industry and domain, the need for human labor, both physical and cognitive, is dwindling. Self-driving trucks will eventually replace truck drivers, and smart vending machines fast food workers. Robots can flip burgers just as well as cooks and harvest crops better than field workers. Amazon’s automated retail store will obviate the need for cashiers, and smart drone deliveries might even make stores excessive. Even doctors, lawyers and news reporters can someday surrender their professions (or a large part of it) to artificial intelligence. We’re already seeing the glimmers of AI algorithms that create their own AI. Maybe one day, even AI researchers will go extinct.
In every case, we can expect robots to perform faster, better and cheaper than humans. They can work for longer periods (sometimes incessantly), improve their skills over time, and pass on their experience to their peers in real time.
RELATED: IoT and machine learning are invading our lives. Is it a good thing?
As automation removes humans from the loop, the costs for human labor will gradually fade. A transportation company doesn’t need to pay its self-driving trucks as it used to do its truck drivers. However, it must pay for their maintenance (which still costs less) because the task still involves human labor. That too will cost next to nothing once the development and maintenance of the trucks and their AI software becomes automated as well. The same goes for everything else.
What happens to all the humans?
Eventually, we’ll achieve a self-sustaining economy, where AI and robots perform absolutely every task and there’s zero-need for human labor. Without humans slowing down the process, AI will be able to find better ways to optimize and speed up production. We can already see how internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence can deal with the planet’s food scarcity problem or make healthcare accessible to more people across the world.

In a fully-automated economy, the cost of living will drop to zero. Money will likely lose its value and raison d’être. What will we do with our 9-5 time then? There are fears that with no tasks left for humans, we’ll have no purpose in life. They’re wrong. In fact, when we no longer worry about putting food on the table, we’ll be able to discover the true meaning of being human.
Some things can never be automated. AI might be able to create art and music that rivals or outperforms that of human artists. But we humans often find attachments to the humans behind those creations rather than the creations themselves. A robot athlete might be better than any human alive, but we like athletes because of their personal struggles, their lives, and how they achieve their perfection through their toil, not how much they score on the field.
We will have plenty of time and opportunity to manifest our creative side, to socialize, to interact with other humans as human beings. We will have no reason to try to make profit off each other, to wage wars over natural resources and wealth. Humanity will thrive when robots take all the jobs.
As DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says, “If AI can help us as a society to not only save the environment, cure disease and explore the universe, but also better understand ourselves — well, that may prove one of the greatest discoveries of them all.”
RELATED: The future of artificial intelligence
The transition can be painful
While the fully-automated economy can perfectly provide the Utopia we deserve, one problem remains. Before we reach the final stage, there will be a period where jobs will become scarce yet not disappear altogether. This means that, while minimal, the costs of life will remain, while without jobs, people won’t be able to pay for those costs.
The fears from automation are rooted in the fact that without jobs, humans won’t be able to afford their lives. It can lead to a spike in inequality. The companies who will drive innovations in artificial intelligence will own the robots and the wealth and the entire economy, while the rest of the population will spiral into poverty and unemployment.
Those fears are well placed. If things go wrong, that’s exactly one of the ways events can unfold, especially if big tech companies will continue the greedy trend of hoarding wealth and making money for the sake of making more money. That will lead to chaos, strife and eventually, their own undoing.

There are several ways we can deal with the troubles that lie ahead during the transition to full automation. Some experts and companies are exploring basic income, the centuries-old idea of giving unconditional money to all citizens, enough for them to live their lives. Other thought leaders such as Bill Gates are proposing robot taxes, where companies that use automation pay certain fees for the jobs they take away from humans. Other solutions might emerge.
Automation will continue to move forward at an accelerating pace. We don’t need to fear about the destination. Instead, we must prepare ourselves for the rocky road ahead. I’m not worried about the robots taking all the jobs. I’m worried about them leaving some to the humans.

When Will We Finally Achieve True Artificial Intelligence?



By Thomas Hornigold
January 1, 2018 







The field of artificial intelligence goes back a long way, but many consider it was officially born when a group of scientists at Dartmouth College got together for a summer, back in 1956. Computers had, over the last few decades, come on in incredible leaps and bounds; they could now perform calculations far faster than humans. Optimism, given the incredible progress that had been made, was rational. Genius computer scientist Alan Turing had already mooted the idea of thinking machines just a few years before. The scientists had a fairly simple idea: intelligence is, after all, just a mathematical process. The human brain was a type of machine. Pick apart that process, and you can make a machine simulate it.
The problem didn’t seem too hard: the Dartmouth scientists wrote, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.” This research proposal, by the way, contains one of the earliest uses of the term artificial intelligence. They had a number of ideas—maybe simulating the human brain’s pattern of neurons could work and teaching machines the abstract rules of human language would be important.
The scientists were optimistic, and their efforts were rewarded. Before too long, they had computer programs that seemed to understand human language and could solve algebra problems. People were confidently predicting there would be a human-level intelligent machine built within, oh, let’s say, the next twenty years.
It’s fitting that the industry of predicting when we’d have human-level intelligent AI was born at around the same time as the AI industry itself. In fact, it goes all the way back to Turing’s first paper on “thinking machines,” where he predicted that the Turing Test—machines that could convince humans they were human—would be passed in 50 years, by 2000. Nowadays, of course, people are still predicting it will happen within the next 20 years, perhaps most famously Ray Kurzweil. There are so many different surveys of experts and analyses that you almost wonder if AI researchers aren’t tempted to come up with an auto reply: “I’ve already predicted what your question will be, and no, I can’t really predict that.”
The issue with trying to predict the exact date of human-level AI is that we don’t know how far is left to go. This is unlike Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law, the doubling of processing power roughly every couple of years, makes a very concrete prediction about a very specific phenomenon. We understand roughly how to get there—improved engineering of silicon wafers—and we know we’re not at the fundamental limits of our current approach (at least, not until you’re trying to work on chips at the atomic scale). You cannot say the same about artificial intelligence.
Common Mistakes
Stuart Armstrong’s survey looked for trends in these predictions. Specifically, there were two major cognitive biases he was looking for. The first was the idea that AI experts predict true AI will arrive (and make them immortal) conveniently just before they’d be due to die. This is the “Rapture of the Nerds” criticism people have leveled at Kurzweil—his predictions are motivated by fear of death, desire for immortality, and are fundamentally irrational. The ability to create a superintelligence is taken as an article of faith. There are also criticisms by people working in the AI field who know first-hand the frustrations and limitations of today’s AI.
The second was the idea that people always pick a time span of 15 to 20 years. That’s enough to convince people they’re working on something that could prove revolutionary very soon (people are less impressed by efforts that will lead to tangible results centuries down the line), but not enough for you to be embarrassingly proved wrong. Of the two, Armstrong found more evidence for the second one—people were perfectly happy to predict AI after they died, although most didn’t, but there was a clear bias towards “15–20 years from now” in predictions throughout history.
Measuring Progress
Armstrong points out that, if you want to assess the validity of a specific prediction, there are plenty of parameters you can look at. For example, the idea that human-level intelligence will be developed by simulating the human brain does at least give you a clear pathway that allows you to assess progress. Every time we get a more detailed map of the brain, or successfully simulate another part of it, we can tell that we are progressing towards this eventual goal, which will presumably end in human-level AI. We may not be 20 years away on that path, but at least you can scientifically evaluate the progress.
Compare this to those that say AI, or else consciousness, will “emerge” if a network is sufficiently complex, given enough processing power. This might be how we imagine human intelligence and consciousness emerged during evolution—although evolution had billions of years, not just decades. The issue with this is that we have no empirical evidence: we have never seen consciousness manifest itself out of a complex network. Not only do we not know if this is possible, we cannot know how far away we are from reaching this, as we can’t even measure progress along the way.
There is an immense difficulty in understanding which tasks are hard, which has continued from the birth of AI to the present day. Just look at that original research proposal, where understanding human language, randomness and creativity, and self-improvement are all mentioned in the same breath. We have great natural language processing, but do our computers understand what they’re processing? We have AI that can randomly vary to be “creative,” but is it creative? Exponential self-improvement of the kind the singularity often relies on seems far away.
We also struggle to understand what’s meant by intelligence. For example, AI experts consistently underestimated the ability of AI to play Go. Many thought, in 2015, it would take until 2027. In the end, it took two years, not twelve. But does that mean AI is any closer to being able to write the Great American Novel, say? Does it mean it’s any closer to conceptually understanding the world around it? Does it mean that it’s any closer to human-level intelligence? That’s not necessarily clear.
Not Human, But Smarter Than Humans
But perhaps we’ve been looking at the wrong problem. For example, the Turing test has not yet been passed in the sense that AI cannot convince people it’s human in conversation; but of course the calculating ability, and perhaps soon the ability to perform other tasks like pattern recognition and driving cars, far exceed human levels. As “weak” AI algorithms make more decisions, and Internet of Things evangelists and tech optimists seek to find more ways to feed more data into more algorithms, the impact on society from this “artificial intelligence” can only grow.
It may be that we don’t yet have the mechanism for human-level intelligence, but it’s also true that we don’t know how far we can go with the current generation of algorithms. Those scary surveys that state automation will disrupt society and change it in fundamental ways don’t rely on nearly as many assumptions about some nebulous superintelligence.
Then there are those that point out we should be worried about AI for other reasons. Just because we can’t say for sure if human-level AI will arrive this century, or never, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t prepare for the possibility that the optimistic predictors could be correct. We need to ensure that human values are programmed into these algorithms, so that they understand the value of human life and can act in “moral, responsible” ways.
Phil Torres, at the Project for Future Human Flourishing, expressed it well in an interview with me. He points out that if we suddenly decided, as a society, that we had to solve the problem of morality—determine what was right and wrong and feed it into a machine—in the next twenty years…would we even be able to do it?
So, we should take predictions with a grain of salt. Remember, it turned out the problems the AI pioneers foresaw were far more complicated than they anticipated. The same could be true today. At the same time, we cannot be unprepared. We should understand the risks and take our precautions. When those scientists met in Dartmouth in 1956, they had no idea of the vast, foggy terrain before them. Sixty years later, we still don’t know how much further there is to go, or how far we can go. But we’re going somewhere.

Or even perhaps an entirely new career? With the progress in the field of machine learning and automation in 2017, you could be forgiven for some concern over what new work you might do and whether those jobs will be automated by the time you are qualified.Fear of automation is not new. The industrial revolution took away people’s jobs, with the luddites famously destroying machines to protect human work. Automation happened, people lost jobs, new jobs were created (often higher paid jobs) and aside from a difficult transitionary period, things got better.The same thing is happening today. Machine learning and robotics are finding better or cheaper ways of doing the same things humans are employed to do in various areas. As this happens, we can move human workers to different roles. Again, as with the industrial revolution, the transitionary period is unlikely to be pain-free, with people needing re-training and time taken for new roles to be invented for the newly available workforce. If anything, it’s happening faster today so the transition may be even more painful than before.Trending AI Articles:1. TOP 100 medium articles related with Artificial Intelligence2.

How I used machine learning as inspiration for physical paintingsWhat would happen though if we were to create an artificial general intelligence? A machine which is at least as good as a human in everything we can do? Provided it can do the same things as a human at a lower cost, free market economics will essentially guarantee that all jobs go to AI. The issue only gets worse if we explore the possibility of Super Intelligence, an AI which is orders of magnitude better than a human at everything we can do. Provided the cost doesn’t go up proportionally with ability, it would seem we mere humans would be in a pretty bad place. But this is a guide about how to guarantee your job well into the future! So, what should you be doing?Lying— Legislation like the rapidly approaching GDPR regulation mandates a ‘right to explanation’. This regulation demands that machines explain the thought process behind any decision they have made, and that the people designing these systems must ensure they are able to explain their thought processes quickly and honestly. Humans on the other hand have been lying to each other for millennia. Long after machines are banned from lying to humans, humans may continue lying to one another.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–95%Killing — Like international bans on chemical and biological weapons, I believe we are headed towards an international agreement banning the use of lethal autonomous weapons. While I don’t doubt that machine could be very good at killing humans, probably fulfilling the ‘faster, better, cheaper’ criteria, we have too many ethical hang-ups about directly delegating the power over which humans live and die to allow lethal autonomous machines. There has been a market for killing other humans since society began. Perhaps an AI government would establish world peace, but if historical evidence is anything to go by the market will remain well into the future.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–80%Doing things badly — There’s still some chance that people will prefer to build human made products for emotional reasons. People have long chosen artisanal processes over factory based mass production for the sense of occasion or story they associate with a handmade product. Swiss watches are a great example. They command a high price, they’ve very difficult to make, go wrong often and have in all technical regards been superseded by quartz watches.

There is still some risk with this type of work, as a general or super intelligence can do everything a human can, and possibly do it a lot better than us. That might include making desirable and charming mistakes that humans love, or even making an artificial back story which resonates with us better than any genuine human one.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–50%So, there you go.

In Memoriam: Charles Rich, Computer Science Professor and Artificial Intelligence Pioneer







January 04, 2018



Charles Rich, professor of computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction, died Jan. 3.
Rich, who was also affiliated with the university’s Interactive Media and Game Development, Learning Sciences and Technologies, and Robotics Engineering programs, joined the WPI faculty in 2007 having already earned widespread recognition for his work in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and human-computer interaction, particularly as a principal research scientist at MIT and a founding member and distinguished scientist at the Mitsubishi Electronic Research Laboratories (MERL).
“At WPI Chuck not only built upon his many professional accomplishments to continue impactful research,” said Craig Wills, professor and head of the Department of Computer Science, “but he had a tremendously positive influence on the students and faculty within Computer Science and IMGD as a teacher, mentor, and colleague.”
In his work with computers and robots, Rich pursued the goal of improving our interactions with technology of all kinds by making them more intuitive, natural, and productive. Motivated in part by images in science fiction of intelligent assistants and companions that could simplify and enrich our lives, he hoped to enhance our experiences with everything from robot helpers to online learning programs.
“If human-like robots are ever going to move freely among us in a broad range of situations (assisting the handicapped and elderly, conducting search-and-rescue operations, or playing roles in sales and entertainment),” he wrote in a research highlight for the National Science Foundation (NSF) website, “we will need to do more than make them safer; we will need to understand how to program them to collaborate with us smoothly and naturally.”
After earning a BASc in engineering science at the University of Toronto and an SM and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, Rich joined the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory as a research scientist in 1980. At MIT, he founded and directed the Programmer’s Apprentice project, which aimed to develop a theory of “how expert programmers analyze, synthesize, modify, explain, specify, verify, and document programs,” according to a research overview he co-authored in 1993. “This research goal overlaps both artificial intelligence and software engineering.”
In 1991, Rich joined the staff of MERL, the North American subsidiary of the corporate research and development organization of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Located in Cambridge, MERL conducted research in a wide range of fields within electronics and information technology. Rich and his wife, Candace Sidner, a research professor in computer science at WPI, worked in the area of collaborative agents. Their aim was to develop intelligent agents that could provide a unified conversational interface for all the appliances in a home.
As part of that project, Rich and Sidner created a software platform called COLLAGEN, an application-independent collaboration manager. The platform, which has had an important influence on subsequent work in dialogue processing, was used to develop a number of collaborative agents, including DiamondHelp, a finalist in two design competitions in 2005.
In a 1998 paper in the journal User Modeling and User-Adapter Interaction, Rich and Sidner talked about the principles that guided the development of COLLAGEN. “Our most fundamental underlying assumption is that a human-computer interface based on familiar human discourse rules and conventions will be easier for people to learn and use than one that is not,” they wrote. “Although we cannot yet confirm this assumption by our own empirical studies, we are encouraged by an analogy with the direct-manipulation paradigm for graphical user interfaces, whose success we believe is due, in large part, to users’ familiarity with the rules and conventions of object manipulation in everyday life.”

At WPI, Rich continued to explore his interest in collaborative and conversational agents. In a 2008 essay in WPI’s research magazine, he described an NSF-funded project in which he explored techniques for helping robots work more effectively with humans by emulating human verbal and nonverbal communications. The research made use of a humanoid robot named Melvin, which Rich helped design while at MERL. With a moveable head and arms and an expressive face, Melvin became a platform for a wide range of research and undergraduate projects at WPI on human-robot collaboration.
In “Robots and Avatars as Hosts, Advisors, Companions, and Jesters,” a 2009 article in AI Magazine, Rich and Sidner surveyed the state of research on the use of AI to create intelligent human companions, focusing, in the conclusion, on one promising application. “Obviously, as robots become able to use their hands and arms safely in close proximity to humans, many physically assistive applications, such as helping the elderly, will become feasible. Furthermore, as compared to the partially competing approach of ubiquitous computing, in which the entire environment is instrumented and automated, a humanoid robot can also offer companionship (emotion and social relationship). Evidence already suggests that people respond positively to such robots.”
With funding from the NSF, Rich and Sidner set out to fulfil that promise by building virtual agents that can serve as companions for the elderly in their homes. These “always on” agents were designed to be available around the clock to provide support and friendship while also promoting healthy behaviors. One agent, named Karen, evolved from a graphical interface on a computer screen to a small robot. It was designed to learn from its interactions with its human companion and anticipate his or her needs “Karen is much more than a simple stimulus-response system,” Rich said. “She has long-term goals for the relationship and a memory of past activities, and she can plan for the future.”
A senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Rich was honored for his early work in artificial intelligence by being elected a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1992.
He was the co-author, with Richard Waters, of Readings in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (Morgan Kaufmann, 1986) and The Programmer’s Apprentice (Addison-Wesley, 1990). He held four patents, including one for systems for collaborative interfaces (with Candace Sidner) and over 70 refereed journal and magazine articles and conference presentations. He served as chair of the 1992 International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, co-chaired the 1998 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 2010 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, and was program co-chair of the 2011 International Conference on the Foundation of Digital Games.
In addition to his prolific accomplishments as a researcher, Rich was known as an excellent classroom instructor who pioneered a number of new courses at WPI, including “Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Media and Games” and “Serious Games.” He was also a valued mentor who supervised or advised more than 30 graduate students at WPI and MIT and served as a faculty advisor for more than a dozen undergraduate Major Qualifying Projects.
Michael Gennert, professor of computer science and former director of the Robotics Engineering Program, says he will remember Rich for his “exuberant personality and playful attitude, which had a wonderful effect on everyone he met. He also had keen insight and boundless curiosity. You could always count on Chuck to ask a profound question at any CS colloquium, whether it was in his research area or not.”
In his profile on the WPI website, Rich offered a glimpse of what motivated his research and his on-going quest to develop computers and robots that can work collaboratively and intelligently with people. “What gets me out of bed in the morning,” he wrote, “is the hope that I will one day interact with a true artificial intelligence and the belief that part of what I will do today contributes to that goal.”
Funeral services will be held on Monday, Jan. 8, at 10 a.m. at the Wilson Chapel at the Andover Newton Theological School, 234 Herrick Road, Newton, MA 02459. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

12 mind-blowing AI advances and 12 critical takeaways to put AI in perspective by Thomas Frey | Jan 3, 2018 | Artificial Intelligence


 It was rare to find a tech columnist last year that didn’t make some reference to artificial intelligence. But it was also rare to find a writer who could clearly differentiate between the hype and true relevance of these accomplishments.
Keep in mind, even after decades of tech progress, we still get lost with our GPS, our digitally translated documents are often unreadable, and our smartphones still drop calls.
Even relatively simple computational tasks like scanning documents with optical character recognition is still not 100% accurate.
Still, many well meaning thought leaders have issued impassioned warnings of the dangers of general AI, which is not anywhere in sight. This does not mean we are without danger, just not that kind of danger. Not yet.
Perhaps the earliest dangers will come on the job front. The efficiencies that AI gives us will eliminate the need for many tasks, and even though many will be tedious jobs, working in undesirable conditions that few can point to as their dream position, they do serve as a current basis for employment, affecting countless lives.
At the same time, few jobs are truly secure with most continually morphing along with their industries. 70% of the tasks software engineers did in 2000 didn’t even exist in 1990.
Farmers, switchboard operators, and assembly-line workers in the 20th century were replaced by computer specialists, accountants, and dental hygienists. Over the coming decades we’ll see drone command center operators, data optimizers, experience designers, and other jobs that we can’t yet imagine.
Millions of unemployed workers will need to be retrained, but we don’t have a great track record here. With the vast majority of higher ed money going to colleges, the U.S. government spends a smaller share of resources on retraining than all but two other OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.

12 mind-blowing advances made by AI
It’s important to consider the dishwasher analogy. While dishwashers do offer significant efficiencies, their role in the average household is quite different than what was originally intended. In addition to being dishwashing machines, they provide an out-of-sight staging area for dirty dishes and a higher bar for all-around kitchen cleanliness.
With AI, rather than witnessing a mass elimination of jobs, we will likely see a higher bar – more thorough analysis, more control, and more certainty in the way jobs are performed.
With that in mind, here are some of the mind-blowing advances made by AI over the past year.
1. Self-taught AI beats doctors at predicting heart attacks
As most doctors will tell you, our tools for predicting a patient’s health are no match for the complexity of the human body. Heart attacks are particularly hard to anticipate. Stephen Weng, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom showed that computers capable of teaching themselves perform far better than established medical processes, significantly increasing prediction rates. Once implemented, the new method will save thousands, perhaps even millions of lives a year.
2. NASA uses A.I. to discover of two new planets
Scanning space is intensely boring work. For this reason, NASA tried a new approach and used machine learning to discover two new planets. Working with old data from the Kepler space telescope, it was able to locate two new additions to our galaxy. This wasn’t the first time researchers applied AI to sift through the massive amount of data NASA’s telescopes collect, but it is a promising example of how neural networks can leverage even some of the weakest signs of distant worlds. Thanks to AI, NASA discovered a whole new planetary system.
3. AI is learning what makes you cry at the movies
AI is no expert at human emotions, but some visionary filmmakers have found a way to use it to gain insights on how to increase a story’s emotional pull. Through this process they were able to identify musical scores or visual images that help trigger the right feelings at the right time! In the storytelling industry, understanding the cause and effect relationships between stimuli triggers and human reactions is a powerful tool.
4. Using AI to converts images of food into a list of ingredients
Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed an AI algorithm to analyze food photos and match them with a list of ingredients and recipes. Starting with more than a million annotated recipes from online sites, their neural network sifted through each list of ingredients and a number of images associated with it. In the future, this kind of tool will help people learn to cook, count calories, and track our eating habits.
5. Amazon develops an AI fashion designer
Amazon has developed an algorithm that can design clothing by analyzing a series of images, copying the style, and then apply it to new garments generated from scratch. In-house researchers are working on several machine-learning systems that will help provide an edge when it comes to spotting, reacting to, and perhaps even shaping new fashion trends. Since Amazon has stated, they want to become “the best place to buy fashion online,” this seems like a logical move.
6. Resistbot, an ingenious AI chatbot will contact lawmakers for you
If you’re looking for a more efficient way for your voice to be heard, pay close attention to Resistbot. This AI-powered chatbot makes it easy to contact your political representatives. Users simply text the word “resist” to 50409. The automated bot will ask for a name and zip code to determine which public officials to contact. Since users create their own messages, creativity and clarity are critical for this service that pride’s itself on avoiding standard “form letters.”
7. China is using AI to predict who will commit crime next
Taking a page out of the movie “Minority Report,” China is developing predictive analytics to help authorities stop suspects before a crime is committed. With their unchecked access to citizens’ histories, Chinese tech companies are helping police develop artificial intelligence they say will help them identify and apprehend suspects before criminal acts are committed. By tapping into facial recognition tech, and combining it with predictive intelligence, they hope to notify police of potential criminals based on their behavior patterns. Even though it sounds like promising tech, applications like this are getting tons of scrutiny.
8. AI beats world’s top poker players
Humankind has just been beaten at yet another game, this time Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold’em poker. Since poker is a game of uncertainty, players don’t know what cards the other players have or what cards will be dealt in the future. In a game like chess or Go, all players can see the board, meaning that everyone has complete information. This makes chess and Go much easier to program than poker. Poker also requires understanding the psychology of the other players – are they bluffing, should I fold, or should I bluff? Poker also involves betting – when should I bet, how much should I bet? Does this mean the gambling industry is doomed?
9. Researchers create a lip-reading A.I.
If you wonder why NFL coaches are now covering their mouths when they talk into their microphones, it’s because someone or something might be reading their lips. Working with Google’s Deep Mind neural network, researchers developed an elaborate training process using thousands of hours of subtitled BBC television videos. The videos showed a broad spectrum of people speaking in a wide variety of poses, activities, and lighting to simulate real life conditions. While still not perfect, their algorithm achieved promising results.
10. ‘Mind reading’ AI is able to scan brains and guess what you’re thinking
Carnegie Mellon University scientists have developed a system that can read complex thoughts based on brain scans, even interpreting complete sentences. Using data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, the team was able to demonstrate different brain activations being triggered according to 240 complex events, ranging from individuals and settings to types of social interaction and physical actions. Using the smart algorithms they developed, the team was able to discern a person’s thoughts with 87% accuracy.
11. AI learns to write its own code by stealing from other programs
A team of researchers at Microsoft and the University of Cambridge created a system called DeepCoder for solving coding challenges like those used in most programming competitions. Without teaching it how to code, DeepCoder uses a technique called program synthesis to piece together lines of code taken from existing software, similar to what most programmer do. Framing the outcome around a list of inputs and outputs for each section of code, DeepCoder learned which pieces of code were needed to achieve the desired results.
12. Google’s AI was used to build it’s own AI, and it outperformed those made by humans
The creation of an AI capable of building its own AI does raise more than a few concerns. For instance, what’s to prevent the parent from passing down unwanted biases to its child? What if it creates systems so fast that society can’t keep up? It’s not very difficult to see how it could be employed in automated surveillance systems in the near future, perhaps even sooner than regulators could put something in place to control such systems. 
12 critical takeaways to put AI in perspective
After scanning through each of these accomplishments, it’s easy to assume that AI is right around the corner. But a successful experiment does not a finished product make.
We are very much in the primitive early stages of AI. People in the future will often look back shaking their heads saying, “what were they thinking?”
Here are some important takeaways to help sort the reality from the hype.
A. AI is based on algorithms
Even though today’s AI’s algorithms are very sophisticated, giving them the appearance of “humanness,” they’re still only fallible machines.
B. AI skills will be developed in a fraction of the time of human skills
Go-master Lee Sedol began serious training when he was 8 years old for 12 hours a day. In just a few days, AlphaGo reviewed over 30 million human games and played an additional 30 million practice games with itself before taking on Lee Sedol. That means AlphaGo received at least 500 times as much practice as Lee to win the competition.
C. There’s no such thing as a perfect AI solution
Researchers have had much more success tailoring individual AI systems to specific problems than building a logic machine capable of general intelligence. Just as AlphaGo could never be used to pilot a driverless car, AI algorithms are designed to work on specific problems.
D. AI is forcing us to rethink what it is that makes us human
We live in a very human-centric world. Human need is what creates our global economy. There is generally no economy for things that do not benefit humankind. But what is it that sets us apart from AI and the machines that use it? We’re still a long ways from understanding where AI capabilities end and uniquely-human skills begin.
E. As AI grows progressively ubiquitous, it’ll become increasingly invisible
AI will touch virtually every aspect of our lives, finding its way into our cars, TVs, phones, lighting, and music. With this level of ubiquity, we will quickly lose our reference points as to what life was like before AI.
F. As we become more reliant on automation we will experience a degrading of skills and readiness when things go wrong
And yes, something will always go wrong, eventually!
G. Blind faith in technology will cause blindness to danger as well
Once something works well, we begin to trust and rely on it. However, there is no perfect technology and the complexity of AI will make the true danger of hidden flaws nearly undetectable until it is too late.
H. Artificial intelligence can never achieve 100% accuracy
It may indeed be quantum leaps better than anything we’re using today, even surpassing six-sigma reliability, but 100% is still not possible.
I. The greatest dangers associated with AI will involve human failure
Sometimes the danger will stem from human ignorance, lack of oversight, or poor monitoring, but we must be constantly vigilant when it comes to spotting the purposeful failures that nefarious coders bury deep within a system.
J. Businesses that become over-reliant on AI will fail
Admittedly there is a fine line between being over-reliant and not-reliant-enough, but hard lessons will be learned by those who fail to employ the proper checks and balance systems to oversee their AI operations.
K. Human-based common sense will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future
Humans will continue to surpass machines for some time in areas like appreciating contextual nuances, weaving together disparate ideas, comprehending human motive and intent, integrating interdisciplinary conceptions of the world, and general intelligence. AI is simply not at our level yet.
L. AI will soon prove to be just as good at job creation as it is at job destruction
There are currently 1 million truck drivers in the U.S., earning on average $21 an hour. It’s hard to imagine a future where those numbers don’t dwindle. But that’s only half of the story. Properly directed, AI will be able to tell us where humans are most needed in every system, process, and business operation. But beyond that, AI will be able to roadmap emerging technologies and identify the skills needed for new positions months if not years before the openings occur.
Final Thoughts
Every new technology brings its own set of dangers, and AI is no different. However, with this level of complexity, the types of danger become exponentially more difficult to understand.
It’s important to understand the symbiotic relationship, if the human economy collapses, so will the AI economy.
While we’re not going to let the bots take over just yet, it’s clear that bots are going to be meeting many of our needs, offering proactive advice, and serving us in favorable ways. Since the best possible interfaces come from the inside out, working with AI will be far less about us trying to understand the technology and far more about technology trying to understand us.
Over the past decade, the digital revolution was about us becoming accustomed to using computers all day, sending texts, connecting with each others over social media, and even learning to code.
In the AI era, technology will slide further behind the curtain into more of an assistive role, one that is not meant to be all about shiny new gadgets and operating system updates. Over time, the gadget craze will subside, as we shift our collective attention to rethinking the human experience.

    The elephant’s new protector is PAWS, a machine-⁠learning and game-theory system that predicts where poachers are likely to strikeJean Kumagai06 Jan 20184 min read 1

    Every year, poachers kill about 27,000 African elephants—an astounding 8 percent of the population. If current trends continue, these magnificent animals could be gone within a decade.The solution, of course, is to stop poachers before they strike, but how to do that has long confounded authorities. In protected areas like wildlife preserves, elephants and other endangered animals may roam far and wide, while rangers can patrol only a small area at any time. “It’s a two-part problem,” explains Milind Tambe, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. “Can you predict where poaching will happen? And can you [target] your patrols so that they’re unpredictable, so that the poachers don’t know the rangers are coming?”To solve both parts of the problem, Tambe and his team created an artificial-intelligence system called PAWS, which stands for Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security. A machine-learning algorithm uses data from past patrols to predict where poaching is likely to occur in the future. And a game-theory model helps generate randomized, unpredictable patrol routes. The system has been field-tested in Uganda and Malaysia with good results, and in 2018 its use will expand to China and Cambodia. In addition, Tambe says, the PAWS system could soon be integrated into an existing tracking tool called SMART, which wildlife conservation agencies have deployed at most sites worldwide to collect and manage patrol data.In a one-month trial with the Wildlife Conservation Society in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park, rangers patrolled two areas that they rarely visited but that PAWS indicated had a high probability of poaching. Much to the rangers’ surprise, they found numerous snares and other signs of illegal activity. A later 8-month trial looked at the entire park. Again, the patrols verified the model’s predictions: In the high-probability areas, they found about 10 times as much poaching as in the low-probability areas. A new trial in Uganda’s Murchison Falls National Park is checking whether PAWS will work equally well in a different location.Video: A.J.Plumptre/Wildlife Conservation SocietyAndrew Plumptre, director of science for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa program, is collaborating with Tambe’s group on the Uganda field trials. He says that on normal patrols, rangers enter data about what they’re seeing, using a smartphone app called Cybertracker. About once a month, that data gets uploaded to SMART. “You’re able to map where patrols have searched, where they found snares and carcasses of elephants and whatever,” says Plumptre. “But there’s nothing proactive about it. Ranger patrols alone aren’t sufficient to stop poaching.” He’s hoping that PAWS’s predictive abilities will make those patrols as efficient and effective as possible.The PAWS system grew out of work Tambe and his students started doing more than a decade ago for port, airport, and airline security. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department have all deployed AI systems developed by Tambe’s group. And he cofounded Avata Intelligence, in Venice, Calif., to commercialize this research.About six or seven years ago, Tambe was at a World Bank meeting and saw a talk on the dire plight of tigers, fewer than 4,000 of which survive in the wild. “I guess I’d heard about such things, but I never appreciated the scope of the problem. I suddenly realized the potential of AI to help,” Tambe says. He quickly got in touch with conservation groups.Fei Fang, a former student of Tambe’s who is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, had worked on a Coast Guard system to protect the Staten Island Ferry, in New York City, before turning to PAWS. The two scenarios are similar, she notes. “There is a defender, which is the wildlife ranger or the Coast Guard, and there is an attacker, which is a poacher or a terrorist, and they’re interacting with each other in a way that you’re trying to predict.”Predictive Patrols: Fei Fang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon, shows off a tiger snare discovered in a wildlife preserve in northeast China. Fang and Milind Tambe of the University of Southern California developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict where poachers are most active.Photo: Yongchao JingFor the PAWS team, the field trials drove home an important reality of wilderness policing: The world is not flat. When the team began working in Malaysia, Fang says, they didn’t factor in the densely forested, mountainous terrain. “In our first model, we took a map, divided the whole area into grid cells, drew a line on the grid, and said, ‘Patrollers, please follow this line,’ ” she recalls. “We’d have Skype calls with them, and they’d tell us: ‘No, no, no, this is not going to work.’ We didn’t understand.”Only when the PAWS team visited the Malaysian reserve did they get it. “We walked the route with the rangers, and it took us about 8 hours to go a couple miles,” Fang says. A subsequent refinement of PAWS takes into account geographical features that are easy to walk on, like ridge lines, streambeds, and old logging trails. “We built a virtual street map for the conservation area and then plotted routes based on the map.” Patrollers following the new routes found “all kinds of signs of animal and human activity,” Fang says.At press time, Fang was in the midst of a three-month field trial of PAWS in northeast China with the World Wildlife Fund, where the animal of greatest concern is the Siberian tiger. Fang says one enhancement they’re working on is to help rangers make decisions while on patrol. “They may see footprints and tree marks, which indicate the direction the poachers are heading,” she says. “And they need to decide, Should I chase the poachers? What is the best strategy for changing plans if they see new information?”Tambe and Fang are also collaborating with a wildlife conservation service called Air Shepherd, which uses drones equipped with infrared cameras to search for poachers at night. Their AI-based video-analysis system is automating what is otherwise a tedious and difficult task for humans: reviewing hours and hours of grainy black-and-white footage and then alerting rangers when illegal activity is detected.The next step for PAWS is to make it available to other NGOs, ideally by integrating the algorithm into existing tools, like Cybertracker and the SMART system. “We’re probably never going to completely stop poaching,” says Plumptre. “But we can get it down to a lower level, so that populations don’t decline.”AI is usually applied to problems of modern technology, Tambe notes, but this work is different. “We’re using AI to save the natural world—these stunning landscapes and animals that we hope won’t disappear,” he says. “These are important treasures.”From Your Site ArticlesAI Is Helping to Stop Animal Poaching and Food Insecurity ›",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://assets.rbl.ms/25584746/origin.jpg,"{'@id': 'https://spectrum.ieee.org/this-ai-hunts-poachers', '@type': 'WebPage'}",https://spectrum.ieee.org/this-ai-hunts-poachers,"{'@type': 'Person', 'description': ""Jean Kumagai is the Executive Editor at IEEE Spectrum .

Technological advances associated with the fourth industrial revolution – including artificial intelligence – allow the automation of an increasingly wide array of processes in increasingly interactive and sophisticated ways. These advances will likely give rise to many opportunities for economic and social development in developing countries, for instance by increasing food production.
But the new technologies also involve important risks, which have special significance in developing countries. They may build upon and exacerbate existing inequalities – both within developing countries as well as between developing and more developed regions. 
Three of these inter-related risks are worsening unemployment, increasing concentration of economic power and wealth, and the spread of biases in influential algorithms. They will manifest in different ways and require different responses in diverse contexts. A cross-cutting problem is that too few developing country governments are giving these risks serious attention.
Risk 1: Worsening unemployment
The concern that new technologies – especially artificial intelligence – will lead to widespread job losses has been widely discussed. Of course, the fear that new technologies replace workers is an old one. But it’s been pointed out that historically new technologies have often given rise to more new jobs than the ones that have been automated away. 
What’s perhaps different now is that the new, interconnected digital technologies will likely have a broader and more far-reaching array of abilities. And so the prospect of new kinds of jobs may well be diminished or limited to increasingly sophisticated domains, such as machine learning. 
In addition, new technologies are now not just replacing jobs, but they are also enabling the disruption and restructuring of entire industries. For instance, Uber has already pulled the rug from underneath the conventional taxi industry in many places. Imagine the possible consequences of Uber’s shift to driver-less cars.
Lower labour costs in many developing countries mean that investments in job replacing technologies will be lower. But other aspects of developing countries’ contexts increase the possible severity of this risk. 
First, the dearth of effective education systems and skills in countries like South Africa will make it more difficult for people to be retrained for the  technology intensive new jobs that will become available. Secondly, all governments are struggling to grapple with the implications of new technologies and associated new business models. This struggle is particularly strong in developing country governments. The case of Uber in South Africa reflects this.
Risk 2: Increasing concentration of wealth
Many developing countries are characterised by high levels of inequality within their populations. Elites within these countries will be more likely to make use of AI and other new technologies. This will further increase returns to capital widening the gap between elites’ productive capacity and that of everyone else. 
A similar effect is likely at a global level. It’s no coincidence that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has identified AI as the new terrain for global competition between nations.
New technologies’ advantages for capital are not just due to increasing productivity, but also because they allow new business models that may control or even dominate entire sub-sectors and stifle competition. For instance, it could become possible for a single company to control large fleets of automated vehicles in one or more large areas.
Again, much will depend on whether states can keep up with these developments and respond effectively. Particular attention will need to be paid to intellectual property and competition law. For instance, the strict enforcement of intellectual property rights for AI algorithms may well support increasing economic concentration. It’s also likely that national governments may have less and less influence over such decisions and trends. Even so, many developing country governments are not giving these developments their due attention.
Risk 3: Bias baked into algorithms
Finally, the AI algorithms that are at the centre of the fourth industrial revolution will reflect and perpetuate the contexts and biases of those that create them. Difficulties faced by voice recognition software in recognising particular accents are a relatively innocuous example. Of course, the promise is that AI will enable such systems to learn to address such issues. But the learning process itself might be influenced by racial, gender, or other prejudices. 
AI algorithms are developed almost entirely in developed regions. Thus they may not sufficiently reflect the contexts and priorities of developing countries. Ensuring that AI algorithms are appropriately trained and adapted in different contexts is part of the required response. It would be even better if developing countries become more engaged in the development of new technological systems from the get-go.
Governments need to act
These three risks require that academics, businesses, and civil society actors attend to the role of new technologies in developing countries. But a special responsibility lies with governments. For the most part, they seem to be distracted. 
Governments ought to carefully assess the above risks in their national context and then establish corresponding policies and programs. This includes national skills development and work placement platforms, intellectual property and competition policies, and local technology adaptation and development.

Fears of the rise of robots swooping in to steal jobs abound, stoked by the confluence of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies that automate routine tasks traditionally performed by humans. The reality is that job replacement will happen more gradually than the media headlines suggest, and eventually AI will create more jobs than it eliminates, say Gartner researchers.
“I try to step back and wait for the boomerang because there always will be one,” says Gartner analyst Craig Roth, of the hype surrounding job cannibalization via automation. “Once it goes too far to one side, people wake up and realize, ‘you know, maybe it’s not that bad.'”
Make no mistake, AI and robotics will have a profound impact on the job market long term. As many as 39 to 73 million jobs will be usurped by automation, according to research McKinsey Global Institute released in November. Yet the consultancy also says that workers will perform new tasks or reskill as tasks become automated, leading to millions of new jobs. Gartner estimates that by 2020 AI will create more jobs than it eliminates — 2.3 million to 1.8 million. By 2025, job creation related to AI will top 2 million net-new jobs, including new positions of highly skilled, management and even the entry-level and low-skilled variety, Gartner says.

Such statistics contradict the panic-inducing headlines that millions of jobs will evaporate. One reason for this is that people tend to conflate job automation with automation of certain tasks, which is a much more accurate snapshot of the current corporate climate, Roth says. In other words, robots and other machines aren’t replacing humans outright, but sharing the workload.

Robots and humans making pizza together
Take a pizza business that employs robots to work alongside humans. Maybe the robots perform roughly 10 of 20 tasks it takes to build, bake and deliver a pizza, says Roth. In fact, such a business already exists in Zume Pizza, a Mountain View, Calif.-based startup that uses several robots to help humans assemble and bake pizzas. 
Humans prepare and divide the pizza dough, put it into a dough press and then onto a moving assembly line. When orders come in, one robot applies sauce and another spreads the sauce before handing it off to a human to smooth out imperfections, says Zume CTO Josh Goldberg. The human worker then adds cheese and toppings, which requires fine-motor skills robots are, for now, largely incapable of. “Humans do it today because it’s a pretty highly skilled thing to do,” Goldberg says.











 
 
 
Another robot takes the finished pie and places it into a par-bake oven, which heats the pizza at 800 degrees to kill the active yeast in the dough before transferring it to trucks, Goldberg says. Beyond saving humans from burns, Zume’s value proposition is fresh, farm-to-oven ingredients and speed. Zume is using trucks equipped with “bake-on-the-way” technology that begins cooking pies shortly after they are ordered; the average delivery time is around 22 minutes. 
Zume uses optical targeting and computer vision technology to inform the automation for the base robots, which are made by ABB, and has developed custom tooling to enable the robot’s manual operations. Roth says Zume offers a glimpse of the human-machine labor division typical today.
What the future of AI means for work
You can think of AI, robotics and even robotic process automation (RPA) as endowing humans with certain “superpowers,” enabling them to get more tasks accomplished in less time, Roth says. Gartner calls this “AI augmentation,” and posits that one in five workers engaged in mostly non-routine tasks will rely on AI to do a job by 2022.











 
 
 
The growing application of AI technology to automate tasks also means IT leaders must take into consideration what jobs will be lost, what jobs will be created, and how staff will collaborate and get work done. CIOs may have to reskill employees and reposition them for other services that provide greater value for customers, Roth says. Ultimately, CIOs must prepare their organizations for an automation boom that will trigger significant, though hard to quantify, changes.

Ask




To that end, Roth advises:

Avoid hype. Don’t get distracted by shiny new AI technologies or dread-inspiring headlines that say robots are taking over the world.
Watch what you say. When talking about the automation capabilities of a certain technology, don’t hammer home the fact that it could lead to headcount reduction. Maintaining a low-key, sober approach is crucial in conversations with employees. You don’t need to incite a panic.
Keep societal impacts out of the equation. Consider how AI and other automation capabilities can fortify the business and drive competitive advantage, but don’t worry about the societal impact these technologies portend. Figuring out the right technology decisions for the business is hard enough without falling into a moral quandary. That’s for academics to worry about, Roth says.
Approach AI lightly. Given their disruptive potential, don’t rush into AI and automation.
Avoid the “nuclear AI” problem. Another reason to proceed with caution is the potential for something to go awry, leading to a public relations disaster that sets the AI and automation markets back years. For example, Microsoft didn’t do the AI software sector any favors when it’s chatbot Tay unleashed racist, sexist and other incendiary comments on social media. One possible scenario: What if a self-driving delivery car operated by Zume Pizza gets into a serious car accident? “There’s a risk that some employers make stupid decisions about AI that could cause a backlash,” Roth says. “There are so many opportunities for that to happen.”

Bottom line: “If [CIOs] can sprinkle [AI and automation] in lightly and in a humanistic way over time, that will do a lot more for society than trying to solve the challenge at the societal level,” Roth says. “And if a CEO or CIO could convince their peers to follow suit, that will have the most impact.”

Your iPhone 6 now sleeps in your closet. But…what if you can upcycle it by combining it with AI?At the workshop held in Waag Society on December 7th 2017, we did an ideation session to “phonvert” retired smartphones with AI.What is “phonvert”?The word “phonvert” is a made-up word that combines phone and convert. As big corporations create new models of smartphones each year, many capable yet less desirable retired smartphones pile up.IDC estimates that of the 1.4 billion smartphones sold in 2015, more than 280 million working smartphones were replaced without being recycled.While many of these still work and have usable sensors, most of them remain unused or worse yet, end up in landfills.Through spreading the word, project phonvert is building a movement and a community that is dedicated to finding alternative usages for old phones.From a microscope for smart diagnostics in Uganda to an earthquake monitor in Japan, new ways of phonverting are being developed around the world.This project was acclaimed internationally and was exhibited at Design of the Year 2016 at the London Design Museum.Workshop to uncover the potential of AI running on old phones.In the workshop, we explored the potential of combing retired smartphones with image recognition system that can see and identify objects, powered by Google Cloud Vision.Each group worked with an old smartphone with an application which data from multiple sensors were visible. To demonstrate the potential of image recognition, we used the Thing translator by Dan Motzenbecker.It detected a bottle in less than 3 secondWe also had badges for the sensor data and the things that can be detected. At each session the participants drew random contexts cards to decide on which social context they would phonvert in. The context card ranged from developing countries to government and politics.phonvert workshop toolkitPeek into a world where things understand usThe ideas that came from the workshop went beyond the idea of repurposing retired smartphones. It made us realize we are entering an age where intelligent cameras recognize the world like we do.These intelligent cameras on small devices brings in a new power balance into our society. One idea that came from the participants illustrated this problem clearly.Pet detector across the cityAccording to the participant, this is a lost pet finder. By feeding several pictures of your pet animal to the system, it detects where your pet is through the eyes of the smartphones attached across the city.At a glance this is a funny innocent idea. However when you consider that this can also be used to track people, it opens up a lot of other questions.Visual recognition system everywhere soon.When a system that can do complex image recognition is in the hands of everyone, what could happen?Since most of the image recognition system work cloud-based, we found out that it works perfectly on a 5-year-old android smartphone as long as it has the latest version of Google Chrome.Google has just released their AIY toolkit for makers to tinker with visual recognition system. I expect in a year or two the world will be filled with apps and devices that use it. This could mean “big brothers” everywhere that perform actions based on what it recognizes.Peaceful protest measuring systemSome dystopian ideas by the participant — a protest sensor. This read the emotions and texts in the protest to measure their violence level to be used to ensure a “peaceful protest”.What are your ideas? Share them with us.Overall, the workshop was a huge success where we collectively tried to figure out what is possible with AI on retired smartphones. We also had an interesting debate over ethical concerns surrounding it.Thanks for joining the workshop!Project phonvert will continue to develop this workshop further, so anybody who is interested in joining/hosting this workshop please feel free to contact me through here.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*cMLOHUgjRk-94fu6rkRYIA.jpeg'],https://becominghuman.ai/phonvert-repurposing-retired-smartphones-with-ai-d9f22776df85,https://becominghuman.ai/phonvert-repurposing-retired-smartphones-with-ai-d9f22776df85,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tomo Kihara', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@kihapper'}",2018-05-23T19:20:50.091Z,2018-01-02T15:20:43.731Z,phonvert : Repurposing retired smartphones with AI - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",,,,,,,phonvert : Repurposing retired smartphones with AI - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-02T15:20:43.731Z,d9f22776df85,['Tomo Kihara']
