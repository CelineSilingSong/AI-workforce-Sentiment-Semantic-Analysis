1. Composer and Beethoven biographer Jan Swafford was asked to respond to the “10th symphony” created with artificial intelligence. “At the end of the symphony I found myself more philosophical than annoyed,” he writes.
The ability of a machine to do or outdo something humans do is interesting once at most… When it comes to art, we need to see a woman or a man struggling with the universal mediocrity that is the natural lot of all of us and somehow out of some mélange of talent, skill, and luck doing the impossible, making something happen that is splendid and moving—or funny, or frightening, or whatever the artist set out to do… Here’s my assertion: True intelligence is in a body. Intelligence outside a living body, as some sort of abstraction, is innately impossible, or should be given another name.
Swafford points out (like Nick Cave has) that part of the beauty of Beethoven is, “in contrast say to Mozart and Bach, with him it’s often as if you can hear the effort, the struggle, hear in the notes what it cost him to rise above the universal mediocrity.”
He writes of his late friend, the painter Francis Gillespie:
She would spend a year or more on a painting of flowers, struggling to represent them with virtually photographic accuracy. In fact, as she knew perfectly well, she didn’t have the technique to do that. “I’m really sort of a primitive,” Fran would say grimly as she worked. But what makes her paintings hers is exactly the grand failure of her attempt. Her pictures are beautiful, close to photos, but always a little off, and the offness makes them singular.
Ted Gioia calls this “an aesthetics of imperfection.”
In this story, the human has something the machine can never have.

2. In Sam Anderson’s profile of Laurie Anderson, he notes that the artist has “become obsessed, lately, with artificial intelligence.” She worked with researchers to make text engines in her style, the style of her late husband, Lou Reed, and an Anderson/Reed blend of the two. Anderson says a 1/3 of what the computer spits out is junk, 1/3 is boring, but 1/3 is “surprising, even authentic, some kind of fresh magic.”
Sometimes she sits there with the hunger of an addict, feeding words and pictures into the engine, seeing what comes out. For a long time, she would save the texts. They felt so precious. After a while, though, she realized that the texts were infinite. She could have one whenever she needed it. So she read them and then let them go.
At one point, Laurie Anderson reeds a poem the machine spit out in Reed’s style. It’s not bad. “Wonderful,” she says. “Just great. He’s talking to me from somewhere else. I definitely do feel that. The line is pretty thin for me.”
(This scene reminded me of something out of Don Hertzfeldt’s World of Tomorrow.)
In this story, the machine gives the human a combination of something it had and something it never had.

3. I am sympathetic to Swafford’s assertion that “intelligence is in a body” and “the aesthetics of imperfection.”
I also know that some of my favorite art came out of the interplay between human and machine. It is between the two that a third thing emerges — Beethoven, after all, was wrangling notes out of a machine with keys.
I think it is worth noting the difference between analog and digital machines. Analog machines, I would venture, give you more mistakes that you can work with — a brush runs out of ink, and the dry texture gives you new marks, Lee Perry blows ganja smoke and dirt on a tape reel, and new sounds emerge. (You throw dirt in a laptop and you’ll simply fry the machine.) That said, even digital machines  and pieces of software have quirks and we ascribe them personalities, and work with them.
I would also note the difference between words and music. Words are more abstract than music. They are more easily fed into a computer and spit back out. They also must be interpreted by us — when we read the poem in the style of Reed, summoned from the computer, it is already an abstract, linear text. We must interpret the words. Music is not interpreted. It is what it is. It is heard.
I confess I have gone from being cranky to curious about A.I., and I wonder what sorts of grunt work it could do for me. (Could it spit out a book proposal?)
In my story, the machines help us to honor what is not machine-like in us.

Automation is becoming a top priority in many markets, especially as the remote workforce grows and workforce shortages displace traditional models of work in favor of more sustainable solutions. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) development is one of the leading forces in the automation drive, with expectations that AI will lead to a $15.7 trillion, or 26%, increase in global GDP by 2030, according to PwC’s “Global Artificial Intelligence Study.”
As AI automation continues to enable new products and workplace solutions, many people have understandably grown concerned about their job security as AI takes over more daily tasks. But is artificial intelligence-enabled automation actually removing jobs, or is it simply changing the way we work? 
Read on to learn about how AI automation is disrupting traditional jobs and how workplaces and employees alike can ensure workers’ security in the long run:

AI as an automation-enabling technology
AI is increasingly finding its way into homes but even more so in businesses, where automated insights and operations speed up processes and decrease the chances of user error. 
Here are some of the top business priorities that are being automated through AI:

Customer service: Through chatbots, virtual assistants, and curated search recommendations, customers can guide their buying decisions autonomously and on their own time.
Smart factories and assembly line automation: Manufacturing has always been a dangerous and time-consuming industry when human workers act as the primary engine. AI-based automation has entered into many factories and assembly lines, enabling a new class of machine-built and -packaged products as well as self-healing equipment on the assembly line.
AIOps and MLOps: Many businesses have leaned into AI and machine learning (ML) for operations automation, using AI to enhance projects like security monitoring and audits.
Data mining and analytics: AI is being programmed to handle data entry and basic data analytics and reporting, leaving employees with more time to focus on tasks that require specialized skill.

Jobs disrupted by AI automation
AI as a replacement for human work
A growing number of people fear that their jobs will be replaced by robots, and while that doesn’t look too likely in the near future, some types of roles will at least decrease in number as AI takes over their tasks. 
The following jobs are expected to decrease in demand by 2025, especially because AI and other automated technologies are replacing the primary tasks of these roles, according to the World Economic Forum’s “Future of Jobs Report”:

Data entry clerks
Administrative and executive secretaries
Accounting, bookkeeping, and payroll clerks
Accountants and auditors
Assembly and factory workers
Business services and administration managers
Client information and customer service workers
General and operations managers
Mechanics and machinery repairers
Material-recording and stock-keeping clerks

AI as a supplement to human work
It’s important to note that while AI can, for instance, handle some of the basic data entry and management tasks traditionally completed by secretaries and clerks, AI tools cannot succeed unless they are appropriately programmed, trained, and maintained over time. 
That’s why, as AI tools continue to enter into more business use cases, roles that manage these tools and support them strategically will continue to grow. These jobs will grow quickly in the next several years, according to “The Future of Jobs Report”:

Data scientists and analysts
AI and machine learning specialists
Big data specialists
Digital marketing and strategy specialists
Process automation specialists
Business development professionals
Digital transformation specialists
Information security (IS) analysts
Software developers
Internet of Things (IoT) specialists

Building skills for an AI world
AI automation promises the creation of new jobs, new consumer products, and greater economic growth. However, if workforce development does not keep up with the AI revolution, employees of varying roles and backgrounds run the risk of being replaced in the workforce by automation.
Although it is ultimately up to the individual to develop competitive professional skills, local and national governments, employers, and educational institutions should invest in the following solutions in order to maintain a healthy, equitable workforce:
Education and skills development
Organizations should invest in education, re-education, or skills development courses for employees who are interested in learning about data science, programming, and other tech skills that are highly lucrative in the job market. If an organization is unwilling or unable to invest financial resources, several free online courses and workshops teach common programming languages and other technical skills.
Hands-on training
Provide employees with hands-on training for deploying and managing any AI or data sets that the company uses. This training provides relevant experience for both the employee and the company that will need help with those tools in the future.
Soft-skills training
One of the most affordable and valuable types of training that employers can provide is soft-skills training. Although AI can mimic several human tasks, no artificial intelligence model has yet come close to matching human soft skills, like leadership, entrepreneurship, conflict resolution, and creative thinking, to name a few. Give employees the opportunity to attend seminars and conferences, set their goals, and spend time developing their humanistic strengths outside of their daily work.

Conclusions
AI automation will likely replace or at the very least transform many of the jobs we see in the market today. 
However, the majority of jobs will not be supplanted with AI technology but instead be supported by AI, allowing employees to optimize their performance and outcomes with artificial assistance.
Jerry Ting, co-founder and CEO of Evisort, an AI contract management software company, believes that the combination of human work and AI work is what will continue to lend enterprises the greatest levels of efficiency:
“Artificial intelligence has truly transformed business technology today,” Ting said. “Humans and technology must work together in order to help businesses remain efficient, and artificial intelligence makes that possible. 
“Rather than replacing humans, artificial intelligence serves as a supportive tool that can help streamline decision-making processes as well as save users time and resources.”

October 11, 2021 — The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has launched a new department dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence (AI) to transform health care, further positioning the Mount Sinai Health System as a leader in providing patient care through pioneering innovations and technologies. The Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health is the first department of its kind within a medical school in the United States.
The department’s mission is to lead the artificial intelligence-driven transformation of health care through innovative research, apply that knowledge to treatment in hospital and clinical settings, and provide personalized care for each patient, which will expand Mount Sinai’s impact on human health across the Health System and around the world.
“Mount Sinai’s AI enterprise and its collective entities will be the connective fabric linking and integrating our work throughout the entire Health System, as we robustly collaborate with all our institutes, departments, and centers to provide phenomenal patient care,” said Thomas J. Fuchs, Dr.sc, Dean for Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, Co-Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, and Professor of Computational Pathology and Computer Science in the Department of Pathology at Icahn Mount Sinai. “The overarching goal of the Department for AI and Human Health is to impact patients’ health with AI. We will accomplish this by building AI systems at scale from data representing Mount Sinai’s diverse patient population. These systems will work seamlessly across all hospitals and care units to support physicians, foster research, and most importantly help patients' care and well-being.”
Fuchs, who will lead the Department, is a prominent scientist in the groundbreaking field of computational pathology, with decades of experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence in health care. Together with his team, he will guide the department in creating an “AI Fabric” that will integrate machine learning and AI-driven decision-making throughout the Health System’s eight hospitals. This effort will include creating a hub-and-satellite model to make new tools and techniques available to all Mount Sinai physicians, and building an infrastructure for high-performance computing and data access to improve Mount Sinai's diagnostic and treatment capabilities.
“Mount Sinai has been on the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution,” said Dennis S. Charney, M.D., Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean of Icahn Mount Sinai and President for Academic Affairs of the Mount Sinai Health System. “We’ve made bold steps in recruiting the brightest minds, invested in leading-edge technology, and created an infrastructure where discoveries are quickly translated to benefit patients and change practice. This Department cements our commitment to further developing this field, charting new avenues, and making this bold future a reality.”
As part of Mount Sinai’s ongoing commitment to expand AI, the department will be located on four floors in a completely redesigned and renovated space at 3 East 101st Street that includes areas for computational work and advanced imaging modalities such as virtual and augmented reality. The Department of AI and Human Health is also launching a campaign to recruit talented researchers, scientists, physicians, and students in the field.  
“We are just at the beginning stages of reaping the advantages of artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical research and clinical medicine,” said Eric J. Nestler, M.D., Ph.D., Dean for Academic and Scientific Affairs, Nash Family Professor of Neuroscience, and Director of The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai. “Mount Sinai is at the forefront of this effort, underscored by the opening—expected toward the end of 2022—of a new research facility on campus that will house the new Department and related endeavors.”
The new department continues to build on Mount Sinai’s expertise and early adaptation of various forms of artificial intelligence, including machine learning to develop novel diagnostics and treatments for diseases. Earlier this year, Icahn Mount Sinai announced it will offer a new PhD concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies in Medicine as part of its PhD in Biomedical Sciences program starting in the fall of 2022. The concentration will train future scientists in cutting-edge technologies, including AI, medical devices, robotic machines, and sensors. The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai—a collaboration between the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering in Potsdam, Germany, and the Mount Sinai Health System—formed in 2019 to expand capabilities and create new tools of data science, biomedical and digital engineering, machine learning, and AI, including wearable technology.

A senior cybersecurity official at the Pentagon said he resigned in protest because the slow pace of technological development has made it impossible for the United States to compete with China. Nicolas Chaillan, who spent three years as the first chief software officer for the Air Force, said Beijing has a clear advantage in the technological space because of its fast advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and general capabilities in cybersecurity. “We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it’s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,” Chaillan told the Financial Times in his first interview since he left his Pentagon job earlier this month. “Whether it takes a war or not is kind of anecdotal.”

In many respects, China is playing in an entirely different league as the United States, Chaillan says, characterizing the cyber defenses in some government agencies as being at “kindergarten level.” Now China is set to dominate the future of the world, controlling media narratives and geopolitics, he added. While the United States continues to spend more money on defense than anyone else, it continues to focus on expensive hardware, such as new fighter jets, rather than emerging technologies that will be far more critical to the future.

One of the reasons China has been able to move much faster than the United States is that it isn’t bogged down in massive debates over AI ethics. But also because Chinese companies are forced to work with the government while many U.S. firms are reluctant to work with the Pentagon. Google, for example, stopped doing artificial intelligence work with the Pentagon in 2018 when a dozen employees quit after the company helped the Department of Defense develop software that could improve the accuracy of drone strikes.

Chaillan had announced his resignation in early September with a LinkedIn post that expressed his frustration at the slow pace of change at the Pentagon and how higher up officials were not willing to make new technologies a real priority. “At this point, I am just tired of continuously chasing support and money to do my job,” Chaillan wrote. Chaillan is hardly the first person to warn about Chinese advances in the emerging technologies. Earlier this year, the National Security Commission warned that the “U.S. government is not prepared to defend the United States in the coming artificial intelligence era” and that China was on track to become the world’s top AI superpower.

Key Takeaways


Most companies work with some form of hybrid or cloud infrastructure, but managing this has become almost impossible without some form of AI help
For teams that are running several different clouds, AI interfaces have become almost a necessity as they evolve and scale their DevOps program.
It’s very apparent that AI is already having a huge impact on speed and quality at which software is being shipped.
The AI revolution has had the side-effect of making DevOps teams busier than ever, and with development cycles much faster as well. 
Ultimately, development teams still need strategic leadership, and although AIs are now highly capable in many areas, they still lack the ability to respond to user demand in truly creative ways.





For many developers, predicting what’s next in DevOps has become something of a favorite pastime. We’ve seen our industry change rapidly in just the last decade, and in that same period the programmer’s role has also changed fundamentally.
In fact, and particularly among those developers of (shall we say) a particular age, it might seem as though the role of the “traditional” developer no longer exists. Rather than the traditional software development life cycle – in which software is planned, built, and then released – many of us now work in multi-disciplinary teams in which development and operations exist side-by-side, and are increasingly indistinguishable.
That model has become known as DevOps, but only recently. And it only took a few years (or months?) for DevOps itself to start changing and adapting. Now, we are adrift in a sea of acronyms (including the more recent DevSecOps) that denote a slightly different way of working, and each a slightly different view of the future.

Among the most recent of these is AIOps. In this vision, AI tools are slowly replacing the role of the developer – just as DevOps did before – and will eventually supplant DevOps entirely.
Assessing whether that prediction is true is tricky, but in this article we will try nonetheless. We’ll look at what AI promises to do for the development process, assess whether it can really ever take over from human  developers, and then look at what DevOps is likely to look like in a decades’ time.
The Promise of Automation
First, and in order to understand why AI tools have been so rapidly adopted by DevOps teams, it’s useful to understand what they promise they can achieve. This promise can essentially be broken into two parts:

On the one hand, the use of AI tools is “merely” a way for over-stretched developers to stay on top of the increasingly complex systems they work with. 
On the other, AI tools offer a range of automated code development and deployment techniques that have more fundamentally transformed the way that software is made.


With regard to the former – AI tools that make our lives easier – we only have to look at the proliferation of cloud infrastructure models over the past decade to see why AI has been necessary. Nowadays, most companies work with some form of hybrid\cloud infrastructure, and managing this has become almost impossible without some form of AI help. Indeed, hybrid and multi cloud infrastructures, microservices architectures like containers and hyperscale applications have created an enterprise IT environment that is more complicated than ever to keep track of. 
Then there is the second aspect of AI tool adoption – the fact that some AI tools like GitHub’s AI Coding Assistant or Microsoft’s DeepDev don’t just make our lives easier, they open up new possibilities when it comes to code development and distribution. The speed with which AI systems can assess individual user requirements, for instance, makes it possible to use them to tweak and specify default web browsing behavior for each user individually, reducing their vulnerability to particular types of malware while using our software. 
DevOps, AIOps, and NoOps
As a consequence of the utility of AI tools, they have been widely and rapidly adopted by all but the most stubborn DevOps teams. Indeed, for teams now running several different clouds (and that’s all teams, pretty much) AI interfaces have become almost a necessity as they evolve and scale their DevOps program.
The most obvious and tangible outcome of this shift has been in the data and systems that developers spend their time looking at. It used to be that a major part of the role of the operations team, for instance, was to build and maintain a dashboard that all staff members could consult, and which contained all of the apposite data on a piece of software. 
Today, that central task has become largely obsolete. As software has grown more complex, the idea of a single dashboard containing all the relevant information on a particular piece of software has begun to sound absurd. Instead, most DevOps teams now make use of AI tools that “automatically” monitor the software they are working on, and only present data when it is clear that something has gone wrong.
This is a massive shift in the way that we work as developers and operational staff, and so it’s no surprise that it’s been given its own acronym – AIOps. Some, in fact, have gone even further, and claimed that this reliance on AI tools now means we are entering the age of NoOps. Tellingly, however, opinion is divided about which role has been eliminated – whether NoOps mean “no developers”, or “no operations”.
The AI Revolution
All these reflections on the philosophical background to software development might sound a little abstract. Until, that is, you look at the numbers, from which it is strikingly apparent that AI is already having a huge impact on speed (if not the quality) at which software is being shipped.
GitLab's most recent survey of over four thousand developers puts some hard figures on this. This research finds that some companies are releasing new code up to ten times more quickly than previously. Tellingly, 75% utilize AI and ML for testing and reviewing code pre-release. This is up from just over 40% only a year ago.

Image Source
This is great news for developers, or at least those who want to produce lots of code quickly. Unfortunately, that’s not always the same as producing great code. It’s clear, for instance, from ransomware attack trends that poorly tested code is quickly becoming a notable source of vulnerability for many organizations, and that the advent of AI-driven testing systems has done little to reduce this.
Nonetheless, the direction of travel is strikingly apparent. Within a few more years, it seems, the vast majority of DevOps teams will be reliant on AI tools, and software will be released at many times the velocity that it was previously. And that returns us to the question we started with – given that AI tools are now doing so much DevOps work, do we still need human DevOps staff at all?
Well, yes and no. Here’s why.
The Challenges
At the most superficial level, it’s possible to answer this question in reference to a very simple test. As AI tools have been adopted across the development sector, have developers seen their workloads decrease? Ask that question of the average developer, and you’ll be met with a laugh. The answer is no.
That’s because, as DevOps teams spend less time on the day-to-day management of their software, the time they used to spend on this is now taken up with arguably more valuable tasks – strategic planning, meta-analyses, and making sure that their development goals are in line with those of management. In fact, the AI “revolution”, which many imagined would make DevOps obsolete, appears to have made teams larger than ever, and busier than ever. This is because it has had the side-effect of making development cycles much faster. 
This is well understood by managers in the industry. In a recent interview with ZDNet, Matthew Tiani, the executive vice president at iTech AG, noted that DevOps is now ""enhanced by, among other things, an enhanced technical toolset -- source code management, CI/CD, orchestration.” 
He also added that successful DevOps implementation makes use of ""a compatible development methodology such as agile and scrum, and an organization commitment to foster and encourage collaboration between development and operational staff.""
Learning to Live Together
In practice, these factors and trends mean that DevOps teams are increasingly focused on business objectives, rather than technical challenges. This is certainly a change, but it might not be a negative one when it comes to the quality of software we produce. Arguably, in fact, AI tools have given teams the ability to focus their human resources where they work best – in creative, holistic, strategic tasks
You don’t have to look far for evidence of this. Just consider, for instance, that Vue JS is now the fastest growing dev framework in the world, with more than 240,000 websites built with the system now live. Before the advent of AI tools, the idea that a new and complex dev framework could be so quickly rolled out across the world would be laughable. Now, backed by AI tools, DevOps teams have a lot more freedom to be brave in their decisions, and trust that their tools are advanced enough to meet technical challenges.
This means that it’s very unlikely that AI tools are going to replace DevOps, or at least anytime soon. Just as we saw with previous trends in the adoption of DevOps, development teams still need strategic leadership, no matter how advanced their technical tools. And, though AIs are now highly capable in many areas, they still lack the ability to respond to user demand in truly creative ways.
The Bottom Line
In short, we are likely to need human developers for quite a while yet. And though their role might be radically different from how it was ten years ago, that’s the price (and the joy) of working in such a dynamic industry. 
About the Author
Sam Bocetta is a former security analyst, having spent the bulk of his as a network engineer for the Navy. He is now semi-retired, and educates the public about security and privacy technology. Much of Sam’s work involved penetration testing ballistic systems. He analyzed our networks looking for entry points, then created security-vulnerability assessments based on my findings. Further, he helped plan, manage, and execute sophisticated ""ethical"" hacking exercises to identify vulnerabilities and reduce the risk posture of enterprise systems used by the Navy (both on land and at sea). The bulk of his work focused on identifying and preventing application and network threats, lowering attack vector areas, removing vulnerabilities and general reporting. He was able to identify weak points and create new strategies which bolstered our networks against a range of cyber threats. Sam worked in close partnership with architects and developers to identify mitigating controls for vulnerabilities identified across applications and performed security assessments to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a variety of threats.

The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Humans continue to pose questions about artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics. 
Back 1951, when Christopher Strachey launched his AI-driven checkers program at the University of Manchester in England, people were questioning the implications of human-mimicking machines. 
Today, depending on who is giving the answer, AI is either the key to driving society toward a peaceful, harmonious future or the biggest potential threat to humankind. 
We can find examples to support both perspectives in the business world and beyond. But reaching a consensus about the ethical bounds of AI is an endless societal debate that will morph as AI applications evolve, becoming more sophisticated — and more human-like. 
Here, we examine a series of questions on and AI and ethics society will wrestle with for the foreseeable future:

5 ethical questions AI raises
1. How much surveillance is too much?
AI applications that help employers and advertisers keep tabs on humans are among the most prominent targets for ethical skepticism. Whether it’s the AI-driven algorithms that track and analyze users’ moves on social media or a “smart” app that runs in the background, clocking every keystroke and click made by an employee, we’ve reached an age where many are under constant digital surveillance. 
On one hand, is it really such a terrible thing if employers can keep better track of exactly what employees are doing during working hours? After all, employees receive paychecks, and employers have a significant stake in employee efficiency. On the other hand, what will become of personal autonomy? What kind of workplace environments are we creating when employees feel surveilled and monetized at every moment of the workday? 
Work isn’t the only place humans are under increased scrutiny. “Big Brother” is lurking, and as AI grows more sophisticated and accurate, we could eventually see applications like facial recognition become a part of nearly every public interaction. 
“In an AI-enabled future, we assume that everyone and everything will have knowledge about everyone else,” says Kathleen Walch, managing partner and principal analyst at the AI firm Cognilytica, in a recent Forbes article, “Ethical Concerns of AI.”
“No longer will we be able to just unplug for a while. We may quickly move to a world where just a few companies and government have an uncomfortable amount of knowledge and level of control over the lives of everyone.”
2. When do the ‘needs of many’ outweigh the needs of a few?
As AI evolves to become more intelligent and autonomous, it’s easy to imagine scenarios where we would hope and expect AI applications to put the needs of the human collective above the needs of individuals. 
Imagine AI that can root, identify, and detain a potential terrorist — here, there is a clear societal benefit. When situations are grayer, however, it’s a slippery slope. 
Take another potential scenario: a factory that is polluting a river and poisoning a small town’s water supply, as Debarshi Chaudhury cites in his Forbes article, “Why the Ethics of AI are Complicated.” 
“A machine could decide that for the benefit of the many thousands of people in the town, the best option is to destroy the factory,” Chaudhury says. “That’s something a ‘good’ human being would never do — we’d try to fix it in other ways.”
Until we reach a level where AI is able to examine these kinds of issues with real context, we can’t truly trust the technology to be left alone to its own devices. The tendency for AI to follow the most logical, literal path is one AI engineers have yet to adequately address.

3. What happens if AI replaces humans in the workplace?
It’s perhaps the one of the most common technological concern expressed by the public, since the industrial revolution began in the late 1800s. As factories emerged for the first time, it quickly became apparent how much work could be done with the help of inventions like the mechanical belt. 
If machines can perform jobs, the logic goes, we’ll need fewer humans on hand, which means fewer employment options. Machines are often quicker, more precise, and much more efficient, since they don’t need breaks nearly as regularly as human workers. And now, machines powered by AI are, indeed, replacing some jobs previously completed by people. 
Some technology watchdogs see signs that the ongoing pandemic has accelerated an inevitable shift toward automation and away from human work. One study that estimated that around 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. factories between 1990 and 2007, according to a recent Time article. 
The drive to replace humans with machinery is accelerating, writer Alana Samuels says in the article. While some jobs have come back since during the pandemic, Samuels says, “Some will never return.” One group of economists estimates that some 42% of the jobs lost are gone “forever,” she says.
Ultimately, AI will significantly impact the entire career landscape for would-be employees. Already, “babysitting robots” is a job, and human oncologists are beginning to turn over diagnostic duties to AI, which has proven to be far more accurate in some cases, according to Yulia Gavrilova in her blog post, “10 AI Ethics Questions We Need to Ask,” on the Serokell Software Development Company website.
“What will happen to specialists when AI systems become available in every hospital not only for making diagnoses but also for performing operations?” Gavrilova says. 
“If computers take over all the work, what will we do? For many people, work and self-realization are the meaning of life.”
4. Is AI making it easier for bad actors to carry out attacks?
We’ve focused on how AI itself poses several ethical issues in certain applications, but what about AI in the wrong hands? AI can do good, but it can be wielded as a weapon by malicious users. 
AI-driven network breaches and other cyber attacks are on the rise. TaskRabbit, an online marketplace that connects freelancers with clients, suffered a data breach in 2018, putting almost 4 million users at risk. Information like Social Security numbers and bank account details made it into the hands of bad actors through an AI-controlled botnet, which used machines to launch DDoS attacks on TaskRabbit’s servers. The personal data of 141 million users was accessed. 
Another example includes a well-publicized AI-driven attack on WordPress, which has so far seen over 20,000 sites infected with a botnet-style cyber attack, putting users’ personal information and credit card numbers at risk. 
Industry watchers speculate that a 2019 attack on Instagram was also AI-based, with many experts speculating that hackers used AI to scan user data for potential vulnerabilities. 
5. What role is AI playing in the spread of disinformation?
Our hyper-connected world allows us to stay constantly connected to each another and to access information about virtually anything at high speeds. 
The Internet Age led society to a place where disinformation and “fake news” have reached epidemic levels. AI is at the heart of many harmful disinformation campaigns. 
AI-driven programs can create extremely convincing fake images, videos, conversations and alarmingly authentic-feeling content. 
What happens if we reach a point where no one, or a small number of people, can tell if images are real or AI-generated? With every passing year, we see evidence that AI-created content is only becoming more sophisticated. Consider the MIT Technology Review article, “These weird, unsettling photos show that AI is getting smarter,” which explores the work being done by researchers to perfect AI image generation. 
We’ve already seen first-hand how AI-driven bots can impact world events. The post-mortem on the 2016 U.S. presidential election shows how quickly and intentionally AI can be used to spread convincing misinformation. 
Throughout the 2016 election cycle, bots were used to automate social media accounts with the aim of manipulating voters and stoking partisan division. The 2016 election was not an isolated event. Even as research conducted through programs like the University of Oxford Computational Propaganda continues to piece together how foreign actors were able to significantly impact an American election, bots continue running rampant among social media platforms.

The artificial intelligence (AI) market is seeing explosive growth not only in traditionally tech-driven industries but also in new lines of business and in the homes of consumers. 
As the demand for AI efficiencies continues to grow, data scientists and other AI experts are challenging themselves to harness and apply big data in new ways.
Read on to learn about artificial intelligence, how AI is being used, and the state of the AI market:
A Closer Look at AI

Artificial intelligence market
The automation and new technologies that come from the development of AI are generating both hype and growth across the AI market. 
The artificial intelligence software market hit a value of about $62.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by 16x over the next several years, reaching around $997.8 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. 
Although AI has been incorporated into various markets and is expected to enter more in the near future, artificial intelligence tools are most commonly used in these industries: tech, automotive, health care, retail, finance, and manufacturing.

Artificial intelligence features

Big data: Without big data to learn from and otherwise code the actions of an AI tool, the solution cannot develop algorithms that successfully complete tasks.
AI algorithms: These use a combination of computer science, programming, and basic logic to develop commands for AI models to follow.
Machine learning (ML): A subset of artificial intelligence that focuses primarily on teaching a machine to complete a singular task based on coded training data instructions.
Deep learning: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to train a machine to work similarly to a human brain, by following and learning from examples.
Natural language processing (NLP): One of the most common forms of AI used to analyze text, voice, and other communication-based unstructured data to inform follow-up actions.

Benefits of artificial intelligence
Customer experience (CX) improvements
Most often powered by machine learning, customer experience tools are increasingly meeting customer needs in real-time with AI. Chatbots, virtual assistants, recommendation engines, and self-adjusting search results all work to answer customer questions and offer catered resources, so they can find what they need on their own schedules.
Accessibility resources and tools
Perhaps the most exciting consumer advantage that comes from AI is the increase in resources that make daily life more accessible. Self-driving vehicles and other autonomous fleet services make it easier for people to access transportation. Home medical diagnostic tools help people get the care they need, even if it’s difficult to leave home. More common daily tools like AI home assistants, bots, readers, and translators make it easier for people with different abilities and linguistic backgrounds to communicate, complete tasks, and enjoy multimedia entertainment.
Additional security support
A small number of specialized teams are developing AIOps, MLOps, and AI-powered security initiatives that automate security monitoring, dashboard analytics, and other security features that preemptively protect against security threats.
Derek Lin, chief data scientist at Exabeam, a cybersecurity and compliance company, explained how AI makes threat monitoring and detection easier for businesses:
“Over the past few years, AI has played a prominent role in threat detection, investigation, and response (TDIR),” Lin said. “Security analysts have been able to use the technology to establish baselines of normal behaviors for users on a network in order to detect anomalies as well as automated threat response to mitigate incidents in a fraction of the time.”
Smart operations development
Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly being programmed to automate business operations through AIOps and in more specialized settings like smart factories. When AI is used in partnership with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, it can also power highly detailed and actionable models like digital twins. 
More on AI and security: Trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
Artificial intelligence use cases
Language-based use cases are the most common across the artificial intelligence market, but a growing number of other use cases like computer vision, machine development, and cybersecurity tools have gained traction.
In many cases, specialized tech companies are also finding new ways to use AI to their advantage:
Contract and compliance management
“Evisort leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help businesses categorize, search, and act on business-driving documents of any type. Evisort’s proprietary AI understands meaning and context in legal language, allowing the technology to process 122,400 pages in one day and eliminating the need for manual data entry and parsing of contracts or business documents.” -Jerry Ting, co-founder and CEO, Evisort
Business coaching
“An increasingly popular use case of AI is to improve conversational intelligence systems for customer service and sales processes. Such technologies include AI-powered guided coaching, which offers salespeople live feedback and recommendations that they can use in the middle of a customer call. … Instead of having to listen to hundreds of hours of calls for training, [new hires] can go straight into a call with AI as their live coach, providing recommendations and scripts while they’re on the phone.” -Greg Armor, EVP at Gryphon.ai
Fraud and threat detection
“Artificial intelligence can be a critical element in how businesses identify and battle e-commerce fraud and abuse. For example, there is a lot of nuance in deciding if an e-commerce transaction is too risky to be approved, and AI enables machines to make these assessments that would normally require human insight at far greater scale.” -Liron Damri, president and co-founder, Forter
An intro to top providers: Top Performing Artificial Intelligence Companies
Artificial intelligence providers
Many tech giants have developed artificial intelligence tools and applications for their users, but a greater number of new companies are entering the tech scene with a singular focus on AI innovation. 
Several companies have focused their efforts on one subset of AI use cases, such as sentiment analysis or autonomous vehicle and fleet development. 
But the majority of top players in the AI market are developing a wider swath of AI tools across their verticals and customer-facing projects:

IBM
AWS
Google Cloud
Microsoft Azure
Salesforce
Siemens
Automation Anywhere
SAS
DocuSign
Nvidia
H20.ai
Intel
Alibaba

A growing number of companies are integrating AI solutions by these providers into their internal operations and consumer products. 
But many other companies are hesitant to adopt AI, due to the perceived cost and required expertise to manage these tools. 
As companies across industries continue to find ways to optimize their processes and offerings through AI, it will be important for companies without AI to engage with the technology soon, so they don’t fall behind their competitors.

How AI is Being Used in Robotics
HomeAI
By Drew Robb

artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the robotics market into various areas, including mobile robots on the factory floor, robots that can do a large number of tasks rather than being specialized on one, and robots that can stay in control of inventory levels as well as fetching orders for delivery. 
Such advanced functionality has raised the complexity of robotics. Hence the need for AI. 
Artificial intelligence provides the ability to monitor many parameters in real-time and make decisions. For example, in an inventory robot, the machine has to be able to know its own location, the location of all stock, know stock levels, work out the sequence to go and retrieve items for orders, know the location of other robots on the floor, be able to navigate around the site, know when a human is near and change course, take deliveries to shipping, keep track of everything, and more. 
The mobile robot also has to interoperate with various shop floor systems, computer numerical control (CNC) equipment, and other industrial systems. AI helps all those disparate systems work together seamlessly by being able to process their various inputs in real-time and coordinate action. 
Autonomous robots market 
The autonomous robotic market alone is worth around $103 billion this year, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group. He predicts that it will more than double by 2025 to $210 billion. 
“It will only go vertical from there,” Enderle said.  
That’s only one portion of the market. Another hot area is robotic process automation (RPA). It, too, is being integrated with AI to deal with high-volume, repeatable tasks. By handing these tasks over to robots, labor costs are reduced, workflows can be streamlined, and assembly processes are accelerated. Software can be written, for example, to take care of routine queries, calculations, and record keeping. 
Historically, two different teams were needed: one for robotics and another for factory automation. The robotics team consists of specialized technicians with their own programming language to deal with the complex kinematics of multi-axis robots. Factory automation engineers, on the other hand, use programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and shop floor systems that utilize different programming languages. But software is now on the market that brings these two worlds together. 
Further, better software and more sophisticated hardware has opened the door to a whole new breed of robot. While basic models operate on two axes, the latest breed of robotic machine with AI is capable of movement on six axes. They can be programmed to either carry out one task, over and over with high accuracy and speed, or execute complex tasks, such as coating or machining intricate components.

5 Examples of AI in robotics 
1. Honda
Honda’s ASIMO has become something of a celebrity. This advanced humanoid robot has been programmed to walk like a human, maintain balance, and do backflips. 
But now AI is being used to advance its capabilities with an eventual view toward autonomous motion. 
“The difficulty is no longer building the robot but training it to deal with unstructured environments, like roads, open areas, and building interiors,” Enderle said. “They are complex systems with massive numbers of actuators and sensors to move and perceive what is around them.” 
2. Sight Machine and Nissan
Sight Machine, the developer of a manufacturing data platform, has partnered with Nissan to use AI to perform anomaly detection on 300 robots working on an automated final assembly process. 
This system provides predictions and root-cause analysis for downtime.

3. Siemens and AUTOParkit
Siemens and AUTOParkit have formed a partnership to bring parking into the 21st century. 
Using Siemens automation controls with AI, the AUTOParkit solution provides a safe valet service without the valet.
This fully automated parking solution can achieve 2:1 efficiency over a conventional parking approach, AUTOParkit says. It reduces parking-related fuel consumption by 83% and carbon emissions by 82%. 
In such a complex system, specialized vehicle-specific hardware and software work together to provide smooth and seamless parking experience that is far faster than traditional parking. Siemens controls use AI to pull it all together. 
4. Kawasaki
Kawasaki has a large offering of robots that are primarily used in fixed installations. But now it is working on robotic mobility and that takes AI. 
“For stationary robots to work seamlessly with mobile robots, it is essential that they can exchange information accurately and without failure,” said Samir Patel, senior director of robotics engineering, Kawasaki Robotics USA. 
“To meet such integration requirements, Kawasaki robot controllers offer numerous options, including EtherNet TCP/IP, EtherNet IP, EtherCat, PROFIBUS, PROFINET and DeviceNet. These options not only allow our robots to communicate with mobile robots, but also allow communication to supervisory servers, PLCs, vision systems, sensors, and other devices.”  
With so many data sources to communicate with and instantaneous response needed to provide operational efficiency and maintain safety, AI is needed. 
“Over time, each robot accumulates data, such as joint load, speed, temperature, and cycle count, which periodically gets transferred to the network server,” Patel said. “In turn. the server running an application, such as Kawasaki’s Trend Manager, can analyze the data for performance and failure prediction.” 
5. Sight Machine and Komatsu
Sight Machine, in close cooperation with Komatsu, has developed a system that can rapidly analyze 500 million data points from 600 welding robots.
The AI-based system can provide early warning of potential downtime and other welding faults.

Addressing Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The link between artificial intelligence (AI) and bias is  alarming. 
As AI evolves to become more human-like, it’s becoming clear that human bias is impacting technology in negative, potentially dangerous ways. 
Here, we explore how AI and bias are linked and what’s being done to reduce the impact of bias in AI applications:

3 questions on AI and bias
1. How does bias in AI impact automated decision systems?
Using AI in decision-making processes has become commonplace, mostly because predictive analytics algorithms can perform the work of humans at a much faster and often more accurate rate. Decisions are being made by AI on small matters, like restaurant preferences, and critical issues, like determining which patient should receive an organ donation. 
While the stakes may differ, whether human bias is playing a role in AI decisions is sure to impact outcomes. Bad product recommendations impact retailer profit, and medical decisions can directly impact individual patient lives. 
Vincent C. Müller takes a look at AI and bias in his research paper, “Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,” included in the Summer 2021 edition of “The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.” Fairness in policing is a primary concern, Müller says, noting that human bias exists in the data sets used by police to decide, for example, where to focus patrols or which prisoners are likely to re-offend. 
This kind of “predictive policing,” Müller says, relies heavily on data influenced by cognitive biases, especially confirmation bias, even when the bias is implicit and unknown to human programmers. 
Christina Pazzanese refers to the work of political philosopher Michael Sandel, a professor of government, in her article, “Great promise but potential for peril,” in The Harvard Gazette. 
“Part of the appeal of algorithmic decision-making is that it seems to offer an objective way of overcoming human subjectivity, bias, and prejudice,” Sandel says. “But we are discovering that many of the algorithms that decide who should get parole, for example, or who should be presented with employment opportunities or housing … replicate and embed the biases that already exist in our society.”

2. Why does bias exist in AI? 
To figure out how to remove or at least reduce bias in AI decision-making platforms, we have to consider why it exists in the first place.  
Take the AI chatbot training story in 2016. The chatbot was set up by Microsoft to hold conversations on Twitter, interacting with users through tweets and direct messaging. In other words, the general public had a large part in determining the chatbot’s “personality.” Within a few hours of its release, the chatbot was replying to users with offensive and racist messages, having been trained on anonymous public data, which was immediately co-opted by a group of people. 
The chatbot was heavily influenced in a conscious way, but it’s often not so clear-cut. In their joint article, “What Do We Do About the Biases in AI” in the Harvard Business Review, James Manyika, Jake Silberg, and Brittany Presten say that implicit human biases — those which people don’t realize they hold — can significantly impact AI. 
Bias can creep into algorithms in several ways, the article says. It can include biased human decisions or reflect “historical or social inequities, even if sensitive variables such as gender, race, or sexual orientation are removed.” As an example, the researchers point to Amazon, which stopped using a hiring algorithm after finding it favored applications based on words like “executed” or “captured,” which were more commonly included on men’s resumes. 
Flawed data sampling is another concern, the trio writes, when groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data that teaches AI algorithms to make decisions. For example, facial analysis technologies analyzed by MIT researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru had higher error rates for minorities, especially minority women, potentially due to underrepresented training data. 
3. How can we reduce bias in AI?
In the McKinsey Global Institute article, “Tackling bias in artificial intelligence (and in humans),” Jake Silberg and James Manyika lay out six guidelines AI creators can follow to reduce bias in AI:

Be aware of the contexts in which AI can help correct for bias as well as where there is a high risk that AI could exacerbate bias
Establish processes and practices to test for and mitigate bias in AI systems
Engage in fact-based conversations about potential biases in human decisions
Fully explore how humans and machines can work best together
Invest more in bias research, make more data available for research, while respecting privacy, and adopt a multidisciplinary approach
Invest more in diversifying the AI field itself

The researchers acknowledge that these guidelines won’t eliminate bias altogether, but when applied consistently, they have the potential to significantly improve on the situation.
