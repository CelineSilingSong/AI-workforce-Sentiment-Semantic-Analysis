It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens.Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday.'Unthinkable advances'The prime minister based the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years.In addition, she said the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"".Getty ImagesDeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success storiesHowever, she recognised that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declared that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"".""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she added. ""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May said.This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved.At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could ""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated.Getty ImagesFacebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanityBut Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-like apocalypse ever coming to pass.And earlier this week, Google's former chief Eric Schmidt told the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur.""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained.""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer.""But they are going to be more efficient.""Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masseWhile many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term.Microsoft, for example, has launched a book called The Future Computed to coincide with the Davos event.It proposes that it be given time to develop rules to govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed.Analysis: AmazonMuch of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UKBy Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondentIs the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence?Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that.Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water. Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go.The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy. That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets. Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI. We already have the Alan Turing Institute which has a similar mission. The concern is that while the UK agonises over the implications of this technology, the Chinese will just be getting on with it.Telegram troubleTheresa May also addressed the need for tech firms to tackle terrorism and extremist content during her speech.TelegramTelegram is a privacy-focused chat appShe said Telegram - a privacy-focused chat app - became popular with criminals and terrorists over a short period of time.""We need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this,"" she added.Telegram has previously said it is ""no friend of terrorists"" and blocked channels used by extremists.In addition, the prime minister called on tech company investors to play their part by demanding that trust and safety issues be considered.'Superhuman' Google AI claims chess crownCES 2018: Can AI deliver for humans?Seeing suitcase and other AI gadgets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But successfully putting AI into action isn't exactly a walk in the park -- it requires a fundamental rethinking of the business. The pressure is on -- 53 percent of executives responding to a recent survey said their industry has ""already experienced disruption"" due to AI. An example that applies to potential AI-driven disruption in the retail sector is Amazon's Go store in Seattle, which employs AI to operate with no checkout clerks or lines -- purchases are tracked as shoppers remove items from the shelves.








Building from the inside out with AI

Along with signaling disruption, a recent survey of 1,000 business and IT leaders commissioned by Infosys which finds AI -- as we know it today -- has moved beyond the experimentation stage, and is delivering real benefits. The vast majority of the executives surveyed, 86 percent, say their organizations surveyed have ""middle"" or ""late-stage"" AI deployments, and view AI as a major facilitator of future business operations. In addition, 73 percent agreed or strongly agreed that their AI deployments have already transformed the way they do business, and 90 percent of C-level executives reported measurable benefits from AI within their organizations.
Believe it or not, AI is more than just automation. While a majority of organizations in the survey, 66 percent, start off using AI to automate routine or inefficient processes, it becomes a factor in innovation and differentiation as time goes on and experience is gained. For example, 80 percent of IT decision makers at organizations in later stages of AI deployment reported that they are using AI to augment existing solutions, or build new business-critical solutions and services to optimize insights and the consumer experience. The same percentage of C-level executives said their future business strategy ""will be informed through opportunities made available with AI technology."" Another 42 percent also expect significant impact in research and development in the next five years.
PROMOTED
As Mohit Joshi, president of Infosys, puts it in the forward to the report: ""So far, the arc of AI leans toward empowerment and giving humans the tools necessary to automate redundant tasks, detect and analyze hidden patterns in data and generally make possible revolutionary insights that will make our lives better.""
As mentioned above, AI is already becoming a disruptive force. Two-thirds of executives in the telecom sector say AI is disrupting their industry, along with 63 percent of banking and insurance executives. A majority of retailers, 54%, also are feeling the impact. (Amazon Go, mentioned above, is just one example.) The only industry not feeling the heat from AI is public sector or governmental organizations.
If AI is a disruptive force, it will act as any disruptive force will, and threaten the very existence of companies that don't keep up with more nimble competitors.  By extension, yes, it is a job-killer. However, at the same time, it opens up new opportunities for forward-looking companies and startups -- and all the employees they hire -- to adopt new ways of thinking, new ways to better meet the needs of customers -- rapidly and assuredly.

Incredibly enough, a majority of enterprises appear to be taking actions to assure their employees' job futures as AI takes hold across basic decision-making functions. No less than 53 percent of respondents report their organizations have increased training in the job functions most affected by AI deployments. Even more are sympathetic and optimistic that AI will enrich, not replace, jobs. Seventy-seven percent were confident that employees in their organizations could be trained for the new job roles AI technologies will create.
Ironically, it is the implementors of AI, the IT departments, who are seeing AI impinging the most upon their jobs.  IT (61 percent) will continue to be the most affected job function over the next five years, as indicated by 61 percent. However, AI is beginning to have a growing impact on marketing and communications (32 percent), human resources (29 percent) and legal departments (15 percent) as well. AI leaders will become fixtures in the C-suite and throughout the organization as an overwhelming majority (95 percent) of IT decision makers from organizations in the late stages of digital transformation said that their organization plans to have a dedicated team of AI professionals.
Business leaders are optimistic that AI technologies will ultimately create more opportunity for employees than they will eliminate, with C-level executives widely agreeing that AI technologies will have a positive effect on their workforce (70%) and equally benefit customers (45 percent) and employees (43 percent).
Sixty-nine percent of C-level executives reported that employees within their organization are concerned AI technologies will replace them. However, 48 percent believe AI has augmented human skills to make their people better at their work, and 45 percent said AI is freeing up employees' time for higher value work.
A majority of business leaders, 80 percent, were confident that their executive teams have the ability to adapt their leadership skills as AI technologies are adopted. Executive training is still called for, with three-fourths of IT decision makers felt that their executives would benefit from formal training on the implications of AI technologies.
Alain Dehaze, CEO of The Adecco Group, a global staffing company, prefers to call AI ""augmented intelligence,"" noting that once blended with human input, will bring about ""a deeper focus on innately human skills – critical thinking, emotional intelligence and value judgments. In the platform economy, technology is connecting people of all backgrounds and abilities with more opportunities. It is also accelerating the employment of both skilled and unskilled workers in the era of digital transformation, making the world work for everyone.""
What stands in the way of this glorious future of AI-driven organizations? Data, or not the right kind of data. Nearly half of IT decision makers (49 percent) reported that their organization is unable to deploy the AI technologies they want because their data is not ready to support the requirements of AI technologies. The opaqueness of AI's internal processes also bothers executives, and a majority of executives, 52 percent, worry about losing transparency into their business.Joe McKendrickFollowingFollowI am an author, independent researcher and speaker exploring innovation, information technology trends and markets.

Pressure for using AI responsibly won’t be on tech companies alone. Invasion of privacy, algorithmic bias, environmental damage, threats to brands and the bottom line — the fears around AI are numerous. Fortunately, a global consensus is emerging around what constitutes responsible AI. These principles can safeguard organizations — and position them to reap economic benefits. Public- and private-sector institutions are likely to collaborate on AI’s societal impact, and collaboration among businesses in self-regulatory organizations may also take root.

AI will hit employers before it affects employment. AI probably won’t devastate the job market in the long run — and it certainly won’t do so in 2018. But it will change the nature of work. Job losses in certain industries, especially in roles with manual and repetitive tasks, will be offset by new jobs that are performed by centaurs: human–machine hybrids. To prepare, businesses will need to bring together teams and data from different disciplines, and many organizations will also need to start retooling.

AI will ramp up its presence in the workplace. AI is already automating increasingly complex processes, identifying trends to create business value, and providing forward-looking intelligence. The result? Less busywork for humans and better strategic decisions. Organizations will want to home in on specific problems they can solve with AI as well as consider new measures to assess business value.

AI will help answer the big ROI question about data. Many investments in data technology and integration have failed to answer the big question: What’s the return on investment for big data initiatives? However, with data now being used to solve specific business problems, AI solutions that draw more heavily on data will become easier to develop and fund. The catch? Some organizations are still struggling with data fundamentals. This year, businesses need to finally get their data infrastructure in order.

Technologists alone won’t decide the AI talent race. There’s a bidding war right now for computer scientists, but they won’t be the deciding factor in AI success. Companies will face an increasing need for domain experts: retail analysts, engineers, accountants, and others who know how to prepare and contextualize data, and who can work with AI and AI experts. Organizations will need to find ways to train these employees in the specific data skills they need.

Because of AI, cyberattacks will be more damaging — and cyberdefense will be more effective. Techniques such as advanced machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks enable computers to find and interpret patterns. They can also allow hackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities. If an organization’s IT department or cybersecurity provider isn’t already using AI, it has to start thinking immediately about AI’s short- and long-term security applications. Cyberdefense may be the portal through which many enterprises get their first taste of AI.

Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. Users may not trust AI if they can’t understand how it makes decisions. Companies will face growing pressure from end users, clients, and regulators to deploy AI that is explainable, transparent, and provable. However, documenting and explaining every step makes the process slower and more expensive. Companies will need a framework to assess concerns around business, performance, regulatory, and reputation to determine how much information each AI application should produce about its decisions.

Nations will spar over AI. Countries, not just companies, are competing on AI, with many governments working to make sure their countries lay claim to a big piece of the pie. China is investing especially heavily and may soon take the lead. Canada, Japan, the U.K., Germany, and the UAE are also moving fast. In some areas, international collaboration is on the horizon. Companies will need to keep an eye on the international competition, and governments will need to increase funding.

AI will hit employers before it affects employment. AI probably won’t devastate the job market in the long run — and it certainly won’t do so in 2018. But it will change the nature of work. Job losses in certain industries, especially in roles with manual and repetitive tasks, will be offset by new jobs that are performed by centaurs: human–machine hybrids. To prepare, businesses will need to bring together teams and data from different disciplines, and many organizations will also need to start retooling.

AI will ramp up its presence in the workplace. AI is already automating increasingly complex processes, identifying trends to create business value, and providing forward-looking intelligence. The result? Less busywork for humans and better strategic decisions. Organizations will want to home in on specific problems they can solve with AI as well as consider new measures to assess business value.

AI will help answer the big ROI question about data. Many investments in data technology and integration have failed to answer the big question: What’s the return on investment for big data initiatives? However, with data now being used to solve specific business problems, AI solutions that draw more heavily on data will become easier to develop and fund. The catch? Some organizations are still struggling with data fundamentals. This year, businesses need to finally get their data infrastructure in order.

Technologists alone won’t decide the AI talent race. There’s a bidding war right now for computer scientists, but they won’t be the deciding factor in AI success. Companies will face an increasing need for domain experts: retail analysts, engineers, accountants, and others who know how to prepare and contextualize data, and who can work with AI and AI experts. Organizations will need to find ways to train these employees in the specific data skills they need.

Because of AI, cyberattacks will be more damaging — and cyberdefense will be more effective. Techniques such as advanced machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks enable computers to find and interpret patterns. They can also allow hackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities. If an organization’s IT department or cybersecurity provider isn’t already using AI, it has to start thinking immediately about AI’s short- and long-term security applications. Cyberdefense may be the portal through which many enterprises get their first taste of AI.

Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. Users may not trust AI if they can’t understand how it makes decisions. Companies will face growing pressure from end users, clients, and regulators to deploy AI that is explainable, transparent, and provable. However, documenting and explaining every step makes the process slower and more expensive. Companies will need a framework to assess concerns around business, performance, regulatory, and reputation to determine how much information each AI application should produce about its decisions.

Nations will spar over AI. Countries, not just companies, are competing on AI, with many governments working to make sure their countries lay claim to a big piece of the pie. China is investing especially heavily and may soon take the lead. Canada, Japan, the U.K., Germany, and the UAE are also moving fast. In some areas, international collaboration is on the horizon. Companies will need to keep an eye on the international competition, and governments will need to increase funding.

Pressure for using AI responsibly won’t be on tech companies alone. Invasion of privacy, algorithmic bias, environmental damage, threats to brands and the bottom line — the fears around AI are numerous. Fortunately, a global consensus is emerging around what constitutes responsible AI. These principles can safeguard organizations — and position them to reap economic benefits. Public- and private-sector institutions are likely to collaborate on AI’s societal impact, and collaboration among businesses in self-regulatory organizations may also take root.

Work, speaking on the Center for a New American Security’s Brussel Sprouts podcast on Jan. 9, explained that while the acquisition hierarchy within the Pentagon is changing, thinking within the department regarding the Third Offset remains consistent with his original vision. The Third Offset was a plan, led by Work, to address the erosion of the U.S. military’s technological superiority and focused on technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and data analytics. “You are going to see the strategic capabilities office continue, DIUx continue … I believe we are going to see an AI Center of Excellence, or something like that,” Work said. Such a center would help the department cement relationships with research universities, laboratories, and the commercial sector that are driving technological innovation in AI. According to Work, “the DOD already has over 100 different relationships with universities, there are University Affiliated Research Centers, like Johns Hopkins applied physics lab and Lincoln Labs.” By tapping into these talent sources, Work said he hopes the United States will be able to be a leader in AI innovation and autonomous technology. The former deputy secretary warned his successors that, “if you cannot tap into [those sources], then there is no way you’re going to be the fast leader you need to be in this very competitive environment. There are going to be lots of fast followers because this stuff is going to be available to anybody because it is primarily commercial so you want to be the fast leader and have people responding to you rather than reacting to them.” Work has previously explained his vision for AI and autonomous technology as being more like Iron Man than the Terminator, but also discussed innovative ways AI can be used to strengthen the NATO alliance.Because AI and other methods of algorithmic warfare are much less expensive than conventional weapon systems, “even the smallest country can add a lot of value to [a potential] NATO operational fires network because [they] have this algorithm that will make the communications go faster and will change automatically security levels and change automatically English to French and French to German. So I think it’s an extremely alliance friendly offset strategy and hopefully we’ll start talking and seeing some real meat on the bones in NATO.”About  Daniel CebulDaniel Cebul is an editorial fellow and general assignments writer for Defense News, C4ISRNET, Fifth Domain and Federal Times.Share:More In Intel/GEOINTSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",Intel/GEOINT,C4ISRNet,,,,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,https://www.c4isrnet.com/intel-geoint/2018/01/23/bob-work-has-an-idea-to-improve-artificial-intelligence/,,,,,,,,

Professor Lee Cronin, from the University of Glasgow, recently visited Imperial to present some of his new multidisciplinary 'chemputing' research.
Professor Cronin’s exciting, popular and somewhat controversial talk was the latest in the 2017–18 Highlight Seminar Series from Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering (IMSE). Through this series, the Institute brings eminent speakers to Imperial to discuss cutting-edge work that spans the interface between molecular science and engineering.



Every chemist needs to become an engineer, and every engineer needs to become a chemist.
– Professor Lee Cronin
University of Glasgow Regius Chair of Chemistry




As a pioneer in the so-called chemputing space, Professor Cronin has many ambitious goals. Most formidable, perhaps, is his quest to create artificial life in the laboratory. In this IMSE Highlight Seminar, however, he focused on two different aspects of his work: artificial-intelligence-driven synthesis and the digitisation of chemistry.
Professor Cronin sees the lack of reproducibility in chemical synthesis as one of the major problems in chemistry. Given the modern digital tools available to researchers, however, he believes that this is something that should – and can – change.
3D-printing chemistry
Professor Cronin and his collaborators have thus been working to devise new methods – combining computer programing and 3D printing technologies – to increase the universality of chemical synthesis processes. The value of 3D printing – also known as additive manufacturing – is already widely recognised, especially in the aerospace, medical device and automotive industries. In his work, however, Professor Cronin, is using these modern printing techniques in an innovative, non-standard way to do chemistry.

By combining aspects of chemistry and chemical engineering, Professor Cronin’s group have already developed a methodology for autonomous 3D printing of ibuprofen. To do this, they use process-control software to fabricate the reactionware, as well as a computer script that prescribes the chemical processing and synthesis steps. 
More recently, in brand-new work published in Science, Professor Cronin and his co-authors have successfully demonstrated their digital chemistry methods for relatively complex chemical synthesis schemes. Looking to the future, this kind of approach could allow specific chemicals to be fabricated, in a simple and cheap manner, by the masses – thus adding a certain level of resilience to the pharmaceutical industry, for example.
Marrying artificial intelligence and chemistry
In the second part of his talk, Professor Cronin spoke about another strand of his research – that of discovery. In particular, Professor Cronin is driven to explore chemical space, in an unbiased way, to find truly novel molecules.




Professor Lee Cronin




For example, he and his team have recently published work in which they used a robot equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) to autonomously create a range of oil-in-water droplets and to evaluate their behaviour with image recognition methods. As the behaviour of the droplets is sensitive to the precise formulation of the oil and water mixtures, the observation of unpredictable, yet desirable properties can lead to the discovery of novel and useful compositions. Furthermore, as the whole system is digitised, it is simple to manufacture the oil-in-water droplets, with exactly the same optimised properties, again and again.
“This work is particularly exciting because it shows we can use machine learning and a novel robotic platform to understand a system in a way that cannot be achieved with conventional laboratory methods”, explained Professor Cronin.
Going forward
Ideally, Professor Cronin would love to create a capable system where he can “let the robot do all the hard work, and leave me with time to think up new ideas”. He is also excited about using AI to help chemists explore new molecules, and sees the Dial-A-Molecule EPSRC Grand Challenge Network at Imperial as a natural place to collaborate. Ultimately, it is his aim to make cheap hardware and software for discovery and synthetic chemistry accessible to everyone.
Upcoming IMSE seminars
IMSE’s Highlight Seminar Series will continue on 22 February 2018 when Professor Jas Pal Badyal FRS (Durham University) will speak on ‘Functional nanocoatings for technological and societal applications’. The full Series is available here.

“I can’t help you with that right now. But I am always learning”
My family has a digital assistant working in our home that is incredibly smart, never takes a break, and never complains about its job. Recently, we purchased a Google Home mini to integrate with other smart products in our home, and my family has found some fun ways to use it, especially with our toddler.
My son is learning different animal sounds, and his favorite sound to make is “moo.” We discovered that our Google Home will make animal noises on command, and he loves to hear its sounds. A few weeks back, we asked our Google Home to make a number of different animal sounds, and it’s response to one that it couldn’t find struck me. “I can’t help you with that right now. But I am always learning.”
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging field of technology defined as non-biological intelligence, where a machine is programmed to accomplish complex goals. Popularly known examples are Google Home, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. But there are far more advanced AI systems than these being used in a variety of applications, such as business, medicine, and finance.
Recently, a set of videos went viral on the internet from Google’s DeepMind and Boston Dynamics. These AI based systems were doing things that astonished most viewers and even many in the AI field. From an AI teaching itself how to walk and jump without human intervention to a humanoid robot doing back flips and crossing rough terrain, AI systems have become so advanced that many are starting to wonder what these systems will be able to accomplish in the future as they become smarter and human intervention becomes less necessary. This is not a sci-fi fantasy. It’s reality.
Not just fun and games
The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in the 1956 by John McCarthy, who is considered the father of AI. That year he organized the “The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence,” which was a gathering of experts for brainstorming about the reality of AI. In the last few years, the complexity of these systems has grown faster than most believed possible.
Google’s DeepMind created an AI system called AlphaGo that recently dethroned the reigning Go champion. Go is an ancient abstract strategy board game that is played on 19×19 inch board with black and white stones. The game was created over 2,500 years ago in China and is still played by over 40 million people in 75 different countries. The game is extremely complex even though it has very simple rules. It is believed that there are at least 2 x 10170² possible moves on the game board which leads most players to use their intuition rather than rote memory to win the game.
Prior AI was developed using “expert systems” that had not been able to take on a challenge like the game of Go based on complexity. These systems dealt with facts rather than ideas. Examples are IBM’s Watson and Deep Blue that played chess. They became “experts” for a given problem but were not able to transcend the task they were designed to accomplish, meaning they could not be applied to other tasks.
The AlphaGo project was formed by Google’s DeepMind around 2014 to research the ability of AI systems to use “deep neural networks” for learning rather than expert systems. This type of machine learning was new to the AI field because it was programmed to function similar to a human brain. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat world champion Lee Sedol 4 to 1 in a 5-game match. AlphaGo surpassed all expectations for AI systems and helped show what the future of AI might hold. The possibilities are seemingly limitless for what AI is able to learn to do.
AI and work?
We might be tempted to think that AI systems are sci-fi fun and games, but AI is so much more. One example is how AI systems are revolutionizing our workforce through various types of automation and data processing that leads many AI researchers, government heads, and industry leaders to question how we have thought about the workforce and the role of computer systems. Many jobs previously thought untouchable by machines are now on the brink of being augmented by or replaced completely by AI in the near future.
AI systems are being used to supplement, and in many cases, take over entire factories. An AI system is able to do the jobs of thousands of factory workers while working 24/7 without breaks. These systems are often overseen by a single operator and a few human workers that clean up after the robots. These AI-based factories are producing higher quality products at rates that far exceed that of their human counterparts and are doing all of this cheaper, making the company more money. Many people have been put out of work because of these advanced systems, and the rate of job replacement is projected to continue exponentially as AI continues to learn and grow ever more complex.
Many researchers and developers now proclaim that we have entered the “second machine age” where machines can rival their human counterparts in many areas never thought possible.

The church must be proactive in learning about Artificial Intelligence, as well as participating in the larger discussion about the future of AI research and development.

Expendable humanity?
While a complete AI takeover of society is not imminent, it is very likely that within the next 20-50 years we will see society completely revolutionized by these systems. From the workforce to healthcare and art, the influence of AI is growing at an exponential rate. The church must be proactive in learning about Artificial Intelligence, as well as participating in the larger discussion about the future of AI research and development.
Large groups of AI researchers and technology giants are now gathering to discuss AI safety research and how we want to implement this technology in the future. Most of these discussions revolve around the concept of human dignity in light of the rise of stronger AI systems. Topics range from upgrading humanity with machine components allowing us to live longer or perform tasks outside of basic human ability and strength, to how an AI system is to be treated by society as these systems are beginning to function more autonomously. What role should AI systems have in government, military, and business applications? Do AI systems live under the same type of morality code that we as humans have as a society? Should these machines be treated similar to humans with basic rights if they are able to outperform humans in many tasks or surpass human knowledge?
The church has the ability to be a part of these discussions much earlier than most ethical issues that we have faced in the past, such as the horror of abortion. In the 1970s, many evangelicals did not speak out against abortion and its legalization, yet now are boldly advocating for pro-life legislation and caring for women in crisis pregnancy situations. Today, instead of being reactive to technological trends, we should seek to be proactive in these discussions, proclaiming that human dignity is not based on what we do but on who we are as created in the image of God. AI systems and machines might one day outperform us in every type of task and maybe even replace us in the workplace, but they will never have a soul and will never be able overtake their creators in terms of dignity and worth.
AI is always learning, the question is, how will we respond?

As far-reaching as the previous industrial revolutions were, they never set free such enormous transformative power. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming practically every human activity: the way we make things; the way we use the resources of our planet; the way we communicate and interact with each other as humans; the way we learn; the way we work; the way we govern; and the way we do business. Its scope, speed and reach are unprecedented. Think of it: Just 10 years ago, there was no such thing as a smartphone. Today, no one leaves home without it. Just a few decades ago, the internet connected computers at just a few sites. Today, practically every human being can connect to a network that spans the entire globe and provides access to the greatest repository of information and knowledge ever created by humankind. Enormous power entails enormous risk. Yes, the stakes are high. If we get the revolution right, digitalization will benefit the nearly 10 billion humans inhabiting our planet in the year 2050. If we get it wrong, societies will be divided into winners and losers, social unrest and anarchy will arise, the glue that holds societies and communities together will disintegrate, and citizens will no longer believe that governments are able to fulfill their purpose of enforcing the rule of law and providing security. That's why the Fourth Industrial Revolution is not just about technology or business; it's about society. It is fascinating when a computer beats the best human GO player, when bots write texts, and machines ""talk"" to each other. Nevertheless, we humans define the algorithms that govern machines and not the other way around. And make no mistake about it: we are now writing the code that will shape our collective future. That's happening in manufacturing right now. What we call Industrie 4.0 enables manufacturers to create a ""digital twin"" of the entire manufacturing environment – from lab to factory floor, from showroom to service. Manufacturers can design, simulate, and test sophisticated products in the virtual domain before making the first physical prototype, before setting up production lines, and before starting actual production. Software helps optimize every process and every task, whether performed by humans or machines. Once everything works in the virtual world, the results are transferred to the physical world, the machines, and they close the loop by reporting back to the virtual world. This seamless integration of the virtual and the physical worlds in so-called cyber-physical systems – that is the giant leap we see today. It eclipses everything that has happened in industry so far. As in previous industrial revolutions but on a much larger scale, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will eliminate millions of jobs and create millions of new jobs. And because manufacturing accounts for 70% of global trade, this really is about ""the wealth of nations"", to quote Adam Smith. That raises the question: what can we do to make sure as many citizens as possible benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution? First, we can learn from the past and lay the conceptual foundation for an inclusive society. In the middle of the 20th century, thought leaders such as the economist Alfred Müller-Armack developed the so-called social market economy, Germany's model of success to this day. He envisioned an open society that aims to ""unite the principle of the free market with that of the fair distribution of prosperity"". This vision is more relevant today than ever before because it points the way to an inclusive form of capitalism and to a sustainable model of economic and social well-being. I believe that the next step on the path to inclusiveness is to significantly raise standards for business as far as social responsibility and sustainability are concerned. Contrary to Milton Friedman's maxim, the business of business should not just be business. Shareholder value alone should not be the yardstick. Instead, we should make stakeholder value, or better yet, social value, the benchmark for a company’s performance. Today, stakeholders – customers, shareholders, suppliers, employees, political leaders, society as a whole – rightfully expect companies to assume greater social responsibility, for example, by protecting the climate, fighting for social justice, aiding refugees, and training and educating workers. The business of business should be to create value for society. At Siemens, we call this ""business to society"".Second, because the Fourth Industrial Revolution runs on knowledge, we need a concurrent revolution in training and education. Here, both government and business must join forces to provide workers with the skills and qualifications they need to participate in the digital economy, for instance, by being able to tap the opportunities created by artificial intelligence. If the workforce doesn't keep up with advances in knowledge throughout their lives, how will the millions of new jobs be filled?Third, we must encourage innovation and the ability to adapt. Digitalization has demonstrated its disruptive power in the past; it has turned entire industries upside down. You know the saying, ""The internet cuts out the middleman"". Digital technologies enable completely new business models – and now we see that they enable new social models. One of these is the sharing economy. It challenges one of the fundamental precepts of our economic order: the prominent role of property. Whether you consider this good or bad, it’s reality. Fourth, as leaders we must summon the courage to address the tough questions. And there are plenty of them. How can we secure the future of those whose jobs will be eliminated by machines? Do we need a guaranteed basic income? Should we impose taxes on software and robots? Do companies that provide global IT platforms have to comply with national rules and regulations? If so, how can they be enforced? What freedoms and rights should individuals have in the digital age?These are the tough questions we face today. And I don't think longing for the alleged ""good old days"" will yield good answers. In his book ""Retrotopia"", the Polish sociologist and philosopher Zygmunt Bauman maintains that many have lost all faith in the idea of building a future society and turn to the ideas of the past, buried but not dead. Instead, we should look forward, point out both the opportunities and risks of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and then roll up our sleeves and create answers that really work for us and future generations.

By all accounts, the store is a technological marvel: Instead of checking out, shoppers check in with their cell phones at a series of gates that resemble those used for subways. When they're finished, shoppers exit through the same gates without the need to pull out a credit card or cash. Instead, the items are simply charged to the shopper's Amazon account. The ease of one-click-purchasing brought to a bricks-and-mortars experience, thanks to sensors and artificial intelligence systems powering the store.For some, this represents a fun technological novelty offering more convenience for busy professionals.

Will the technology that powers Amazon Go lead to 3.5 million cashiers to lose their jobs?By now, it is almost routine to see columns sounding the alarm about millions of existing jobs at risk of being automated. However, the real risk is that we do not have a system ready to equip people with the skills needed to fill millions of new and modified jobs that will result from the rise of AI.AI is going to change the labor market in three important ways. First, automation will erode jobs further up the skills ladder. For example, Enlitic uses AI to analyze medical images such as with CT scans. In a test against three expert radiologists, Enlitic's system was 50 percent better at classifying tumors and had a false-negative rate of zero, compared to 7 percent for the human experts.Second, AI will redefine many existing jobs. A Burning Glass analysis found a surge of ""hybrid jobs"" that blend technical skills with other skills or domains. For example, digital marketing combines technological tools with the domain of marketing. American manufacturers are now posting more jobs for software developers and engineers than production workers.Third, AI will raise the skill level required for all jobs. Low-skilled jobs become higher-skilled when evolving AI tools become part of the work. Those who were formerly cashiers are still needed at an Amazon Go store, but for higher-skilled roles such as customer assistance. Human capital from education and training programs will depreciate at a faster pace, requiring continuous upgrading of skills to keep pace with the ways AI changes job functions.The Best Cartoons on the EconomyView All 221 ImagesYes, some jobs will be eliminated as part of this wave of automation. But the more pressing threat is that the country is woefully unprepared to equip individuals with the skills required to fill millions of jobs that will either be created or already exist but will evolve. We already see glimpses of this within labor market and wage data. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, 54 percent of small-business owners reported difficulty finding qualified workers. New jobs are also demanding higher levels of skills. The Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that over 95 percent of jobs created after the Great Recession went to workers with at least some college education. That, in turn, is driving up wages for higher-skilled jobs. The average income difference between those who have a college degree and those who don't has never been larger. That gap will widen unless our workforce system becomes more agile in responding to employer needs and more flexible in serving students across all ages and backgrounds. K-12 students will need multiple pathways to careers, not just college. Alex Hernandez, a partner at Charter School Growth Fund, compares our current education system to a game of ""Chutes and Ladders,"" where career and technical education has been a chute, ""an off-ramp for students who ... were not succeeding in 'traditional' education."" Career and Technical Education should become an option for all students, not just for those that the system has sorted as not being ready for college. For example, Carmen Schools of Science & Technology offers career-preparation programs to all students. In addition to traditional high school classes, students can earn certifications and college credits and even participate in apprenticeships with local companies. Promising models like Kenzie are also worth considering. The new Indianapolis-based venture is creating a new type of program that combines work and school to teach nontechies, between the ages of 19 and 40, how to do software engineering. Students initially spend four hours a week learning programming, mostly through projects instead of lectures. At the end of six months, students will have enough training to be junior front-end developers, and then junior full-stack developers after another six months. Kenzie also offers a paid apprenticeship program where ""Kenzie Studio Fellows"" work on projects for companies. That's important for giving students real-life work experience, but also in helping with student placement. A student could conceivably work for an employer for 18 months before being hired.Humans Can Survive RobotsRobot alarmists discount history, capitalism and our ability to adapt.Brian Hamilton Oct. 18, 2017While it's necessary to create more opportunities for people to learn new skills, it's also important to train companies to hire people based on skills. Opportunity@Work is developing pathways for overlooked Americans to gain skills that will open access to technical jobs around the country. Their TechHire initiative creates local ecosystems with job seekers, training providers, and employers working to identify needed skills and open positions, along with the training to secure those skills, and a system to verify the attainment of those skills. They are also working with employers to move past rough proxies of skills, such as college degrees and years of experience, and instead describe the specific skills needed for a job.All three of these programs have some common features. First, while the skills gap may be a national problem, skills-training partnerships must be local to reflect regional employer needs. Second, these programs leverage project-based work, often with real employers, not only to better engage students but to ensure the curriculum is current and relevant. Finally, many of these systems are leveraging Income Share Agreements, which create a financial incentive for the providers to ensure students are employable and, ultimately, hired. Policymakers, employers and community leaders must come together to not only improve the existing education and workforce system but also experiment with new models and approaches to help meet the diverse needs of employers and workers.Tags: robots, economy, Amazon.comRead MoreMore OpinionOpinionWe Can Engage Turned-Off Youth Voters.OpinionPolitics 'Silly Season' Roils the WorldOpinionIt’s Not Just About You, America",,,,,2018-01-23T13:45-0500,,,,,,,,,1030.0,"Amazon Go, a cashier- and cash-free shopping experience from Amazon, officially launched this week.

 Five Key Trends in AI and Data Science for 2024 | Thomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean















If you were a brilliant artificial intelligence (AI) expert just graduating from a doctoral program at a prestigious school, would you pursue that startup you’ve been thinking about, join a company that wants to build cutting-edge AI applications, or use your expertise to help scientists in other fields conduct basic research? 
Admittedly, this is a bit of a silly question. The opportunities presented by the first two options are outrageous, and growing more outrageous by the day. With more than 2,000 startups absorbing much of the top-tier AI talent — estimated by some to be just 10,000 individuals worldwide — the combination of great scarcity and even greater demand for talent is driving salaries through industry roofs. Some businesses offer seven-figure compensation packages for elite AI talent. 
Plus, it’s never been a better time to launch an AI startup. Investment in AI-focused ventures has grown 1,800% in just six years, from $282 million in 2011 to more than $5 billion in 2016, according to CB Insights.
The sanity behind these numbers comes, in part, from the fact that companies expect AI to allow them to move into new business segments or to maintain their competitive advantage in their industry. Driving this expectation is the idea that AI will enable them to dramatically improve the efficiency or effectiveness of their operations and offerings.
Despite the lucrative financial opportunities in these first two career paths, the alternative choice — to collaborate with scientists in other fields — may be more pivotal to how nations and businesses compete over the long term. 
Conventional wisdom, based on no small amount of research, holds that AI-driven automation will create technological unemployment in a variety of sectors in the next five to 10 years. Optimists believe that this won’t be a big deal for the labor sector as a whole because corporate adoption of AI (and other digital trends) will create new industries and new job categories that will replace whatever AI-driven losses occur in labor sectors of the current economy. But there are two open questions about this hypothesis:

How will these new industries be created?
How soon will they come, if they come at all?

The creation of new industries frequently depends on dramatic advances in science and technology that can take decades to move from discovery to commercial application to new industry.

Am going to speak on more psychological part of AI and impact on the senior generation.

There have been many skeptics when it comes to AI and creation of new job opportunities.  

No doubt that AI; using a more creative approach; will benefit many people especially the younger generation. 

To some ""older"" generation, AI seem to create more fear rather than ""good news"" - fear of being left behind, the fear of being terminated and fear of having to learn something more advanced etc. 

Despite these may not be accurate at some point, the need to  be more creative and most importantly; sending the right information to the prevailing workforce especially those who have served for too many years.

Again, as I speak now, with all due respect; I still see some corporations and manufacturers are using AI as an easy path to ""sack"" more workers under the pretext of ""cutting cost"".

Perhaps a more friendlier way to approach this delicate matter is required. For example, designing the AI elements to be more user-friendly which comes together with induction, reassignment or review of current job description to match the AI requirements, transfer of staff to branches or other units/departments etc. 

After all, spending on AI is always linked to profitable corporations which definitely  have branches nation or worldwide.

Create a blue rather than red ocean in the context of AI.

If this issue is not properly addressed, then the wrong perspective will go on forever. It will not be in line with the technological advancement era.

Just my 2 cents worth.

So useful, in fact, that we are left to wonder why so anyone might be bothered with the advancement of physical robotics when software seems to really do it all.Trending AI Articles:1. Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data2. Data Science Simplified Part 1: Principles and Process3. Getting Started with Building Realtime API InfrastructureWith artificial intelligence on IoT on the rise, is there really a market for physical robotics any more? Let’s take a closer look at how we use these two technologies today.The Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and RoboticsIs AI part of robotics? Is robotics part of AI? What exactly is the difference between these two terms?You’ve probably seen the two used interchangeably in a variety of settings, adding to the widespread confusion. We can blame pop culture for this one.Artificial intelligence and robotics serve two very different purposes. However, it is not uncommon for people to get them confused. This may be because the overlap between them that gets the vast amount of the media’s attention: Artificially Intelligent Robots.Let’s set the record straight.Artificial IntelligenceAI, or artificial intelligence, is a branch of computer science. This branch involves the development of software programs to complete specific tasks that would otherwise depend on human intelligence. The main goal of AI algorithms is to tackle logical reasoning, language understanding, problem-solving, perception, and learning.AI is used all around us in our modern world. For example, AI algorithms are used in SatNav route finders, Amazon’s recommendation engine, and Google Searches.Most of the AI programs used today do not control robots. And when AI is used in robotic technology, AI algorithms are only a piece of a larger robotic system.RoboticsTo put it simply, robotics is the branch of technology that handles robots. Robots are known as programmable machines. These machines carry out certain actions autonomously and semi-autonomously.We can typically classify a technology as a robot if it meets these 3 components:Robots have the ability to interact with the world around them via actuators and sensors.Robots are programmable.Robots perform semi-autonomous and autonomous actions.It is not unusual to hear experts argue over just what constitutes a “robot”. Some people believe that robots must be able to “think” for itself and make decisions.However, requiring that a robot “thinks” suggest that it holds some level of artificial intelligence. While robots can be implemented with AI technology, AI alone is not grounds for a robotic classification.Artificially Intelligent RobotsRobots that are artificially intelligent bridge the gap between AI and robotics. AI software and programs control these robots.Most robots today are not artificially intelligent. Until recently, industrially designed robots could only carry out a series of repetitive movements based on programming. As mentioned previously, repetitive motions do not require the use of artificial intelligence.Therefore, robots without intelligence are rather limited in functionality. To allow a robot to perform tasks that are more complex AI algorithms are required.However, AI robots are not completely unheard of.Sophia, the artificially intelligent robot designed by Hanson Robotics, stunned the world this past year (2017) and it wasn’t just in regards to her ability to converse and speak her mind. The fact that she was given a national citizenship had the world wondering if this type of technology is really necessary and how it might affect our future.Looking ForwardIs it possible that robots will change the way that we live? It’s an interesting question to ask when robots are already shaping the way that we live today. From the first time that the world saw a toaster pop up by itself, we’ve accepted the fact that robots can be trusted to perform certain actions that make our lives easier.Today robots run our cars, play our music, cook our food, and record our shows. Many of us simply don’t realize it because they don’t have a face that we can talk to.Technically speaking, robots are simply automatic motorized tools that are programmed to perform specific physical actions. The key here is physical because AI intelligence by itself does not concern itself with physical actions.While flashy AI robots like Sophia can be a little unnerving, to say the least, it’s more about the technology behind her and how it can be applied to change our future for the better. We’re not just talking entertainment, think about real physical labor in dangerous places, elderly care, and even a telepresence in tourism, shopping, and assistance.Imagine sitting at home on your computer and walking a video game character through a market or mall, except it’s not a game, it’s a personal robot shopping for you in London while you sit comfortably in New York. Imagine a robot’s ability to assist at a disaster site, clean up wreckage from a highway in just seconds, and provide relief assistance to the elderly and less-abled.In today’s day in age, modern technology is designed to bring the world to you through the Internet, our televisions and phones, but if this trend continues, robots will soon have the ability to bring you to the world — all at a speed of thought.So do we need physical robots when we have AI on IoT technology?The answer is yes. While the two has existed separately for some time now, we can only watch and wait to see just what robotics, AI, and IoT technology will shape the way that we approach problems, care for others, and live our daily life.",,Do we need physical robots or AI on IoT will do the job?,,,2018-01-24T14:12:16.749Z,,,['Munawar Abadullah'],,,,,,,,b29faabd2d10,,,,

Doxel Introduces AI Solution to Boost Construction Industry 
      Productivity




Andreessen Horowitz Leads Investment in Computer Vision and 
      Artificial Intelligence Disruptor






January 24, 2018 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Approximately $10 trillion is spent every year on the construction 
      industry – 13 percent of the global GDP – yet productivity levels for 
      this industry have trailed other sectors for decades.
    
.@Doxel_ai introduces #AI solution to boost #construction industry productivity; #VC round led by @a16zPost this

      Addressing this enormous challenge, Doxel today unveiled an artificial 
      intelligence and computer vision-based system that delivers significant 
      productivity increases to commercial construction projects. Doxel uses 
      autonomous devices to visually monitor every inch of a project, then 
      feeds this data to its proprietary deep learning algorithms. The 
      algorithms then inspect the quality of installed work and measure 
      installed quantities in real time. This enables project managers to 
      react to inefficiencies almost immediately and boost productivity as 
      much as fifty percent.
    

      In addition, Doxel announced a $4.5 million investment led by Andreessen 
      Horowitz, with Alchemist Accelerator, Pear Ventures, SV Angel and 
      Steelhead Ventures participating.
    

      “You can’t improve what you can’t measure. Without real-time visibility 
      into quality and progress, managers simply can’t boost productivity. Our 
      turnkey solution literally tracks progress for hundreds of thousands of 
      line items in project budgets and schedules, comparing actual 
      performance to original plans,” said CEO and Co-Founder Saurabh Ladha. 
      “This is transformative for an entire capital project team. With Doxel’s 
      system in place, project managers can react in minutes, not months, 
      increasing productivity by fifty percent and bringing in projects 
      twenty-five percent under budget.”
    

      Doxel offers progress tracking and transparency to an industry in 
      desperate need of productivity improvements. According to McKinsey & 
      Company, ninety-eight percent of large-scale construction projects are 
      delivered, on average, eighty percent over budget and twenty months 
      behind schedule. This happens because project managers don't have 
      real-time visibility into the biggest factor affecting project outcomes 
      – labor productivity.
    

      Labor productivity is hard to predict. While managers often know how 
      many person hours are being spent on a project, they don’t have an 
      accurate measure of how much work is accomplished, or if that work is 
      being done correctly. It isn’t difficult to know why – most construction 
      projects involve several teams that are installing millions of 
      components to high accuracies. With so much to inspect, it's nearly 
      impossible for managers to track progress accurately. This leads to 
      nasty surprises where managers realize several weeks or months later 
      that they’ve been spending a lot more person hours or, in other words, 
      more time and money, than they expected for a given amount of work.
    

      Doxel uses autonomous devices to monitor a site every day, both outdoors 
      and indoors, with LIDAR and HD cameras. Their proprietary artificial 
      intelligence algorithm then processes this visual data, inspects 
      installation quality, and quantifies how much material has been 
      installed correctly. Doxel’s cloud-based dashboard then provides project 
      managers with real-time feedback on productivity, as well as how actual 
      costs and time spent are comparing to the original budget and schedule. 
      As a result, managers can better control outcomes and keep their 
      projects on time and on budget. This information allows CFOs to get 
      real-time data on earned value for hundreds of thousands of line items 
      in a project budget, while enabling field teams to track schedule at a 
      hyper granular level and in real time.
    

      At the heart of Doxel’s solution is a major breakthrough in computer 
      vision software; one that allows artificial intelligence to understand 
      the world not just in 2D, but like people do, in 3D.
    

      “Construction projects involve millions of similar-looking components, 
      packed tightly together in a dark environment. It’s a Molotov Cocktail 
      of challenges for computer vision software,” said CTO and Co-Founder 
      Robin Singh. “Usually, the amount of training data such an algorithm 
      would need would be enormous, and even then, the results may not be 
      reliable. With our proprietary 3D semantic algorithms, we’ve been able 
      to get more reliable results with a fraction of the training data. Our 
      algorithms recognize and contextualize objects not just based on color, 
      but also based on shape, location and size.”
    

      In addition to tracking progress against schedule and budget, Doxel also 
      detects errors almost immediately. As per the Construction Industry 
      Institute, about ten percent of construction time is spent just fixing 
      mistakes. Using a design-intent 3D model that shows the intended 
      location, size and shape of every component, Doxel can alert managers if 
      field work doesn’t match designs.
    

      The means to track construction site progress in real time is helpful 
      for foremen, superintendents, project managers, CFOs and executives – 
      anyone who has a financial stake in increasing job site productivity.
    

      “If you could have an alarm that went off when your project was going 
      over budget or off course, wouldn’t you want to use it considering the 
      millions of dollars you could save?"" asked Lars Dalgaard, General 
      Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. ""For an industry that is notorious for 
      cost overruns and delays, we see Doxel as the canary in the coalmine for 
      construction projects. We expect Doxel to help owners and builders 
      increase productivity, save money, and bring projects in on time with 
      the highest levels of quality.”
    

      The construction industry currently manages project inspection through a 
      combination of clipboards, physical measurement, or even simple visual 
      inspection. With Doxel's real-time, AI-based solution in place, builders 
      and building owners can track progress accurately and in real-time – all 
      while actually reducing the amount of time spent doing these activities 
      manually.
    

      “On-site productivity can be increased by as much as 50 percent by 
      implementing a cloud-based control tower that rapidly assembles accurate 
      data in near real time that is both backward-looking and predictive (for 
      example, using plan conformance and other variability and inventory 
      metrics). Importantly, owners need to ensure that the right data flow 
      through the various owner, contractor, and subcontractor systems.”
    

Reinventing 
      Construction: A Route To Higher Productivity, McKinsey Global 
      Institute
    

      Doxel works with many parties in the construction industry – builders to 
      contractors to project managers, to the building owners themselves: 
      whoever carries the financial risk in the success of a large 
      construction project. Doxel can be deployed at any stage of 
      construction, from the time the first hole in the ground until the keys 
      are handed over.

The US, UK, France, UAE, Canada, South Korea and Japan also have their own plans. Australia however does not have one yet. Countries around the world are adopting formal AI strategies.(ABC Gold Coast: Damien Larkins)""I think we need some action here, really. I think the Government really needs a national plan,"" Professor Walsh said.""And we do actually have a remarkably good research community. We have some of the most automated ports, some of the most automated mines in the world.""We are actually already punching well above our weight in this field, and so we should take advantage of that.""China already leading in some areasProfessor Walsh said according to some measures, Chinese companies were already outperforming their rivals — but there was still room for improvement.""In terms of the pure output, the number of papers and patents and so on, China is now actually ahead of the US,"" he said.Could a robot do your job?Search our database of every Australian occupation to find out how difficult it will be for artificial intelligence to do your job.Read more""If you look more closely at the data, look at the quality of the work, look at things like the citations, you can still see that the US is still ahead of China.""The quality of the work is perhaps a bit higher in the US.""However while China is interested in how the technology can be used to improve living standards, it remains clear-eyed about the potential military applications of AI.The Government's strategy makes it clear information on technological developments is to be shared between civilian and military researchers.Professor Walsh, who has been involved in efforts calling for a worldwide ban on so-called ""killer robots"", said global efforts to regulate AI would be necessary.""We're not going to be able to stop the technology being developed, because actually it has very potentially good uses — the same technology that goes into your autonomous car will go into your autonomous drone,"" he said.""We're not going to stop the development of the technology, but we can make sure it's used for good.""Translations by Bang Xiao and Jason Fang, Asia Pacific Newsroom.Posted 25 Jan 201825 Jan 2018Thu 25 Jan 2018 at 2:28am, updated 25 Jan 201825 Jan 2018Thu 25 Jan 2018 at 2:36amShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesHow Google's new AI can teach itself to beat you at the most complex gamesCan an ancient board game give Google the keys to the Middle Kingdom?Google AI wins final Go match, gets 'divine' rankingMore on:AustraliaChinaComputer ScienceInternetRoboticsScience and TechnologyUnited StatesTop StoriesThe red flags at the centre of AFP's suspicions about the couple charged with spying for RussiaPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworksAnalysisVice-President Trump and President Putin of Ukraine — Joe Biden's gaffes keep coming, but he says he's not budgingSeven stand-out moments from Joe Biden's high-pressure press conferenceCFMEU boss John Setka steps down 'Time is running out': Collingwood's premiership defence on thin ice after loss to Geelong in crucial clashBritish man sentenced to life in prison for attempted kidnap and murder of UK presenter Holly WilloughbyWhy Shelley Duvall disappeared from HollywoodBenji apologises to fans after the Tigers are smashed 58-6 by CronullaVenice's debated tourist fee expected to increase 'in coming years', says tourism councillorAussie killed in Ukraine among many 'lulled' to fight war without military trainingRussian-Australian woman charged with spying offences was well-travelled, made lifestyle videosPhilippines police open special investigation into suspected murder of Australian couple as hunt for suspect continuesDubbed the 'Star Wars Project', South Korea plans to use drone-melting lasers against North Korea'All they took was two pies', says Gippsland bakery owner after armed robbers tie up staff in early morning raidPopular NowDon't miss news that matters to you.

Kentaro Sonoura, national security adviser to PM Shinzo Abe, told TOI in an exclusive chat, ""You should expect to see increased bilateral cooperation between us to develop unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and robotics."" The strategic sphere is where the bulk of India-Japan convergence lies. After the nuclear agreement was ratified by the Japanese parliament late 2017, Sonoura said India and Japan would be setting up a joint task force for commercial agreements by the end of January. With the legislation behind them, the Japanese minister said Tokyo was keen to get this going. ""The two PMs agreed to launch a working group, which will work on cooperation between nuclear companies. Japan's intention is to start this quickly, possibly by the end of this month,"" he said.With an aggressive and expansionist China growing as a challenge to both India and Japan, the two countries are increasingly looking at the world from a similar lens. While the latest buzzword in international geopolitics, 'Indo-Pacific', might sound American, its actually Japanese in origin, having been articulated by Abe himself as far back as 2007.In 2018, Japan's is aiming for a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"", a theme Sonoura expounded on at the recent Raisina Dialogue. This, he told TOI, was a coming together of Japan's Indo-Pacific policy and India's Act East policy. ""We need to share the importance of rule of law and freedom of navigation among related countries. The next step is infrastructure development based on global standards, so that connectivity among countries is increased. The third step would be maritime law enforcement and disaster management that would ensure the stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Therefore, we would like to connect and combine our Indo-Pacific strategy and India's Act East policy as a one big picture. That's the synergy we seek,"" Sonoura said. This is the kind of grand strategy that incorporates a stronger bilateral relationship as well as a multilateral one, between Japan-India-US, Japan-US-Australia and the Quadrilateral, Japan-US-India-Australia, seeking to tilt the strategic balance away from China.Working with India in the quadrilateral, Sonoura said, the aims were slowly crystallising. ""Among these four countries, we have the same standards in terms of maritime strategy and basic values. So it's important to realise these values - non-proliferation, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Its important to utilise the strengths of these countries and use it. Rather than frameworks, its important what we can do - to create concrete results which should be visible to the world,"" he said. For India, the key aims of the quadrilateral is to come together on non-proliferation and on freedom of navigation. To counter China's growing influence in India's neighbourhood, India has encouraged the presence of Japan and the US in South Asian countries, actions that might have elicited mild protests earlier. Consequently, New Delhi was remarkably quiet when Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono recently visited Pakistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka, increasing Japanese presence in these countries. Japan has already ramped up its involvement in Bangladesh and Myanmar, both countries on China's radar. Questioned on this, Sonoura said, ""Foreign minister Kono visited Maldives for the first time and Sri Lanka for the first time in 15 years. Last year I visited Mauritius, Madagascar, Kenya and Mozambique. If you place this within the rubric of Japan's Indo-Pacific strategy, you will get the larger picture."" In Islamabad, Sonoura said, the Japanese message was clear that Pakistan had to take action on terrorism and terrorists. ""With Pakistan, we have an older relationship. But in terms of counter-terrorism, our foreign minister told the Pakistanis they need to do more,"" he said.
