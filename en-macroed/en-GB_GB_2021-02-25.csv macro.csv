 A new study that measures how humans perceive artworks generated by artificial intelligence, alongside artworks created by humans, has concluded that a majority of people basically can’t tell the difference.
Published in the journal Empirical Studies in the Arts by researcher Harsha Gangadharbatla, the study was inspired by the sale of “Edmond de Belamy”, an AI-generated portrait by the creative studio Obvious. Hailed as “the future”, the artwork fetched around ten times the average price for a male artist at auction (and 20 times more than artworks by women), going for $432,500 at Christie’s in 2018. 
The hype around “Edmond de Belamy” wasn’t an isolated occurrence, either. In a 2017 study that asked people to compare a selection of AI artworks and actual Art Basel pieces, people mostly preferred the artworks created by machines.
 “For me, the interesting thing was the role of humans in producing art,” Gangadharbatla tells Artnet. “I always assumed there was a soul that the human pours into the work. When a machine creates the work, how do people interpret it? Are they still moved? What role does the knowledge of who produced the artwork play in how it is perceived?”
The study consisted of a survey asking respondents to distinguish between human and AI artworks. The human pieces were created by artists Tom Bailey and Steve Johnson – impressionistic landscapes and geometric abstractions, respectively – while the computer-created artworks were the work of a single artist’s algorithms.
Of the hundreds of people that responded to the survey, a majority were unable to correctly attribute more than one in five landscape works created by the AI. More than 75 per cent guessed wrong on the remaining four. People were slightly more successful at attributing the AI’s abstract artworks, signalling a tendency to equate abstraction with AI and representational art with a human creator.
While Gangadharbatla says that AI creating artworks is relatively harmless (unless, presumably, you’re a human artist that doesn’t need any more competition), he adds that advertising could be a different story. “If computers start producing persuasive messages and they’re put in front of people,” he asks, “what effect would that have?”
In more recent news from the robot art world, Ai-Da (AKA the world’s first AI humanoid to create art without human input) announced a new exhibition of self portraits, set to go on display at London’s Design Museum. Earlier this year, OpenAI also debuted DALL·E, a neural network that can create bizarre images based on written descriptions.
In case you’re still trying to figure out whether the images above are made by humans or AI, they are, in order: AI, human, human, and AI.

In 2017, I returned to Canada from Sweden, where I had spent a year working on automation in mining. Shortly after my return, the New York Times published a piece called, “The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine,” about Sweden’s embrace of automation while limiting human costs.
Although Swedes are apparently optimistic about their future alongside robots, other countries aren’t as hopeful. One widely cited study estimates that 47 per cent of jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.Whether we like it or not, the robot era is already upon us. The question is: is the Canadian economy poised to flourish or flounder in a world where robots take over the tasks we don’t want to do ourselves? The answer may surprise you.  Story continues below advertisement



 Modern-day robots are how artificial intelligence (AI) physically interacts with us, and the world around us. Although some robots resemble humans, most do not and are instead specifically designed to autonomously carry out complex tasks.Over the last few decades, robots have rapidly grown from specialized devices developed for select industry applications to household items. You can buy a robot to vacuum your floors, cut your grass and keep your home secure. Kids play with educational robots at school, where they learn to code, and compete in robot design teams that culminate in exciting international competitions.

Robots are also appearing in our hospitals, promising to help us fight the COVID-19 pandemic and performing other health-care tasks in safer and more efficient ways.The media is abuzz with stories about the latest technical claims, rumours and speculations about the secret developments of major international corporations, including Waymo, Tesla, Apple, Volvo and GM.And NASA just landed the Perseverance rover on Mars, with an autonomous helicopter called Ingenuity attached to its belly.

I have been working on robotics and autonomous vehicles technology in mining since the late 1990s. As such, I have been part of an industry that is undergoing a sea change, with fully autonomous machines steadily replacing workers in dark, dirty and dangerous scenarios.This robot revolution is happening behind the scenes in other industries too. Robots fill Amazon orders, manufacture stuff in factories, plant and pick crops, assist on construction sites, and the list goes on.In fact, robots even build other robots. Will we soon run out of jobs for people?There are many who paint a bleak picture of the future, where robots and AI take away all the “good jobs.” Although I fully acknowledge that we must be mindful of possible inequalities and unintended outcomes that might arise as a result of new technologies, I contend that Canadians have the potential to thrive.  Story continues below advertisement



 But to make it happen, my colleagues and I agree that our country needs a “robotics strategy.”In 2017, Canada launched the world’s first national AI strategy. Called the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and costing $125 million, the strategy aims to strengthen Canada’s leadership in AI by funding institutes, universities and hospitals to meet key objectives.

In its 2020 list of future jobs, the World Economic Forum listed “robotics engineers” as No. 10, in close company with “AI and machine learning specialists.” In Canada, I see huge potential for our robotics industry, with companies such as Clearpath Robotics, OTTO Motors, Kinova, Robotiq and Titan Medical already world leaders in the design and manufacture of robots for purposes ranging from materials handling to surgery.  Story continues below advertisement



 Beyond building robots, Canada’s most significant opportunities may lie in the increased adoption of robots into economically important industry sectors, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.And yet, Canada may be the only G7 country without a robotics strategy.As it turns out, there is hope. According to a November 2020 report from Statistics Canada, Canadian firms that employed robots have also hired more human workers, contrary to what you may instinctively believe. In fact, they hired 15 per cent more workers!However, this does not mean that we can all sit back and relax. Along with the increased economic activity that robots bring to businesses comes a shift in the workforce from “workers spending less time performing routine, manual tasks, in favour of non-routine, cognitive tasks.”Mobile robotics researchers from the Ingenuity Labs Research Institute at Queen’s University. (Heshan Fernando), Author providedThe roles of education and research and development — such as new programs to train the next generation of robot-savvy Canadians and collaborative research clusters — are paramount. And they need to be combined with a national robotics strategy and a progressive socioeconomic system that supports a transitioning workforce to ensure the success, well-being and happiness of Canadians, alongside our robot friends.Joshua A. Marshall, associate professor of mechatronics and robotics engineering, Queen’s University.  Story continues below advertisement

If so, this article will give you some insights on where to work as a Data Scientist beyond the traditional tech companies.Obviously, most data professions would be excited to work at one of the companies that form the widely known acronym FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). FAANG companies are at the forefront of technological development. As a result, Data Scientist could learn a lot by spending a few years at one of those companies.However, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, the need to manipulate data will rise, and there will be around 11.5 million job openings by 2026 [1]. There will be so many opportunities for data professionals (including machine learning and software engineers) that they do not have to focus on FAANG companies. For this reason, here is a list of tech companies that have the potential to provide a unique Data Science career. The list is based on the combination of Glassdoor and The Great Place to Work’s rank for tech companies.
