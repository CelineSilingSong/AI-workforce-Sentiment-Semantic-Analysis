It’s no surprise that the artificial intelligence talent market is white-hot right now. The business value created by AI will reach $3.9 trillion in 2022, according to Gartner. IDC says worldwide spending on cognitive and artificial intelligence systems will reach $77.6 billion during the same year. And cognitive capabilities are poised to have an impact on nearly every corporate IT function.
AI and machine learning have the potential to create an additional $2.6 trillion in value for marketing and sales by 2020 and as much as $2 trillion in manufacturing and supply chain planning, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.
The number that matters most to IT leaders who increasingly will need AI professionals on their teams, however, is how much they are going to have to pay to bring these scarce, highly skilled individuals into the fold.

We gathered some of the more telling figures related to AI salaries, including which skills are seeing the biggest paydays, the most in-demand roles, shifts in supply and demand dynamics, hot hiring geographies, and the net number of jobs AI may create.
$142,858: Average for highest-paying AI job title of 2019
That’s the average salary for machine learning engineers, the highest-paying AI job title of 2019, according to job-posting site Indeed. That role came in third place last year. The salaries for these AI pros are up 5.8 percent over last year – well above the average 2.9 percent expected by human resources consultancy Mercer. Rounding out the top five highest-paying AI roles were data scientist ($126.927), computer vision engineer ($126,399), data warehouse architect ($126,008), and algorithm engineer ($109,313).
#2 in-demand AI job: Deep learning engineer
Deep learning didn’t even appear on the same list last year. 
Deep learning engineers rank second on Indeed’s list of the top roles in job listings seeking AI or machine learning skills. The headline here is that deep learning didn’t even appear on the same list last year.
These engineers are expert in that subset of machine learning in which algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. They are in high demand in areas like autonomous driving, advanced robotics, and facial recognition systems. Deep learning could account for $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in annual value, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

The machine learning engineer title came in first, while numbers three through five were senior data scientist, computer vision engineer, and data scientist.
29 percent AI job listing growth
The number of AI jobs listed on Indeed from May 2018 to May 2019 grew 29 percent – still significant growth, but down from the 58 percent increase in the previous 12-month period and 36 percent two years prior. At the same time, Indeed saw a 15 percent decrease in candidate searches for AI roles, suggesting a potential shortage of AI experts for companies looking to hire them. During the previous 12-month period, those candidates searches jumped 32 percent.
New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C., San Jose, Seattle: Top AI job markets
The top metro areas for AI job openings were largely unchanged from Indeed’s 2018 analysis. As Indeed’s blog pointed out, “New York’s top position may surprise you, until you consider that it’s the home of diverse industries, from financial services to publishing — many of which are now adopting AI. Many West Coast-based tech companies (such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google) have a significant presence in the region. And New York has its share of AI-related tech startups, such as AlphaSense, Clarifai, Persado, and x.ai.”
The nation’s capital rose one position, while San Jose came down a notch. Similarly, Seattle was up for sixth, while Boston slipped one ranking down into that spot this year. Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Ft. Worth came in seventh, eighth, and ninth. Atlanta, which didn’t even rank last year, came in tenth, knocking Philadelphia off the list.

40 percent say they’re adding jobs due to AI
Forty percent of respondents from Global 2000 organizations say they are adding more jobs as a result of AI adoption, according to a 2019 Dun & Bradstreet report, while only eight percent are cutting jobs because of the new technology. Just eight percent of the 100 business executives surveyed said that their companies were planning to eliminate jobs as a result of implementing AI capabilities. Around one-third (34 percent) reported that there was no change in HR needs as a result of AI.
133 million new jobs created by AI by 2022
That's the number of new jobs that will be created as a result of AI-enabled automation by 2022, according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2018 Future of Jobs report. That’s nearly twice as many as the 75 million roles that the WEF research predicts will be displaced.

With a collapsed economy and hyperinflation, ""people don't have enough money to afford a dentist and have to worry about food, education and other things"", she adds.Two years ago she swapped her dental practice for online work as part of the global army of hidden ""microworkers"" - performing tasks that machines alone cannot.Think of a day in your ""digital life"". Whether it's your phone's search engine recommending relevant restaurants or a music app's suggested playlist - none of this would be possible without microworkers.Microworkers like Michelle from Venezuela undertake simple, repetitive tasks online - such as drawing round a face to help train artificial intelligence systems to recognise peopleThey help provide data for machine learning algorithms that are the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) by adding the human element. They might draw bounding boxes around footage of roads to teach driverless cars what a tree, obstacle or a moving person look like, or tag content with feelings so algorithms can learn what a ""sad"" song sounds like or whether a text or word is ""worrying.""This work often gets a bad press as it's seen as poorly paid, but for many it is a solution. Michelle says microworking has been her only way of earning an income: ""I do much better with this than as a dentist.""She tells the BBC of a good day when she earned about $80, which she used to buy the smartphone she now uses to work. Getty ImagesThe 18th Century Mechanical Turk fooled chess players into thinking they were competing against a machineBack in 2005, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos called crowdsourced microwork the ""artificial artificial intelligence"" when he set up the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) the world's first crowdsourcing marketplace. It was named after an 18th Century hoax that fooled chess players into thinking they were competing against a machine, instead of the chess master hiding inside a large wooden box with a dummy on top.Amazon first used it to weed out millions of duplicate pages as computers could not notice subtle differences. But as no one person could do this, they broke it down into small tasks that could be completed by thousands of workers.There are no official numbers for how many microworkers there are, but tens of thousands are estimated to work on Amazon's MTurk every month, with up to 2,500 being active at any given time - mostly in the US and India. An International Labour Organisation (ILO) survey of 3,500 microworkers in 75 countries found the average age was 33 and a third were women, though this dropped to a fifth in developing countries. Microworkers are also educated: fewer than 18% had a high-school diploma or less, 37% had a graduate degree, 20% a postgraduate degree; more than half specialised in science and technology, 23% in engineering and 22% in IT.For those in countries in crisis, microwork can be especially useful.Yahya: ""This allows you to work without having to apply and send a CV""Yahya Ayoub Ahmed is a Syrian who fled the civil war and is now in the Darashakran refugee camp in Erbil, Iraq. In the camp, an organisation called Preemptive Love taught him the English and IT skills allowing him to become a microworker.""You can use it remotely and generate income. Over here applying for a job is quite difficult, it's not like you can just Google a job,"" he says. ""This allows you to work without having to apply and send a CV.""But there is an extra hurdle for workers in countries like Iraq, as tasks are mainly aimed at developed countries, says Allen Ninous of Preemptive Love. ""Most online crowdsourcing services restrict Iraqis from registering, and even if one could magically do so, there's no method of cashing out the wages since all withdrawals take place through a third party online banking system such as PayPal.""So they have to resort to special agreements with firms to overcome this.It is even harder for people who work on their own from home. Venezuelan microworker Rafael Pérez describes a similar situation of being filtered out of many tasks he sees being posted.Microworkers provide data for machine learning used in technology like driverless carsHe has also lost money many times from unscrupulous requesters who didn't pay him: ""Once I earned $180 in 15 days - a lot of money - and they never paid. I emailed, I called - but you don't have anyone to complain to.""Michelle says at the beginning she too fell for scams, but she now puts websites through a test period before working with them. Microwork has come under scrutiny because of poor pay: the ILO found workers earned an average of $4.43 an hour. And while US workers earnt an average of $4.70 (still lower than the minimum wage) workers in Africa got just $1.33 an hour. BBCWhat microworkers earnPer hour of paid and unpaid workUS$4.70Northern AmericaUS$3.00EuropeUS$2.22Asia and the PacificUS$1.33AfricaSource: ILO survey of crowdworkers, 2017And these figures don't take into account workers spending an average of 20 minutes on unpaid activities for every hour of paid work.This includes searching for tasks and answering test questions set by the requester for quality control. ""I spend most of the day looking for tasks. Once one comes in, I have to sit down and do it,"" says Rafael.Rafael says on a good day he can make about $8-10 a day. It means he can buy a small box of eggs, a kilo of cornflour and a kilo of beans. ""You will not live very well, but you will eat well,"" he says.BBCMicrowork is invisible to the many, and has attracted little public attentionPaola TubaroSenior research scientist, Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueProfessor Paola Tubaro of CNRS, France's national scientific research centre, says microworking is not a temporary phenomenon but structural to the development of new technologies like AI.""Even if machines learn, say, how to recognise cats and dogs, you still need to feed them more details to recognise."" As these technologies expand so will the need for people to feed in the data, she says.Currently there is no government regulation of microwork platforms, though the ILO has called for better regulation of the sector to ensure minimum wages and better payments transparency, are met.

If people work under the same conditions as 19th Century factories that's not something that our society would accept as right.""Back in Venezuela, Michelle agrees. She says there should be more ""support and recognition"" for microworkers. She says its the platforms that make the money from their work.

What are the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Emile Contal, Co-Founder of Crossing Minds, on Quora:
There’s a lot of misinformation about the risks and opportunities surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). It’s a complicated topic, but I’ll try to unpack a few key points here.
PROMOTED
Let’s start with a quick definition: AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Example of AI systems used regularly in developed countries include Amazon’s Alexa, smart replies in Gmail, Chatbots, predictive searches in Google, and recommendations. At a baseline level, AI helps improve our everyday lives by solving pain points, streamlining processes, and advancing human knowledge.

It’s understandable why many consumers find the idea of AI intimidating or unsettling – science fiction movies have been obsessed with robot takeovers for years and recent movies like I am Mother portray AI as contributing to a post-apocalyptic world. But the concern isn't just from Hollywood writers obsessed with the fantastical, world-renowned minds like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have also rung the AI warning bell.
To be fair, they raise some important points. But instead of getting defensive, AI researchers should consider feedback and ask themselves: just because I can advance a particular technology, should I? This isn’t a knock on AI (we are AI researchers after all)–but rather a question scientists and researchers in every field should ask themselves when advancing technologies with unknown consequences (ping Google, Facebook). This is particularly true for AI more than other technologies because AI takes part in the decision making. It is easy to know who is responsible for pushing the red button sending missiles to an enemy; it is far more complex when the decision was made by an AI. Any system taking decisions based on data will propagate and amplify human biases. Anyone using AI cannot hide behind this fact and act as if data was a source of absolute truth, they need to take full responsibility for the decision made with their system.
We do think is worth keeping an eye on is AI’s impact on wealth inequalities. As with any advanced technology, AI has the power to increase the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, especially if monopolies are formed. Our vision of work is rooted in the fact that we need people to work to keep the society growing. But with technological progress, this is less and less true. Indeed “AI is taking over jobs,” because machines can do things that used to require humans. Many authors in science-fiction foresee a world where no one needs to work anymore, and all the basic needs are provided by fully autonomous systems. This future is sustainable only by deep restructuration of how wealth from autonomous systems is distributed. Researchers and politicians should continue exploring the feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI). Although considered radical by some, the idea behind UBI was first floated in the 1600s by Sir Thomas More and was even considered by President Richard Nixon.
Yes, there are some areas we need to keep an eye on, but remember, we’re still far from achieving what most consumers consider true AI – technology with consciousness. Instead, over the next few years, you’ll see more of the following AI advancements:
Smarter weather predictions and agriculture
Accurately predicting weather can be difficult, and errors have the potential to hurt businesses, disrupt travel, and endanger lives, especially for those who lack transportation or the ability to quickly seek shelter when needed. Thankfully, AI offers solutions by analyzing data and making future predictions. According to the American Meteorological Society, AI is a game-changer for improving real-time decision making with high-impact weather. This will allow us to predict more accurately natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods but even earthquakes and tsunamis. AI is also starting to be used toward more sustainable agriculture. By employing such software to optimize crops yield, we can reduce the space required without having to resort to damaging techniques like pesticides.
Energy optimization
From micro-architectures to heavy industries, the progress of AI had a significant impact in engineering. The challenges we face today are far more complex than they were a few years ago. Both tiny systems like smart devices and huge structures like buildings need to be more and more energy-efficient. These problems cannot be solved by only traditional engineering science. Today AI and data science help crunching numbers to design green buildings or green energy production for instance.
Self-driving cars everywhere
Sure, if you live in Silicon Valley you routinely come across self-driving cars, especially by the Googleplex. But for the majority of U.S. residents, self-driving driving cars not only seem out of reach, they also seem untrustworthy. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, half of U.S. residents believe driverless cars are more dangerous than cars driven by people, and nearly two-thirds of respondents said they would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle. This is a mindset that will quickly change, and there will be a tipping point over the next three to five years. As people interact more with cars that have driverless features (automatic breaks, evasive steering, and pre-safe nudging), there comfort level increase. It’s a matter of when, not if, driverless cars become mainstream and dominate American highways.
AI in healthcare
Recent years have witnessed striking advances in the ability of machines to understand and manipulate images, language, and speech, largely fueled by an explosion of research in a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning. Despite the prodigious amounts of machine-readable data generated in healthcare (150 exabytes or 1018 bytes in US alone growing 48% annually), including medical images, clinical notes, and sensor data, the field has been slow to fully benefit from advances in deep learning because the data are subject to important patient privacy laws and the algorithms are subject to regulatory oversight. As deep learning researchers, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies continue to work together towards making data more accessible, deep learning will enhance the abilities of healthcare providers, resulting in more affordable, accessible, and personalized care.
On-demand language translation
The days of awkward hand pointing are about to be over. Tourists can now depend on sophisticated language translators while traveling internationally. In 2018, Microsoft unveiled neural machine translation (NMT), which provides high-quality translations for both the written word and text that appears in images, such as traffic signs or menus. This advancement will help increase communication, decrease petty misunderstandings, and contribute to a more open and cosmopolitan world where people have a deeper understanding and appreciation for others.

 The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 August 2019
 How can artificial intelligence impact the workplace of the future? At the Ayco InnerCircle conference, which brings together practitioners and thought leaders in the human resources industry, Goldman Sachs’ Joe LeRoy of Ayco’s Institutional Business Solutions, spoke with Richard Hughes of UnitedHealth Group, Jeffrey Howell of Panasonic Industrial Devices Sales Company of America and Brian Marcotte of the National Business Group on Health, about the role of AI in their businesses.
 Joe LeRoy: AI is having an outsized impact on companies’ human resources departments. According to PwC, about 63% of companies are rethinking the role of their HR department in light of AI’s impact. Just how pervasive is it?
 Jeffrey Howell: From a standpoint of AI, I think the best word that comes to mind would probably be “inevitability.” It is coming whether we like it or not. In 2019, according to one industry stat, an estimated $30 billion to $40 billion will be spent on AI technology in 2019 – that’s up about 40% from last year.
 Richard Hughes: In its current state, AI would be better described as “augmented” intelligence where human engagement is still needed in order for AI to reach its potential. AI is not currently capable of the creative, imaginative thinking we associate with the human mind. Rather, we see it as a system for ingesting human engagement and driving outcomes based on observations.
 Brian Marcotte: When I think about AI, it’s more of an umbrella term that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and other methods to reach smart decisions. It’s behind a lot more of what we do and see. In healthcare, for example, it’s everywhere. AI is being used in back-end administration, wearables and are helping to steer people to the right physicians. It will revolutionize how healthcare is delivered. But having said that, the level of change in health care is far outpacing the localized and fragmented delivery system’s ability to keep up. While there are emerging remedies to integrate these fragmented services, including better data integration and more predictive analytics and actionable messaging to patients, we are in the early stages and they are far from mature solutions.
 Joe LeRoy: Given AI’s ubiquity, can you talk about how it’s affecting your recruiting and people strategies?
 Richard Hughes: AI is already helping our HR professionals at UnitedHealth with employee selection and advancement. We’ve been using AI for more than three years in our recruiting practice to help connect an applicant’s profile with job openings. But we’re seeing more potential in applying AI to understand our own workforce. For example, we’re applying AI algorithms and leveraging the science of our leadership database to identify the characteristics and profiles that make a great leader. This will allow us to identify and groom future potential leaders earlier in their career. We’ve also developed methods for assessing flight risk potential through the data points that trigger turnover, giving us time to introduce proactive solutions to help mitigate attrition.
 Joe LeRoy: Jeff, as head of Panasonic’s industrial sales business, how is AI impacting the business side?
 Jeffrey Howell: The amount of data that we’re getting is permeating every aspect of our business relationships. And data is what’s driving the core of AI by giving us the ability to project, interpret and predict. We’ve been using AI with some of our business partners to obtain more cost transparency and fine-tune our pricing models. We’re also using similar predictive analytics to enhance our ability to introduce new products to the market. Historically, we’ve introduced about 20 new products a year. Next year, we’ll launch 140 new products because of AI.
 Joe LeRoy: And we can’t talk about AI without addressing its ability to replace jobs. How are you viewing the impact of AI on the future workforce?
 Brian Marcotte: In the future, AI will significantly transform many job functions, particularly in the administrative space. Some people are going to lose their jobs in the short term, but over the long term, AI has the potential to create more jobs. We need to reskill and redeploy those people who will be negatively impacted by AI and focus on ways to upskill and develop future workers in the necessary skill sets. 
 Jeffrey Howell: AI is not only automating many of the manual processes, but it’s also reducing operational efficiencies. If you want to look at ways to take advantage of AI, my advice is to put someone in place to take advantage of your data – such as a chief data officer.

However, Turing’s work still challenges and inspires many people working today, especially those in robotics and artificial intelligence.In 1950 he asked, “Can machines think?”, and came up with a test that researchers still turn to as a way of judging whether a computer could be considered truly intelligent in the same way as humans. But, coming from an age where autonomous robots were only just in their infancy, the Turing Test was only designed to assess artificial brains, not a complete artificial person.Now that we have increasingly realistic looking androids, we need a 21st-century version of the test. My colleagues and I have designed a “Multimodal Turing Test” to judge a machine’s appearance, movement, voice and what we call embodied artificial intelligence (EAI). This is a measure of how well artificial intelligence is integrated with a robotic body in order to expresses a personality.This means we can systematically compare a humanoid robot to a living counterpart. In this way, we can ask the question: “Can we build robots that are perceptually indistinguishable from humans?”Not there just yet. Image: Carl Strathearn,Author providedTuring argued that if a computer program could deceive more than 30% of humans into believing it was sentient in real-world conditions, then it is effectively indistinguishable from the human mind – it can think. A computer was able to pass this test in 2014. That doesn’t mean there’s no work to do to create true artificial intelligence. Far from it. But the Turing Test gives us a benchmark to judge our progress.Many scholars think creating a humanoid robot that is indistinguishable from a real human is the ultimate goal of robotics. Yet there’s currently no standard way of evaluating how lifelike androids are, so it’s impossible to benchmark this development.Like Turing, we’re not arguing that a robot transforms into an organic being when it can replicate the conditions of a human. But if a robot appears, behaves and functions in a way that is indistinguishable from a human being in real-world conditions, then it can effectively be thought of as the same as a human.One of the biggest challenges for lifelike robot builders is overcoming what’s known as the “uncanny valley”. This refers to a stage of development when robots become closer in appearance to humans but are actually more offputting to people because they are not quite right. The issue is that conventional methods of assessing the problem aren’t nuanced enough to determine exactly why a robot makes people uncomfortable.The test breaks down the robot building process. Image: Carl Strathearn,Author providedThese approaches tend to compare the robot as a whole with a human, rather than breaking it down into its component features. For example, a slight miscalculation in the movement of the eye of an otherwise realistic looking robot can give the whole game away. High quality features of other facial areas then become part of that failure.Our idea is to evaluate each area step by step. As long as each feature is designed to look like it is part of the same body (same gender, age and so on), then if an eye and mouth can individually pass the test then they should also pass it together. This would allow a robot builder to assess progress as they go to ensure each body part is indistinguishable from a that of human and to prevent ending up with something that falls into the uncanny valley.Have you read?Robotic health care is coming to a hospital near youThis robotic Icelandic farm has made its cows much happier - with dramatic resultsThis is what the ancient Greeks had to say about robotics and AIOur test is also organised into four stages, each more difficult than the last, representing what we call the “hierarchy of human emulation”. First, the robot has to simply look real when still. Second, it has to move in a naturally looking way. Third, it has to produce a realistic simulation of physical speech in both appearance and the way it moves.Finally comes the test of embodied artificial intelligence, assessing whether the robot can respond to the world by realistically expressing emotions so it can interact naturally with humans. If a humanoid robot can simultaneously pass all four levels of the test, then it is perceptually indistinguishable from humans.Passing for human? Image: Carl Strathearn,Author provided“We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done”. This statement is as accurate today as the day Turing said it in 1950. However, robotic engineers are closer than ever before to achieving their goal of a realistic humanlike machine, and 2017 witnessed the inauguration of the world’s first robotic citizen.Today, we have the tools to develop humanoid robots with increasingly lifelike appearance, movement, speech and EAI. But our Multimodal Turing Test gives engineers an accessible way to evaluate and so improve their work.As with Turing’s original test, our approach raises questions about what it will mean to be a person when we can no longer tell the difference between a real human and an artificial one. Trying to answer these questions too soon because we want to advance quicker than we actually are can lead to mistakes such as giving legal rights to a machine that is nowhere near lifelike. But the more we develop humanoid robots, the more we learn about our values and even our emotions.Don't miss any update on Emerging TechnologiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Fourth Industrial RevolutionEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is already in use in many sectors. Its contribution is expected to rise steadily, driven by advances in data storage, computer processing power and connectivity. 
Following last week’s report on AI by the Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA), the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi today launches a report that focuses on the opportunities and risks the “fourth industrial revolution” might bring to Aotearoa New Zealand.  
AI, in all its applications, is predicted to contribute some US$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This represents roughly the combined GDP of China and India in 2018. 
Australia and New Zealand are yet to develop national AI strategies. The reports look 20 years ahead, which is a useful period for policy development. The explicit focus on well-being provides a helpful frame to start national conversations about how to embrace these new technologies, leading rather than passively accepting advances from offshore.

AI in New Zealand
New Zealand has started to adopt AI in the government sector, with most government agencies employing some form of it. There are advantages in New Zealand’s small size and strong legal frameworks to develop protocols for data ethics and security, and intellectual property, and to nurture a diverse AI-savvy workforce. 
Placing equity at the centre of the conversation means that we can choose to adopt AI technologies across education, government and industry in the context of public good. This would mitigate the risk of importing biases from offshore algorithms and allow us to identify areas where AI can benefit all New Zealanders, rather than a small international elite. 
Within the reports’ 20-year horizon, specialist machine learning and narrow AI (a specific type of AI that outperforms humans in a very narrowly defined task) will help us to start removing the “four Ds” – dirty, dull, difficult, dangerous – from our daily work. Instead, we will be able to use machines to free people up to use their originality, creativity and questioning abilities. 
It is unlikely that machines will challenge these skills in this time frame. Artificial general intelligence, which could compete with these more human forms of cognition, is likely many decades away. By focusing on this nearer-term future, the ACOLA report makes concrete recommendations on strategic investment, regulatory mechanisms, equity and respect for intrinsic human rights, while calling for a national strategy to bring these approaches together. 
What AI could do for New Zealand
A recent New Zealand government report signalled that AI-driven automation and optimisation could result in economic gains in productivity. Think drones applying herbicides in an orchard, identifying weeds through AI-driven vision recognition systems, then feeding the data into a central system. This could mean less herbicide use, better farm productivity and environmental outcomes, and fewer people operating herbicide sprayers (at least in the way they do currently). 
But the predicted gains in productivity are not without risks. Estimates of the proportion of jobs likely to be automated by AI vary wildly. So do estimates of the degree to which those will be replaced by new jobs. Some of these new jobs are currently difficult to imagine. Consider someone preparing for a career as a social media manager back in 2000, four years before Facebook was founded. 
Foresight will be key to building a resilient and adaptable workforce. Key skills in STEM subjects (especially maths), coupled with strong foundations in the humanities, will be important. AI experts agree that, as AI technologies are implemented at scale, the key concern is the rate at which they may disrupt work and drive inequalities in income and employment opportunities. 
Even if the former orchard sprayer is able to find another job, they are unlikely to get a direct financial payoff in the same way that the owners of the farm will. Multiplied thousands of different ways across New Zealand’s economy, these AI-driven changes threaten to widen inequities. Research related to this issue, for example at the Centre for AI and Public Policy (CAIPP), will need to feed into policy.

Other risks of AI
Economic effects are just one part of the story. The reports raise several issues, including lethal autonomous weapons, threats to democratic decision making and the disturbing gender imbalance in the rapidly growing AI workforce. The discussions fit into a wider body of recent work on AI relevant to New Zealand. This includes an analysis of the government’s use of predictive systems, establishment of the OECD principles on AI and a report on the state of the industry in New Zealand. This work identifies an urgent need for clear principles for the use of AI and state regulation for socially accepted use and standards. 
The ACOLA report discusses many aspects of AI relevant to our responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi. AI technologies need to be developed to augment critical thinking and social and emotional skills at all levels, and in a culturally inclusive context. An important implication, consistent with the government’s focus on well-being, is the need to closely monitor societal impacts.

The report also identifies where New Zealand could contribute to the global conversation, including in indigenous data sovereignty. Groups such as Te Mana Raraunga and Te Hiku Media actively explore how tikanga (Māori customary system of values and practices) should be applied to these emerging technologies. 
As the ACOLA report notes:

An AI strategy that places equity at its forefront will strengthen Aotearoa New Zealand’s international reputation in this arena and ensure that Aotearoa New Zealand is not left behind by some of the most important developments of the 21st century.

Overall, we see enormous potential for transformative opportunities, from intelligent tutoring systems in education through to precision agriculture. These could improve well-being across all sectors of society, government, agriculture and industry. 
Realising this potential will require addressing the substantial challenges inherent in ensuring a fair and equitable transition into an AI-enabled future, making sure that benefits also reach those at risk of being excluded.

Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) seek to understand and develop machines with human-level intelligence by exploring the academic and real-world challenges surrounding AI. 
At USC’s Department of Computer Science, we are pioneering breakthroughs in a full spectrum of topics related to AI, including machine learning, computer vision and image processing, human-robot interaction, speech and language analysis, information extraction and privacy-protection.
Our researchers are working in areas where artificial intelligence has been under study for decades—like language—and where the tools are just starting to make inroads—such as efforts to combat human trafficking, diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome, and prevent terrorist attacks using limited resources. 
We understand that the long-term goal of building intelligent machines relies on collaboration across many fields. That’s why we also work closely with researchers across application domains, such as health care, social work and linguistics. Labs
