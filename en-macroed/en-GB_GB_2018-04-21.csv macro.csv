 Paris – Total and Google Cloud have signed an agreement to jointly develop artificial intelligence (A.I.) solutions applied to subsurface data analysis for oil and gas exploration and production.  The agreement focuses on the development of A.I. programs that will make it possible to interpret subsurface images, notably from seismic studies (using Computer Vision technology) and automate the analysis of technical documents (using Natural Language Processing technology). These programs will allow Total’s geologists, geophysicists, reservoir and geo-information engineers to explore and assess oil & gas fields faster and more effectively. Under this partnership, Total geoscientists will work side-by-side with Google Cloud’s machine learning experts within the same project team based in Google Cloud’s Advanced Solutions Lab in California.  “Total is convinced that applying artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry is a promising avenue to be explored for optimizing our performance, particularly in subsurface data interpretation. We are excited to work with Google Cloud towards this goal. This builds on the strategy being developed at Total, where A.I. is already used, for example, in predictive maintenance at facilities,” said Marie-Noëlle Semeria, Senior Vice President, Group CTO at Total. “We believe that the combination of Total’s geoscience expertise and Google’s artificial intelligence skills will ensure the project’s success. Our ambition is to give our geoscience engineers an A.I. personal assistant in the next few years that will free them up to focus on high value-added tasks.” said Kevin McLachlan, Senior Vice President Exploration for Exploration & Production at Total. “We are thrilled to welcome Total in our Advanced Solutions Labs for the development of A.I. solutions,” said Paul-Henri Ferrand, President of Global Customer Operations Google Cloud. “We are keen to engage our best A.I. engineers to work with Total’s geosciences’ experts.” Artificial Intelligence Applied to Exploration & Production at Total Total started applying artificial intelligence to characterize oil & gas fields using machine learning algorithms in the 1990s. In 2013, Total used machine learning algorithms to implement predictive maintenance for turbines, pumps and compressors at its industrial facilities, thus generating savings of several hundred million dollars. Today, Total teams are exploring multiple machine learning and deep learning applications such as production profile forecasting, automated analysis of satellite images or analysis of rock sample images.* * * * * Total contacts Media Relations: +33 1 47 44 46 99 l presse@total.com l @TotalPressInvestor Relations: +44 (0)207 719 7962 l ir@total.com Cautionary note This press release, from which no legal consequences may be drawn, is for information purposes only.

Summary

89% of law firms are already utilising Artificial Intelligence or have imminent plans to do so
61% of firms have adopted an agile working policy - a doubling over 12 months
98% of firms do not expect Brexit to have a significant impact on their London business








Nearly half (48%) of London law firms are already utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a further 41% have imminent plans to do so, according to a survey of over 100 law firms from CBRE, the world's leading real estate advisor.
Of the firms already employing AI, 63% of firms are using it for legal document generation and review, and the same proportion for e-discovery. Due diligence (47%) and research (42%) were also common applications, along with compliance and administrative legal support (each 32%).
The use of AI will affect employment levels, with the greatest impact predicted at the junior and support levels, where nearly half (45%) of firms believing that there will be a reduction in headcount. In contrast, only 7% of firms believe that senior headcount levels will be reduced.
As far as agile working is concerned, there are clear signs that the traditional partner’s office culture is declining among law firms, with 33% now in more open or activity based working environments. This figure is likely to increase, particularly amongst UK law firms.
 




“






Our study found considerable uncertainty around the impacts of AI on employment, reflected by over 30% who were unsure of the potential impact at each level. This will make formulating a dynamic real estate strategy, to cope with these structural changes to the sector, particularly problematic for law firms.

We expect the proportion of firms engaging in activity-based agile working environments to increase in the coming years. Compared with some other professional services businesses, such as consulting firms, the legal sector has been slow to adapt to agile working, but this is changing. Of the firms surveyed, 61% have now implemented agile working policies – a doubling since last year’s report. 
Frances Warner Lacey, Senior Director, Central London Tenant Advisory Group, CBRE„






 





In spite of speculation about businesses moving away from London following the EU Referendum, the study indicated that the vast majority of law firms (98%) expect no impact on profitability as a result of the referendum.In total, the CBRE Legal 100 occupy almost 10 million sq ft, spending a total of £495m per annum on rent, up 6.2% from 2013 and representing an average of £49.41 per sq ft, compared to £43.51 per sq ft five years earlier.Frances Warner Lacey concludes: “Along with other professional services, it is interesting to see that law firms who have traditionally been more conservative by nature, are embracing new technology and agile working as key strategies to boost efficiency and collaboration. Whilst employees do not seem in the main to object to agile working, the greatest single challenge to implementation, stated by over a quarter of respondents (27%) is resistance from senior management.“With a number of law firms actively seeking requirements, we expect take-up of office space by law firms to be strong this year, boosted by a number of international law firms who have expanded or plan to expand their presence in London including Sidley Austin, Quinn Emanuel and Akin Gump.”

But the commission distanced itself from proposals to give the most advanced robots the legal status of personhood.“I don’t think it will happen,” Andrus Ansip, a commission vice-president in charge of digital single-market policy told journalists. “I don’t think my vacuum cleaner has to get human rights.”Give robots 'personhood' status, EU committee arguesRead moreLast year a committee of MEPs argued that robots should have a form of electronic personhood, raising the idea of machines being sued in law courts. The proposals were made under the parliament’s own-initiative powers, meaning they had no implications for EU law.The commission said it would appoint a committee to draw up ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. The group of experts from business, civil society and academia will be convened by July to consider AI and its impact on society, including work, social inclusion and privacy.Commission officials stressed they wanted a human-centric approach to AI policy. “Robots will never become humans,” said Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European commissioner for industry.Researchers have said Europe risks being left behind, as the US and China ramp up spending. US tech firms have been luring top British PhD researchers with six-figure salaries. In an attempt to stop the brain drain, leading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European AI institute. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems – or Ellis – it would have centres in a number of countries, including the UK.Last month Emmanuel Macron, the French president, announced €1.5bn in public funding for artificial intelligence by 2022, in a move to turn France into a “startup nation”.To meet the €20bn target, the commission promised to increase its spending by €1.5bn in 2018-20, under the EU research programme known as Horizon 2020. It hopes this will trigger €2.5bn in extra spending through public-private partnerships.The UK is among a group of 24 European countries that signed a declaration this month pledging a European approach to artificial intelligence. “It can ... solve key societal challenges, from sustainable healthcare to climate change and from cybersecurity to sustainable migration,” the ministerial declaration said.Against the backdrop of Brexit, tensions have flared over Britain’s role in EU scientific projects. The UK is considering plans to launch its own satellite navigation system as a rival to the EU’s Galileo, amid a row over information security.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has taken legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim €1.4bn it has invested since the project’s launch, the Financial Times reported.Bieńkowska, who will be delivering the project, said she would be speaking to the secretary of state later on Wednesday. “The fact is that the UK, Britain, will become a third country from 30 March next year and of course we are assessing the consequences ... both for the 27 member states and for the UK.”She said it was “the right time to start thinking about adjusting cooperation” on Galileo, adding that her main priority was to deliver the satellite navigation system “on time and on budget”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European CommissionComputingEuropean UnionEuropeHuman biologyChinanewsShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But a male staff member barely registered her presence, saying “The secretaries work down the hall.” So began the rise of one of the few female African American roboticists in America.To be fair, Dr. Howard’s staffer probably didn't realize that the young woman entering the lab was his boss because he had never met a female robotics Ph.D. Even today, although 74 percent of girls are interested in technology-related fields such as computer science, as adults they represent only 25 percent of all computing occupations.

      A 1970’s TV character, half woman half robot, was another role model for Dr. Howard. She saw the possibility of a woman using bionics—mechanical and electronic systems that mimic biological ones—to do good in the world. And so, inspired by real life as well as entertainment role models, Dr. Howard set her course for a career in robotics.Growing up in Pasadena, California, Dr. Howard didn’t realize she could be labeled by her appearance. It wasn’t until college that she discovered racism in the classroom when she and the only other two minority women in the class had their grades cut unfairly. Yet, she persisted, achieving her B.S. from Brown University, M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, and her M.B.A. from the Drucker School of Management at Claremont University.Most PopularHollywoodShannen Doherty, Star of Charmed, Heathers, and Beverly Hills, 90210, Dies at 53By Tracy Moore, Vanity FairPoliticsRFK Jr.’s Family Doesn’t Want Him to Run. Even They May Not Know His Darkest Secrets.By Joe HaganHollywoodFormer Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Victoria Kalina Had a Hard Road Out of TexasBy Julie Miller, Vanity FairShows like HBO’s Westworld provide a new generation of young women with the kind of characters that inspired Dr. Howard. In the show, robots Delores and Maeve learn to drop their subservient programming in order to take charge of their lives and induce others—including powerful men—to follow them. Asked how she did it, Dolores responds, “I imagined a story where I didn’t have to be the damsel.”Dr. Howard is also changing socially constructed narratives—such as who gets to be the boss in robotics. She was 27 years old when she took charge of the NASA team developing artificial intelligence for Mars rovers. Almost 20 years later, she’s now the Chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and the chief technology officer of Zyrobotics, a company she co-founded in 2013 to build educational products for children.For the past two years Dr. Howard has been studying bias in robotics, inspired by previous studies that reveal bias in artificial intelligence (AI).

As if that isn’t low enough, women leave the tech industry at twice the rate men do.
“The only thing that’s saved me is that I was stubborn,” says Dr. Howard. “I credit my upbringing with giving me confidence, although even then that wasn’t enough.”
Her mom was a computer scientist and her dad was an engineer. Exposure to tech-related fields is key for a child to later succeed in technology, as studies such as The Equality of Opportunity Project’s “Who Becomes an Inventor in America: The Importance of Exposure to Innovation” reveal. “If you can’t see it, you can’t be it,” affirms Howard.
A 1970’s TV character, half woman half robot, was another role model for Dr. Howard. She saw the possibility of a woman using bionics—mechanical and electronic systems that mimic biological ones—to do good in the world. And so, inspired by real life as well as entertainment role models, Dr. Howard set her course for a career in robotics.
Growing up in Pasadena, California, Dr. Howard didn’t realize she could be labeled by her appearance. It wasn’t until college that she discovered racism in the classroom when she and the only other two minority women in the class had their grades cut unfairly. Yet, she persisted, achieving her B.S. from Brown University, M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, and her M.B.A. from the Drucker School of Management at Claremont University.
Shows like HBO’s Westworld provide a new generation of young women with the kind of characters that inspired Dr. Howard. In the show, robots Delores and Maeve learn to drop their subservient programming in order to take charge of their lives and induce others—including powerful men—to follow them. Asked how she did it, Dolores responds, “I imagined a story where I didn’t have to be the damsel.”
Dr. Howard is also changing socially constructed narratives—such as who gets to be the boss in robotics. She was 27 years old when she took charge of the NASA team developing artificial intelligence for Mars rovers. Almost 20 years later, she’s now the Chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and the chief technology officer of Zyrobotics, a company she co-founded in 2013 to build educational products for children.
For the past two years Dr. Howard has been studying bias in robotics, inspired by previous studies that reveal bias in artificial intelligence (AI). For example, an investigation led by MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini and partner Timnit Gebru, on facial-analysis programs from major tech companies, uncovered skin-type and gender biases. The AIs only had a 0.8 error rate when analyzing light-skinned men and up to a 34 percent error rate when analyzing dark-skinned women. Implicit racism and sexism such as this led Dr. Howard to question how much the field of robotics is affected.
In Dr. Howard’s 2017 paper in The Science and Engineering Ethics Journal, “The Ugly Truth About Ourselves and Our Robot Creations: The Problem of Bias and Social Inequality,” she points out that the biases of the world at large appear to have crept into artificial intelligence. “Intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society.

A 2017 US Department of Defense study of the future operating environment has described artificial intelligence as the most disruptive technology of our time. The potential applications of artificial intelligence, and the deep learning capabilities it brings, may be one of the most profound artifacts of the fourth industrial revolution. Indeed, for the first time in two centuries, informed and experienced experts such as Secretary James Mattis and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work are questioning whether AI will result in changes in not just the character, but also the nature of war. This highlights how disruptive this technology may be for society, commerce, as well as human competition and conflict.
As a recent Belfer Center report finds, it is vital for non-technologists to be conversant in the basics of AI and machine learning. The aim is to develop a baseline literacy in AI among more military and national security leaders to supplement the expertise of the few technical experts and contractors who design algorithms. This will permit a wider institutional capacity to develop new operating concepts underpinned by human-AI teaming, but also to effect quality control and address the risks of misbehaving algorithms. The military needs an institutional reservoir of generalists who understand the use of AI, and who appreciate how human and AI collaboration can be applied most effectively at each level of command.
To this end, I have assembled some resources that I have found useful as I have developed my knowledge of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the application of these technologies. It is by no means comprehensive, and there will be many War Books readers who can add to the list. I trust this reading list will be a good start, however, in building knowledge about AI among generalist military personnel.

Facing a diminishing workforce, some farmers in the United States are looking to artificial intelligence as a means to adapt to the changing labor landscape. In Florida, for example, Gary Wishnatzki of Wish Farms is rolling out AI-powered robots that are capable of picking his crops. 
Wish Farms in FL made a name for itself as a producer of premium strawberries and blueberries. Strawberries are a particularly demanding crop; since every three days, the plant will give off new ripe fruit. If these fruits are not harvested according to their cycle, the strawberry plant dies. 
According to Wishnatzki, his farms need around 600 workers to harvest his 600 acres of crops every two or three days. Thus, during season, workers are faced with very few rest days. In a statement to CBS News, Wishnatzki noted that his farms’ labor force, a significant number of whom is from Mexico, has been facing challenges over the past 15 years.

“We’ve seen a shrinking labor force and an aging labor force. People just aren’t showing up anymore to do this work. I started to look at what was really causing it. It was more of a demographic issue than a political issue or anything else. As the Mexican economy continues to improve as more fruit is being grown in Mexico, people aren’t going to be coming anymore,” Wishnatzki said. 
In order to address his farm’s shortage of workers, Wishnatzki looked to automation through AI-powered robots. He co-founded Harvest CROO Robotics, a company aimed at developing a machine that can pick crops using robots and artificial intelligence. A few years later, Harvest CROO has created an AI-powered robot that uses imaging technology to determine which berries are ripe enough to pick. The technology behind the AI-powered robot was described to CBS News by Paul Bisset, Harvest CROO’s CEO. 
“We’re collecting 50 to 100 images a plant, and all of those images are fed into our AI system in order to tell us, OK, this is a good berry, this is one we want to go after,” Bisset said. 
Even farming giants are turning to Silicon Valley to advance their operations. Farming equipment producer John Deere, for one, has opened an office in San Francisco aimed at developing smart solutions that can be used for the agricultural sector. Alex Purdy, the head of John Deere Labs, stated that the future of farming lies in advanced tech. 
“We know that we absolutely need to go and seek out capabilities in machine learning, in deep learning, in robotics and advanced analytics. And Silicon Valley has been receptive,” he said. 
As we noted in a previous report, using technology in agriculture has been the focus of Kimbal Musk through his company, Square Roots. Square Roots converts old shipping containers into advanced vertical farms, which would enable even the most populated cities to have access to fresh, organic food. So far, Kimbal’s initiative continues to gain ground, just as his nonprofit, Big Green, continues to expand its reach into schools across America.
