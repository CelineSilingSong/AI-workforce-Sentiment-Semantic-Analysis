Getty
Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to permeate our daily lives by 2025. This could have huge implications on several business sectors, most notably healthcare, customer service and logistics. Already, AI is responsible for medical research breakthroughs and climate research, not to mention self-driving cars.


Will robots replace human workers? 

The answer to that seems to be divided. According to Pew Research, about half (48%) of experts surveyed felt that robots and digital agents will displace a significant number of blue- and white-collar jobs. Their concern is that this will increase income inequality and create a mass of virtually unemployable people. The other half (52%) expect robotics and AI to create more jobs than they take. This latter half believes that while AI will replace humans, these experts have faith in human ingenuity to create new jobs, industries, and new ways of making a living—much like at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.

Of interest in the Pew study, both groups are concerned that our educational institutions are not adequately preparing people for the job market of tomorrow.

What is artificial intelligence? 
PROMOTED
AI in its simplest form stands for artificial intelligence designed to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. Advocates of AI see this as a positive step forward. It will make it easier for businesses to identify and rectify problems. AI will potentially improve recruitment, cybersecurity, marketing, and standard operating processes.
AI can process large amounts of data and execute complex algorithms quickly and accurately. Each year, AI is getting ""smarter"" and increasing business efficiency.

Leading expert Martina Mara, professor of robopsychology at Johannes Kepler University Linz, suggests we ask a different question: What do we want the future of work to look like? How do we want robots to change our lives? She reminds us that robots are developed by people. While robots can work 24/7, they cannot generalize or contextualize. They have no soft skills.

They're hard wired, literally, to perform highly specific and clearly structured tasks. This is great news for humans—we get to pass off the mundane repetitive tasks and adopt those that require critical thinking and problem solving based on human intuition.

AI is evolving and technology is having an increasingly bigger role, but it will complement and augment most jobs, not replace them. In a study involving 1500 companies, researchers found that the most significant performance improvements occurred when humans and machines worked together. Humans perform three crucial roles: they train machines what to do, explain outcomes especially when those are counterintuitive or controversial, and they sustain responsible use of machines. Robots need us just as much as we need them.
Robots are used to do the heavy lifting, literally. In manufacturing, cobots, context-aware robots, perform repetitive actions dominated by heavy lifting, while their human coworker completes complementary tasks that require more dexterity and judgment.
Whether you are pro-bot or anti-bot, you may not have a choice. Rosie the Robot who worked for the Jetsons is probably still far away, but we already have robots that will vacuum our floors and AI has been used in the customer service industry for years.
We need to begin to look at how we can improve technology-related skills while at the same time promoting characteristically human skills. Creativity, intuition, initiative and critical thinking are human skills that will not likely translate to robots—at least not soon. We should already be thinking of how we as employers and employees can harness robots to augment the work we do.
If not already, it won't be long before your next co-worker is a robot.

The Socialists and Democrats have declared their support for the development and use of human-centric artificial intelligence technologies in the EU to help develop crucial areas of our society and economy. The S&Ds showed their support for the report of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age during the plenary debate in the European Parliament and the report was adopted this afternoon. AI can offer great benefits to society, including in the fields of healthcare and environmental protection, as well as opportunities for small and medium enterprises. The S&D Group wants the EU to benefit from all the opportunities AI brings, while ensuring we are protected from the potential hidden risks of these technologies, especially in relation to workers' rights and people’s private lives.
Brando Benifei MEP, the S&D negotiator on the issue of Artificial Intelligence, said: 
“Artificial intelligence brings a lot of opportunities to people in their daily lives, but we have to make sure this fully respects human dignity, the environment and the achievements of democracy. The EU should lead in a global debate about artificial intelligence and work on settling global standards. What the S&D Group wants to avoid at any price is turning Europe into a surveillance society with the help of AI. Europe is a world champion in the protection of privacy, protection of personal data and workers’ rights. We should not allow any undermining of all the achievements we, the Socialists and Democrats, have fought for so hard throughout the years. The surveillance of workers or biometric recognition in public spaces are against these values and we will continue to fight so that they are not allowed in Europe.”
Ibán García del Blanco MEP, S&D spokesperson in the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age, said: 
“After 18 months of work, our special committee has brought together a very balanced report where different aspects of human activity and challenges to the EU are reflected. Among them are the impact of AI on the daily lives of our citizens; its contribution to healthcare; the ways it can benefit the goals of the Green Deal; possible implications for democracy; the need for gender balance; and so many more. AI-powered surveillance in the workplace should not be allowed, as it severely compromises fundamental rights and mental health. We should continue a democratic dialogue with citizens, promoting AI literacy at all levels in order to have a technology that respects fundamental and workers’ rights.”

Editor’s note: On May 3 Eric Horvitz, Chief Scientific Officer, testified before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cybersecurity for a hearing on the use of AI in Department of Defense cyber missions. Read Eric Horvitz’s written testimony below and watch the hearing here.
 

Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Rounds, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to share insights about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on cybersecurity. I applaud the Subcommittee for its foresight and leadership in holding a hearing on this critically important topic. Microsoft is committed to working collaboratively with you to help ensure new advances in AI and cybersecurity benefit our country and society more broadly.
My perspective is grounded in my experiences working across industry, academia, scientific agencies, and government. As Microsoft’s Chief Scientific Officer, I provide leadership and perspectives on scientific advances and trends at the frontiers of our understandings, and on issues and opportunities rising at the intersection of technology, people, and society. I have been pursuing and managing research on principles and applications of AI technologies for several decades, starting with my doctoral work at Stanford University. I served as a Commissioner on the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI), was president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), chaired the Section on Computing, Information, and Communication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). I am a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. I currently serve on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Academies of Sciences.
I will cover in my testimony four key areas of attention at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity that warrant deeper understanding and thoughtful action:

Advancing cybersecurity with AI
Uses of AI to power cyberattacks
Vulnerabilities of AI systems to attacks
Uses of AI in malign information operations

Before covering these topics, I will provide brief updates on the cybersecurity landscape and on recent progress in AI. I’ll conclude my testimony with reflections about directions.
1. Cybersecurity’s changing landscape
Attacks on computing systems and infrastructure continue to grow in complexity, speed, frequency, and scale. We have seen new attack techniques and the exploitation of new attack surfaces aimed at disrupting critical infrastructure and accessing confidential data.[1] In 2021 alone, the Microsoft 365 Defender suite, supported by AI techniques, blocked more than 9.6 billion malware threats, 35.7 billion phishing and malicious emails, and 25.6 billion attempts to hijack customer accounts targeting both enterprise and consumer devices.[2],[3] Multiple independent reports have characterized the nature and status of different forms of cyberattack.[4] As detailed in Microsoft’s recent Digital Defense Report,[5] cyber criminals and nation-state actors continue to adapt their techniques to exploit new vulnerabilities and counter cyber defenses.
To help mitigate these concerning trends, the U.S. government has taken significant steps forward to secure our cyber ecosystem. Congress enacted several recommendations that came out of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, such as creating the Office of the National Cyber Director and enacting cyber incident reporting legislation. Almost a year ago, the Administration issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, which directs agencies to develop and implement a variety of initiatives to raise the bar on cybersecurity across areas, such as supply chain security, and requiring agencies to adopt a zero-trust model. Microsoft has worked diligently to meet deadlines specified in the E.O. on cybersecurity and we support these efforts to encourage a cohesive response to evolving cyber threats.
We expect to face continuing efforts by creative and tireless state and non-state actors who will attempt to attack computing systems with the latest available technologies. We need to continue to work proactively and reactively to address threats and to note changes in systems, technologies, and patterns of usage. On the latter, cybersecurity challenges have been exacerbated by the increasing fluidity between online work and personal activities as daily routines have become more intertwined.[6] The large-scale shift to a paradigm of hybrid work coming with the COVID-19 pandemic has moved workers further away from traditional, controlled environments. Cybersecurity solutions must enable people to work productively and securely across various devices from a variety of non-traditional locations.
2. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science focused on developing principles and mechanisms to solve tasks that are typically associated with human cognition, such as perception, reasoning, language, and learning. Numerous milestones have been achieved in AI theory and applications over the 67 years since the phrase “artificial intelligence” was first used in a funding proposal that laid out a surprisingly modern vision for the field.[7]
Particularly stunning progress has been made over the last decade, spanning advances in machine vision (e.g., object recognition), natural language understanding, speech recognition, automated diagnosis, reasoning, robotics, and machine learning—procedures for learning from data. Many impressive gains across subdisciplines of AI are attributed to a machine learning methodology named deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs have delivered unprecedented accuracy when fueled by large amounts of data and computational resources.
Breakthroughs in accuracy include performances that exceed human baselines for a number of specific benchmarks, including sets of skills across vision and language subtasks. While AI scientists remain mystified by the powers of human intellect, the rate of progress has surprised even seasoned experts.
Jumps in core AI capabilities have led to impressive demonstrations and real-world applications, including systems designed to advise decision makers, generate textual and visual content, and to provide new forms of automation, such as the control of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.
AI technologies can be harnessed to inject new efficiencies and efficacies into existing workflows and processes. The methods also can be used to introduce fundamentally new approaches to standing challenges.  When deployed in a responsible and insightful manner, AI technologies can enhance the quality of the lives of our citizenry and add to the vibrancy of our nation and world.  For example, AI technologies show great promise in enhancing healthcare via providing physicians with assistance on diagnostic challenges, guidance on optimizing therapies, and inferences about the structure and interaction of proteins that lead to new medications.
AI advances have important implications for the Department of Defense, our intelligence community, and our national security more broadly. Like any technology, the rising capabilities of AI are available to friends and foes alike. Thus, in addition to harnessing AI for making valuable contributions to people and society, we must continue to work to understand and address the possibilities that the technologies can be used by malevolent actors and adversaries to disrupt, interfere, and destroy. AI has important implications for cybersecurity as the technologies can provide both new powers for defending against cyberattacks and new capabilities to adversaries.
3. Advancing Cybersecurity with AI
The value of harnessing AI in cybersecurity applications is becoming increasingly clear. Amongst many capabilities, AI technologies can provide automated interpretation of signals generated during attacks, effective threat incident prioritization, and adaptive responses to address the speed and scale of adversarial actions. The methods show great promise for swiftly analyzing and correlating patterns across billions of data points to track down a wide variety of cyber threats of the order of seconds. Additionally, AI can continually learn and adapt to new attack patterns—drawing insights from past observations to detect similar attacks that occur in the future.
3.1 Assisting and Complementing Workforce
 The power of automation and large-scale detection, prioritization, and response made possible by AI technologies can not only relieve the burden on cybersecurity professionals but also help with the growing workforce gap. On the challenges to current cyber workforce: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates cybersecurity job opportunities will grow 33% from 2020 to 2030—more than six times the national average.[8] However, the number of people entering the field is not keeping pace. There is a global shortage of 2.72 million cybersecurity professionals, according to the 2021 (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study released in October 2021.[9]
 Organizations that prioritize cybersecurity run security operations teams 24/7. Still, there are often far more alerts to analyze than there are analysts to triage them, resulting in missed alerts that evolve into breaches. Trend Micro released a survey in May 2021 of security operations center decision makers that showed that 51% feel their team is overwhelmed with the overall volume of alerts, 55% are not confident in their ability to efficiently prioritize and respond to alerts, and that 27% of their time is spent dealing with false positives.[10]
AI technologies enable defenders to effectively scale their protection capabilities, orchestrate and automate time-consuming, repetitive, and complicated response actions. These methods can enable cybersecurity teams to handle large volumes of classical threats in more relevant time frames with less human intervention and better results. Such support with scaling on the essentials can free cybersecurity professionals to focus and prioritize on those attacks that require specialized expertise, critical thinking, and creative problem solving. However, additional attention should also be given to general cybersecurity training, security awareness, secure development lifecycle practices, and simulated training modules, including using AI to run intelligent and personalized simulations.
3.2 AI at Multiple Stages of Security
Today, AI methods are being harnessed across all stages of security including prevention, detection, investigation and remediation, discovery and classification, threat intelligence, and security training and simulations. I will discuss each of these applications in turn.
Prevention. Prevention encompasses efforts to reduce the vulnerability of software to attack, including user identities and data, computing system endpoints, and cloud applications. AI methods are currently used in commercially available technologies to detect and block both known and previously unknown threats before they can cause harm. In 2021, AV-Test Institute observed over 125 million new malware threats.[11] The ability of machine learning techniques to generalize from past patterns to catch new malware variants is key to being able to protect users at scale.
As an example, last year Microsoft 365 Defender successfully blocked a file that would later be confirmed as a variant of the GoldMax malware. Defender had never seen the new variant of GoldMax. The malware was caught and blocked leveraging the power of an AI pattern recognizer working together with a technology known as “fuzzy hashing”—a means for taking a fingerprint of malware.[12] It is important to note that GoldMax is malware that persists on networks, feigning to be a “scheduled task” by impersonating the activities of systems management software. Such hiding out as a scheduled task is part of the tools, tactics, and procedures of NOBELIUM, the Russian state actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds in December 2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service known as the SVR.
In other work, we have found that AI methods can improve our ability to detect sophisticated phishing attacks. Phishing attacks center on social engineering, where an attacker creates a fake webpage or sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive data to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim’s device, such as ransomware. To help protect people from harmful URLs, AI pattern recognizers have been deployed in browsers and other applications as part of their security services. AI methods can improve detection while lowering false positive rates, which can frustrate end users.[13]
Detection. Detection involves identifying and alerting suspicious behaviors as they happen. The goal is to quickly respond to attacks, including identifying the scale and scope of an attack, closing the attacker’s entry, and remediating footholds that the attacker may have established. The key challenge with detecting suspicious activity is to find the right balance between providing enough coverage via seeking high rates of accurate security alerts versus false alarms. AI methods are being leveraged in detection to (1) triage attention to alerts about potential attacks, (2) identify multiple attempts at breaches over time that are part of larger and lengthier attack campaigns, (3) detecting fingerprints of the activities of malware as it operates within a computer or on a network, (4) identifying the flow of malware through an organization,[14] and (5) guiding automated approaches to mitigation when a response needs to be fast to stop an attack from propagating. For example, an automated system can shut down network connectivity and contain a device if a sequence of alerts is detected that is known to be associated with ransomware activity like the way a bank might decline a credit card transaction that appears fraudulent.
There are several technologies available today to help detect attacks. I will use Microsoft 365 Defender capabilities as an example. A set of neural network models are used to detect a potential attack underway by fusing multiple signals about activities within a computing system, including processes being started and stopped, files being changed and renamed, and suspicious network communication.[15], [16] In addition, probabilistic algorithms are used to detect high likelihoods of “lateral movement” on a network.[17] Lateral movement refers to malware, such as ransomware, moving from machine to machine as it infects an organization. The goal is to detect signals of concerning patterns of spread and to shut down the infection by isolating potentially infected machines and alerting security experts to investigate. As numerous legitimate operations can appear like lateral movement of malware, simplistic approaches can have high false-positive rates. AI systems can help to raise the rate of capture and block these spreading infections, while reducing false positives.[18]
As a recent example, in March 2022, Microsoft leveraged its AI models to identify an attack attributed to a Russian actor that Microsoft tracks as Iridium, also referred to as Sandworm.  The US government has attributed Iridium activity to a group allegedly based at GRU Unit 74455 of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The actor deployed wiper malware at a Ukrainian shipping company based in Lviv. Wiper malware erases data and programs on the computers that it infects. The first documented encounter of this malware was on a system running Microsoft Defender with Cloud Protection enabled. The ensemble of machine learning models in Defender, combined with signals across client and cloud, allowed Microsoft to block this malware at first sight.
Investigation and remediation. Investigation and remediation are methods used following a breach to provide customers with a holistic understanding of the security incident, including the extent of the breach, which devices and data were impacted, how the attack propagated through the customer environment, and to seek attribution for the threat.[19] Gathering and doing synthesis from telemetry sources is tedious. Efforts to date include multiple tools to collect telemetry from within and across organizations. The use of AI for investigation and remediation is a promising and open area of research.[20],[21]
Threat intelligence. Threat intelligence enables security researchers to stay on top of the current threat landscape by tracking active malicious actors, at times deliberately engaging with them and studying their behavior. Today, Microsoft actively tracks 40+ active nation-state actors and 140+ threat groups across 20 countries.[22],[23] AI methods help to identify and tag entities from multiple feeds and intelligence sharing across agencies. AI models show promise with their ability to learn and make inferences about high-level relationships and interactions by identifying similarities across different campaigns for enhancing threat attribution.[24],[25]
Recommendations: Advance development and application of AI methods to defend against cyberattacks

Follow best practices in cybersecurity hygiene, including implementation of core protections such as multifactor authentication. Bolster security teams, regularly test backups and update patches, test incident response plans, and limit internet access to networks that do not require internet connectivity.
Invest in training and education to strengthen the U.S. workforce in cybersecurity, including education and training programs on cybersecurity for both traditional and AI systems.
Invest in R&D on harnessing machine learning, reasoning, and automation to detect, respond, and protect every step of the cyberattack kill chain.
Incentivize the creation of cross-sector partnerships to catalyze sharing and collaboration around cybersecurity experiences, datasets, best practices, and research.
Develop cybersecurity-specific benchmarks and leaderboards specific to validate research and accelerate learnings.

4. AI-powered cyberattacks
While AI is improving our ability to detect cybersecurity threats, organizations and consumers will face new challenges as cybersecurity attacks increase in sophistication. To date, adversaries have commonly employed software tools in a manual manner to reach their objectives. They have been successful in exfiltrating sensitive data about American citizens, interfering with elections, and distributing propaganda on social media without the sophisticated use of AI technologies. [26],[27],[28] While there is scarce information to date on the active use of AI in cyberattacks, it is widely accepted that AI technologies can be used to scale cyberattacks via various forms of probing and automation. Multiple research and gaming efforts within cybersecurity communities have demonstrated the power using AI methods to attack computing systems. This area of work is referred to as offensive AI.[29],[30]
4.1 Approaches to offensive AI
Offensive AI methods will likely be taken up as tools of the trade for powering and scaling cyberattacks.  We must prepare ourselves for adversaries who will exploit AI methods to increase the coverage of attacks, the speed of attacks, and the likelihood of successful outcomes. We expect that uses of AI in cyberattacks will start with sophisticated actors but will rapidly expand to the broader ecosystem via increasing levels of cooperation and commercialization of their tools.[31]
Basic automation. Just as defenders use AI to automate their processes, so too can adversaries introduce efficiencies and efficacies for their own benefit. Automating attacks using basic pre-programmed logic is not new in cybersecurity. Many malware and ransomware variants over the last five years have used relatively simple sets of logical rules to recognize and adapt to operating environments. For example, it appears that attacking software has checked time zones to adapt to local working hours and customized behavior in a variety of ways to avoid detection or take tailored actions to adapt to the target computing environment.[32],[33] On another front, automated bots have begun to proliferate on social media platforms.[34] These are all rudimentary forms of AI that encode and harness an attacker’s expert knowledge. However, substantial improvements in AI technology make plausible malicious software that is much more adaptive, stealthy, and intrusive.[35]
Authentication-based attacks. AI methods can be employed in authentication-based attacks, where, for example, recently developed AI methods can be used to generate synthetic voiceprints to gain access through an authentication system. Compelling demonstrations of voice impersonations to fool an authentication system were presented during the Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competition at the 2018 DEF CON meeting.[36]
AI-powered social engineering. Human perception and psychology are weak links in cyber-defense. AI can be used to exploit this persistent vulnerability. We have seen the rise of uses of AI for social engineering, aiming the power of machine learning at influencing the actions of people to perform tasks that are not in their interest. As an example, AI methods can be used to generate ultra-personalized phishing attacks capable of fooling even the most security conscious users. A striking 2018 study demonstrated how AI methods could be used to significantly raise the probability that end users would click on malevolent links in social media posts. The AI system learned from publicly available data including online profiles, connections, content of posts, and online activity of targeted individuals. Machine-learning was used to optimize the timing and content of messages with a goal of maximizing clickthrough rates—with significant results.[37] A 2021 study demonstrated that the language of emails could be crafted automatically with large-scale neural language models and that the AI-generated messages were more successful than the human-written messages by a significant margin.[38] In a related direction, Microsoft has tracked groups that use AI to craft convincing but fake social media profiles as lures.
4.2 AI-powered cyberattacks on the frontier
The need to prepare for more sophisticated offensive AI was highlighted in presentations at a National Academies of Sciences workshop on offensive AI that I co-organized in 2019. The workshop, sponsored by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led to a report available from the Academies.[39] The report includes discussion of the applications of AI methods across the cyber kill-chain, including the use of AI methods in social engineering, discovery of vulnerabilities, exploiting development and targeting, and malware adaptation, as well as in methods and tools that can be used to target vulnerabilities in Al-enabled systems, such as autonomous systems and controls used in civilian and military applications.
The cybersecurity research community has demonstrated the power of AI and other sophisticated computational methods in cyberattacks. Adversaries can harness AI to efficiently guess passwords, to attack industrial control systems without raising suspicions, and to create malware that evades detection or prevents inspection[40],[41],[42],[43],[44],[45] AI-enabled bots can also automate network attacks and make it difficult to extinguish the attacker’s command and control channels.[46] In another direction, a competitor demonstrated at a DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge exercise in 2016 [47] how machine learning could be used to learn how to generate “chaff” traffic, decoy patterns of online activity that resemble the distribution of events seen in real attacks for distraction and cover-up of actual attack strategies.[48]
It is safe to assume that AI will improve the success, impact, and scope of the full breadth of threats present today. AI will also introduce new challenges, including special cyber vulnerabilities introduced with general uses of AI components and applications, which create new apertures for adversaries to exploit.
Recommendations: Prepare for malicious uses of AI to perform cyberattacks

Raise DoD and other Federal agency awareness of the threat of AI-powered cyberattacks and directions with defenses against them, including detecting and thwarting new forms of automation and scaling.
DoD should deeply engage with the cybersecurity community, participate in R&D and competitions on AI-enhanced cyberattacks and continue to learn from frontier advances, findings, and proposed mitigations.
Increase R&D funding for exploring challenges and opportunities at the convergence of AI and cybersecurity. Consider the establishment of federally funded R&D centers of excellence in cybersecurity. Execute on the NSCAI recommendation to invest in DARPA to facilitate greater research on AI-enabled cyber defenses.[49]
Formalize and make more efficient cross-sector networks for sharing updates on evolving technologies, data, attack vectors, and attacks.

5. Special vulnerabilities of AI systems
The power and growing reliance on AI generates a perfect storm for a new type of cyber-vulnerability: attacks targeted directly at AI systems and components. With attention focused on developing and integrating AI capabilities into applications and workflows, the security of AI systems themselves is often overlooked. However, adversaries see the rise of new AI attack surfaces growing in diversity and ubiquity and will no doubt be pursuing vulnerabilities. Attacks on AI systems can come in the form of traditional vulnerabilities, via basic manipulations and probes, and via a new, troubling category: adversarial AI.
5.1 Attacks on AI Supply Chains 
AI systems can be attacked via targeting traditional security weaknesses and software flaws, including attacks on the supply chain of AI systems, where malevolent actors gain access and manipulate insecure AI code and data. As an example, in 2021, a popular software platform used to build neural networks was found to have 201 traditional security vulnerabilities, such as memory corruption and code execution.[50] Researchers have demonstrated how adversaries could use existing cyberattack toolkits to attack core infrastructure of the software running AI systems.[51] Multiple components of AI systems in the supply chain of AI systems can be modified or corrupted via traditional cyberattacks. As an example, data sets used to train AI systems are rarely under version control in the same way that source code is. Researchers from NYU found that most AI frameworks downloaded from a popular algorithm repository do not check the integrity of AI models, in contrast to the standards of practice with traditional software, where cryptographic verification of executables/libraries has been standard practice for well over a decade.[52]
5.2 Adversarial AI
Adversarial AI or adversarial machine learning methods harness more sophisticated AI techniques to attack AI systems. Several classes of adversarial AI have been identified, including adversarial examples, the use of basic policies or more sophisticated machine learning methods to fool AI systems with inputs that cause the systems to fail to function properly. A second type of attack is called data poisoning, where data used to train AI systems are “poisoned” with streams of data that inject erroneous or biased training data into data sets, changing the behavior or degrading the performance of AI systems.[53] A third type of attack, called model stealing, seeks to learn details about the underlying AI model used in an AI system.[54] A fourth category of attack, called model inversion, seeks to reconstruct the underlying private data that is used to train the target system.[55]
With adversarial examples, basic manipulations or more sophisticated application of AI methods are used to generate inputs that are custom-tailored to cause failures in targeted AI systems. Goals of these attacks include disruptive failures of automated message classifiers, perceptions of machine vision systems, and recognitions of the words in utterances by speech recognition systems.
As an example of basic manipulations of inputs, a group, alleged to be within the Chinese government, attempted to amplify propaganda on Uyghurs by bypassing Twitter’s anti-spam algorithm via appending random characters at the end of tweets.[56] The approach was viewed as an attempt to mislead the algorithm into thinking each tweet was unique and legitimate. In another example, researchers from Skylight appended benign code from a gaming database to Wannacry ransomware to cause the machine-learning-based antivirus filter to classify the modified ransomware as benign.[57] In related work on the fragility of AI systems, researchers showed that simply rotating a scan of a skin lesion confuses a computer recognition system to classify the image as malignant.[58]
In uses of AI to generate adversarial examples, researchers have demonstrated stunning examples of failures. In one approach, adversarial methods are used to inject patterns of pixels into images to change what an AI system sees. While the changes with AI inferences are dramatic, the changes to the original images are not detectable by humans. Sample demonstrations include the modification of a photo of a panda leading an AI system to misclassify the panda as a gibbon and changes to a stop sign to misclassify it as a yield sign.[59],[60] Similar demonstrations have been done in the realm of speech recognition, with the injection of hidden acoustical patterns in speech that changes what a listening system hears.[61] Attacks leading to such misclassifications and malfunctions can be extremely costly, particularly in high-stakes domains like defense, transportation, healthcare, and industrial processes.
Challenges of adversarial AI and a set of recommendations are called out in the final report of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI).[62] I chaired the lines of effort on directions with developing and fielding trustworthy, responsible, and ethical AI applications, leading to chapters 7 and 8 of the report and the appendix on NSCAI’s recommendations on key considerations for fielding AI systems that align with democratic values, civil liberties, and human rights.[63],[64],[65] Chapter 7 of the report covers rising concerns with adversarial AI, including the assessment that, “The threat is not hypothetical: adversarial attacks are happening and already impacting commercial ML systems.” In support of this statement, over the last five years, the Microsoft cybersecurity team has seen an uptick in adversarial AI attacks.[66] I believe the trend will continue.
5.3 Efforts to Mitigate Adversarial AI
Pursuit of resistant systems. Computer science R&D has been underway on methods for making AI systems more resistant to adversarial machine learning attacks. One area of work centers on raising the level of robustness of systems to attacks with adversarial inputs as described above.[67],[68] Approaches include special training procedures to include adversarial examples, validation of inputs to identify specific properties that can reveal signs of an attack and making changes to the overall approach to building models, and modifying the objective functions used in optimization procedures used to create the models so that more robust models are created. While the latter techniques and research directions behind them are promising, the challenges of adversarial examples persist, per the large space of inputs to machine learning procedures. Thus, it is important to continue to invest in R&D on adversarial AI, to perform ongoing studies with red-teaming exercises, and to remain vigilant.
5.4 Tracking, Awareness, and Resources
Front-line awareness. Despite the opportunities that adversarial AI methods will provide to state and non-state actors for manipulating and disrupting critical AI systems and rising evidence of real-world attacks with adversarial AI, the idea of protecting AI systems from these attacks has been largely an afterthought. There is an urgency to be aware and to be ready to respond to adversarial AI threats, especially those used in critical areas such as defense. A Microsoft survey of 28 organizations in 2020 showed, despite the rise in attacks on AI systems, companies are still unaware of these kinds of intentional failures to AI systems and are massively underinvested in tools and processes to secure AI systems. Ryan Fedasiuk, a noted researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Security of Emerging Technology specializing in China’s AI operations, notes that Chinese military officers have explicitly called out that the U.S. defenses are susceptible to data poisoning, and even so far as calling data integrity as “the Achilles’ heel” of the U.S. joint all-domain command and control strategy.[69]
Resources and Engagement. Microsoft, along with MITRE and 16 other organizations created the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix to catalog threats to AI systems.[70] The content includes documentation of case studies where attacks have been made on commercial AI systems. For engineers and policymakers, Microsoft, in collaboration with Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University, released a taxonomy of machine learning failure modes.[71] For security professionals, Microsoft has open-sourced Counterfit, its own tool for assessing the posture of AI systems.[72] For the broader community of cybersecurity practitioners interested in AI and security, Microsoft hosts the annual Machine Learning Evasion Competition as a venue to exercise their muscle in attacking and securing AI systems.[73] Within the Federal government, the DoD has listed safety and security of AI systems in its core AI principles.[74] And there is encouraging activity by NIST on an AI Risk Assessment Framework to address multiple dimensions of AI systems, including robustness and security.[75]
Recommendations: Raise awareness and address vulnerabilities of AI systems

Secure engineering supply chains for Federal AI systems, including use of state-of-the-art integrity checking for data, executables, libraries, and platforms used to construct AI systems; ensure that a security development lifecycle approach is in place for sensitive code and data.
Require security reviews of AI engineering projects at DoD and other Federal AI agencies.
Bring AI development and cybersecurity teams together to establish best practices and review programs.
Raise DoD awareness of challenges of adversarial AI and consider the vulnerabilities of AI systems and components.
Pursue the use of robust machine learning algorithms to bolster resilience of systems in the face of adversarial examples.
Develop training programs to raise awareness of cybersecurity and AI engineering workforce on security vulnerabilities of AI systems and components, risk of attacks with adversarial AI methods, and means for reducing risks.
Invest in R&D on trustworthy, robust, and secure AI systems.

6. AI in Malign Information Operations
Advances in machine learning and graphics have boosted the abilities of state and non-state actors to fabricate and distribute high-fidelity audiovisual content, referred to as synthetic media and deepfakes. AI technologies for generating deepfakes can now fabricate content that is indistinguishable from real-world people, scenes, and events, threatening national security. Advances that could only be found with the walls of computer science laboratories or in demonstrations that surprised attendees at academic AI conferences several years ago are now widely available in tools that create audio and audiovisual content that can be used to drive disinformation campaigns.
6.1 Challenges of Synthetic Media
Advances in the capabilities of generative AI methods to synthesize a variety of signals, including high-fidelity audiovisual imagery, have significance for cybersecurity. When personalized, the use of AI to generate deepfakes can raise the effectiveness of social-engineering operations (discussed above) in persuading end-users to provide adversaries with access to systems and information.
On a larger scale, the generative power of AI methods and synthetic media have important implications for defense and national security. The methods can be used by adversaries to generate believable statements from world leaders and commanders, to fabricate persuasive false-flag operations, and to generate fake news events. A recent demonstration includes the multiple examples of manipulated and more sophisticated deepfakes that have come to the fore over the course of the Russian attack on Ukraine. This includes a video of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appearing to call for surrender.[76]
The proliferation of synthetic media has had another concerning effect: malevolent actors have labeled real events as “fake,” taking advantage of new forms of deniability coming with the loss of credibility in the deepfake era. Video and photo evidence, such as imagery of atrocities, are being called fake. Known as the “liar’s dividend”, the proliferation of synthetic media emboldens people to claim real media as “fake,” and creates plausible deniability for their actions.[77]
We can expect synthetic media and its deployment to continue grow in sophistication over time, including the persuasive interleaving of deepfakes with unfolding events in the world and real-time synthesis of deepfakes. Real-time generations could be employed to create compelling, interactive imposters (e.g., appearing in teleconferences and guided by a human controller) that appear to have natural head pose, facial expressions, and utterances. Looking further out, we may have to face the challenge of synthetic fabrications of people that can engage autonomously in persuasive real-time conversations over audio and visual channels.
6.2 Direction: Digital Content Provenance
A promising approach to countering the threat of synthetic media can be found in a recent advance, named digital content provenance technology. Digital content provenance leverages cryptography and database technologies to certify the source and history of edits (the provenance) of any digital media. This can provide “glass-to-glass” certification of content, from the photons hitting the light-sensitive surfaces of cameras to the light emitted from the pixels of displays, for secure workloads. We pursued an early vision and technical methods for enabling end-to-end tamper-proof certification of media provenance in a cross-team effort at Microsoft.[78],[79] The aspirational project was motivated by our assessment that, in the long-term, neither humans nor AI methods would be able to reliably distinguish fact from AI-generated fictions—and that we must prepare with urgency for the expected trajectory of increasingly realistic and persuasive deepfakes.
After taking the vision to reality with technical details and the implementation of prototype technologies for certifying the provenance of audiovisual content, we worked to build and contribute to cross-industry partnerships, including Project Origin, the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), and the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a multistakeholder coalition of industry and civil society organizations. [80],[81],[82],[83] In January 2022, C2PA released a specification of a standard that enables the interoperability of digital content provenance systems.[84],[85] Commercial production tools are now becoming available in accordance with the C2PA standard that enable authors and broadcasters to assure viewers about the originating source and history of edits to photo and audiovisual media.
The final report of the NSCAI recommends that digital content provenance technologies should be pursued to mitigate the rising challenge of synthetic media. In Congress, the bipartisan Deepfake Task Force Act (S. 2559) proposes the establishment of the National Deepfake and Digital Provenance Task Force.[86] Microsoft and its media provenance collaborators encourage Congress to move forward with standing-up a task force to help identify and address the challenges of synthetic media and we would welcome the opportunity to provide assistance and input into the work.
 Recommendations: Defend against malign information operations

Enact the Deepfake Task Force Act.
Promote uses of digital media provenance for news and communications in defense and civilian settings.
Adopt pipelines and standards for certifying digital content provenance of signals, communications, and news at DoD and other Federal agencies, prioritized by risk and disruptiveness of fabricated content.
Review potential disruptions that malign information campaigns could have on DoD planning, decision making, and coordination based on manipulative uses of sophisticated fabrications of audiovisual and other signals, spanning traditional Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) pipelines, real-time defense communications, and public news and media.
Invest in R&D on methods aimed at detection, attribution, and disruption of AI-enabled malign information campaigns.

Summary
I have covered in my testimony status, trends, examples, and directions ahead with rising opportunities and challenges at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. AI technologies will continue to be critically important for enhancing cybersecurity in military and civilian applications. AI methods are already qualitatively changing the game in cyber defense. Technical advances in AI have helped in numerous ways, spanning our core abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks—including attacks that have never been seen before. AI innovations are amplifying and extending the capabilities of security teams across the country.
On the other side, state and non-state actors are beginning to leverage AI in numerous ways. They will draw new powers from fast-paced advances in AI and will continue to add new tools to their armamentarium. We need to double down with our attention and investments on threats and opportunities at the convergence of AI and cybersecurity. Significant investments in workforce training, monitoring, engineering, and core R&D will be needed to understand, develop, and operationalize defenses for the breadth of risks we can expect with AI-powered cyberattacks. The threats include new kinds of attacks, including those aimed squarely at AI systems. The DoD, federal and state agencies, and the nation need to stay vigilant and stay ahead of malevolent adversaries. This will take more investment and commitment to fundamental research and engineering on AI and cybersecurity, and in building and nurturing our cybersecurity workforce so our teams can be more effective today—and well-prepared for the future.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering your questions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its mark on the water industry, powering intelligent operations using machine learning to optimize resource use and operational budgets for organizations. Here are 10 ways AI is already changing the water industry, from business innovations that save money and make work more efficient to helping combat global water challenges by lowering overall water consumption.
1. AI will drive a decade of technology investment in water and wastewater
Water and wastewater operations are investing in artificial intelligence. Market research is forecasting $6.3 Billion of investment in AI solutions by the year 2030. This investment is a part of a growing trend for the water industry to “go digital” with smart infrastructure solutions. 


Mel Meng on training AI to SWMM: Can AI help predict sewer flows?
One example of AI in action is in predicting sewer flows. Sewer systems are critical infrastructure that transport wastewater to treatment plants, but with the impacts of climate change, aging infrastructure, and historical design practices, too much raw sewage is being released into our environment, causing harm to our planet and damaging properties. By training an AI model with thousands of examples, the model can learn to predict the next flow value, without the need to know the exact processes. 
2. AI will deliver significant OPEX savings
When some US utilities are spending over $300 per customer annually on water and wastewater operations, the potential for savings is significant. AI can save 20-30% on operational expenditures (OPEX) by reducing energy costs, optimizing chemical use for treatment, and enabling proactive asset maintenance.
3. AI will predict emergency events and learn from them at an accelerated rate
Water main breaks are costly for utilities in both financial and social capital. Articifical intelligence and machine learning can “fingerprint” the data patterns that indicate a break event may be imminent and learn from these patterns so that alerts become more accurate over time.


Water Talk: A guide to low-hanging AI fruit for the water and wastewater sector.
4. AI will provide sophisticated decisioning intelligence to support operators
Operators no longer need to analyze complex variables for important decision-making by themselves. Whether it’s turning pumps on or off, determining chemical dosages, or deciding when to maintain assets, AI enables “Operator 2.0” with intelligent recommendations and driven by machine learning.
5. AI will optimize energy use for both drinking water and wastewater
According to the EPA, for many municipal governments, drinking water and wastewater plants are their largest energy consumers, often accounting for 30 to 40 percent of their total energy consumed. That rolls up nationally to a large amount, with drinking water and wastewater systems accounting for approximately 2 percent of energy use in the United States. 
AI can optimize pump runtimes so that they are only using energy when they need to. This should be an easy cost-reduction win for early adopters of AI.
6. AI will help identify overconsumers of water and help them find ways to use less
The kind of efficiency artificial intelligence promises in water savings goes far beyond traditional utility operations and water distribution, for example in the realm of water footprints for datacenter management. Datacenters are becoming ever more pervasive and need ever-more energy to operate. They also need to build water cooling towers to cool the massive racks of servers they have set up in giant warehouses. 
Datacenters have become massive users of water for cooling racks of servers. Can AI help? 
This is all perhaps a bit ironic, considering that AI and machine learning applications themselves require significant datacenter resources, both in terms of raw energy usage and water usage for water. In some sense, energy-hungry AI applications may need to fulfill their water efficiency promises to alleviate their own water usage. 
Currently, more than 30 percent of the datacenters in the world are located in the US, accounting for around 2% of national elecricity usage. That’s as much energy as water and wastewater plants themselves use. Compiling accurate numbers for water usage by datacenters can be a challenge because the industry appears hesitant to share numbers, but we are already seeing big names like Google be more transparent about their water usage, which may encourage more transparency and solution seeking. 
It’s reasonable to assume that these operators know the amount of water they are using is too high and that they themselves will want to find innovative ways related to AI to help reduce their usage, both to realize more cost savings and improve their optics around the issue of sustainability. 
7. AI will keep water clean, cost-effectively
Meeting effluent compliance standards is a requirement for many organizations – both public and private. AI learns from the unique characteristics of your site to ensure that effluence standards are met and that compliance fees are avoided.
8. AI will simplify data integrity
An explosion of available data for water operations managers has brought along a challenge of data management. SCADA systems, CMMS, and even social media hold a wealth of knowledge to improve operations. AI can take this heterogeneous data and process it so that it is clean, useful, secure, and drives high-fidelity recommendations.
9. AI will retain institutional knowledge
How do you ensure that a veteran operator’s valuable knowledge is retained after they leave the workforce? AI-powered dashboards will keep institutional knowledge documented and standardized.
10. AI will accelerate the move to value-based asset maintenance
Early adopters of AI are quickly leaving reactive asset maintenance behind. Time-based maintenance is easy to manage but results in unnecessary uptime and deterioration. Let AI tell your team what assets need to be serviced, and when.

Many of us don’t like the idea of putting decisions that can seriously impact people’s lives in the hands of machines, particularly when we might not necessarily understand how and why they do what they do.
The Benefits And Dangers Of Using AI In RecruitmentAdobe Stock

But what if it turns out that machines were actually capable of making decisions in a way that is fairer and less prone to prejudice and bias than decisions made by humans? For many of those working on the problem of applying machine intelligence to recruitment and HR, this is the goal. And going a step further than that, is it possible that AI can help overcome the challenges of today’s fast-changing hiring landscape? The shift to home and remote working prompted by the global Covid-19 pandemic, as well as related developments such as the “great resignation”, require HR departments to navigate and predict their way around complex and ever-changing employee behavioral patterns.

These are the type of patterns that AI excels at recognizing, understanding, and predicting. This is why Google is so good at predicting what you want to search for, and Netflix is so accurate at predicting what you want to watch next – 80% of viewing on the streaming service is apparently driven by recommendations!

PROMOTED
Nevertheless, while we might be happy for a machine to help us choose which movie to watch next, we might feel a bit uneasy at the thought of it deciding whether we can have a job or not – or which workers a company should hire or fire.

I was reassured to learn that these are concerns that are shared by Frida Polli, the CEO and founder of Pymetrics – one of the leading AI-driven recruitment platforms. I was recently joined by Polli for a conversation in which we discussed the ethical implications of this type of technology, as well as how it is evolving to help companies understand concepts like “soft skills”. These are concepts that can be vital to understanding how well a candidate might fit a certain role but are often poorly conveyed by traditional recruitment data gathering channels – such as resumes and interviews.

Crucially, by helping organizations get a better understanding of what candidates have to offer in this regard, they can lead to less biased and more effective recruiting decisions. This is a view held not just by Polli but by one of her company's customers – Tan Moorthy, global head of education, training, and assessment at Infosys. Moorthy also joined us in the conversation.

Moorthy says, ""If you look at what's going on with technology skills, the lifespan of how long they're relevant is reducing on the one hand, and then we have automation that is taking away roles that people can do.

“What that means is … you need to figure out ways in which people can coexist with machines. That’s the critical need … you have to recruit the right talent [and] it's important therefore to bring in people not based on their degrees but on their skills.”
At Infosys, this understanding of the current challenges in the employment space has led to the establishment of the Reskill and Restart program. The program is built around a free-to-use online platform that connects employers and trainers with jobseekers and potential hires based on their skills and interests rather than their backgrounds and education. So far, it has enabled hundreds of people to reskill for profitable and rewarding careers in the tech industry.
Pymetrics has played an important role in this process thanks to its innovative AI-powered employment decisioning tools.
“I completely understand the concerns around AI. It’s incumbent around tech providers like ourselves to prove we’re equitable … but once we can do that, it's critical for societies to start leveraging some of these platforms - like Reskill and Restart and Pymetrics – that can really help with these broad labor market problems”, Polli tells me.
Polli took the time to explain to me some of the principles behind the way that Pymetrics specifically works. By assessing the soft skills – such as a person’s communication and decision-making ability, as well as their empathy, generosity, or altruism – smarter decisions can be made about who might be a good fit for particular roles. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it differentiates between “good” and “bad” people, as might be implied by the fact it is assessing, for example, altruism.
“What’s amazing … is that everything can be personalized”, she says.
“I get the question all the time, ‘what are the soft skills people need?’ – but that’s not a thing – the soft skills you need to be a successful entrepreneur versus a successful accountant versus a successful CIA agent are completely different … and what’s beautiful about [AI] is that we can be very prescriptive and personalized in our recommendations.
“I might not have the soft skill profile to be an accountant because I’m biased to action and not very methodical, but … an entrepreneur – I can do that.”
This new way of assessing potential is potentially highly valuable in a world where machines will inevitably be making humans redundant in some roles – such as drivers and machine operators – and free them up to take on different, potentially more rewarding tasks.
“Gone are the 1980s… ‘oh, if you’re this, then you'll do this, and you'll be successful – and if you're not, you're out of luck … technology enables us to do that,"" says Polli.
Moorthy says that this type of intelligent assessment and personalized recommendation is crucial to the role Infosys hopes to play in reskilling the workforce of tomorrow.
“We have to look out for people who are in different professions – who want to make a move into technology, and create a pathway for them to get there,” he tells me.
“Recruitment will therefore have to look out for people who have … the ability and desire to learn new things … and the capability of saying ‘I transferred these skills from my last job into this profession, or this industry’. So transferrable skills will be important, and recruitment will have to constantly look out for means by which we can identify those people who carry those transferrable skills, so they can learn and become the talent of the future.""

AbbVie Chooses Cerebras Systems to Accelerate AI Biopharmaceutical Research




Cerebras CS-2 accelerates artificial intelligence work while radically reducing power consumption






May 05, 2022 01:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerebras Systems, the pioneer in high performance artificial intelligence (AI) computing, and AbbVie, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced a landmark achievement in AbbVie’s AI work. Using a Cerebras CS-2 on biomedical natural language processing (NLP) models, AbbVie achieved performance in excess of 128 times that of a graphics processing unit (GPU), while using 1/3 the energy. Not only did AbbVie train the models more quickly, and for less energy, due to the CS-2’s simple, standards-based programming workflow, the time usually allocated to model set up and tuning was also dramatically reduced.

“At Cerebras Systems, our goal is to enable AI that accelerates our customer’s mission”Post this

“A common challenge we experience with programming and training BERT LARGE models is providing sufficient GPU cluster resources for sufficient periods of time,” said Brian Martin, Head of AI at AbbVie. “The CS-2 system will provide wall-clock improvements that alleviate much of this challenge, while providing a simpler programming model that accelerates our delivery by enabling our teams to iterate more quickly and test more ideas.”

With a focus on cutting edge R&D across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and virology, it’s essential for AbbVie’s scientists to keep abreast of research findings from around the world. To that end, AbbVie employs large, sophisticated AI language models to build its machine translation service, Abbelfish. This service accurately translates and makes searchable vast libraries of biomedical literature across 180 languages using large, state-of-the-art Transformer models such as BERT, BERT LARGE, and BioBERT.

Ensuring Abbelfish is both accurate and always up to date requires training and re-training the NLP models from scratch with domain-specific biomedical data. However, the Abbelfish model is very large – 6 billion parameters. Such a model is impractical to train on even the largest GPU clusters. Cerebras Systems makes this type of large-scale AI training fast and easy.

Large language models like BERT LARGE have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy on many language processing and understanding tasks. Training these large language models using GPUs is challenging and time-consuming. Training from scratch on new datasets often takes weeks, even on large clusters of legacy equipment. As the size of the cluster grows, power, cost, and complexity grow exponentially. Programming clusters of graphics processing units requires rare skills, different machine learning frameworks and specialized tools that take weeks of engineering time to each iteration.

The CS-2 was built to directly address these challenges and radically reduce the time to insight. The CS-2 delivers the deep learning performance of 100s of GPUs, with the programming ease of a single node. As a result, less time is spent in set up and configuration, less time is spent training and more ideas are explored. The AbbVie team was able to set up and train their custom BERT LARGE model from scratch in less than two days with the Cerebras CS-2.

“At Cerebras Systems, our goal is to enable AI that accelerates our customer’s mission,” said Andrew Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Cerebras Systems. “It’s not enough to provide customers with the fastest AI in the market -- it also must be the most energy efficient and the easiest to deploy. It’s incredible to see AbbVie not only accelerating their massive language models, but doing so while consuming a fraction of the energy used by legacy solutions.”

The Cerebras CS-2 is powered by the largest processor ever built – the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine 2 (WSE-2), which is 56 times larger than the nearest competitor. As a result, the CS-2 delivers more AI-optimized compute cores, more fast memory, and more fabric bandwidth than any other deep learning processor in existence. It was purpose built to accelerate deep learning workloads reducing the time to answer by orders of magnitude.

With customers and partners in North America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Cerebras is delivering industry leading AI solutions to a growing roster of customers in the enterprise, government, and high performance computing segments including GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, TotalEnergies, nference, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), and Tokyo Electron Devices.

I’m grateful to my friends for helping to put this first piece together – I hope you enjoy it. – Daniel Faggella In 2010, most Americans would struggle to list the ways in which AI impacts their day-to-day life.  In 2022, many of us spend large percentages of our daily life using AI applications. They guide our route to the office, they automatically edit our photos, they find obscure products or facts, and – mostly – they entertain or distract us. Not only has our screen time increased over the last twelve years, our “percent of screen time generated by AI” has gone up astronomically.  The most prominent of the AI interfaces we interact with today are optimized at keeping us “engaged” – maximizing for the goal of the platform itself: Revenue (through advertising, purchases, and/or maintained subscriptions). In this article I’ll lay out a case as to why and how AI will invariably expand into a necessary addition for nearly all productive work, and how the proliferation of this trend might lead to more serious cognitive augmentation and transhumanism. I’ve broken this article down into the following sections: TL;DR Summary Defining Terms – “Distractive” and “Ambitious” AI Why Entertainment and Passive AI Came First From the Goals of the Platform – to the Goals of the User AI Augmentation – From Web Apps to Brain Computer-Interface Quotes and Perspectives from Experts While this article is a collection of some of my own ideas, it’s built from many great conversations with the many brilliant minds we’ve connected with at Emerj Artificial Intelligence Research. From academics, to startup founders, to United Nations AI leaders – I’m grateful to all of the friends and folks in our expert network for contributing quotes, ideas, and articles worth referencing to in this work. Their quotes are referenced throughout, as well as in the final section of the article below. Note: This won’t be an essay assailing the founders of current AI-augmented media platforms for being malicious or detrimental to mental health. Rather, I’ll be examining trends and incentives, not the moral character of individuals. TL;DR Summary Entertainment-oriented consumer AI applications (Distractive AI, appealing to the drive for pleasure) have dominated the first wave of AI-powered consumer apps mostly because of the fact that they can optimize for the same goals (engagement) across all users. In the decade ahead, an ecosystem of AI-enabled applications will emerge that serve to further generally “productive” goals (Ambitious AI, appealing to the drives for power and profit), and these applications will need to overcome the technical challenges of being trained on more bespoke/varied goals than many Distractive use-cases. Living in hyper-customized AI ecosystems becomes normal: In the coming 10-15 years, most people will spend most of their time in a combination of Distractive and Ambitious AI environments. To spend time in neither will be unheard-of.
Distractive AI will appeal to people who wish for the fastest track to ease and pleasure. Ambitious AI will appeal to people who want to become more powerful or active through technology, rather than more satiated and passive. Achieving career/life goals and seeking fulfillment will both be unquestionably better pursued within AI interfaces than without them, making adoption a simple choice for most people. For both Distractive and Ambitious use-cases, the user experience will go from isolated experiences to ubiquitous experiences, roughly: First: Web or mobile apps Second: Immersive AR/VR Third: Brain-computer interface The cognitive augmentation of Ambitious AI (first through apps, eventually through actual brain augmentation) will become as required for influence and power in the world or tomorrow as literacy and computer skills are for the world of today. The pursuit of pleasure, power, and profit in drastically personalized virtual worlds will lead to a radical shift in the human condition – and the emergence of cognitively augmented, post-human intelligences. The business and intergovernmental communities should consider the pathways that these technologies should develop, and prepare for a world where divergent, augmented intelligences interact primarily in a virtual – not physical – world. Defining Terms I’ve broken out AI’s impact on consumer technologies into two categories: Distractive and Ambitious.  Distractive AI Goals: Is optimized to achieve the goals of a platform (improving engagement, use time or purchases). You are wielded by it. You are marshaled toward its aims. Passive or active: Passive. Purpose: Generally designed to help the user avoid the the challenges of the state of nature (life challenges, stress from work, etc). Appeals to human drives: Pleasure. Examples:  Web or mobile app: Netflix binging, YouTube rabbit holes, TikTok infinite scrolling, etc. Immersive VR/brain-computer interface: Programmatically generating an entire movie, or series of films, based on the topics/themes of interest for the user, and the desired emotional state that the user wants to experience. Distractive AI is the use of AI primarily for distraction and entertainment – the primary goal it strives for is a change of emotional state. People want to forget their stressors and be entertained, laugh, or otherwise distract themselves. Others may want to confirm or deepen negative emotions to somehow validate or reinforce those feelings – a phenomena referred to today as doomscrolling. Ambitious AI Goals: Is optimized to help you achieve or become what you want. It is wielded by you. It is marshaled toward your aims. Passive or active: Active. Purpose: Generally designed to help the user compete in the state of nature (achieve tangible goals, perform at work, get things done). Appeals to human drives: Power, profit, pride. Examples:  Web or mobile app: AI app that helps salespeople close deals by providing them with real-time prompts on how to handle objections, or how to write follow-up or prospecting emails – based on what has worked for previous sales. Immersive VR/brain-computer interface: An AI application that helps entrepreneurs stay on task and grow their company – nudging them away from distraction and towards the right focus areas to further their business goals. Ambitious AI is mostly about helping the user achieve more of user’s own goals. We might call this self-directed AI augmentation.  Most of what could be called “complex” Ambitious AI and “complex” Distractive AI is safely outside the capabilities of today’s (2022) technology – but this won’t be the case for long.  In the rest of this article I’ll explore near-term and long-term applications of self-directed AI augmentation. But first, we’ll look at why the more passive Distractive AI dominates the first wave of machine learning consumer applications. Why Distractive AI Dominates Today It would be untrue to say that all of the first wave of machine learning-powered consumer applications were completely Distractive.  Very few people are addicted to Google search, Waze navigation guidance, unlocking their smartphones via facial recognition, etc. Many of these applications are simply convenient, or (in the case of Google search), potentially very helpful in promoting one’s own general life goals. The often-lamented impacts of this first wave of ML-powered consumer applications – including addiction and distraction – are largely from social and streaming media. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube and TikTok are different platforms, but their goal is the same: Maximizing screen time and advertising exposure.  “You get a show or a movie you’re really dying to watch and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep… and we’re winning!” – Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, at the 2017 Summit LA (source) To break down Distractive AI a bit further: Goal: Improve engagement, i.e. Time using free application – continued advertising exposure Time using paid application – continued subscription revenues Measuring Goal Attainment: Relatively easy (Is the user still scrolling? Are they using the app more often, or for longer periods of time? Are they spending more money on the platform?) Example: Netflix, Twitter, etc, optimizing watch time and engagement with content. Bespoke-ness: Very similar process to train from one user to another. There is some specificity for individuals… but that overall it’s the same end game: Keep them on the platform to either (a) see ads, or (b) pay a subscription. “Stickiness” and use are the general aim. User Upside: Unlimited entertainment, media, and information calibrated to our preferences/interests. User Downside: Constant distraction, a personally calibrated form of potentially addicting escape. Ultimately unfulfilling Monetary Cost: Cheap or Free “Distractive AI” took off before self-directed AI augmentation mainly because it’s easier to optimize for distraction. Technical Viability Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube have enormous volumes of data to deal with, and outlandishly different preferences from one user to another. Yet from a technical standpoint, they benefit from two factors:  A gigantic number of users. While niche productivity applications for architectural design or enterprise might acquire millions of users, general “entertainment” needs apply across careers and demographics. Paid applications like Netflix can still achieve hundreds of millions of users – and free applications like TikTok and Facebook reach billions. A single set of quantifiable metrics to optimize for across all users. Engagement. While it isn’t child’s play, it’s fundamentally the same process to keep a horror movie fanatic on Netflix as it is a family who likes to watch Disney movies. (Netflix’s Research/Engineering Director, Justin Basilico has a 30-minute presentation on recommendation applications that is worth watching for any layperson interested in the topic.) Each user is different, but the variables to adjust (content the user can engage with, types actions – like clicks, comments, views of a video, etc) are the same. The company’s aim is to find the right combination of experiences to encourage higher usage from the user. Comparing Distractive vs Productive AI Use-Cases Compare this “watch time”/“engagement” optimization to the narrow, productive challenge of optimizing for sales productivity.  An AI application for sales enablement might listen to tens of thousands of sales calls and achieve specific outcomes to help salespeople sell more, such as: Labeling important segments of a call, such as “introductions”, “need discovery”, “overcoming objections”, etc… – allowing sales teams to better analyze their calls. Labeling the sentiment of the prospect and salesperson throughout a sales call. Prompting salespeople during the conversation with their next statement or objective (i.e. “Move to presenting our offerings” or “Here’s how to overcome this price objection”). etc… Some applications along these lines already exist. My interviews with the CEOs of unicorn firms like Outreach.io, and AI-enabled sales platforms like Chorus.ai (recently acquired for over $500MM by ZoomInfo) has lead me to see the great promise of narrow AI for sales enablement – but it’s also made some of the limitations of the technology clear: It likely won’t be replacing salespeople or astronomically improving the performance of average sales reps and time soon. Helping a user reach their own bespoke goals is more complicated than keeping them engaged on an individual platform – it involves much more nuanced criteria of success (not simply “user using application more = good”), and, generally, a much more varied set of inputs and variables (not just “scrolls, clicks, video views, comments, etc in a single app”). Comparing Productive AI Use-Cases to Generally Self-Directed AI Use-Cases Now take this “sales productivity” optimization against a general optimization for “furthering the user’s life goals.”  Say we have a hypothetical user, Mary, a young lawyer with the aspiration of becoming a Senator and pushing for more environmentally friendly policies, particularly around preventing and cleaning up pollution – a cause she believes in deeply.  A kind of “general” AI application geared to optimizing for these life goals might serve in a variety of ways in Mary’s life. Here are a few hypothetical examples: The system might scour secondary sources about women around Mary’s age who had achieved the goal of becoming a Senator, using this information to build a kind of informed outline or plan – and presenting Mary with options for next steps based on the most viable and effective paths found in the research. The system might feed real-time recommendations to Mary via her smartphone of AR glasses, reminding her to study, or to network with specific political figures, etc. The system might help to promote Mary’s desired sleep and nutritional habits in order to ensure that she is able to perform on the job (based on general sleep and nutrition knowledge, and on Mary’s historical performance under differing food/sleep conditions over time). etc… This long-term goal of becoming a Senator and reducing pollution is an inherently subjective goal, and after a day of deterring distractions and encouraging healthy habits and aiding in work productivity, an AI system would have a hard time knowing how well it performed.  Is Mary closer to, or not closer to, becoming a Senator after she took this action, or made this interim career choice, or choose to handle these emails in her inbox instead of these? The more bespoke (customized from user to user) and abstract (not immediately quantifiable by a metric such as screen time, clicks, purchases, etc) the objectives are – the harder it is to train a viable AI system. This is evidenced by the fact that essentially all of the hypothetical use-cases listed above are outside the range of what AI applications are capable of today. I’d argue that this challenge of handling bespoke and abstract goals is the biggest reason that Ambitious AI applications have lagged, and Distractive AI has dominated the first wave of ML-powered consumer applications. But the desire for power and productivity is great – and the as-yet-unrealized wave of Ambitious AI applications will arrive – and it will have a profound impact on how we live and work. From the Goals of the Platform – to the Goals of the User There was a time when only a tiny fraction of the world’s useful information could be found on the internet.  There was a time when AI was nearly incapable of searching for content relevance beyond simple, clumsy keyword search. During this time – though human beings had an unlimited desire to access information, and ease of access – Google search could not have come into existence. The data, the internet infrastructure, the processing power, and the machine learning state-of-the-art were not there yet. Similarly, there have been many barriers that have prevented Ambitious AI from coming into existence, and there still are. These barriers vary by use-case, but we can take a look at a handful of the barriers that might hold back some of the more general Ambitious AI use-cases. Quantifiability of Actions: Amazon can train algorithms to recommend products to users in large part because it can track user behavior. A search (string of keywords), a click, an “add to cart”, and a long purchase history – all are concrete data points. Contrast this with a company like Target, whose shoppers visit in-store locations. It is much harder to get a sense of who these customers are (you don’t have to “log in” with a username and email to walk into Target), never mind what they’re interest in. For the same reason, helping users with bespoke lift goals (study for classes, making sales, writing code, hiring staff) is a hairy problem involving a lot of context and, often, not much by way of concrete data points. Ambitious AI will have to begin in narrower domains where these criteria are clear. Accurately Assessing and Structuring Human Goals: Someone with the goal of “becoming a Senator” or “starting a successful Indian restaurant” has other motives in mind. For some it might be prestige, for others wealth. Some need to perform just better than peers, or just well enough, while others must best anyone in the history of their field. An AI system that generally nudges users towards their goals will have to determine what these goals actually are – probably by not only taking direct instructions from a human users, buy by observing the human user’s actions – and the kind of “progress” that the human user actually seems satisfied with. (Note: AI alignment is a field unto itself. Paul Christiano’s work is a good start for readers new to the subject.) (Business Model Concerns): Netflix is cheap because it can reach hundreds of millions, Facebook is cheap because advertisers pay for your attention when you’re on it. Ambitious AI – if it be Ambitious AI at all – serves the goals of the user, not the advertiser. This will cost a premium, likely a significant subscription fee – and will, for most users – involve a significant amount of high-touch consulting and feedback with the provider of the service to make sure that goals, progress, and behaviors are calibrate properly, and that the device seems to be genuinely benefitting the user based on the expectations of that user. Without a million users doing the same thing, training time and high-touch calibration will probably be necessary, expensive, and in some cases, prohibitively hard. These hurdles are significant, and probably won’t begin to be overcome for years. Nonetheless, over the coming decade, human drives will bring about this next wave of ML applications, an ecosystem of Ambitious AI. Humans have an innate desire to compete – and there will always be a market for whatever technologies help to wield power. Today the ambitious CEOs, politicians, and busy professionals are likely on their computers whenever they’re not in meetings. Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete. Tomorrow they will be – from the moment they awake – nudged towards their most important tasks and away from distractions by AI systems designed to maximize the use of their time. Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete. 15 years from now they will live immersed in a VR workspace, in an environment optimized to maintain their focus and ensure their peak performance in their tasks (strategizing, selling, negotiating, delivering on client projects, etc).  Anyone who doesn’t won’t compete (more on this in a bit). While there are many possible models for human drives, neuroscientist Nayef Al-Rodhan’s (Head of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy’s Geopolitics and Global Futures Programme) useful model suggests that in addition to pleasure – humans are driven by power, pride, profit, and permanence. There is absolutely a market for any kind of technology that helps to achieve any one of them. The Ambitious AI ecosystem will inevitably arise because power, profit, and pride demand it. While there is a certain kind of pleasure in achievement – any user who seeks pleasure alone will likely find it more swiftly through Distractive AI. One will be incapable of entering the ranks of the most capable and prominent persons without Ambitious AI. In fact, one may not even be employable (as people without basic computer skills or familiarity with common software applicants are often not employable today). The leaders of the most powerful nations and organizations – and essentially high-performing persons – will be those who take full advantage of these technologies. Not all users will choose to adopt Ambitious AI. Some may opt out entirely, while others may use Ambitious AI sparingly.  Some people will avoid work and escape almost entirely into AI-generated feeds of enticing distraction and entertainment. They will be the lotus eaters. Some people will live almost entirely in AI-gamified interfaces that encourage them to drive towards goals (financial/ creative/ career/ otherwise), making every second of work optimally productive, automating every automate-able task, and making every second of non-work (entertainment, sleep, time with friends) serve the sole purpose of fueling work performance. I’ve referred to them as world eaters. I suspect that in the coming 10 years, most people will spend time in a mix of Distractive and Ambitious interfaces. Spending time in neither will be unheard-of.  “Analog” entertainment, and “analog” methods of striving/achieving will be – rightfully – seen as mostly laughably outdated and pointless – the same way making your own shoes from leather, or entertaining yourself with a hoop and stick seems outdated and pointless today. This is not only because Distractive AI and Ambitious AI will become more satisfying and useful (respectively) – but because they’ll become more and more literally embedded in our lives – and in our minds. AI Augmentation – From Isolated to Integrated Experiences The graphic below represents how AI augmentation is likely to progress, from individual user interfaces to brain-computer interfaces:  This transition from apps to brain-computer interfaces is pulled along by both of the categories of human drives we’ve already addressed: Pleasure – Even with all the AI-enabled entertainment in the world, the hedonic treadmill is still real, and only by augmenting do we have a chance to experience continuous states of wellbeing. Once people live in AI-enabled VR worlds and are still unhappy, they’ll demand that we address the root of the problem: the brain itself. Power, profit, pride – Even with all the AI-enabled productivity interfaces in the world – the human mind still has limitations for memory, creativity, and more. As the demands of work require more augmentation, and as AI augmentation in VR becomes normal, the focus will shift to augmenting the mind itself.  Below are some examples of what Distractive and Ambitious AI applications might look like in all three phases of development: Distractive AI Use-Cases Today – Web or Mobile App Imagine scrolling endlessly through images or videos programmatically conjured to suit their preferences and capture their attention. Invest real time and money into virtual games, where quests involve interactions with real and computer generated characters and personalities, where “achievement” feels real and endlessly entertaining. Near Future – Immersive AR/VR VR experiences totally customized to a user’s goals, preferences, and real-time response (EEG / EKG / eye-movement / other). Imagine a user saying “Okay Google, show me a VR movie about samurai, both from the point of view of the main character, and make sure to include vampires as the bad guys” – and having a completely programmatically generated film conjured up for your enjoyment. A gamified AR layer over reality itself (via contact lenses, glasses) – making environments more pleasant. Imagine every room in your home having colors, views, and musical scores calibrated exactly to what would seem pleasant to you at that time. Future – Brain-Computer Interface Swimming in a VR/AR sea of AI-generated experiences – ranging from sexual pleasure to humor to beautiful art to heroic adventure and more. Brain-computer interface and nanotechnology mostly eliminate the fetters of positive sentient experience, allowing for a near-constant experience of gradients of bliss. Experiencing “relationships” with programmatically generated entities who have no goal other than to fulfill your own goals – a universe designed to explore pleasurable experiences (from base pleasures to more rich pleasures from creativity, or pride – but also a wide range of positive emotional experiences that we don’t have names for right now because they exist outside the range of our present hardware). Ambitious AI Use-Cases Today – Web or Mobile App Leverages AI-powered apps to optimize their sleep schedule. Uses AI-enabled software to run sales, accounting, and other discrete functions of one’s business or career. Near Future – Immersive AR/VR Some ambitious people live entirely in VR work environments calibrated to maintain focus and mood, while also prioritizing the most productive tasks. These systems are gamified to be engaging – and they deter distractions (possibly with notifications, with blocks on certain apps, or simply by making work tasks vastly more appealing in the forefront of the user’s experience). Ever-present AI-enabled notifications keep users abreast of exactly what should be top of mind.  Future – Brain-Computer Interface For nearly all waking hour, the user is prompted to act by habits and behaviors most conducive to performance for said user’s desired goals. This might involve or include: Calibrated sleep and wake time, based on the circadian rhythm and previous work performance and sleep patterns. A configured schedule optimized to leverage their most productive tasks. A stream of recommendations for improving workflows and outcomes based on best-practices, historical performance, etc. Algorithms are trained in real-time based on user experience to handle discrete tasks (from email replies to data entry to interviewing candidates for jobs, etc), allowing the main user to only focus on the edge-cases for almost all of his/her common work tasks – thus allowing the user to be astronomically more productive. Brain-computer interface users will communicate huge volumes of information simultaneously without the hindrances of typing. Anyone aiming to be of use in the white collar world will positively require these technologies – just as modern knowledge workers require a cell phone and computer literacy. If those sound monstrous, impossible and disturbing to you now, we can also be sure that commercial air travel, transgender surgeries and 10-year-olds addicted to TikTok feeds would all sound just as monstrous, impossible and disturbing to someone born in 1900. And yet here we are today. And there we will be tomorrow. So while Ambitious AI applications will be much more likely to help people achieve their own goals (as opposed to the “engagement” goals of Distractive AI applications), they will also force accelerated change to the human condition – changing the nature of what achievement and power are, and how they are wielded.  The tools can only be upgraded so far until human hardware itself must be augmented, and it’s nearly inevitable that exactly this is what will happen. In wellbeing, people will face the choice of augmentation or (comparative) unhappiness. In productivity and creativity, people will face the choice of augmentation or irrelevance. Nayef Al Rodhan wrote the following in a prescient 2013 article for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich: “When more and more people are able to opt for voluntary enhancements, this will give them a competitive edge over other individuals, posing the very real risk of fostering a dangerous divide between enhanced and unenhanced individuals.  …Making matters potentially more disruptive from a security perspective, the inequalities and differences would only be reinforced along pre-existing lines of social classes and nationalities as enhancement technologies are, and likely to remain, very expensive.” The choice between powerlessness and irrelevance vs augmentation won’t be much of a choice at all – and at the time will seem as natural as our (comparatively monstrous) choice to live glued to computer/mobile screens for nearly every waking moment of our life and work. Quotes from the Emerj Network My thoughts around the Ambitious AI paradigm have been informed by many authors and thinkers, some of whom are linked above. In this final section I’d like to highlight some of the ideas contributed by outside experts and friends through the research for this article: Considerations for Transparent Data Policies of AI-Powered Interfaces John C. Havens, Executive Director, The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, Author of “Heartificial Intelligence” addresses some of the adoption challenges that truly customized applications may face from savvy consumers.  It will be interesting to see if more consumers will care about the data policies of large tech firms in the USA, but I’m sure John would believe it to be a net positive if they did: “I’d like to enter a VR/AR world and know that the company will actually care about my priorities, instead of nudging me towards ads or products. To pay X$/month and have a commitment from a firm to not share your data or be beholden to advertisers would be ideal. To do that well, I’d argue that we need data portability and algorithmic terms and conditions for each individual user. Imagine ten dials of ten increments each, for various elements of privacy, data sharing, and preferences.” AI Augmentation – Breaking Down or Reinforcing Existing Digital Divides? In my short phone conversation with Irakli Beridze – Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, United Nations, UNICRI – he “Currently we are experiencing a growing digital divide. These are something like 60 countries with formal digital strategies, 130+ countries don’t have such strategies yet. Countries with those strategies are improving faster than those without, and if that trend continues that way we may end up in a very dangerous world where a lot of countries have fallen behind.  We may see more movement of refugees and other trends that may be dangerous for everyone. Virtual worlds may have the ability to level the field in some way – but this depends on whether people in those developing countries have access to the technologies or not.” Tech Adoption Will Be Largely Driven by Work Demands My first interview with Dr. Robin Hanson, Associate Professor of Economics at George Mason University, was nearly a decade ago – and I’ve followed his work since. Below is a quote from 3:30 into our AI Futures episode with Hanson, on the topic of “drivers of adoption” for AI and VR tech: “We think of ourselves as social creatures, with this work thing off to the side – but when work demands something we listen… Over the next few decades, work will change the way to use computers… …the fundamental push is conglomeration. Right now we do that in big cities, but remote work will allow for much more of that.” Interestingly, Hanson doesn’t believe that AI will play a major role in what kinds of Ambitious AI tools win the most users. From a recent email exchange with Hanson: “I don’t see such a trend as you see, and if firms get better at enticing customers to look at the world more through their frameworks, I don’t see that the value of that depends much on how much AI helps with that.” I’d argue that AI-oriented personalization is among the most powerful forces in creating lock-in and encouraging use. TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook seem to be businesses that couldn’t exist without such AI recommendation systems to encourage use. Ambitious and Distractive AI May Apply Mostly to Recommendation German Sanchis-Trilles, PhD in AI – University of Valencia, CEO of Sciling (and technical advisor here at Emerj) believes that, outside of recommendation, AI might not imply an inherent pull towards Distractive or Ambitious applications. “I don’t really see these two (Distractive AI to Ambitious AI) as being separate at all. If you think about AI as in recommender systems, then that’s true. But I think that’s only a very specific use case of AI. Let’s list some of the most popular technologies: Computer Vision. I would say most of the popular use cases around computer vision do not align with the three phases you are drawn out. You might need computer vision for some of the phases you mention, but then there are many other use cases (e.g., computer vision for quality control in an industrial process) which directly align with phase 2. NLP. Something very similar as with computer vision. For instance, machine translation has been used by professional translators for literally decades to enhance productivity, and for instance I also know that speech recognition systems are being used for similar purposes. Or NLP used for chatbots, or to route customer service issues. Predictive analytics. E.g. churn prediction. Recommender systems. Here’s where most of them are used for optimizing engagement. But even so, there are also some recommender systems that are being used for other purposes (e.g., to establish the appropriate learning plan for a student). So even though I believe I understand the argument that you are putting through, I believe it might be a bit narrower/for a more specific kind of AI.” I’d agree with German’s take here. Ambitious and Distractive AI are about hyper-personalization, they’re about calibrating an experience (achieving a work task, enjoying a relaxing movie, etc) to the needs and behaviors of the users. Outside of this recommendation / calibration sphere, AI capabilities are quite neutral. Metaverse Transition Likely, and Regulation Needed I was glad to also connect with my friend Thomas A. Campbell – Founder and CEO at FutureGrasp, former National Intelligence Officer for Technology at the National Intelligence Council. Thomas has published a number of works on regulating metaverse tech, and he shared his perspectives on some of the areas of concern for early metaverse users: Q: Do you think this transition is likely in the next 10 years, why or why not? “I agree that presently AI firms are focusing mostly on driving eyeballs to their platforms. There are many such competing platforms, but perhaps Meta will be the most prominent because of their huge base of billions of users and strong investments. For example, Meta just installed a full supercomputer exclusively for their metaverse applications.  There remain several barriers to larger adoption of the metaverse, such as compute power, availability and pricing of VR headsets, and overcoming the discomfort of multi-hour wearing of headsets. But I’m optimistic that with so much interest and investment, these will be overcome. So, yes, I believe we will see a serious shake-up and then eventually consolidation (M&As) of the metaverse within perhaps 10 years. Even at this stage, there is sufficient momentum to enable at least the earliest visions of metaverse-enhanced retail shopping, online concerts, etc.” Q: Do you think such productive AI applications would be aggregately good, or mostly misguided and bad for people? “Like all technologies, the metaverse’s AI applications will be both good and bad, and even potentially misguided. One major concern I have is that existing algorithms and our strong tendencies toward filter bubbles will naturally (and on the part of the platforms, lazily) be ported directly into the metaverse. Imagine having even a narrower world view with exquisitely targeted advertisements to you, and only you, as you navigate various metaverses. I have been actively encouraging government regulators to begin considering implications and appropriate regulations and rules for metaverse activities. If we don’t do such work now, by 10 years it will be too late.” Related Posts AI Ethics at War - When AI Governance Shifts from Cooperation to CompetitionAlternative Montaigne-like Article Title: ""That the Meek Will Stand United for Only as Long as… An Intro to AI Power - A New Series on EmerjVladimir Putin has said: “Whoever becomes the leader in [artificial intelligence] will become the ruler… Regulation of AI as a Means to Power(Alternative Montaigne-like title for this essay: ""That the Meek Must Feign Virtue"") When I first… The USA-China AI Race - 7 Weaknesses of the WestThe great power nations that master the use of artificial intelligence are likely to gain… The International Governance of AI - We Unite or We FightThe general premise of this article is different from most of my previous AI Power… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI strategists have important roles not just in shepherding projects through to completion, but in making them make sense in a corporate context.




What is an AI strategist? It's an interesting question, particularly in the context of how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the business world and revolutionizing how companies sell products and services. (Watch: 3 Key Breakthroughs That Paved the Way for Artificial Intelligence.)
Here's some of what we've heard ""on the street"" from tech experts and industry professionals close to AI design.
A Glorified Product/Project Manager?
In some ways, an AI strategist is a lot like other roles that follow a particular process from beginning to end, from cradle to grave, or more accurately — from prototype to reality. But that comparison is only skin deep.
We've previously talked about IoT product managers and how they walk with a technology through the full life cycle.
AI strategists can be like that, too.
“An AI strategist can be similar to a project manager role, in that the AI strategist also needs to oversee AI projects to ensure they are executed as smoothly as possible, that the projects keep in line with the business goals, and to ensure the right talent and tech set up is in place for AI projects to be successful,” said Rebecca Merrett, a Data Science Instructor at Data Science Dojo who spoke to us about what’s involved in this AI role.
“Having a clear understanding of different AI strategic use cases for the business and how the business can use AI to stay innovative and competitive long term is crucial to any AI strategist.”Advertisements




However, it's important to stress to that's only the beginning. Seeing an AI strategist as just a type of project management role is just part of showing what's happening in the bigger picture of the industry — because as important as AI is, data scientists with the right skill set to work as AI strategists help to keep companies on course in other ways, as well. (Read Job Role: Data Scientist.)
Communicate Value and Requirements
Here are some other very real components of what it means to be an AI strategist.
In a 2018 Medium article titled “The Need for an AI Strategist”, author Ravi Vayuvegula goes over some of the reasons that these specialists are so valuable, partially based on how the average business leadership team lacks the expertise to fully grasp the realities of AI.
“(The disconnect in understanding AI) stems from the top management being unclear about the value AI brings to the table,” Vayuvegula wrote. “In spite of their enthusiasm for AI implementation the CIO/CTOs are unable to communicate the economic value add of AI transformation to the rest of the management team … Bridging this gap is exactly the job of an AI strategist.”
Vayuvegula also touched on some pretty interesting statistics. For example, the assertion that “data related challenges hinder 96% of organizations from achieving artificial intelligence” or that “organizations invest in an average of seven different machine learning (ML) tools.” (Read Job Role: Machine Learning Engineer.)
These statistics and the ensuing narrative really paint a picture of why AI strategy is important. If you can't communicate the economic value, you can't target the project. If you don't know what the requirements are, you're likely to land in hot water when trying for implementation.
Vayuvegula suggested an AI strategist should have three core competencies:

A significant understanding of the AI business domain.
A grasp of ML fundamentals and familiarity with algorithm work.
The ability to separate fact from fiction in artificial intelligence development.

“Most of the disappointments in AI implementations arise because of misguided expectations.The runaway imagination of Hollywood and popular media has created a near mythical performance expectation from AI systems. An astute AI strategist will be able to articulate in solving a business problem how much will be done by an AI system and how much by the human system.”
All of the above is very instructive, but you can also get clues to what companies are looking for by examining some of the job ads that are out there for AI strategist roles.
Here's one from PSCU: despite some pretty elaborate word salad, there are ideas in here that point to some of the key roles of an artificial intelligence strategist’s job.
For example, take this: “Incumbent will develop and drive corporate strategy to lead assessments of new product ideas, develop business cases and lead prototype creation to reach formal business recommendation on new opportunities geared at enhancing service and member experience.”
If your eyes glazed over, don't worry. There are three obstacles to clarity here.
The first one is length. The second one is the ambiguity around the word “lead” — if the AI strategist is “leading” assessments of new product ideas and “leading” prototype creation, why are they not “leading” in the development of business cases? And how about “drive(ing) corporate strategy to” do these three things?
Some of the role responsibilities posted here are much more useful in helping to understand the AI strategist’s job.
Some are pretty intuitive — for example: “Serve(ing) in an advisory role on client engagements” or “collaborate(ing) with other digital product managers” or “research(ing)/gather(ing) information on business needs and industry analysis in order to identify key business challenges and opportunities.”
A common-sense reading of all of this shows how the AI strategist works with stakeholders, and as mentioned by Vayuvegula above, drives home the value of AI.
But there's one other domain that's very important in working with artificial intelligence, and it's treated not only in job ads, but in other commentary.
This job ad from Booz Allen, for instance, makes it very clear that part of the job of an AR strategist involves ethics:
“We are seeking a full-time post-doctoral Research Associate (RA) or a Senior Research Associate (SRA) to work on one or more themes of the Turing Safe and Ethical AI: Fairness — measuring and mitigating inappropriate bias against subgroups.”
Then those who work in the field also confirm this as a core piece of AI strategist work.
“An AI strategist needs to navigate through the potential ethical and legal issues of AI technology, while driving forward the execution of smarter, more intelligent products and services and processes,” Merrett clarified.
“Some will need a good amount of knowledge on the AI execution side, even though they will not be writing the programs or implementing the tech themselves.”
In conclusion, the AI strategist works on the full life cycle, works on showing value and requirements, and works on AI ethics. That's a start to understanding what these professionals do in a corporate context.
It's also a good roadmap for young people who want to start getting involved in these exciting industries, because AI is not going away anytime soon.

India, Germany to work together on artificial intelligence start-ups
To further strategic research and development in the artificial intelligence arena, the two governments have roped in academic institutions and local industries
India and Germany have agreed to collaborate and work together in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that includes working on advancing artificial intelligence based start-ups and research.
Also jointly, the two countries will work to foster a higher degree of application of artificial intelligence in sustainability and healthcare. The announcement was made at the sidelines of a meeting between Minister for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Jitendra Singh and his German counterpart Bettina Stark-Watzinger.
Both ministers, at the meeting, agreed for greater cooperation in the field of AI. It was also announced that to invite suggestions from researchers and industry in this regard, a proposal will soon be floated.
Singh also said that electric mobility, quantum technologies, green hydrogen fuel, among others are the newer areas of technology in which the two countries will be working together. To leverage the two country’s strengths, he further proposed ramping up joint cooperation in these areas.
Highlighting the government’s achievements, Singh said that the Centre was focused on ‘promoting the value chain of innovation, entrepreneurship and IP generation.’
The announcement is part of the overarching cooperation between the two sides in science and technology. To further strategic research and development in the artificial intelligence arena, the two governments have roped in academic institutions and local industries.
Indian Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups have been creating a mark in the artificial intelligence space. Many Indian companies have made their foray into global markets with a slew of offerings powered by artificial intelligence. A host of Indian start-ups, from Zoho to Freshworks, have created artificial intelligence products that have found markets in different parts of the world.
Last year, Indian enterprise-tech start-ups raised more than $3.2bn in investments. India also boasts of 16 unicorns in the sector. A report by IDC said that the India AI software market would grow from $2.7bn in 2020 to $6.3bn by 2025 at a CAGR of 18.1 per cent.

This technology can detect hidden agitation even if someone uses their dry sense of humor and says the opposite of what they actually mean.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Advanced techniques can work with sarcasm, hyperbole, and other linguistic habits. One of the main applications of voice emotional artificial intelligence is to spot disappointed customers in call centers and redirect them to someone who can smooth their feelings.   &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; California-based Behavioral Signals developed an emotional AI-powered solution for call centers. It matches agents to clients and finds the best representative to serve a particular customer. The tool operates solely based on vocal information and ignores conversations’ contents.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Difficulties &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; It is not always easy to differentiate between anger and excitement, as they are both expressed with a high-pitch tone. We can overcome this by using training data of 20-50 hours of conversation to identify the baseline.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; One example of thorough training is the Thai Speech Emotion Recognition Model developed by Chulalongkorn University. For the training dataset, researchers asked 200 male and female actors to perform a speech pattern of five emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, and a regular tone in the form of monologues and dialogues. A team of directors monitored the performances and helped actors deliver realistic speeches.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Tip to Implement &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Ensure your training datasets are representative of the cultures, dialects, and habits of the target population. When you purchase ready-made emotional AI algorithms, make sure the vendor considers your audience and is open to recalibrating their tool to fit your needs.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #3: Video  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; AI facial emotion recognition can analyze facial expressions in videos to gauge the prevailing sentiment with the help of such technologies as facial recognition and computer vision. It can help detect the difference between lying and telling the truth.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; This emotional artificial intelligence type can be used in interview settings to detect whether candidates are nervous, confident, genuine, etc. Financial institutions can potentially use it to examine loan applicants.   &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Difficulties &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; It is challenging to get a clear picture of people’s faces when they are moving, as the lighting and the background change, not to mention the fact that people keep altering their appearances by tanning, growing facial hair, etc. Also, some people are less expressive than others, making it harder to spot any emotional signals.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Tip to Implement &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Many AI emotion detection video applications focus on group responses. For instance, in marketing, this technology is applied to observe people’s reactions to different advertisement campaigns. Instead of focusing on individual users, marketers capture all this data and average it.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; However, if you want to see every individual reaction in the context of your use case, it’s a good practice to customize your model and train it on specific users. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Emotional AI in Three different industries &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #1: Marketing and Advertising  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; AI emotion recognition algorithms help marketers understand which ads resonate better with the target audience and what features they should include in their videos to yield a better outcome.   &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; One example comes from Affectiva, an emotional AI company based in Boston. It developed a solution that helps marketers gauge customers’ reactions to different advertisements. With users’ permission, the tool analyses their facial expressions, body language, and speech to understand their emotional state. Affectiva’s AI model was trained on a diverse dataset including 6 million faces from 87 countries and can achieve an accuracy of 90%.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #2: Healthcare &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; The healthcare sector deploys emotional support AI to help both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, this technology is paired with voice assistants to detect stress levels and respond appropriately. For patients, it is used to monitor their emotions in examination rooms and during surgical procedures.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Additionally, AI-enhanced solutions can be deployed to measure people’s vitals. For example, the American Heart Association used emotional AI models to build an application that measured blood pressure from short videos instead of using the armband. This solution is believed to have an accuracy of approximately 95%. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; #3: Customer Service  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Companies deploy emotional recognition AI at their call centers to enhance customer service. Such solutions have many benefits. They can pick the best fitting agent for a specific client, give real-time feedback to agents and notify them when they start to lose control, and respond in kind to a frustrated customer. Artificial intelligence algorithms can also analyze incoming support tickets and identify clients on the verge of cutting ties with the company.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; An American insurance corporation, MetLife, deployed Cogito’s emotional AI coaching solution in ten of its call centers. This solution could understand customers’ emotional states and provide agents with conversation and conflict resolution tips in real time. As the result, MetLife witnessed 17% reduction in call duration and 6.3% improvement in issue resolution. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; Barriers to Expect &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Emotions Are Expressed Differently  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; There is no standardization on how people express emotions. Anthropology research shows that different culture representatives vary in the way they express their feelings. For example, in Japan, a smile is a sign of politeness, and it doesn’t exclude the fact that a smiling person can be in great distress. So, if a Japanese tourist needs assistance somewhere in Europe, emotional AI might give them a low score on urgency just because of the smile.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Additionally, the Association for Psychological Science concluded there is no scientific support for the fact that people’s emotions can be accurately deduced from their faces.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Bias &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Facial recognition technologies generally struggle with racial bias. Google once mistakenly tagged black faces as “gorilla”, cameras identified Asian people as “blinking”, and not long ago, an emotional AI algorithm ranked black people as “angrier” than their white counterparts.  &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Moreover, studies revealed there is bias against elderly people. As our faces age, it becomes harder to identify different emotions, and the technology can penalize corresponding population groups. If, for instance, insurance companies would want to use emotional AI to identify driver’s fatigue based on facial expressions, older drivers will be more likely to match the criteria even when they don’t experience any physical symptoms. As a result, insurance companies will demand older drivers to pay larger premiums. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt; Privacy Compromised  &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Do people agree to be monitored and to have their emotions (mis)interpreted? If someone has written that they feel suicidal on social media, do they consent for health insurers to get hold of this information and react? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; ImageNet, one of the most extensive datasets used to train facial detection and recognition algorithms, was forced to blur faces on 1.5 million pictures in response to privacy rights. “We are concerned about the issue of privacy”, reported Olga Russakovsky, Assistant Professor at Princeton University and one of ImageNet managers. Even though they improved on privacy, the research team is wondering how training on faceless data will affect algorithms’ performance in the real world. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. So, even if the technology can get accurate readings on what we feel, do we want such intimate surveillance in our life? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Deborah Raji, an AI researcher, explained in her interview with MIT Technology Review how these algorithms can hurt people. Here is what she said, “One way is by not working: by virtue of having higher error rates for people of color, it puts them at greater risk. The second situation is when it does work — where you have the perfect facial recognition system, but it’s easily weaponized against communities to harass them.” &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; Emotional AI has its benefits. But we should be careful when considering potential applications. Maybe it doesn’t make much sense now to involve this technology in life-altering situations. Rana Gujral, CEO of Behavioral Signals, reports that her company was approached with a request to apply their intent model to immigration. Behavioral Signals declined. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;  &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; But the question remains: is it correct to penalize people for their feelings? Is it acceptable that job candidates are judged on how their voice sounds and students are punished because their faces look angry? &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;",2022-05-05T10:00:00,2022-04-28T10:14:05,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.iotforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Emotional-AI-2.jpg', 'height': 1200, 'width': 1600}",N/A,N/A,"

'There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. Emotional AI has its benefits, but you should be aware of the challenges when considering potential applications at your organization.' - Nadejda AlkhaldiClick To Tweet
Despite these concerns, AI consulting firms are thriving as the global emotional AI market is expected to reach $173.81 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 34.05 percent between 2019 and 2025.  Let’s take a look at what emotional artificial intelligence can do and what hurdles you can expect along the way should you decide to implement emotional AI in your organization.
What is Emotional AI?
Emotional AI, also referred to as affective computing and artificial emotional intelligence, is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with processing and replicating human emotions. This technology dates back to 1995 and aims at making human-machine interactions more authentic and natural. Emotional AI can read people’s feelings through text, voice tone, facial expressions, and gestures and adjust its demeanor accordingly. 
People have the upper hand in recognizing different emotions, but AI is catching up with its ability to analyze large volumes of data. Emotional AI employs computer vision, speech science, and deep learning algorithms, among other techniques. It can listen to human speech and detect voice inflections that correspond to anger, stress, etc. The technology can spot facial micro-expressions that disappear so rapidly that the human eye wouldn’t be able to catch them. 
Let’s look at three main types of emotional artificial intelligence.
#1: Text 
Extracting emotions from text is also called sentiment analysis or opinion mining. It uses natural language processing and machine learning emotion detection on text samples to determine whether the prevailing sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. One common application is sifting through reviews of a hotel or a restaurant to understand what customers feel about it.
When looking into sentiments, it is crucial to understand what exactly elicits negative or positive feelings. Seeing negative sentiments towards a particular restaurant doesn’t give the owners actionable tips. They need to understand what exactly went wrong, whether it be the food, service, or the lighting.
Clarabridge, an AI-driven text and speech analysis company, performs sentiment analysis and can extract emotions, such as happiness and sadness, and evaluate them on a scale of -10 to 10, reflecting the intensity of the exhibited feeling. For example, “I’m angry” would be less intense than “I’m furious.”  
Challenges
Often, the sentiment hidden in words depends on the context. One word can have different emotions attached to it. For example, describing a phone as “thin” is positive, while the same characteristic of bedsheets in a hotel room would hold a negative sentiment.
Tip to Implement
There are existing pre-trained models that you can deploy, but it’s strongly recommended to go the extra mile and train those algorithms on a dataset that is specific to your application area. As a result, you will have a customized version with the desired accuracy.
#2: Audio
Emotional AI analyzes a person’s speech through various factors, including intonation, voice tone, vocal pitch, speed, and elongated pauses to determine their sentiment. This technology can detect hidden agitation even if someone uses their dry sense of humor and says the opposite of what they actually mean. 
Advanced techniques can work with sarcasm, hyperbole, and other linguistic habits. One of the main applications of voice emotional artificial intelligence is to spot disappointed customers in call centers and redirect them to someone who can smooth their feelings.  
California-based Behavioral Signals developed an emotional AI-powered solution for call centers. It matches agents to clients and finds the best representative to serve a particular customer. The tool operates solely based on vocal information and ignores conversations’ contents.

A team of directors monitored the performances and helped actors deliver realistic speeches. 
Tip to Implement
Ensure your training datasets are representative of the cultures, dialects, and habits of the target population. When you purchase ready-made emotional AI algorithms, make sure the vendor considers your audience and is open to recalibrating their tool to fit your needs. 
#3: Video 
AI facial emotion recognition can analyze facial expressions in videos to gauge the prevailing sentiment with the help of such technologies as facial recognition and computer vision. It can help detect the difference between lying and telling the truth. 
This emotional artificial intelligence type can be used in interview settings to detect whether candidates are nervous, confident, genuine, etc. Financial institutions can potentially use it to examine loan applicants.  
Challenges
It is challenging to get a clear picture of people’s faces when they are moving, as the lighting and the background change, not to mention the fact that people keep altering their appearances by tanning, growing facial hair, etc. Also, some people are less expressive than others, making it harder to spot any emotional signals. 
Tip to Implement
Many AI emotion detection video applications focus on group responses. For instance, in marketing, this technology is applied to observe people’s reactions to different advertisement campaigns. Instead of focusing on individual users, marketers capture all this data and average it. 
However, if you want to see every individual reaction in the context of your use case, it’s a good practice to customize your model and train it on specific users.
Emotional AI in Three Different Industries
#1: Marketing and Advertising 
AI emotion recognition algorithms help marketers understand which ads resonate better with the target audience and what features they should include in their videos to yield a better outcome.  
One example comes from Affectiva, an emotional AI company based in Boston. It developed a solution that helps marketers gauge customers’ reactions to different advertisements. With users’ permission, the tool analyses their facial expressions, body language, and speech to understand their emotional state. Affectiva’s AI model was trained on a diverse dataset including 6 million faces from 87 countries and can achieve an accuracy of 90 percent. 
#2: Healthcare
The healthcare sector deploys emotional support AI to help both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, this technology is paired with voice assistants to detect stress levels and respond appropriately. For patients, it is used to monitor their emotions in examination rooms and during surgical procedures. 
Additionally, AI-enhanced solutions can be deployed to measure people’s vitals. For example, the American Heart Association used emotional AI models to build an application that measured blood pressure from short videos instead of using the armband. This solution is believed to have an accuracy of approximately 95 percent.
#3: Customer Service 
Companies deploy emotional recognition AI at their call centers to enhance customer service. Such solutions have many benefits. They can pick the best fitting agent for a specific client, give real-time feedback to agents and notify them when they start to lose control, and respond in kind to a frustrated customer. Artificial intelligence algorithms can also analyze incoming support tickets and identify clients on the verge of cutting ties with the company. 
An American insurance corporation, MetLife, deployed Cogito’s emotional AI coaching solution in ten of its call centers. This solution could understand customers’ emotional states and provide agents with conversation and conflict resolution tips in real time. As the result, MetLife witnessed 17 percent reduction in call duration and 6.3 percentimprovement in issue resolution.
Barriers to Expect
Emotions Are Expressed Differently 
There is no standardization on how people express emotions. For example, in Japan, a smile is a sign of politeness, and it doesn’t exclude the fact that a smiling person can be in great distress. So, if a Japanese tourist needs assistance somewhere in Europe, emotional AI might give them a low score on urgency just because of the smile. 
Bias
Facial recognition technologies generally struggle with racial bias. Google once mistakenly tagged black faces as “gorilla”, cameras identified Asian people as “blinking”, and not long ago, an emotional AI algorithm ranked black people as “angrier” than their white counterparts. 
Moreover, studies revealed there is bias against elderly people. As our faces age, it becomes harder to identify different emotions, and the technology can penalize corresponding population groups. If, for instance, insurance companies would want to use emotional AI to identify drivers’ fatigue based on facial expressions, older drivers will be more likely to match the criteria even when they don’t experience any physical symptoms. As a result, insurance companies will demand older drivers pay larger premiums.
Privacy
Do people agree to be monitored and to have their emotions (mis)interpreted? ImageNet, one of the most extensive datasets used to train facial detection and recognition algorithms, was forced to blur faces on 1.5 million pictures in response to privacy rights. Even though they improved on privacy, the research team is wondering how training on faceless data will affect algorithms’ performance in the real world.
The Final Verdict
There is still a lot of controversy around AI emotions. Emotional AI has its benefits, but we should be careful when considering potential applications. Maybe it doesn’t make much sense now to involve this technology in life-altering situations. 
But the question remains: Is it right to penalize people for their feelings? Is it acceptable that job candidates are judged on how their voice sounds and students are punished because their faces look angry? All of these concerns will have to be taken into consideration before implementing emotional AI into your organization.

Artificial intelligence is helping us understand the language of animals.The technology can analyze hours of animal audio in a fraction of the time the same work would take for a human.""If you're manually trying to isolate these calls from audio files, it takes a really long time,"" said Kevin Coffey, a professor at the University of Washington.Coffey is also one of the creators of DeepSqueak, an A.I. program designed to pick up on high-pitched rat calls that human ears often miss.

""They make certain calls in positive situations and other calls in negative situations.""DeepSqueak's technology relies on the visual waveforms associated with an audio file.The A.I. scans the waves for any irregular patterns.""It certainly works better with some things, like rodent calls or a whistle, than others,"" Coffey said. ""Not all vocalizations are so nice.""Similar machine learning technologies are being deployed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution off the coast of Massachusetts.Researchers are using underwater microphones to catalog different species on coral reefs.A single reef can be home to more than a hundred species.""Sound travels really well in the ocean,"" said Aran Mooney, an associate scientist at WHOI. ""It's a really good indicator of those different species. We can put one sensor out and cover most of the reef.""The work is urgent, as climate change threatens to make some species extinct.""It's a way to catalog the animals that are more obvious, but we can also detect some of the more cryptic animals,"" Mooney said. ""That's one of the goals of the A.I., is to get some of those rarer species. Humans are pretty good at pulling out the obvious. We want to pull out the rare stuff.""The early success of this technology does not mean an ""animal to English"" translator is on the horizon.And any technology that claims to translate your dog's barks is probably a phony.Domestic pets have a smaller range of sounds. Much of their communication comes through body language.In order to fully understand a dog or cat, researchers believe we will need to use a hybrid A.I., which analyzes audio and video.Some research is already underway.""Things like DeepLabCut do pose estimation, where they try to automatically score animal behaviors based on individual frames of video,"" Coffey said. ""I want to merge those two very, very powerful techniques, so we have behavior and communication in one model and we can start getting a better idea of what the sounds mean.""

						Mission Sensor Operator Wade Hutt, checks out the large camera used for their work that is attached to the outside of the Pilatus multi-mission aircraft at a hangar at Centennial Airport on May 2, 2022. This aircraft is used to detect fires, help with mapping of perimeters and give real time situational awareness of fires. The plane is used year round for search and rescue operations, wildlife surveys, even avalanches.		

By Judith Kohler | jkohler@denverpost.com | The Denver PostUPDATED: May 3, 2022 at 10:38 a.m.With wildfires becoming bigger and more destructive as the West dries out and heats up, agencies and officials tasked with preventing and battling the blazes could soon have a new tool to add to their arsenal of prescribed burns, pick axes, chain saws and aircraft.The high-tech help could come by way of an area not normally associated with fighting wildfires: artificial intelligence. And space.Lockheed Martin Space, based in Jefferson County, is tapping decades of experience of managing satellites, exploring space and providing information for the U.S. military to offer more accurate data quicker to ground crews. They are talking to the U.S. Forest Service, university researchers and a Colorado state agency about how their their technology could help.By generating more timely information about on-the-ground conditions and running computer programs to process massive amounts of data, Lockheed Martin representatives say they can map fire perimeters in minutes rather than the hours it can take now. They say the artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning the company has applied to military use can enhance predictions about a fire’s direction and speed.“The scenario that wildland fire operators and commanders work in is very similar to that of the organizations and folks who defend our homeland and allies. It’s a dynamic environment across multiple activities and responsibilities,” said Dan Lordan, senior manager for AI integration at Lockheed Martin’s Artificial Intelligence Center.Lockheed Martin aims to use its technology developed over years in other areas to reduce the time it takes to gather information and make decisions about wildfires, said Rich Carter, business development director for Lockheed Martin Space’s Mission Solutions.

About ConnatixV511634 Worldwide outage cancels, delays hundreds offlights at Denver International Airport“The quicker you can react, hopefully then you can contain the fire faster and protect people’s properties and lives,” Carter said.The concept of a regular fire season has all but vanished as drought and warmer temperatures make Western lands ripe for ignition. At the end of December, the Marshall fire burned 991 homes and killed two people in Boulder County. The Denver area just experienced its third driest-ever April with only 0.06 of an inch of moisture, according to the National Weather Service.

Colorado had the highest number of fire-weather alerts in April than any other April in the past 15 years. Crews have quickly contained wind-driven fires that forced evacuations along the Front Range and on the Eastern Plains. But six families in Monte Vista lost their homes in April when a fire burned part of the southern Colorado town.Since 2014, the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control has flown planes equipped with infrared and color sensors to detect wildfires and provide the most up-to-date information possible to crews on the ground. The onboard equipment is integrated with the Colorado Wildfire Information System, a database that provides images and details to local fire managers.“Last year we found almost 200 new fires that nobody knew anything about,” said Bruce Dikken, unit chief for the agency’s multi-mission aircraft program. “I don’t know if any of those 200 fires would have become big fires. I know they didn’t become big fires because we found them.”When the two Pilatus PC-12 airplanes began flying in 2014, Colorado was the only state with such a program conveying the information “in near real time,” Dikken said. Lockheed Martin representatives have spent time in the air on the planes recently to see if its AI can speed up the process.“We don’t find every single fire that we fly over and it can certainly be faster if we could employ some kind of technology that might, for instance, automatically draw the fire perimeter,” Dikken said. “Right now, it’s very much a manual process.”Something like the 2020 Cameron Peak fire, which at 208,663 acres is Colorado’s largest wildfire, could take hours to map, Dikken said.And often the people on the planes are tracking several fires at the same time. Dikken said the faster they can collect and process the data on a fire’s perimeter, the faster they can move to the next fire. If it takes a couple of hours to map a fire, “what I drew at the beginning may be a little bit different now,” he said.Lordan said Lockheed Martin engineers who have flown with the state crews, using the video and images gathered on the flights, have been able to produce fire maps in as little as 15 minutes.The company has talked to the state about possibly carrying an additional computer that could help “crunch all that information” and transmit the map of the fire while still in flight to crews on the ground, Dikken said. The agency is waiting to hear the results of Lockheed Martin’s experiences aboard the aircraft and how the AI might help the state, he added.Helen H. Richardson, The Denver PostMission Sensor Operators Josh Seymour, left, and Wade Hutt, right, look at a perimeter map of the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires currently burning in New Mexico inside the Pilatus multi-mission aircraft at a hangar at Centennial Airport on May 2, 2022.“Actionable intelligence”The company is also talking to researchers at the U.S. Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory in Montana. Mark Finney, a research forester, said it’s early in discussions with Lockheed Martin.“They have a strong interest in applying their skills and capabilities to the wildland fire problem, and I think that would be welcome,” Finney said.The lab in Missoula has been involved in fire research since 1960 and developed most of the fire-management tools used for operations and planning, Finney said. “We’re pretty well situated to understand where new things and capabilities might be of use in the future and some of these things certainly might be.”Related Articles

However, Lockheed Martin is focused on technology and that’s “not really been where the most effective use of our efforts would be,” Finney said.“Prevention and mitigation and preemptive kind of management activities are where the great opportunities are to change the trajectory we’re on,” Finney said. “Improving reactive management is unlikely to yield huge benefits because the underlying source of the problem is the fuel structure across large landscapes as well as climate change.”Logging and prescribed burns, or fires started under controlled conditions, are some of the management practices used to get rid of fuel sources or create a more diverse landscape. But those methods have sometimes met resistance, Finney said.As bad as the Cameron Peak fire was, Finney said the prescribed burns the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests did through the years blunted the blaze’s intensity and changed the flames’ movement in spots.“Unfortunately, they hadn’t had time to finish their planned work,” Finney said.Lordan said the value of artificial intelligence, whether in preventing fires or responding to a fire, is producing accurate and timely information for fire managers, what he called “actionable intelligence.”One example, Lordan said, is information gathered and managed by federal agencies on the types and conditions of vegetation across the country. He said updates are done every two to three two years. Lockheed Martin uses data from satellites managed by the European Space Agency that updates the information about every five days.Lockheed is working with Nvidia, a California software company, to produce a digital simulation of a wildfire based on an area’s topography, condition of the vegetation, wind and weather to help forecast where and how it will burn. After the fact, the companies used the information about the Cameron Peak fire, plugging in the more timely satellite data on fuel conditions, and generated a video simulation that Lordan said was similar to the actual fire’s behavior and movement.While appreciating the help technology provides, both Dikken with the state of Colorado and Finney with the Forest Service said there will always be a need for “ground-truthing” by people.Applying AI to fighting wildfires isn’t about taking people out of the loop, Lockheed Martin spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said. “Somebody will always be in the loop, but people currently in the loop are besieged by so much data they can’t sort through it fast enough. That’s where this is coming from.”Helen H.
