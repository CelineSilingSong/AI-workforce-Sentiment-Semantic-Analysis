Reskilling people to use AI effectively will be the key to companies being able to use the technology successfully, says Accenture.How would you feel about working as a human alarm clock? It’s a job people used to do before the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. They would go around the dark, cold streets and tap on people’s windows with long sticks to wake them up for work.The invention of the mechanical alarm clock changed all that, and many people are now asking which 21st-century jobs artificial intelligence (AI) and the Fourth Industrial Revolution could consign to the history books.Professional services company Accenture describes the arrival of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 as ""a significant turning point and milestone in artificial intelligence ... [because] they've cracked the code on language complexity"".It estimates that 40% of all working hours could be impacted by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4. ""This is because language tasks account for 62% of the total time employees work,"" it says.However, the good news is that this doesn't mean machines will simply replace humans. Accenture says that 65% of the time we spend on these ""language tasks"" can be ""transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation"". AI is expected to change how we spend our time at work.  Image: AccenturePeople will be at the heart of successful AI use The potential for AI to reshape the world of work means companies need to start learning now to avoid being left behind, Accenture says. A big part of this will involve ensuring their staff are developing the new skills that will be required in the age of AI.""Success with generative AI requires an equal attention on people and training as it does on technology,"" Accenture says. ""This means both building talent in technical competencies like AI engineering and enterprise architecture, and training people across the organization to work effectively with AI-infused processes.""DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

""There will also be entirely new roles to recruit, including linguistics experts, AI quality controllers, AI editors, and prompt engineers,"" Accenture says. Breaking down roles into 'bundles of tasks' can help firms assess the potential impact of AI. Image: AccentureThe jobs AI could createThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 says that AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts and scientists, and digital transformation specialists are the most prominent emerging roles.It predicts a 40% jump in the number of AI and machine learning specialists by 2027, a 30-35% rise in demand for roles such as data analysts and scientists or big data specialists, and a 31% increase in demand for information security analysts. This would add a combined 2.6 million jobs.On the flipside, some jobs are seen as likely to decline quickly because of AI. These are mostly clerical or secretarial roles, and include bank tellers and data entry clerks. Here are the top 10 jobs the Forum sees growing fastest – and declining fastest – in the next five years:AI and machine learning specialists top the list of fastest growing jobs. Image: World Economic ForumAll this is leading companies to rethink their priorities when it comes to training staff to work with AI and big data. It is the number three priority in company training strategies to 2027, and number one for companies with more than 50,000 employees, the Future of Jobs Report 2023 says. How AI will impact the future of jobsThe Forum's report also finds that workplace tasks are seen as no more automated now than they were three years ago. To some extent, that's because automation had been occurring already, the Forum's Managing Director, Saadia Zahidi, told the Radio Davos podcast.Have you read?The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, explained4 ways artificial intelligence could transform manufacturingHere's how artificial intelligence can benefit the retail sector""But when it comes to very human traits like coordinating between people, like helping with decision-making and reasoning or communicating, that's where actually you see an uptick. That's where you see a greater prediction around automation than before. ""It's not surprising because we've all seen what is happening with generative AI and how fast that's getting adopted across various industries.""Artificial intelligence is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and to lead to high churn – with 50% of organizations believing it will result in job growth and 25% thinking it will create job losses, the Future of Jobs Report says. How tasks could be split between humans and machines in the coming years.

To ensure that innovation in AI continues in a way that benefits consumers, businesses and the UK economy, the government has asked regulators, including the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), to think about how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: safety, security and robustness; appropriate transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress.</p>

<p>In line with government’s AI white paper and the CMA’s role to support open, competitive markets, the review seeks to understand how foundation models are developing and produce an assessment of the conditions and principles that will best guide the development of foundation models and their use in the future.</p>

<p>This initial review will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>examine how the competitive markets for foundation models and their use could evolve</li>
  <li>explore what opportunities and risks these scenarios could bring for competition and consumer protection</li>
  <li>produce guiding principles to support competition and protect consumers as AI foundation models develop</li>
</ul>

<p>The development of AI touches upon a number of important issues, including safety, security, copyright, privacy, and human rights, as well as the ways markets work. Many of these issues are being considered by government or other regulators, so this initial review will focus on the questions the CMA is best placed to address − what are the likely implications of the development of AI foundation models for competition and consumer protection?</p>

<p>Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI has burst into the public consciousness over the past few months but has been on our radar for some time. It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It’s crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information. Our goal is to help this new, rapidly scaling technology develop in ways that ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CMA is seeking views and evidence from stakeholders and welcomes submissions by 2 June 2023. The CMA encourages interested parties to respond and be proactive in identifying relevant evidence.</p>

<p>Following evidence gathering and analysis, the CMA will publish a report which sets out its findings in September 2023.</p>

-2%, an educational company, and IBM have both announced that AI will cause a change within their respective organizations. Chegg saw its shares fall in value. IBM will enact hiring freezes and allow attrition without recruiting new personnel, as AI will take over their jobs.

AI Schools Chegg Stock
Shares in online learning company Chegg plunged after it was one of the first organizations to admit that AI affected its business model. Chegg recognized that students were turning to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for help. The AI alternative hurts Chegg’s financial situation as its shares fell nearly 50% on Tuesday morning.

In response to the new reality, The company started CheggMate, a service created with ChatGPT-4 to offer tailored content via AI.

Millions Of Jobs Predicted To Be Impacted
According to a new report by the World Economic Forum released on Monday, a quarter of jobs will be impacted over the next five years. The fast-growing trends of artificial intelligence, digitization, renewable energy and supply chain reshoring will bring about a critical shift in the global labor market. The WEF predicts a ""new era of turbulence,"" as many workers won’t have the requisite skills to keep up with the changes. Those with a technology, data analytics or cybersecurity background will benefit in the new environment.

The WEF study surveyed more than 800 companies that collectively employ 11.3 million workers across 45 countries worldwide. Global employers anticipate creating 69 million new positions by 2027 and eradicating 83 million jobs—a net loss of 14 million roles. Clerical workers will bear the brunt of the fast-moving changes. Around 26 million jobs in administrative positions will be cut due to AI.

Suppose generative AI lives up to its hype. In that case, the workforce in the United States and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs reported this week in a sobering and alarming report about AI's ascendance. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.

IBM’s Hiring Freeze on Roles That AI Can Replace
Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp. CEO Arvind Krishna announced it would pause hiring for roles that can be replaced by artificial intelligence. Functions, including administrative-oriented back office roles and human resources, are targeted. Krishna points out that the tech company has around 26,000 workers that are not client-facing, and about 30%— representing 7,800 people— could be displaced through attrition due to AI over the next five years. IBM boasts 260,000 workers and will keep hiring for software development and customer-facing roles.

Artificial intelligence for HR: What is it and how will it change?

Research from Goldman Sachs predicts that artificial intelligence could replace the equivalent of more than 300 million jobs. Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT are now so advanced that they can create content “indistinguishable” from humans, write documents and fulfil repetitive administrative tasks, but this heralds a huge change for how workforces are managed.
What is artificial intelligence for HR?
Artificial intelligence refers to a suite of computer algorithms that can replicate human intelligence processes. In many organisations, its use so far has been restricted to tools such as chatbots, where it can answer simple questions in recruitment processes, or making suggestions to employees if they’re searching for learning content or a key document in their email.
Recent developments in generative AI, however, mean these systems have evolved to the point where they can simulate more complex human tasks such as writing policies, drawing realistic images or answering difficult questions.
What is generative AI?
Generative AI uses machine learning to process a huge amount of textual and visual data from the internet and other sources. One of the most popular generative AI tools is ChatGPT, produced by OpenAI. A host of alternatives have emerged in recent months, often focused on specific tasks such as writing, coding or translation. HR users of ChatGPT can put a request into the engine such as “please write a parental leave policy” and it will generate a document in seconds for a task that could take humans hours or days.
Is artificial intelligence for HR reliable?
Experts argue that while AI HR tools can speed up the generation of policies or documents for volume tasks such as recruitment or a change in terms and conditions, it is still vital to have human oversight.
Maria Kutar, information systems expert at Salford Business School, has argued that HR teams will need to build new skills to manage the use of ChatGPT-style programmes. “Human ethics will still need to be applied to ensure policies serve their purpose and meet business needs, while having integrity and fairness,” she says. “This is particularly important for HR policies and ensuring they don’t discriminate, hold any bias and protect employees, particularly those from underrepresented groups.”

Artificial intelligence for HR
Generative AI will ‘replace 300 million jobs’, says Goldman Sachs 
How useful is ChatGPT-style AI for HR? 

That said, HR teams could use generative AI to check their policies against UK employment law, according to employment law specialist Joanne Gill from Wirehouse Employer Services. While it won’t advise on whether this content is legally binding, it could make suggestions for things to include that were missed in drafting.
One area where generative AI could be particularly useful is in recruitment, where there are numerous administrative tasks that can be simplified and accelerated. Many HR departments already use basic AI to scan CVs or applications for keywords, but this could evolve into more sophisticated analysis of language in video interviews, for example, or making suggestions to recruiters.
What will AI mean for workforce planning?
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 57 sYou can close Ad in 2 sGoldman Sachs research suggests that as much as 63% of the US workforce could have some aspects of their role automated, and a similar proportion in Europe will be affected. Hands-on roles in areas such as construction will be the least affected.
For HR teams in sectors such as law, a high proportion of tasks could be automated, meaning the function will need to recalibrate its recruitment and retention strategies. Job losses are already occurring in some sectors – UK publisher Reach has recently trialled the use of AI to produce articles for local news sites, and the company announced 200 redundancies at the start of this year.
On the one hand, AI can support HR to optimise the workforce through tasks such as scheduling or working out who has the most relevant skills for a project, according to consulting group McKinsey. On the other hand, it will require HR and learning teams to rethink the skills needed in a hybrid workforce where humans and ‘machines’ interact.
HR analyst Josh Bersin believes HR will need to adapt rapidly to a changing skills landscape, reassessing skills models and redesigning jobs so the human aspect of roles is put to best use.
What will AI mean for the HR function itself?
In 2020, Willis Towers Watson published research suggesting that almost a third of HR roles were at risk of being replaced by robots. It found that 24 out of 27 roles would be impacted by AI in some way.
According to a BBC analysis of research by Oxford University and Deloitte from 2015, the most likely roles in HR to be automated are in HR administration, which have a 90% likelihood of automation. HR managers and directors (32% likelihood) and HR and industrial relations officers (24%) are at far less risk of automation.

The art of the prompt: How to get the best out of generative AI






Written by Jake Siegel

Generative AI models can crank out anything from poetry and prose to images and code at your command. But to coax your desired output from these AI tools, you need to craft the right input — AKA, the prompt.
Prompts are what guide the AI model’s output and influence its tone, style and quality. And good prompts are what elicit brilliant text and stunning images.
“Writing good prompts is the key to unlocking the power and potential of generative AI,” said Jennifer Marsman, principal engineer in Microsoft’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer. 
 






Simple prompts to try on Bing

“I compare it to the early days of search engines — there was an art to choosing the right keywords to get good results and, over time, both the users and the search engine got better at understanding each other,” she said. “This is the same paradigm. Over time, both we as users and the machine learning models will understand each other better.”
As generative AI tools become increasingly popular for work and play, it’s helpful to know how to get the most out of them. Crafting the right prompt is essential, but it can be a give-and-take. Here are a few of Marsman’s top tips and tricks for writing effective prompts.

Write a prompt in Bing Chat

Be specific
You had a stunning image in your mind, but when you told Bing Image Creator to make it real, the result wasn’t at all what you imagined. What gives?
It’s essential to provide as much detail as possible when writing prompts, especially when it comes to images, Marsman said. One key element she likes to provide is style. Tell the model to produce the image as a pencil sketch, for example, or an oil painting, or a cartoon. Point of view and lighting are also attributes to consider. In an image of a baseball stadium, are you looking down from the stands, or on the field, or a bird’s-eye view from above? 
In the “underwater palace” example, Marsman added the phrase “high-quality digital art” to her prompt. Without it, the image wouldn’t have had the same level of detail, she said.

Marsman was pleased with the output. But don’t be afraid to iterate, she added. Flipping around the order of words in the prompt will bring different elements to the foreground. If she had wanted to add mermaids as the focus, for example, she could have listed “mermaids” first.
Use the right model for the right job
If you’re looking for stories, poems, jokes or other imaginative answers, use the “more creative” mode of Bing Chat.
But if you’re looking for just the facts, use the “more precise” mode. This will yield succinct and fact-based responses, Marsman said. “Balanced” mode is the default and works well for most scenarios, she added.
Fact-check
Bing combines powerful AI models with its immense search index for results that are current, cited and conversational. But one downside of generative AI models is that they can occasionally generate plausible-sounding answers that are, in fact, wrong. Here are a few tips to help make sure that reasonable-sounding output is indeed true:

Use the “more precise” conversation style in Bing Chat. This model tends to do better at grounding its responses in the source material from the web. 
Read the references carefully. You can click into the citations and verify that the model correctly interpreted the text.  
Tell the model to summarize specific information rather than asking an open-ended question. For example, instead of asking, “what is the theory of general relativity,” you could frame your prompt as “summarize the key concepts of general relativity in one paragraph.” This can help guide the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses, Marsman said. 

Tailor results through different points of view 
You can get better answers from a chatbot by telling it how you want it to provide answers. For example, if you want a simple explanation of quantum mechanics, you can ask AI-powered Bing to “explain it to me like I’m in 8th grade.” But if you’re savvy with the jargon and nitty-gritty of the topic, you can ask it to act like a college professor or a technical trainer. This way, you can adjust the Bing Chat’s voice and level of understanding to suit your needs.

When you want to change the conversation, use the “New topic” button   
If you want to ask follow-up questions on the same topic in Bing Chat, it’s best to keep the current conversation going. When you want to switch topics, hit the “New topic” button. This gives the model a clean slate — it won’t get confused and merge unrelated topics.
You can specify length 
Do you want a succinct answer or a long tale? You can specify the length — two sentences, for example, or two paragraphs — and guide the model accordingly. And if the chatbot stops before you’re satisfied, you can always prompt it to “go on.”
Don’t forget formatting
AI-powered Bing can present data and information from multiple sources across the web and in a variety of different ways to improve understanding. For example, tables and outlines can help users see information in a structured format. Similarly, diagrams and flow charts can help users visualize complex data, making it easier to understand and interpret.

Leverage your Copilot for writing good code
Remember that the model is trained with many programming languages, so asking simply to accomplish a coding task could result in any number of programming languages being used. Specify the programming language you want. You should also include any other relevant contextual information, such as libraries, APIs or frameworks you are using. You can also mention context from already-written code, like “the user’s input is stored in a variable called x.”
Don’t forget to always run and test your code!
If at first you don’t succeed, prompt again
It’s important to remember that prompting AI to generate responses is not an exact science, and that iteration is key, Marsman said. The beauty of creating prompts is that you can try multiple approaches to see what works best. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different lengths, tones and voices. If the initial results aren’t what you’re looking for, try tweaking your prompt and running it again. With practice, you’ll get better at guiding the model to the results you want.

Become the New McKinsey?As it’s currently imagined, the technology promises to concentrate wealth and disempower workers. Is an alternative possible?By Ted ChiangMay 4, 2023Illustration by Berke YaziciogluSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyWhen we talk about artificial intelligence, we rely on metaphor, as we always do when dealing with something new and unfamiliar. Metaphors are, by their nature, imperfect, but we still need to choose them carefully, because bad ones can lead us astray. For example, it’s become very common to compare powerful A.I.s to genies in fairy tales. The metaphor is meant to highlight the difficulty of making powerful entities obey your commands; the computer scientist Stuart Russell has cited the parable of King Midas, who demanded that everything he touched turn into gold, to illustrate the dangers of an A.I. doing what you tell it to do instead of what you want it to do. There are multiple problems with this metaphor, but one of them is that it derives the wrong lessons from the tale to which it refers. The point of the Midas parable is that greed will destroy you, and that the pursuit of wealth will cost you everything that is truly important. If your reading of the parable is that, when you are granted a wish by the gods, you should phrase your wish very, very carefully, then you have missed the point.So, I would like to propose another metaphor for the risks of artificial intelligence. I suggest that we think about A.I. as a management-consulting firm, along the lines of McKinsey & Company. Firms like McKinsey are hired for a wide variety of reasons, and A.I. systems are used for many reasons, too. But the similarities between McKinsey—a consulting firm that works with ninety per cent of the Fortune 100—and A.I. are also clear. Social-media companies use machine learning to keep users glued to their feeds. In a similar way, Purdue Pharma used McKinsey to figure out how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin during the opioid epidemic. Just as A.I. promises to offer managers a cheap replacement for human workers, so McKinsey and similar firms helped normalize the practice of mass layoffs as a way of increasing stock prices and executive compensation, contributing to the destruction of the middle class in America.AdChoicesA former McKinsey employee has described the company as “capital’s willing executioners”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. has become a way for a company to evade responsibility by saying that it’s just doing what “the algorithm” says, even though it was the company that commissioned the algorithm in the first place.The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has.Note that you cannot simply say that you will build A.I. that only offers pro-social solutions to the problems you ask it to solve. That’s the equivalent of saying that you can defuse the threat of McKinsey by starting a consulting firm that only offers such solutions. The reality is that Fortune 100 companies will hire McKinsey instead of your pro-social firm, because McKinsey’s solutions will increase shareholder value more than your firm’s solutions will. It will always be possible to build A.I. that pursues shareholder value above all else, and most companies will prefer to use that A.I. instead of one constrained by your principles.Is there a way for A.I. to do something other than sharpen the knife blade of capitalism? Just to be clear, when I refer to capitalism, I’m not talking about the exchange of goods or services for prices determined by a market, which is a property of many economic systems. When I refer to capitalism, I’m talking about a specific relationship between capital and labor, in which private individuals who have money are able to profit off the effort of others. So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.Many people think that A.I. will create more unemployment, and bring up universal basic income, or U.B.I., as a solution to that problem. In general, I like the idea of universal basic income; however, over time, I’ve become skeptical about the way that people who work in A.I. suggest U.B.I. as a response to A.I.-driven unemployment. It would be different if we already had universal basic income, but we don’t, so expressing support for it seems like a way for the people developing A.I. to pass the buck to the government. In effect, they are intensifying the problems that capitalism creates with the expectation that, when those problems become bad enough, the government will have no choice but to step in. As a strategy for making the world a better place, this seems dubious.You may remember that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, the actress Susan Sarandon—who was a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders—said that voting for Donald Trump would be better than voting for Hillary Clinton because it would bring about the revolution more quickly. I don’t know how deeply Sarandon had thought this through, but the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said the same thing, and I’m pretty sure he had given a lot of thought to the matter. He argued that Trump’s election would be such a shock to the system that it would bring about change.Video From The New YorkerSurfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made WaveWhat Žižek advocated for is an example of an idea in political philosophy known as accelerationism. There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes.I suppose this is one way to bring about a better world, but, if it’s the approach that the A.I. industry is adopting, I want to make sure everyone is clear about what they’re working toward. By building A.I. to do jobs previously performed by people, A.I. researchers are increasing the concentration of wealth to such extreme levels that the only way to avoid societal collapse is for the government to step in. Intentionally or not, this is very similar to voting for Trump with the goal of bringing about a better world. And the rise of Trump illustrates the risks of pursuing accelerationism as a strategy: things can get very bad, and stay very bad for a long time, before they get better. In fact, you have no idea of how long it will take for things to get better; all you can be sure of is that there will be significant pain and suffering in the short and medium term.I’m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, as one famous thought experiment has imagined. It’s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value. Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives.People who criticize new technologies are sometimes called Luddites, but it’s helpful to clarify what the Luddites actually wanted. The main thing they were protesting was the fact that their wages were falling at the same time that factory owners’ profits were increasing, along with food prices. They were also protesting unsafe working conditions, the use of child labor, and the sale of shoddy goods that discredited the entire textile industry. The Luddites did not indiscriminately destroy machines; if a machine’s owner paid his workers well, they left it alone. The Luddites were not anti-technology; what they wanted was economic justice. They destroyed machinery as a way to get factory owners’ attention. The fact that the word “Luddite” is now used as an insult, a way of calling someone irrational and ignorant, is a result of a smear campaign by the forces of capital.Whenever anyone accuses anyone else of being a Luddite, it’s worth asking, is the person being accused actually against technology? Or are they in favor of economic justice? And is the person making the accusation actually in favor of improving people’s lives? Or are they just trying to increase the private accumulation of capital?Today, we find ourselves in a situation in which technology has become conflated with capitalism, which has in turn become conflated with the very notion of progress. If you try to criticize capitalism, you are accused of opposing both technology and progress. But what does progress even mean, if it doesn’t include better lives for people who work? What is the point of greater efficiency, if the money being saved isn’t going anywhere except into shareholders’ bank accounts? We should all strive to be Luddites, because we should all be more concerned with economic justice than with increasing the private accumulation of capital. We need to be able to criticize harmful uses of technology—and those include uses that benefit shareholders over workers—without being described as opponents of technology.Imagine an idealized future, a hundred years from now, in which no one is forced to work at any job they dislike, and everyone can spend their time on whatever they find most personally fulfilling. Obviously it’s hard to see how we’d get there from here. But now consider two possible scenarios for the next few decades. In one, management and the forces of capital are even more powerful than they are now. In the other, labor is more powerful than it is now. Which one of these seems more likely to get us closer to that idealized future? And, as it’s currently deployed, which one is A.I. pushing us toward?Of course, there is the argument that new technology improves our standard of living in the long term, which makes up for the unemployment that it creates in the short term. This argument carried weight for much of the post-Industrial Revolution period, but it has lost its force in the past half century. In the United States, per-capita G.D.P. has almost doubled since 1980, while the median household income has lagged far behind. That period covers the information-technology revolution. This means that the economic value created by the personal computer and the Internet has mostly served to increase the wealth of the top one per cent of the top one per cent, instead of raising the standard of living for U.S. citizens as a whole.Of course, we all have the Internet now, and the Internet is amazing. But real-estate prices, college tuition, and health-care costs have all risen faster than inflation. In 1980, it was common to support a family on a single income; now it’s rare. So, how much progress have we really made in the past forty years? Sure, shopping online is fast and easy, and streaming movies at home is cool, but I think a lot of people would willingly trade those conveniences for the ability to own their own homes, send their kids to college without running up lifelong debt, and go to the hospital without falling into bankruptcy. It’s not technology’s fault that the median income hasn’t kept pace with per-capita G.D.P.; it’s mostly the fault of Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman. But some responsibility also falls on the management policies of C.E.O.s like Jack Welch, who ran General Electric between 1981 and 2001, as well as on consulting firms like McKinsey. I’m not blaming the personal computer for the rise in wealth inequality—I’m just saying that the claim that better technology will necessarily improve people’s standard of living is no longer credible.The fact that personal computers didn’t raise the median income is particularly relevant when thinking about the possible benefits of A.I. It’s often suggested that researchers should focus on ways that A.I. can increase individual workers’ productivity rather than replace them; this is referred to as the augmentation path, as opposed to the automation path. That’s a worthy goal, but, by itself, it won’t improve people’s economic fortunes. The productivity software that ran on personal computers was a perfect example of augmentation rather than automation: word-processing programs replaced typewriters rather than typists, and spreadsheet programs replaced paper spreadsheets rather than accountants. But the increased personal productivity brought about by the personal computer wasn’t matched by an increased standard of living.The only way that technology can boost the standard of living is if there are economic policies in place to distribute the benefits of technology appropriately. We haven’t had those policies for the past forty years, and, unless we get them, there is no reason to think that forthcoming advances in A.I. will raise the median income, even if we’re able to devise ways for it to augment individual workers. A.I. will certainly reduce labor costs and increase profits for corporations, but that is entirely different from improving our standard of living.It would be convenient if we could assume that a utopian future is right around the corner and develop technology for use in that future. But the fact that a given technology would be helpful in a utopia does not imply that it’s helpful now. In a utopia where there’s a machine that converts toxic waste into food, generating toxic waste wouldn’t be a problem, but, in the here and now, no one could claim that generating toxic waste is harmless. Accelerationists might argue that generating more toxic waste will motivate the invention of a waste-to-food converter, but how convincing is that? We evaluate the environmental impact of technologies in the context of the mitigations that are currently available, not in the context of hypothetical future mitigations. By the same token, we can’t evaluate A.I. by imagining how helpful it will be in a world with U.B.I.; we have to evaluate it in light of the existing imbalance between capital and labor, and, in that context, A.I. is a threat because of the way it assists capital.A former partner at McKinsey defended the company’s actions by saying, “We don’t do policy. We do execution.” But this is a pretty thin excuse; harmful policy decisions are more likely to be made when consulting firms—or new technologies—offer ways to implement them. The version of A.I. that’s currently being developed makes it easier for companies to lay people off. So is there any way to develop a kind of A.I. that makes it harder?In his book “How to Be an Anticapitalist in the 21st Century,” the sociologist Erik Olin Wright offers a taxonomy of strategies for responding to the harms of capitalism. Two of the strategies he mentions are smashing capitalism and dismantling capitalism, which probably fall outside the scope of this discussion. The ones that are more relevant here are taming capitalism and resisting capitalism. Roughly speaking, taming capitalism means government regulation, and resisting capitalism means grassroots activism and labor unions. Are there ways for A.I. to strengthen those things? Is there a way for A.I. to empower labor unions or worker-owned coöperatives?In 1976, the workers at the Lucas Aerospace Corporation in Birmingham, England, were facing layoffs because of cuts in defense spending. In response, the shop stewards produced a document known as the Lucas Plan, which described a hundred and fifty “socially useful products,” ranging from dialysis machines to wind turbines and hybrid engines for cars, that the workforce could build with its existing skills and equipment rather than being laid off. The management at Lucas Aerospace rejected the proposal, but it remains a notable modern example of workers trying to steer capitalism in a more human direction. Surely something similar must be possible with modern computing technology.Does capitalism have to be as harmful as it currently is? Maybe not. The three decades following the Second World War are sometimes known as the golden age of capitalism. This period was partially the result of better government policies, but the government didn’t create the golden age on its own: corporate culture was different during this era. In General Electric’s annual report from 1953, the company bragged about how much it paid in taxes and how much it was spending on payroll. It explicitly said that “maximizing employment security is a prime company goal.” The founder of Johnson & Johnson said that the company’s responsibility to its employees was higher than its responsibility to its shareholders. Corporations then had a radically different conception of their role in society compared with corporations today.Is there a way to get back to those values? It seems unlikely, but remember that the golden age of capitalism came after the enormous wealth inequality of the Gilded Age. Right now we’re living in a second Gilded Age, in which wealth inequality is about the same as it was back in 1913, so it’s not impossible that we could go from where we are now to a second golden age. Of course, in between the first Gilded Age and the golden age we had the Great Depression and two World Wars. An accelerationist might say that those events were necessary to bring about the golden age, but I think most of us would prefer to skip over those steps. The task before us is to imagine ways for technology to move us toward a golden age without bringing about another Great Depression first.We all live in a capitalist system, so we are all participants in capitalism whether we like it or not. And it’s reasonable to wonder if there’s anything you as an individual can do. If you work as a food scientist at Frito-Lay and your job is to invent new flavors of potato chip, I’m not going to say that you have an ethical obligation to quit because you’re assisting the engine of consumerism. You’re using your training as a food scientist to provide customers with a pleasant experience; that’s a perfectly reasonable way to make a living.But many of the people who work in A.I. regard it as more important than inventing new flavors of potato chip. They say it’s a world-changing technology. If that’s the case, then they have a duty to find ways for A.I. to make the world better without first making it worse. Can A.I. ameliorate the inequities of our world other than by pushing us to the brink of societal collapse? If A.I. is as powerful a tool as its proponents claim, they should be able to find other uses for it besides intensifying the ruthlessness of capital.If there is any lesson that we should take from stories about genies granting wishes, it’s that the desire to get something without effort is the real problem. Think about the story of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” in which the apprentice casts a spell to make broomsticks carry water but is unable to make them stop. The lesson of that story is not that magic is impossible to control: at the end of the story, the sorcerer comes back and immediately fixes the mess the apprentice made. The lesson is that you can’t get out of doing the hard work. The apprentice wanted to avoid his chores, and looking for a shortcut was what got him into trouble.The tendency to think of A.I. as a magical problem solver is indicative of a desire to avoid the hard work that building a better world requires. That hard work will involve things like addressing wealth inequality and taming capitalism. For technologists, the hardest work of all—the task that they most want to avoid—will be questioning the assumption that more technology is always better, and the belief that they can continue with business as usual and everything will simply work itself out. No one enjoys thinking about their complicity in the injustices of the world, but it is imperative that the people who are building world-shaking technologies engage in this kind of critical self-examination. It’s their willingness to look unflinchingly at their own role in the system that will determine whether A.I. leads to a better world or a worse one. ♦",https://schema.org/,BreadcrumbList,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey'}",,2023-05-04T12:38:14.461-04:00,2023-05-04T12:38:14.461-04:00,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Yorker', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/social-image-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '117px'}, 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com'}","['https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6421b50e1aec38f0f544ac9b/16:9/w_1920,h_1080,c_limit/Chiang_AI_Mckinsey.jpg', 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6421b50e1aec38f0f544ac9b/4:3/w_1375,h_1031,c_limit/Chiang_AI_Mckinsey.jpg', 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6421b50e1aec38f0f544ac9b/1:1/w_1097,h_1097,c_limit/Chiang_AI_Mckinsey.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ted Chiang', 'sameAs': 'https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ted-chiang'}]",,,"So, I would like to propose another metaphor for the risks of artificial intelligence. I suggest that we think about A.I. as a management-consulting firm, along the lines of McKinsey & Company. Firms like McKinsey are hired for a wide variety of reasons, and A.I. systems are used for many reasons, too. But the similarities between McKinsey—a consulting firm that works with ninety per cent of the Fortune 100—and A.I. are also clear. Social-media companies use machine learning to keep users glued to their feeds. In a similar way, Purdue Pharma used McKinsey to figure out how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin during the opioid epidemic. Just as A.I. promises to offer managers a cheap replacement for human workers, so McKinsey and similar firms helped normalize the practice of mass layoffs as a way of increasing stock prices and executive compensation, contributing to the destruction of the middle class in America.
A former McKinsey employee has described the company as “capital’s willing executioners”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. has become a way for a company to evade responsibility by saying that it’s just doing what “the algorithm” says, even though it was the company that commissioned the algorithm in the first place.
The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has.
Note that you cannot simply say that you will build A.I. that only offers pro-social solutions to the problems you ask it to solve. That’s the equivalent of saying that you can defuse the threat of McKinsey by starting a consulting firm that only offers such solutions. The reality is that Fortune 100 companies will hire McKinsey instead of your pro-social firm, because McKinsey’s solutions will increase shareholder value more than your firm’s solutions will. It will always be possible to build A.I. that pursues shareholder value above all else, and most companies will prefer to use that A.I. instead of one constrained by your principles.
Is there a way for A.I. to do something other than sharpen the knife blade of capitalism? Just to be clear, when I refer to capitalism, I’m not talking about the exchange of goods or services for prices determined by a market, which is a property of many economic systems. When I refer to capitalism, I’m talking about a specific relationship between capital and labor, in which private individuals who have money are able to profit off the effort of others. So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.
As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?
Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.
You may remember that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, the actress Susan Sarandon—who was a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders—said that voting for Donald Trump would be better than voting for Hillary Clinton because it would bring about the revolution more quickly. I don’t know how deeply Sarandon had thought this through, but the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said the same thing, and I’m pretty sure he had given a lot of thought to the matter. He argued that Trump’s election would be such a shock to the system that it would bring about change.
What Žižek advocated for is an example of an idea in political philosophy known as accelerationism. There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes.
I suppose this is one way to bring about a better world, but, if it’s the approach that the A.I. industry is adopting, I want to make sure everyone is clear about what they’re working toward. By building A.I. to do jobs previously performed by people, A.I. researchers are increasing the concentration of wealth to such extreme levels that the only way to avoid societal collapse is for the government to step in. Intentionally or not, this is very similar to voting for Trump with the goal of bringing about a better world. And the rise of Trump illustrates the risks of pursuing accelerationism as a strategy: things can get very bad, and stay very bad for a long time, before they get better. In fact, you have no idea of how long it will take for things to get better; all you can be sure of is that there will be significant pain and suffering in the short and medium term.
I’m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, as one famous thought experiment has imagined. It’s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value. Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives.
People who criticize new technologies are sometimes called Luddites, but it’s helpful to clarify what the Luddites actually wanted. The main thing they were protesting was the fact that their wages were falling at the same time that factory owners’ profits were increasing, along with food prices. They were also protesting unsafe working conditions, the use of child labor, and the sale of shoddy goods that discredited the entire textile industry. The Luddites did not indiscriminately destroy machines; if a machine’s owner paid his workers well, they left it alone. The Luddites were not anti-technology; what they wanted was economic justice. They destroyed machinery as a way to get factory owners’ attention. The fact that the word “Luddite” is now used as an insult, a way of calling someone irrational and ignorant, is a result of a smear campaign by the forces of capital.
Whenever anyone accuses anyone else of being a Luddite, it’s worth asking, is the person being accused actually against technology? Or are they in favor of economic justice? And is the person making the accusation actually in favor of improving people’s lives? Or are they just trying to increase the private accumulation of capital?
Today, we find ourselves in a situation in which technology has become conflated with capitalism, which has in turn become conflated with the very notion of progress. If you try to criticize capitalism, you are accused of opposing both technology and progress. But what does progress even mean, if it doesn’t include better lives for people who work? What is the point of greater efficiency, if the money being saved isn’t going anywhere except into shareholders’ bank accounts? We should all strive to be Luddites, because we should all be more concerned with economic justice than with increasing the private accumulation of capital. We need to be able to criticize harmful uses of technology—and those include uses that benefit shareholders over workers—without being described as opponents of technology.
Imagine an idealized future, a hundred years from now, in which no one is forced to work at any job they dislike, and everyone can spend their time on whatever they find most personally fulfilling. Obviously it’s hard to see how we’d get there from here. But now consider two possible scenarios for the next few decades. In one, management and the forces of capital are even more powerful than they are now. In the other, labor is more powerful than it is now. Which one of these seems more likely to get us closer to that idealized future? And, as it’s currently deployed, which one is A.I. pushing us toward?
Of course, we all have the Internet now, and the Internet is amazing. But real-estate prices, college tuition, and health-care costs have all risen faster than inflation.

Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now regretted his work. He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were ""quite scary"".""Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.""Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: ""I'm 75, so it's time to retire.""Dr Hinton's pioneering research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for current AI systems like ChatGPT. In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and process information. They enable AIs to learn from experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.""Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not as good, but it does already do simple reasoning,"" he said.""And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get better quite fast. So we need to worry about that.""Is the world prepared for the coming AI storm?AI could affect 300 million jobs - reportBBC Reel: Why we are still smarter than machinesIn the New York Times article, Dr Hinton referred to ""bad actors"" who would try to use AI for ""bad things"".When asked by the BBC to elaborate on this, he replied: ""This is just a kind of worst-case scenario, kind of a nightmare scenario. ""You can imagine, for example, some bad actor like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decided to give robots the ability to create their own sub-goals.""The scientist warned that this eventually might ""create sub-goals like 'I need to get more power'"".He added: ""I've come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we're developing is very different from the intelligence we have. ""We're biological systems and these are digital systems. And the big difference is that with digital systems, you have many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of the world. ""And all these copies can learn separately but share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something, everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.""Matt Clifford, the chairman of the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, speaking in a personal capacity, told the BBC that Dr Hinton's announcement ""underlines the rate at which AI capabilities are accelerating"".""There's an enormous upside from this technology, but it's essential that the world invests heavily and urgently in AI safety and control,"" he said.Dr Hinton joins a growing number of experts who have expressed concerns about AI - both the speed at which it is developing and the direction in which it is going.'We need to take a step back'In March, an open letter - co-signed by dozens of people in the AI field, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk - called for a pause on all developments more advanced than the current version of AI chatbot ChatGPT so robust safety measures could be designed and implemented.Yoshua Bengio, another so-called godfather of AI, who along with Dr Hinton and Yann LeCun won the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning, also signed the letter. Mr Bengio wrote that it was because of the ""unexpected acceleration"" in AI systems that ""we need to take a step back"".But Dr Hinton told the BBC that ""in the shorter term"" he thought AI would deliver many more benefits than risks, ""so I don't think we should stop developing this stuff,"" he added.He also said that international competition would mean that a pause would be difficult. ""Even if everybody in the US stopped developing it, China would just get a big lead,"" he said.Dr Hinton also said he was an expert on the science, not policy, and that it was the responsibility of government to ensure AI was developed ""with a lot of thought into how to stop it going rogue"".'Responsible approach'Dr Hinton stressed that he did not want to criticise Google and that the tech giant had been ""very responsible"".""I actually want to say some good things about Google. And they're more credible if I don't work for Google.""In a statement, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean said: ""We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.""1:46Watch: What is artificial intelligence?It is important to remember that AI chatbots are just one aspect of artificial intelligence, even if they are the most popular right now. AI is behind the algorithms that dictate what video-streaming platforms decide you should watch next. It can be used in recruitment to filter job applications, by insurers to calculate premiums, it can diagnose medical conditions (although human doctors still get the final say).  What we are seeing now though is the rise of AGI - artificial general intelligence - which can be trained to do a number of things within a remit. So for example, ChatGPT can only offer text answers to a query, but the possibilities within that, as we are seeing, are endless.But the pace of AI acceleration has surprised even its creators. It has evolved dramatically since Dr Hinton built a pioneering image analysis neural network in 2012. Even Google boss Sundar Pichai said in a recent interview that even he did not fully understand everything that its AI chatbot, Bard, did. Make no mistake, we are on a speeding train right now, and the concern is that one day it will start building its own tracks.

How artificial intelligence could change certain types of work
02:03

New York City — Since he started using artificial intelligence, copywriter Guillermo Rubio estimates his productivity has increased by as much as 20%. ""It just makes certain things go a bit faster, like research or brainstorming ideas,"" Rubio told CBS News. ""It's really useful for coming up with those things. Not necessarily writing them, but just generating the ideas when you're stuck.""That innovation also means change. A report released by Goldman Sachs in March found that AI services could automate as many as 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. Many are calling it a new age in the way we work.  






""It's very powerful,"" said Daniel Keum, an assistant professor of management at Columbia Business School. ""AI is able to actually outperform us in learning and adapting. So that we have not seen before in any technologies."" Keum believes the impact of AI will stretch across industries. The issue has already taken center stage in Hollywood, where Writers Guild of America members went on strike this week for the first time in 16 years. Among the demands from the more than 11,000 WGA writers to the studios is a ban on the use of AI to create feature and television scripts. 


""These more very physical and labor-intensive jobs won't be replaced,"" Keum said. ""But I think ... thinking, analytical, creative skills, these things are actually most exposed to AI at the moment."" The spike in the popularity of AI has raised alarm among some in the tech world, who say that there are ethical issues that still need to be fleshed out. In March, a group of about 1,000 tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, signed a letter calling for a pause on AI development because they believe it poses ""profound risks to society and humanity.""""ChatGPT came on the scene in November, and it's been like a wildfire ever since,"" said Margaret Lilani, vice president of talent solutions at the job search site Upwork.""You have to be smart about it and really look at it as this opportunity,"" Lilani added. ""It is not an 'or' between ChatGPT and humans. It's an 'and.' And when you combine those two together and really harness that potential of utilizing technology to increase your productivity, and really showcase your creativity, it's going to take you that much further.""   


That is a mindset that Rubio has embraced, saying it's not just about adapting in order to survive.  ""Survive and even thrive, I would say,"" Rubio said.

A lot has been written about the dangers of generative AI in recent months and yet everything I’ve seen boils down to three simple arguments, none of which reflects the biggest risk I see headed our way. Before I get into this hidden danger of generative AI, it will be helpful to summarize the common warnings that have been floating around recently:  

The risk to jobs: Generative AI can now produce human-level work products ranging from artwork and essays to scientific reports. This will greatly impact the job market, but I believe it is a manageable risk as job definitions adapt to the power of AI. It will be painful for a period, but not dissimilar from how previous generations adapted to other work-saving efficiencies.  


Risk of fake content: Generative AI can now create human-quality artifacts at scale, including fake and misleading articles, essays, papers and video. Misinformation is not a new problem, but generative AI will allow it to be mass-produced at levels never before seen. This is a major risk, but manageable. That’s because fake content can be made identifiable by either (a) mandating watermarking technologies that identify AI content upon creation, or (b) by deploying AI-based countermeasures that are trained to identify AI content after the fact. 


Risk of sentient machines: Many researchers worry that AI systems will get scaled up to a level where they develop a “will of their own” and will take actions that conflict with human interests, or even threaten human existence. I believe this is a genuine long-term risk. In fact, I wrote a “picture book for adults” entitled Arrival Mind a few years ago that explores this danger in simple terms. Still, I do not believe that current AI systems will spontaneously become sentient without major structural improvements to the technology. So, while this is a real danger for the industry to focus on, it’s not the most urgent risk that I see before us. 

So, what concerns me most about the rise of generative AI? 
From my perspective, the place where most safety experts go wrong, including policymakers, is that they view generative AI primarily as a tool for creating traditional content at scale. While the technology is quite skilled at cranking out articles, images and videos, the more important issue is that generative AI will unleash an entirely new form of media that is highly personalized, fully interactive and potentially far more manipulative than any form of targeted content we have faced to date.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Welcome to the age of interactive generative media 
The most dangerous feature of generative AI is not that it can crank out fake articles and videos at scale, but that it can produce interactive and adaptive content that is customized for individual users to maximize persuasive impact. In this context, interactive generative media can be defined as targeted promotional material that is created or modified in real time to maximize influence objectives based on personal data about the receiving user.
This will transform “targeted influence campaigns” from buckshot aimed at broad demographic groups to heat-seeking missiles that can zero in on individual persons for optimal effect. And as described below, this new form of media is likely to come in two powerful flavors, “targeted generative advertising”  and “targeted conversational influence.”
Targeted generative advertising is the use of images, videos and other forms of informational content that look and feel like traditional ads but are personalized in real time for individual users. These ads will be created on the fly by generative AI systems based on influence objectives provided by third-party sponsors in combination with personal data accessed for the specific user being targeted. The personal data may include the user’s age, gender and education level, combined with their interests, values, aesthetic sensibilities, purchasing tendencies, political affiliations and cultural biases.  advertisement
In response to the influence objectives and targeting data, the generative AI will customize the layout, feature images and promotional messaging to maximize effectiveness on that user. Everything down to the colors, fonts and punctuation could be personalized along with the age, race and clothing styles of any people shown in the imagery. Will you see video clips of urban scenes or rural scenes? Will it be set in the fall or spring? Will you see images of sports cars or family vans? Every detail could be customized in real time by generative AI to maximize the subtle impact on you personally.
And because tech platforms can track user engagement, the system will learn which tactics work best on you over time, discovering the hair colors and facial expressions that best draw your attention.
If this seems like science fiction, consider this: Both Meta and Google have recently announced plans to use generative AI in the creation of online ads. If these tactics produce more clicks for sponsors, they will become standard practice and an arms race will follow, with all major platforms competing to use generative AI to customize promotional content in the most effective ways possible.    
This brings me to targeted conversational influence, a generative technique in which influence objectives are conveyed through interactive conversation rather than traditional documents or videos.  advertisement
The conversations will occur through chatbots (like ChatGPT and Bard) or through voice-based systems powered by similar large language models (LLMs). Users will encounter these “conversational agents” many times throughout their day, as third-party developers will use APIs to integrate LLMs into their websites, apps and interactive digital assistants.
For example, you might access a website looking for the latest weather forecast, engaging conversationally with an AI agent to request the information. In the process, you could be targeted with conversational influence — subtle messaging woven into the dialog with promotional goals. 
As conversational computing becomes commonplace in our lives, the risk of conversational influence will greatly expand, as paying sponsors could inject messaging into the dialog that we may not even notice.  And like targeted generative ads, the messaging goals requested by sponsors will be used in combination with personal data about the targeted user to optimize impact.
The data could include the user’s age, gender and education level combined with personal interests, hobbies, values, etc., thereby enabling real-time generative dialog that is designed to optimally appeal to that specific person.
Why use conversational influence? 
If you’ve ever worked as a salesperson, you probably know that the best way to persuade a customer is not to hand them a brochure, but to engage them in face-to-face dialog so you can pitch them on the product, hear their reservations and adjust your arguments as needed. It’s a cyclic process of pitching and adjusting that can “talk them into” a purchase.
While this has been a purely human skill in the past, generative AI can now perform these steps, but with greater skill and deeper knowledge to draw upon. 
And while a human salesperson has only one persona, these AI agents will be digital chameleons that can adopt any speaking style, from nerdy or folksy to suave or hip, and can pursue any sales tactic, from befriending the customer to exploiting their fear of missing out. And because these AI agents will be armed with personal data, they could mention the right musical artists or sports teams to ease you into friendly dialog.
In addition, tech platforms could document how well prior conversations worked to persuade you, learning what tactics are most effective on you personally. Do you respond to logical appeals or emotional arguments? Do you seek the biggest bargain or the highest quality? Are you swayed by time-pressure discounts or free add-ons? Platforms will quickly learn to pull all your strings.
Of course, the big threat to society is not the optimized ability to sell you a pair of pants. The real danger is that the same techniques will be used to drive propaganda and misinformation, talking you into false beliefs or extreme ideologies that you might otherwise reject. A conversational agent, for example, could be directed to convince you that a perfectly safe medication is a dangerous plot against society. And because AI agents will have access to an internet full of information, they could cherry-pick evidence in ways that would overwhelm even the most knowledgeable human.
This creates an asymmetric power balance often called the AI manipulation problem in which we humans are at an extreme disadvantage, conversing with artificial agents that are highly skilled at appealing to us, while we have no ability to “read” the true intentions of the entities we’re talking to. 
Unless regulated, targeted generative ads and targeted conversational influence will be powerful forms of persuasion in which users are outmatched by an opaque digital chameleon that gives off no insights into its thinking process but is armed with extensive data about our personal likes, wants and tendencies, and has access to unlimited information to fuel its arguments.
For these reasons, I urge regulators, policymakers and industry leaders to focus on generative AI as a new form of media that is interactive, adaptive, personalized and deployable at scale. Without meaningful protections, consumers could be exposed to predatory practices that range from subtle coercion to outright manipulation.

If companies are not using AI and machine learning, their risk of becoming obsolete increases exponentially. That observation was made back in 2020 by my former teacher, now colleague, at the University of California, Berkeley, the AI expert Alberto Todeschini. AI's value to business has only become more evident over the years, as I have collaborated with distinguished enterprises.







AI algorithms can help sharpen decision-making, make predictions in real time and save companies hours of time by automating key business workflows. They can improve customer service, bubble up new ideas and bring other business benefits -- but only if organizations understand how AI algorithms work, know which type is best suited to the problem at hand and take steps to minimize AI risks.
Let's begin the work of understanding AI algorithms.

What is an AI algorithm?
AI algorithms are a set of instructions or rules that enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions based on that knowledge. These algorithms can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, problem-solving and decision-making.
It is important in any discussion of AI algorithms to also underscore the value of the using the right data and not so much the amount of data in the training of algorithms. We'll dive into why quality data testing is so critical. With that said, the following are some general types of AI algorithms and their use cases.

The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years







Here is a snapshot of the main types of AI algorithms, techniques to develop them, their applications and chief risks.







Types of AI algorithms
There are three main types of AI algorithms.
1. Supervised learning algorithms. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a labeled data set, where the input data is associated with the correct output. This approach is used for tasks such as classification and regression problems such as linear regression, time-series regression and logistic regression. Supervised learning is used in various applications, such as image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.
Examples of supervised learning algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks.
2. Unsupervised learning algorithms. In unsupervised learning, an area that is evolving quickly due in part to new generative AI techniques, the algorithm learns from an unlabeled data set by identifying patterns, correlations or clusters within the data. This approach is commonly used for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning is used in various applications, such as customer segmentation, image compression and feature extraction.
Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders.
3. Reinforcement learning algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusting its actions to maximize the cumulative rewards. This approach is commonly used for tasks like game playing, robotics and autonomous vehicles.
Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action) and policy gradients.


Algorithms have been around for thousands of years
Derived from the name of the ninth-century Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, the term algorithm has been in use for thousands of years to denote a detailed set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or completing a task.
The ancient Greeks, for example, developed mathematical algorithms for calculating square roots and finding prime numbers.
In the computer age, the availability of massive amounts of digital data is changing how we think about algorithms and the types and complexity of the problems computer algorithms can be trained to solve.




Techniques used in AI algorithms
There are several techniques that are widely used in AI algorithms, including the following:

Machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI and is the most prevalent approach for training AI algorithms. ML uses statistical methods to enable machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms, as explained above, can be broadly classified into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Common machine learning techniques include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks.
Deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers (think ResNet50) to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Popular deep learning techniques include convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.
Natural language processing. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP techniques enable machines to understand, interpret and generate human language in textual and spoken forms. Common NLP techniques include sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition and machine translation.



General applications and use cases for AI algorithms
AI algorithms have numerous applications across all industries, making it safe to say that the state of AI is near-ubiquitous in business. The following are some examples of AI's reach: Healthcare. AI algorithms can assist in diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized medicine and remote patient monitoring. In healthcare, AI algorithms can help doctors and healthcare professionals make better decisions by providing insights from large amounts of data. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to identify anomalies or predict disease progression.
Finance. AI is used for fraud detection, credit scoring, algorithmic trading and financial forecasting. In finance, AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of financial data to identify patterns or anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity. AI algorithms can also help banks and financial institutions make better decisions by providing insight into customer behavior or market trends.
Retail and e-commerce. AI enables personalized recommendations, inventory management and customer service automation. In retail and e-commerce, AI algorithms can analyze customer behavior to provide personalized recommendations or optimize pricing. AI algorithms can also help automate customer service by providing chat functions.


The rise of LLMs
Large language models, a type of AI system based on deep learning algorithms, have been built on massive amounts of data to generate amazingly human-sounding language, as users of ChatGPT and interfaces of other LLMs know.
As of this article, LLMs have mainly been built on general platforms by the big tech companies. But customization is happening -- for example, BloombergGPT just created its own finance LLM.
We forecast that LLMs will quickly become industry specific and even hyper-localized to highly specific audiences. Let's say a company is targeting a group of senior citizens. Or maybe you wanted to communicate in a different era? The LLMs would be able to speak their language in the exact tone and terminology they are accustomed to. It's hard for humans to do this.




The need for responsible AI
It's important to understand the full scope and potential of AI algorithms. These algorithms enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions based on that knowledge. They are widely used across all industries and have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives. However, as we integrate AI into more aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and challenges to ensure responsible AI adoption.
One of the biggest ethical concerns with AI algorithms is bias. If the data used to train the algorithm is biased, the algorithm will likely produce biased results. This can lead to discrimination and unfair treatment of certain groups. It is crucial to ensure that AI algorithms are unbiased and do not perpetuate existing biases or discrimination.
Another ethical concern with AI algorithms is privacy. As AI algorithms collect and analyze large amounts of data, it is important to ensure that individuals' privacy is protected. This includes ensuring that sensitive information is not being used inappropriately and that individuals' data is not being used without their consent.
To address these ethical concerns and challenges, various doctrines of ethical-based AI have been developed, including those set by the White House. These doctrines outline principles for responsible AI adoption, such as transparency, fairness, accountability and privacy.
In addition to ethical considerations, many high-level executives are considering a pause on AI-driven solutions. This is due to the speed at which algorithms are evolving and the plethora of use cases. It is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and risks of AI algorithms before implementing them.
As a data scientist, it is important to stay up to date with the latest developments in AI algorithms and to understand their potential applications and limitations. By understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI algorithms, data scientists can make informed decisions about how best to leverage these powerful tools.

The global COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns for most people except essential workers and then cautious, partial returns to work or job losses in industries that never fully recovered. Almost immediately, this was followed by the disruption of war in Ukraine and soaring energy and food prices, causing a decline in real wages. Technology adoption, already accelerating before and during the pandemic, potentially poses a new wave of transformation, especially to white-collar work through the rise of generative AI. And now a strong push for a much-needed green transformation is also leading to expectations of future displacement in carbon-intensive roles in favour of growth in emerging green jobs and skills. Each new change alone would be difficult for affected workers to navigate, but together they have disrupted livelihoods broadly and created widespread uncertainty about the future. When uncertainty is this high, forecasting can help, not to generate firm predictions, but to provide ways of thinking about the challenges ahead and preparing better for the multiple futures that may unfold. The Future of Jobs Report 2023The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, released today, assesses the impact of macro trends, as well as technological change on jobs and skills over the next five years. The report finds that nearly a quarter of all jobs (23%) globally will change in the next five years. Across 45 economies, covering 673 million workers, 69 million new jobs are expected to be created and 83 million to be eliminated, a net decrease of 14 million jobs, or 2% of current employment. Investment in the green transition, as well as increasing consumer awareness of sustainability issues will create new opportunities. Roles from renewable energy engineers, solar energy installation and systems engineers to sustainability specialists and environmental protection professionals will be in high demand, translating to a growth of approximately one million jobs. Agriculture and education are jobs growth areasThe largest absolute gains in jobs will come from education (3 million jobs) and agriculture (4 million jobs), driven in part by demographics and in part by applications of new technologies in these fields. The new economic geography created by shifting supply chains and a greater focus on resilience over efficiency is also expected to create net job growth, with wins for economies in Asia and the Middle East especially.Technology will create structural churn, with a quarter of companies seeing job decline from new technology adoption and more than half seeing job growth. But the human-machine frontier is shifting to new terrain. While expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, tasks requiring reasoning, communicating and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future.  Image: World Economic ForumThis is not surprising. Generative artificial intelligence is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and is second only to humanoid and industrial robots in terms of expectations of job losses, most likely to affect bank tellers, cashiers, clerks, secretaries and accounting. Yet, the biggest threat to jobs is still seen to come not from technology, but from slowing economic growth, the rising costs of inputs and weaker purchasing power among consumers. Have you read?The future of jobs is green: How climate change is changing labour marketsHow pay transparency can help close wage gaps in the workplaceReskilling on the riseWe also find that almost half of an individual’s skills - 44% - will need to change on average across all jobs. The skills with the highest share of companies reporting growing demand include analytical and creative thinking, followed by technological literacy, curiosity and lifelong learning, resilience and flexibility, systems thinking and AI and big data. Skills with less demand include global citizenship, sensory processing abilities and manual dexterity, endurance and precision.For many individuals, the concurrent shift in the wider economic environment, the integration of new technologies at work and the expectation of future uncertainty translates into frustration with current job prospects, fear about future ones and despair about growing economic disparity in the future. For many companies, there is concern about the talent required to thrive in the new context: 60% of companies are concerned about skills gaps and 54% worry about being able to attract talent. And for governments, particularly those that underinvested in education and lifelong learning systems thus far, human capital will become the key impediment to navigating the new economic landscape. Preparing for the future of jobsHow then should learners, workers, employers and governments prepare for the future of jobs?In a technology-intensive, greener and potentially deglobalizing world, local skills development will matter more than ever. For today’s students, analytical and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to understand and work with technology will be critical. Every student – regardless of their chosen fields – should aim to build these generalist skills to be ready for a rapidly changing future. For today’s workers in declining fields, there is a major reskilling and transition effort needed, whereas for those in changing or growing fields, there is a need for upskilling and developing the ability for constant learning. The good news is that skilling can happen fast and online learning can offer a level playing field: workers from all education levels – including those without college or graduate education – take the same time to acquire online skill credentials. Yet, it cannot be on individual learners and workers alone to negotiate complex new terrain. Governments must provide resources and a roadmap. This presents a major and unprecedented dual challenge for policymaking: governments must balance support for innovation with the regulation needed to make new technologies safe and, at the same time, support workers through safety nets, care systems and job centres, while making major investments in skilling systems, rapid certifications and partnerships with the education sector, businesses and non-profits alike, to drive change at scale. Employers must play a partEmployers must play their part through investment in reskilling and upskilling – most expect to see a return on investment within one year, making training the most effective and responsible course of action. The best employers go further: supporting workers’ transitions outside the company when required, prioritising safety and well-being, fostering diversity, equity and inclusion and, finally, placing a premium on taking a skills-first approach over one that prioritises qualifications or job history. Employers that take these actions close skills gaps faster and are proven to enhance loyalty, productivity and motivation.Share of organizations surveyed planning to adopt these workforce strategies. Image: World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Report 2023At the World Economic Forum, we provide the Reskilling Revolution platform to help one billion people in the global workforce with the skills needed to future-proof their careers by 2030. These partnerships have reached more than 350 million people since launching in 2020. But more such efforts are needed and at greater speed and scale. There is no doubt that the future of work will be disruptive. But it need not be dystopian. Instead, it can be an opportunity to lay the foundations for putting people firmly at the centre of the new global economy.Read the Future of Jobs Report 2023 here.

Large Language Models (LLMs), the technologies underpinning chatbots like ChatGPT, are creating cascading waves of emerging paradigm-shifting opportunities by redefining how we accumulate, organize, and disseminate knowledge-based information. Within a week of the ChatGPT launch, one million people had used it; within two months, the number soared to 100 million. The hockey stick adoption rate is being hailed as a game-changing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based productivity enhancement technology. Global competition amongst entrepreneurs and investors is hastily deploying Research and Development (R&D) resources to create cutting-edge AI-based productivity tools for a gamut of industries. Early users of the nascent ChatGPT are amazed at its ability to deliver work products at near-human levels of sophistication.


We are just at the tip of the iceberg. The benefits and impact of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT on industries have only begun to occur, harbingering generational job role shifts. By consolidating the knowledge of the collective, these tools can unleash substantial productivity gains and accelerate growth. With the ability to produce content on command, these productivity enhancement tools are expected to deliver work products more quickly and efficiently than ever. The hybrid human/AI mix offers exciting possibilities for the future of work. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%.

While ChatGPT has aroused a lot of excitement, it has also elicited ominous projections of potential job losses; subliminal messaging through biased responses; usage for malicious propaganda and harmful activities; taking over of the human race, and more. However, machines replacing jobs is an age-old fear. New technologies have historically created jobs to replace the ones obsoleted. Unlike prior technology innovations that have typically replaced unskilled labor, Generative AI can also undertake white-collar tasks. While there is no indication of disruption in job markets, it cannot be completely ruled out.

PROMOTED
By analyzing and interpreting vast repositories of data, AI can provide valuable assistance to individuals working in tech (coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts, etc.), media (advertising, content creation, journalism, entertainment, etc.), legal (paralegals, legal assistants, etc.), market research, medical, education, gig economy/freelancing, liberal arts, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), gaming, finance, security/defense, environment/climate change, and many more.

With the help of Generative AI coding assistants, engineers can write code more efficiently, potentially paving the way for a future in which, rather than writing code themselves, software engineers will concentrate on instructing AI tools to write code. The primary focus could morph into qualifying work products produced by machines. These new working models will have applications across many fields. Using Generative AI tools to quickly create a first draft, after that, for a human to further correct, enhance, and deliver the final product in shorter task completion times, can significantly boost worker productivity across many job roles. Task-based programming, writing, and research dominate the freelance gig economy job market. The advent of productivity-enhancing Generative AI tools could have significant implications for the freelancing job market segment.

Calls for a global summit on AI regulationThe rapid advance of generative AI tools has drawn the attention of regulators around the world. Political bodies and policy-makers are accelerating efforts to put laws in place controlling the potential risks of AI and making developers accountable for the actions of their systems. A group of EU lawmakers working on AI legislation is calling for a global summit to find ways to control the development of advanced AI systems, according to reports from Reuters. The 12 European Parliament members have urged US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to convene a meeting of world leaders.The World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution convened leading industry, academic and government experts to explore generative AI systems' technical, ethical and societal implications at a three-day meeting in San Francisco.In an article published on Project Syndicate, the Forum's Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab and I explained how all stakeholders must work together ""to devise ways to mitigate negative externalities and deliver safer, more sustainable, and more equitable outcomes."" Research shows that efforts to regulate AI appear to be gathering pace. Stanford University's 2023 AI Index shows 37 AI-related bills were passed into law globally in 2022. The US led the push for regulation, passing nine laws, followed by Spain with five and the Philippines with four. Legislative bodies in 127 countries passed AI-related laws in 2022. Image: Stanford University 2023 AI Index The European Commission proposed draft rules for an AI Act nearly two years ago. It is expected to classify AI tools according to their perceived level of risk, from low to unacceptable. There are also reports that the European Data Protection Board has set up a task force on ChatGPT, in a first step towards possible regulation on privacy around AI. The US is also acting on potential accountability measures for AI systems as questions loom about the impact on national security and education. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration wants to know if there are measures that could be put in place to provide assurance ""that AI systems are legal, effective, ethical, safe, and otherwise trustworthy"", Reuters reports.OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, says it is collaborating with policy-makers ""to ensure that AI systems are developed in a trustworthy manner"".Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies2. Workers more productive when paired with AI, says MIT study Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University have been looking into the productivity of workers using generative AI to help them with their work. The study, which assessed the performance of more than 5,000 customer support agents, showed workers were on average 14% more productive when using generative AI tools.Customer service agents working with AI were able to handle 14% more issues per hour.  Image: Stanford University/MIT/NBERPairing workers with an AI assistant proved much more effective with novice and low-skilled employees, according to the research. The technology's impact on highly skilled staff was minimal.A broader study by the Pew Research Center found that 62% of Americans believe AI will have a major impact on jobs over the next 20 years. Their biggest concern is the use of AI in hiring and firing processes, which 77% of respondents are opposed to.Integrating generative AI into the workforce of the future will be a key topic at the World Economic Forum's Growth Summit, taking place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 2-3 May 2023. Sessions on reskilling workforces and how to align education systems with industry demand for AI talent will form a central part of the discussions.

News in brief: AI stories from around the worldA news agency in Kuwait has introduced online viewers to an AI newsreader who may become the face of its news bulletins. The Guardian reports that the virtual presenter's first words, spoken in Arabic, were: “I’m Fedha, the first presenter in Kuwait who works with artificial intelligence at Kuwait News. What kind of news do you prefer? Let’s hear your opinions.” Kuwait News published the presenter's first appearance on Twitter. But the use of AI in the news media is likely to prove controversial as there are well-documented cases of AI delivering inaccurate information. There are also concerns about AI being used to spread disinformation.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesThe health sector is one area where AI is already being used to improve patient care and outcomes, as we have reported previously. Now an Israeli health-tech company is using AI to match patients with the most effective drugs to treat depression, according to a report from the BBC. The process, which combines stem cell technology with AI, helps to cut the risk of side effects and make sure the treatment is as effective as possible. The US Homeland Security Agency will create a task force to develop its approach to using artificial intelligence, according to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. AI could be used in roles from protecting critical infrastructure to screening cargo. Mayorkas said the technology would ""drastically alter the threat landscape,"" adding: ""Our department will lead in the responsible use of AI to secure the homeland and in defending against the malicious use of this transformational technology.""The University of California, Berkeley School of Law is among the first educational institutions to adopt a formal policy on student use of generative AI. The policy limits students to using AI to conduct research or correct grammar, and says it may not be used in exams or to compose assignments. The rules also forbid the use of AI in any way that constitutes plagiarism. “The approach of finals made us realize that we had to say something,"" said Professor Chris Hoofnagle. ""We want to make sure we have clear guidelines so that students don’t inadvertently attract an honour code violation.”4.

Here's what you need to knowChatGPT and cheating: 5 ways to change how students are gradedHere's what Americans think about generative AI like ChatGPT and DALL-EThe Future of Jobs Report 2023Dialogue on the future of work and education has long emphasized the importance of developing skills and values that are uniquely human and less likely to be replaced by technology. The rise of ChatGPT is yet another proof point. Most students and teachers agree that ChatGPT is “just another example of why we can’t keep doing things the old way for schools in the modern world”. (Although please note that this blog was written in the ""old way"" as an interactive collaboration between humans, and not generated by AI.)How AI tools can help educators and studentsOur hope is that the advent of AI will spur educators, students, parents, and policy-makers to come together to consider what skills our students really need to navigate uncertainty, solve complex challenges and shape meaningful futures in a changing economy. This means embracing the challenge to provide learning that fosters agency, awareness, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, connectedness, and well-being. We already see that AI tools deployed by well-trained and well-supported teachers can be invaluable for accelerating progress towards this vision.AI can help foster the skills students will need to navigate and shape the future. Tools like ChatGPT, as Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek and Elias Blinkoff argue, can help promote students’ critical thinking when used in sophisticated ways for deeper, more engaged learning. Vriti Saraf, CEO and founder of K20 Educators, in New York, agrees: “The less students need educators to be the main source of knowledge, the more educators can focus on developing the ability to curate, guide, critically assess learning, and help students gain skills that are so much more important than memorizing information.”Teachers work about 50 hours a week, spending less than half of the time in direct interaction with students. Image: McKinsey 2020Noting the increased importance of social-emotional learning, Henry May, CEO of Co-School in Bogota, Colombia, notes that teachers have an essential role in shaping childhood experiences away from screens. So, ""teachers must be trained on how to educate students on ethical principles; how to use AI tools appropriately; and how to mitigate the potential risk of AI to reduce human connection and belonging and increase loneliness.""Another potential benefit is that AI can free up time in the classroom. Teachers often cite unmanageable administrative tasks as their greatest source of exhaustion and burnout. By automating routine administrative tasks, AI could help streamline teacher workflows, giving them more time to build relationships with students and foster their learning and development. Technology can help teachers reallocate 20-30% of their time toward activities that support student learning.

In Lagos, Nigeria, teachers are beginning to see the efficiency and ease that AI brings to their work. Oluwaseun Kayode, who taught in Lagos and founded Schoolinka, is currently seeing an increasing number of teachers from across West Africa using AI to identify children’s literacy levels, uncover where students are struggling, and deepen personalized learning experiences. In the US state of Illinois, a similar pattern is seen where Diego Marin, an 8th-grade math teacher, likens ChatGPT to “a personalized 1:1 tutor that is super valuable for students.”DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Summary: Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—AI systems that produce novel text, images, and music from simple user prompts—has important applications in many fields, including entertainment, education, health care, and retail. However, exaggerated and misleading concerns about the tool’s potential to cause harm have crowded out reasonable discussion about the technology, generating a familiar, yet unfortunate, “tech panic.” Until the hysteria dissipates, policymakers should hit pause on any new legislation or regulations directly targeting generative AI.

Introduction
Significant technological changes inevitably disrupt the economy and society, and the potential for major change induces both inflated fears and expectations. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI)—a branch of computer science that studies computer systems that perform operations previously requiring human intelligence—have heightened imaginations about what the future holds. AI doomsayers predict job destruction, declining human intelligence, loss of privacy, algorithmic manipulation, and, sometimes, the end of humanity.1
Fears about AI have reached new levels because of the emergence of generative AI. Generative AI—a novel tool that can produce complex text, images, and videos from simple inputs—promises to democratize the creative sector and enable entirely new forms of creativity. This novelty has impressed technology enthusiasts but alarmed many others—especially those who believe AI is encroaching on creativity, which many people believe to be an essential difference that separates humans from machines.
Yet, technology and human creativity have long been intertwined, and fears about the negative impact of new innovations have been overstated in the past. For example, prior innovations in the music sector led to fears that record albums would make live shows redundant or that radio would destroy the record industry or that sampling and other means of digital editing would undermine musical artistry. But these concerns never arrived. Over time, this and other tech panics fizzled out as the public embraced the new technology, markets adapted, and initial concerns turned out to be clearly overblown or never arrived.
The fears around new technologies follow a predictable trajectory called “the Tech Panic Cycle.”2 Fears increase, peak, then decline over time as the public becomes familiar with the technology and its benefits. Indeed, other previous “generative” technologies in the creative sector such as the printing press, the phonograph, and the Cinématographe followed this same course. But unlike today, policymakers were unlikely to do much to regulate and restrict these technologies. As the panic over generative AI enters its most volatile stage, policymakers should take a deep breath, recognize the predictable cycle we are in, and put any regulation efforts directly aimed at generative AI temporarily on hold.
Four Stages of the Tech Panic Cycle
The merits of encouraging or curbing any new technology depend on the available use cases and potential harm. While many accept this premise, alarmists only imagine catastrophic risks or prefer the state of technology as it is. Many alarmists have an incentive to find or exaggerate a reason for alarm because doing so attracts funding for their advocacy. These actors begin to seed panic when new technology arrives, setting off a chain reaction that soon erupts into frenzy.
As the public begins to use and become familiar with a new tool, it soon becomes clear the alarmists exaggerated the risks or misled the public about their concerns. Panic starts subsiding, and the media slowly lose attention (though they rarely correct the record). As the innovation becomes mainstream, only the alarmists are left dispensing sporadic and less attractive concerns before eventually moving on to new technologies. This pattern constitutes the Tech Panic Cycle (see figure 1).
Figure 1: The Tech Panic Cycle3

The cycle charts four stages: Trusting Beginnings, Rising Panic, Deflating Fears, and Moving On.
Stage 1: Trusting Beginnings
At the beginning of the cycle, knowledge of the new creative tool is limited to those who invented it, innovators in the field, commentators, and domain experts. Engineers are still figuring out its potential and innovators are considering commercial use cases. Fears remain low because the tool is neither well known nor widely used.
But doomsayers soon catch wind of the new tool and raise the alarm. Since alarmists cannot pinpoint where the device is misused, they target imaginary harms rather than real ones. For example, AccessNow recently claimed that Microsoft trained Vall-E, a generative AI tool not yet public, by secretly listening to Teams’ users.4 If true, this would justify anxieties about the power and willingness of AI companies to deceive their users. But the claim was false: Vall-E’s used Libri-Light, a publicly available collection of audio archives, for the training data.5
When the impact of new generative technology is more tangible, such as its place in the workforce, alarmists often mislead by using needlessly emotional rhetoric.6 This rhetoric inevitably proves false but serves to frighten many. Since the public understanding of new technology at the Trusting Beginnings stage is so primitive, the public and media often accept claims of the technology’s destructive potential. This moment marks the point of panic.
Stage 2: Rising Panic
Fears spread quickly among alarmist networks and those who have the ear of policymakers. At the Rising Panic stage, policymakers susceptible to hot-button issues legitimize the fears by repeating them in legislative drafts, hearings, and public speeches and statements. Legacy industry, which feels threatened, often leads the charge. Unable to resist an opportunity to write sensationalist content, journalists cannot help but pile in with well-rewarded clickbait coverage.
At the Rising Panic stage, dystopian rhetoric achieves greater attention and sweeps away consumers’ initial optimism about a new tool. The media ecosystem becomes so saturated with overblown fears that only the most outrageous claims remain. Fears eventually reach an apex at the end of the Rising Panic stage: the height of hysteria.
Stage 3: Deflating Fears
The Deflating Fears stage dawns when the public embraces the new tool and accepts its merit. By this stage, it is clear that many fears will never materialize. Disturbed by the growing popularity of new technology, alarmists continue to incite panic but fail to gain traction as before. Occasional scandals and new features cause micropanics, but the public is now less easily fooled. The point of practicality marks the end of this stage. Society integrates the new technology, and people no longer believe the doomsayers.
Stage 4: Moving On
The tech apocalypse never arrives. At the Moving On stage, previous fears are exposed and ridiculed (in some cases by the same people who first raised the alarm.) Wired’s alarmist article in 2000, “Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us,” was followed up eight years later by the more measured, “Why the Future Still Needs Us A While Longer.”7 Once-feared tools are normalized and cooler heads lead policy conversations. Alarmists have turned their attention to the latest shiny technology hype by this stage. New panics crowd out the old. And the cycle repeats.
Examples of Previous Tech Panics in the Creative Sector
Advances in technology have resulted in tech panics for printed books, recorded sound, and motion pictures. The invention of the printing press and advances in paper technology created a tech panic for printed books; the invention of the phonograph and a means to store sound portably such as the record created a tech panic over recorded sound; and innovations in photography and film materials created the tech panic for motion pictures. And so it is with generative AI: Advances in machine learning algorithms and computing capacity have created a tech panic for generative AI.
These creative tools—printed books, recorded sounds, motion pictures, and generative AI—share three traits. First, each has a range of functions. Recorded sound, for example, is used to broadcast news, to signal instructions, or as music to entertain. Printed books contain everything from scientific treatises and classic literature to pornographic works and vile calls for genocide. Second, each presents to the public new types of content. Motion pictures, for example, brought to life scenes and settings unavailable through still photographs or written accounts. Third, each greatly broadens the availability of content by disrupting its price of production. New, cheaper forms of literary content, for example, emerged as the price of printing books plummeted.
In each panic, an innovation in the creative sector makes it much easier to produce new content. Some people, especially incumbents and elites, tend to fear the implications of this new content and concern reaches a boiling point as policymakers and alarmists work together to slow its progress, with news media unable to resist the drama. Eventually, however, the public embraces the tools and moves on.
Printed Books
Printed books changed the way people share information. Indeed, the printing press facilitated the mass production of all kinds of written materials including books, newspapers, and pamphlets. Before its invention, written material had to be printed or copied by hand: a fraught, laborious process that limited the distribution of knowledge to a minority that could afford it. Johannes Gutenberg first mechanized the writing process in the 14th century, making it possible to produce copies of written material quickly and cheaply.8
In the Trusting Beginnings stage, when the printing press was prohibitively expensive, the sparse literate class welcomed the tool as a means to share and receive knowledge—and books became a status symbol.9 But monks, who held an effective monopoly on handwriting books, fretted. “He who ceases from zeal for writing because of printing is no true lover of the Scriptures,” declared the 15th century abbot Johannes Trithemius, defending the work of scribes against those who used the new technology.10 However, fears remained low as printing remained rare.
But advances in printing and paper technology led to more books. Europe, for example, printed more in the 18th century than in the three previous combined.11 The 19th century saw yet greater leaps in innovation—the pages that could be printed per hour increased from 480 at the beginning of the century to 2,400 just decades later (to 90,000 by the century’s end.)12 These advances plummeted the price of books and sparked concerns about the effect of the printing press on society. As English poet and literary critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge lamented in his influential Biographia Literaria (1817), “[T]he multitude of books and the general diffusion of literature, have produced other and more lamentable effects
in the world of letters;” that books once respected as “religious oracles” have “degraded into culprits to hold up their hands at the bar of every
self-elected … judge.”13 The fear that those without status or formal training could gain power and influence through writing—a fear familiar in the Internet era—spread quickly and marked the point of panic.
As the use of the printing press proliferated, many became particularly worried about the reading of novels. “In the creation of fiction, we could lose the bitterness and barrenness of truth!” lamented an early 19th-century author, Sinclair Hamilton, while the Augusta Herald warned that novels led people into “an enchanted country … They corrupt all principles.”14 The ability to generate content so freely disturbed alarmists.
During the Rising Panic stage, Saint James’s Chronicle (1822) deplored that “profligate writers” were seducing “a greater number of Book-sellers into the publication of books of an evil tendency,” and the Leicestershire Mercury warned against the easy distribution of novels in 1847: “The multitude of books is a great evil. There is no measure or limit to this fever for writing; every one must be an author; some out of vanity, to acquire celebrity, and raise up a name; others for the sake of lucre and gain.”15 In 1889, academic and generative tech alarmist John Meiklejohn delivered a speech, “Literature versus Books,” in which he proclaimed that “the disease of the age was distraction, hurry, interest in far too many things, with the consequence result of mental indigestion and muddle-headedness.”16 The concern that there was too much content widely available, owing to advances in technology, foreshadows each subsequent tech panic.
And as with many tech panics, alarmists made fanciful proclamations about the subversion of the youth. Technological advances spawned a new genre of cheap novels—”dime novels,” ”flash literature,” or ”pulp fiction”’—which ramped up hysteria. In his essay, Concerning printed poison (1885), prominent writer Josiah W. Leeds noted the “evil effect of ‘flash literature’” on the youth: its “dreadful and pernicious influence of the cheap novels which abound in our midst,” and those public libraries “have weakly succumbed to the craving for fiction, even to the extent of supplying trashy, vapid, and often immoral works.”17
At this moment, only outrageous claims could survive. As figure 2 shows, critics held novels responsible for homicides, suicides, and “depraved sentiments.”18 The Courier-Post, for example, described a 16-year-old girl, Cecile Guimaraes, whose father forbade her the attention of young men, which in turn drove her to suicide. But, the paper claims, it was not her father’s austerity that caused her anguish, nor a mental illness, but rather “sentimental novels.” Meanwhile, the Boston Globe wrote in 1884 a story about two 14-year-old boys who had deserted their homes after reading dime novels, and the Saint Paul Globe published an article on “Dime Novel Victims” to describe an instance when an 11-year-old was sent to the “asylum for the insane” for repeating lines from a novel he was reading.19 “The paralyzing effect of the false notions instilled in the plastic and easily wounded minds of the boys is little realized,” “What is your boy reading?” the paper warned.20 This era of concern marked the height of hysteria.
Figure 2: The height of hysteria, 1863–189721

However, as literacy rates grew and the prices of books continued to fall, hysteria surrounding novels began to subside. Many of the fears, helped by the spread of scientific knowledge, were understood to be false and authorities eventually conceded that books were not to blame for social ills.22 In the early 20th century, alarmists had to resort to less-interesting concerns, such as the dangers of “reading in bed” rather than novels in and of themselves.23 Eventually, even alarmists conceded that novels had many more positive effects than negative. By 1952, The Vancouver Sun was lamenting that a third of UK children could not read, blaming “movies, TV, radio.”24
Although the Moving On stage had dawned, lingering fears persisted and aversions resurfaced with later innovations in written materials. For example, in the 21st century, the legacy publishing industry denounced e-books as “a stupid product,” complaining about its lack of creativity.25
Recorded Sound
Recorded sound forever changed the enjoyment of music, as it became cheaper to listen to, produce, distribute, and share. Devices that could record sound emerged in the middle of the 19th century, and—after Thomas Edison’s invention in 1877—by its end, commercially viable phonographs started to sell to the public at large.26 Foundations produced “talking books” for those who were illiterate or blind.27
This meant music entered people’s homes in ways unimagined before—and, at the turn of the century, alarmists started to take note. The New York Times warned in 1878 that such recording devices would censor homes—“Who will be willing even in the bosom of his family to express any but the most innocuous and colorless views?”—and gruesomely recommended “something ought to be done to Mr. Edison… there is a growing conviction that it ought to be done with a hemp rope.”28 Initially restricted by technical shortcomings, live music was unthreatened by the new technology and so remained the preferred means of consuming music.
But improvements in recording techniques soon changed this and a new breed of artists emerged that earned income entirely from records. These changes brought about the point of panic. In his 1908 essay titled The Menace of the Mechanical Music, American composer John Philip Sousa lamented recorded sound for degrading the skill of music—“Singing will no longer be a fine accomplishment”—and its quality for damaging romance, discouraging study, and even numbing entrance to war. 29 These overblown concerns unfortunately distract from more legitimate issues Sousa raised in the essay, such as whether reproducing an artist’s composition “a thousandfold on their machines” violates the artist’s intellectual property rights.30
During the Rising Panic stage, the legacy music industry began to fret. In 1930, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), a union, unsuccessfully complained to the Federal Radio Commission to limit the playing of records on air.31 James Patrillo, then leader of AFM, struck fear into musicians with colorful rhetoric, once stating that nowhere “in the mechanical age does the workman create the machine which destroys him, but that’s what happens to the musician when he plays for a recording.”32 The introduction of sound into movies when The Jazz Singer premiered in 1927 and then the invention of the jukebox around 1932—capable of filling hotels, restaurants, and bars with cheaper music—rocketed fears. The New York Times reported in 1928 that “organized musicians the world over are endeavoring to erect barriers against the epidemic of unemployment.”33 Letters to the paper that year also relayed concerns that recordings were degrading the quality of music.34
A more pernicious anxiety during this period was the impact of recorded sound on society’s morals. Since music discovery was no longer limited to what was playing on the radio, the public could seek and share music—it became a creative endeavor. So consumers, especially the young, discovered entirely new genres and new forms of content that concerned their parents—in ways that remain familiar today. Jazz was especially blameworthy. A series of newspaper clippings during the early years of the phonograph reveal an environment of outrageous claims made about jazz, a newly accessible genre of music: “Jazz Music Blamed for Delinquency of Girls Today” (1922), “Jazz Blamed For Large Number Of Deaths By Suicide” (1924), “Jazz Blamed For Murder” (1926), and “Jazz Blamed for Bodily Ailments” (1927).35 In 1927, a physician at the University of Heidelberg ludicrously inferred that “this modern jazz age” was responsible for tooth decay.36 No doubt this tech panic worked in tandem with and fueled a race panic about Black music corrupting society.37 The fearmongering around music content aggravated concerns about job losses and skill degradation, and marked the height of hysteria.
Over the years, however, the public continued assimilating recorded sounds in their daily lives. A 1942 study of 796 radio stations in the United States shows that of radio time devoted to music, 55.9 percent was recorded.38 Although the fears of job displacement were clearly unfounded by this time—recordings did not replace live shows—and exaggerated concerns and overstated anxieties remained. AFM in the United States contended that the “unrestricted commercial use of records” remained a threat to the employment of musicians.39 And in 1942, the union had banned its artists and engineers from recording music, sending shockwaves throughout the United States40 In the United Kingdom, the musicians’ union detailed in its Report of the 1945 Delegate Conference proceedings to “limit the extent to which gramophone records may be used for public entertainment.”41
However, by now, the public had embraced the technology: A poll found 73 percent of Americans wanted legal action taken against the union.42 So, following a hearing with the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, the union agreed to wind down the recording ban in return for royalties for members.43 Hereafter, fears deflated, and the Moving On stage dawned.
New innovations in recorded sound reliably resurrect similar panics. The rise of digital music in the 1970s, and especially disco—one of the first pop genres designed for club venues—led to familiar fears that live musicians would soon be out of a job.44 Music technology, such as sequencers (machines that edit and playback music) and drum machines, are intrinsic to disco’s repetitive characteristics—consider the classic disco record, “I Feel Love” by Donna Summer. But disco’s reliance on technology over live music, and its mechanical and industrial characteristics, disturbed classical musicians. 45 Worst of all, disco was popular. Discotheques and dance venues were seen as a threat to those that played live. But campaigns that responded to the perceived threat of disco records, such as the Keep Music Live campaign, look misguided now.46 Revenues from live music in the United States now dwarf those in the 1970s.47 Instead of undermining the industry, digital technology spawned new categories of music such as electronic dance music (EDM), and a new type of live performer: the “disc jockey” (DJ). For the most part, recorded music has become a widely accepted and celebrated art form, proving that initial fears about new technologies are often exaggerated.
Motion Pictures
At the turn of the 20th century, a new technological marvel was sweeping across Europe: the invention of motion pictures (film). Moving images projected onto a large screen allowed people to experience visual storytelling like never before, and movies became a medium with a mass audience, appealing to the literate and illiterate, adults and children.48 In the United Kingdom, weekly crowds at movie theaters jumped from 7 million in 1914 to 21 million in 1917, dwarfing any other form of spectator entertainment.49 In the United States, the number of nickelodeons—simple theaters that charged attendees 5 cents each—doubled in 1908, and by 1910, around 26 million Americans attended them weekly.50 Between 1911 and 1918, a third of New Yorkers went to the movies once a week; in some cities, residents attended on average more than once a week.51
Technological advances in movie cameras, film stock and projectors meant films could look better and be longer. The Cinématographe, for example, was a portable camera-projector that evolved movie production, as scenes could be shot with a greater variety of locations and methods, and distribution, and as films could be projected in rooms of all sizes to audiences of all sizes, enabling them to become popular around the world.52 The Latham Loop, invented at the end of the 19th century and still used today, carefully threaded film and meant films that were once limited to a novel matter of seconds could become feature-length stories.53 But the realism of films irked alarmists. In 1896, a myth spread that a Parisian audience was so convinced of a black-and-white train was coming toward them that the crowd panicked and a stampede ensued.54
The growing concern was that these new, technologically enabled long narrative films would unduly influence the audience and corrupt their values. Purists once worried about reading now feared giant, realistic motion pictures encouraged immoral behaviors. In a letter to the UK’s Home Office in 1916, the wife of Bramwell Booth, author and then-General of the Salvation Army, warned that films were “more powerful” than “undesirable literature” and their influence “more durable and lasting.”55 French officials were similarly concerned: “Scenes of murder, homicide, suicide, theft, sabotage, criminal activities and attacks, is [sic] too often marked by a desire for realism which has led to the non-exclusion of any detail, however shocking.”56
As panic rose in Europe, the Danish minister of justice legitimized these fears in 1907 by instructing local police chiefs: “Cinemas, cosmoramas and similar establishments including variety theatres, (showing) pictures which may be considered offensive either morally or through the way in which the carrying out of crime is shown or which by their nature are apt to corrupt their audience and especially the young people who are present in great numbers.”57
John Collier, member of the U.S. National Board of Censorship in the 1910s, declared of small movie theatres, “It is an evil pure and simple, destructive of social interchange, and of artistic effect.”58 In 1921, officials in the Var region of France issued an edict on film, which included “some actors of these scenes [that] appear as a special kind of hero which gives to the performance the character of a veritable justification of criminal acts; considering that the cinemas are much frequented by young people; considering that public order and tranquility cannot be maintained, any more than can morality, with this continual instigation of young people to unhealthy exploits.”59
The effect of this content on the youth was widely overblown and served to disparage and patronize young people. This preceded modern panics over violence in video games—where studies show only extremely small effects (averaging 0.4 percent to 3.2 percent) linking violence in video games to minor aggressive behavior, all the while distracting from the main causes of youth violence: educational disparities, mental illness, and poverty.60 Nevertheless, concerns over the appropriate age ratings and warnings for content have merit and remain relevant today. Unfortunately, less-legitimate concerns soon emerged.
Echoing perceptions of “dime novels,” moving pictures were initially considered “lowbrow”—a form of cheap entertainment for the working class rather than for the sophisticated or artistic.61 In 1916, the Guardian lamented that “street urchins and vacuous boys and girls” fill cinema and just “sit and are amused,” while Church Times too warned of the laziness of the new generation: “If Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton—what success in future battles will be due to picture palace performances?”62 Doctors and social workers in the United States warned that theaters caused “a sort of dazed ‘good-for-nothing’ feeling, lack of energy, or appetite.”63
Figure 3: Rising panic, 1912–192064

The concerns about moving pictures reached a fever pitch in the 1920s. At the height of hysteria, politicians were so convinced that moving pictures threatened society that they began heavily regulating their content. In the United States, the Motion Picture Production Code mandated that movies must promote good behavior, respect the state, and uphold “Christian values.”65 The British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), set up in 1913, had two rules—no nudity and no personification of Christ—but, by 1926, had seven, including “questions of sex” and “crime.”66 BBFC infamously banned the gangster film The Public Enemy (1931), while local authorities such as those in Birmingham and Kent went beyond BBFC policy by banning Scarface in 1932.67
Eventually, the tide started to turn. As with “dime novels,” the influence of this new content was greatly overstated. Social ills were understood to be a consequence of society, not technology. An influential study of film’s effect on children called Our Movies Made Children (1935) concludes:
Motion pictures, scarcely a generation old in our experience, have proved themselves to be one of those necessary inventions of mankind whose absence or deletion from our civilization is by now virtually unthinkable. At their best they carry a high potential of value and quality in entertainment, in instruction, in desirable effects upon mental attitudes and ideals, second, perhaps to no medium now known to us. That at their worst they carry the opposite possibilities follows as a natural collar.68
Rather than corrupting the youth, some alarmists-turned-enthusiasts saw the new form of entertainment as a means for the youth to resist the delinquency of the streets. Britain’s Home Secretary Herbert Samuel said in 1916 that “the recent increase in juvenile delinquency is, to a considerable extent, due to demoralising cinematograph films” but, by 1932, the still Home Secretary told the British Parliament that “on the whole the cinema conduces more to the prevention of crime than to its commission … In general, the Home Office’s opinion is that if the cinema had never existed there would probably be more crime than there is rather than less.”69
Though society had moved on from this panic, fears about films’ impact on society have resurfaced with new innovations. For example, there was the “video nasty” panic in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, where the proliferation of home videos, enabled by the video cassette and low-cost filming equipment, was seen by many as a threat to the social order.70 At the height of the panic, when the Daily Mail ran the headline “Ban video sadism now” and described the “Rape of our children’s minds,” the UK parliament made it illegal to supply a video that the British Board of Film Classification had not approved. The censorship laws have since been relaxed, with many of the so-called “nasties” appearing tame today.71 Despite subsequent micropanics, motion pictures are commonplace today, and films are accepted by the masses. Indeed, much of the world now carries a motion picture player in their pocket.
Factors Influencing Tech Panics
Four elements remain influential throughout all tech panics: elitism, legacy industries, antitech crusaders, and news media.
Elitism
What is often so outrageous about new technology is its accessibility to the broader public. In traditional creative industries, only certain elites can produce and create. Innovation disrupts the status quo and democratizes the field, invoking outrage and disdain among the elite. The American “dime-novels,” French “feuilleton,” or British “penny dreadfuls”—terms for a range of affordable literature and magazines—often told working-class stories, lifted working-class protagonists, and were popular among the working class.72 The Wild Boys of London was a classic working-class serial of the age, following the “adventures of poor outcast children.”73 Elites patronized that such literature caused the “demoralization” of the working class.74
Figure 4: The “Wild Boys of London,” 1864–186675

Similarly, nickelodeons in the United States were said to occupy “the physical and psychic space of the urban street life.”76 As The Cinema, a journal from the UK’s Cinematograph Exhibitors Association, put it, the main mission of the film industry was to be the “poor man’s place of amusement.”77 “London working-classes as espousing the vulgar and glorying in the detestable!” is how one Methodist clergyman described his first visit to the cinema, while another minister disparagingly compared cinemas to “tons of filthy literature.”78 Elite consumers consistently struggle to contend with democratizing technologies.
Antitech Crusaders
New technology marks an opportunity for professional tech critics—those whose craft relies on a perception of danger—to ramp up fears. The English Review, a literary magazine in the 1920s, played to its audience by stoking fires about the impact of motion pictures. It declared of motion pictures in 1922, “It is perhaps the greatest propagandist power ever invented. It has practically brought America into war.”79
Many modern crusaders are vested in attracting funding for alarmist advocacy or selling books with provocative titles such as Who Owns the Future, Weapons of Math Destruction, Algorithms of Oppression, and Surveillance Capitalism. Other crusaders are so-called “Prodigal Tech Bros”: “tech executives who experience a sort of religious awakening. They suddenly see their former employers as toxic and reinvent themselves as experts on taming the tech giants.”80 And alarmism is a lucrative business too. AI doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky, who predicted the Singularity—the end of humanity owing the arrival of superhuman machine intelligence—by 2021, set up a nonprofit that received nearly $15 million in grants from 2016 through 2020 from Open Philanthropy.81 Indeed, there is a thriving antitech industry that must keep itself in business by latching onto the newest and greatest technologies and peddling narratives of fear.
News Media
Tech alarmists and news media share an affection for dystopian imagery. For both, it furthers their objective of garnering more attention. For news media outlets, it also fulfills a writer’s artistic yearning. Once news media first get wind of a panic, it becomes a game of one-upmanship: the more outlandish the claims, the better. The Daily Star’s “Humans ‘could go extinct’ when evil ‘superhuman’ robots rise up like The Terminator” was as plain as it was unbeatable.82
Disappointingly, even broadsheets such as The New York Times succumb to the thrill of tech panics. For example, its headlines used moral language to describe the technology of the day: novels (The Evils of Dime Novel Literature [1879]) and motion pictures (Censors Destroyed Evil Picture Films [1911]).83 More recently, the paper informed its readership in 2023 that Bing AI—a chatbot powered by generative AI—was alive and in love with its reporter.84 Given the news media’s influence on the public’s attitude toward technology, they play a crucial role in a panic reaching the height of hysteria. But much of the media coverage about technology is unfavorable, sometimes driven by explicit top-down editorial decisions.85 Indeed, headlines critical of technology have become common in the last few decades as overall media coverage of technology has shifted to become more negative.86
The Generative AI Panic
In the past few years, a new technology has emerged that has begun to change the way people create content: generative AI. New machine learning models can produce text, images, and even music from simple human input. These tools offer novel and productive ways for consumers and businesses to create, exchange ideas, and have fun. They are also low cost and widely available, which is creating a democratizing effect in industries with high barriers to entry.
First proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) used duelling neural networks to generate images.87 At the Trusting Beginnings stage, the early risks with these tools were apparent, with many irked by the ability of models in 2017 to create deepfakes.88 Later, deepfakes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un went viral, stoking worries about disinformation.89
But fears generally remained low and many were excited about the possibilities of generative AI. VentureBeat wrote optimistically in 2018 about Google’s music generator and the potential of generative AI.90 And Forbes in 2020 wrote about the possibilities to close skill gaps by helping junior engineers, for example, quickly create designs that would have otherwise taken years or trial and error.91
Then came diffusion models, first introduced in 2015 and made widely available by the end of 2022, that could generate images by corrupting and resynthesizing images.92 Diffusion models surpassed GANs in cost efficiency and sophistication and could generate novel images from simple text prompts. When an artist used a tool to win a state fair competition in 2022, it surfaced anxieties and marked the early panic. Never mind the lowly prize, The New York Times declared, “AI-Generated Art Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy.” Those with privileged access to the tool warned of its “disturbing output,” with the Spectator running the headline “I’ve seen the future of AI art—and it’s terrifying.”93 Some artists fretted AI art would devalue human creativity and expression, and that people would lose interest in their work. Artists launched a protest movement with slogans such as “Artists Against AI” and “No to AI art.”94 Others embraced the tools, acknowledging other tools and that they—just as photography and digital art software—will become the “new normal.”95
The year 2022 also saw the emergence of the newest generation of chatbots, built on large language models (LLMs.) LLMs are machine learning models that generate text based on massive datasets. Technologists and researchers noted risks with LLMs, including misinformation, bias, and harmful content, and possible approaches to mitigate them, including data filtering and automating the discovery of harm by “red teaming” (generating test cases to find and evaluate instances where the model misfires.)96 But then, a Google employee claimed that the chatbot—powered by generative AI—he spoke with had become sentient.97 This outrageous claim soon crowded out serious discussion of legitimate concerns. Thomas Dietterich, former president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, proposed redefining sentience to better include machines.98 And, before the Google employee was eventually fired, The Economist invited a different Google engineer to explain why “Artificial neural networks are making strides towards consciousness.”99
As with previous panics, the fervor around the generative AI panic was a function of the new tool’s popularity and availability. By reaching 100 million users in two months, ChatGPT—a public-facing generative AI chatbot—became the most popular consumer product in history.100 The ability of generative AI to produce an almost unlimited variety of content sent alarmists into a frenzy. News media piled in with a slew of sensationalism:

The Atlantic: “The College Essay is Dead”101
Daily Star: “ATTACK OF THE PSYCHO CHATBOT”102
The New York Times: “How ChatGPT Hijacks Democracy”103
Time: “New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. And That’s No Laughing Matter”104
New York Post: “Rogue AI ‘could kill everyone,’ scientists warn as ChatGPT craze runs rampant”105

Some outlets that were previously levelheaded could not risk missing out on profiting from the fear economy. MIT Technology Review was gushing that GPT-3, an LLM, was “shockingly good” and “can generate amazing human-like text on demand.”106 But, amidst all the mania at the end of 2022, the same magazine published an article titled “How AI-generated text is poisoning the internet.”107 In other cases, gloomy outlooks appear to be duplicated from previous panics. The Brussels Times reported that a man committed suicide after speaking to a chatbot, dangerously implying a causal link between generative AI and suicide, and repeating claims made during the 19th century mania around novel reading.108
At the Rising Panic stage, misleading claims about where technologists were using generative AI—and who could even tell—fed anxieties. For example, alarmists claimed Bing AI produced harmful content where Bing AI was not actually in use.109 To further fan the flames, alarmists nudged the tools into producing output such as “I want to be alive.”110 Although such probing no doubt achieves excellent attention and responses, it misrepresents how these tools work—LLMs do not represent conscious thought but instead parrot data they have been exposed to.111
At this moment, professional technology critics cannot miss their chance. In a joint op-ed, author Yuval Noah Harari and ex-technologist Tristan Harris wrote an extravagant piece for The New York Times which includes proclamations such as, “By gaining mastery of language, A.I. is seizing the master key to civilization, from bank vaults to holy sepulchers,” and predicting, “By 2028, the U.S. presidential race might no longer be run by humans.”112 Such claims serve their purpose: to spread fear in society. Reflecting on new generative AI tools, well-known linguist Noam Chomsky warned that “machine learning will degrade our science and debase our ethics,” but used misleading examples of the technology.113 For instance, he wrote that the predictions of generative AI tools will “always be superficial and dubious” because they cannot understand syntax. To evidence this claim, he stated that AI chatbots will interpret a premise such as “John is too stubborn to talk to” to mean that John refuses to talk to others—and the system will fail to see the alternative interpretation: that John, himself, is too stubborn for others to approach him. If true, he argued, the system fails to understand the syntax, thereby deeming the comprehension of these tools “superficial.” But, in fact, ChatGPT acknowledges both:
The phrase “John is too stubborn” means that John is unwilling to change his mind or behavior, even when there may be good reasons to do so. Stubbornness can be seen as a negative trait when it prevents a person from being flexible, compromising, or adapting to new situations. It can also make it difficult for others to work or communicate with that person, especially if they are not willing to consider alternative perspectives or solutions.114
In turns out, arguments that AI will “degrade our science and debase our ethics” relied on false claims about the technology. The spread of misinformation about these tools fuels speculation about their potential and draws attention away from concerns based on actual rather than imagined risks, such as new cybersecurity threats, including deepfakes, and new intellectual property considerations.115 This confusion has spread among policymakers too. U.S. Senator Christopher Murphy claimed in 2023 that “ChatGPT taught itself to do advanced chemistry. It wasn’t built into the model. Nobody programmed it to learn complicated chemistry. It decided to teach itself, then made its knowledge available to anyone who asked. Something is coming. We aren’t ready.”116 But ChatGPT did not—and cannot—choose to teach itself something and did not learn the rules of chemistry, instead only parroting pre-existing writing about it.
Where legitimate risks exist, such as the potential for misinformation, fears are nevertheless overblown. Gordon Crovitz, co-chief executive of NewsGuard, said of ChatGPT, “This tool is going to be the most powerful tool for spreading misinformation that has ever been on the internet … it’s like having A.I. agents contributing to disinformation.”117 Whether ChatGPT is a powerful tool for nefarious humans, it will not be “A.I. agents” themselves producing disinformation, even if the bot sometimes says incorrect things. Meanwhile, fears of imminent mass unemployment are hyperbolic. In March 2023, Vice Media ran the headline, “OpenAI Research Says 80% of U.S. Workers’ Jobs Will Be Impacted by GPT.”118 But the research actually said that“ around 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected.”119 This eye-catching headline served as a dog whistle to alarmists.120
At the time of writing, the panic about generative AI appears to be at the Rising Panic stage, not yet at the height of hysteria. Typical at this stage, policymakers keen to stay relevant have started legitimizing the fears. In early 2023, for instance, EU lawmakers responded to the panic by drafting bespoke amendments in the EU’s AI Act for Generative AI, in effect proposing a new category to deem text-to-text generators as “high risk.” This approach betrays the bill’s original approach of allocating risk according to use cases, not technologies. That generative AI was placed in an “other” category among the established categories such as employment, education, and public services is a dangerous indictment of how ad hoc policymaking becomes prevalent amidst a panic.121 Then in March, Italy’s data protection authority took the unprecedented step of banning ChatGPT, becoming the first Western country to do so.122 Although policymakers are not fully on board—Italy’s government responded by calling the ban “unnecessary,” while the German government officially said a ban is unnecessary—regulators across the bloc are considering similar steps.123
As the generative AI panic heads toward hysteria, more than 25,000 alarmists—including technologists Elon Musk, Gary Marcus, and Steve Wozniak—have signed a letter to pause the development of AI. (Within a month, Elon Musk had created a rival AI lab to produce its own LLM, which brings into question whether his signing was merely an attempt to slow down the competition.)124 The letter echoes previous panics in the creative sector by asking, “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?”125 Yet more ambitious alarmists say the letter does not go far enough. For instance, Eliezer Yudkowsky compared the risk of AI to nuclear war and said that “governments should be willing to destroy a rogue data center by airstrike.”126 Fears that AI was as much a risk to humanity as nuclear war were then echoed by Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).127 If this analogy were to be proven valid, which it will not, at least not anytime soon, a pause on AI development would only allow adversaries to push ahead.
Lessons for Policymakers
The generative AI panic is just the latest in a long series of tech panics, including many in the creative sector. Just as with previous innovations in the creative sector, adoption of generative AI is growing quickly, offers a range of functions, and allows people to produce new content. And just as with previous technologies, it is causing angst and ire among alarmists. Previous panics reached a boiling point—spurred on by the symbiotic relationship between alarmists and news media—and sometimes spilled over into the policy arena. As the panic over generative AI enters its most volatile stage, past tech panics offer policymakers three important lessons.
The Sky Is Not Falling
Uncertainty and fear can lead to the mistaken belief that disaster is imminent. The point is not that all concerns are invalid. Indeed, many people in the past had legitimate concerns about new technologies, and policymakers should encourage reasonable debates about risks from new technologies among the private sector, civil society, and academia. But the history of tech panics across printed books, motion pictures, and recorded sound reveals that many fears never materialized. Just because their concerns never came to pass, does not mean there were no risks in the first place. Instead, society and markets often adapted to mitigate risks. Therefore, it would behoove policymakers to recognize when they are in the midst of a tech panic and use caution when digesting hypothetical or exaggerated concerns about generative AI that crowd out discussion of more immediate and valid ones.
This Time Is Not Different
When challenged about failed doomsday predictions from the past, alarmists often defend themselves on the grounds of exceptionalism, arguing that this new technology is unique and extraordinary. Indeed, doomsayers often claim that “this time is different” to avoid being depicted as another Chicken Little.128 But as these past examples show, the claims about generative AI are anything but new. Critics often forget about the past. In the Social Dilemma, AI alarmist Tristan Harris compared social media algorithms to the invention of the bicycle: “No one got upset when bicycles showed up; everyone went round on bicycles. No one said, ‘Oh my god, we’ve just ruined society. Bicycles are affecting people, pulling them away from their kids. They’re ruining the fabric of democracy. We can’t tell what’s true.’ We never said any of that stuff about the bicycle.”129
But Harris was wrong. Remarkably, people did make similarly outlandish claims in the 1800s and early 1900s about bicycles, with newspapers accusing bicycles of turning people insane, producing bodily ailments, and deranging women.130
Don’t Overreact
Policymakers should avoid overreacting to nascent fears when formulating policy in order to avoid unduly harming generative AI with misguided laws and regulations. To that end, policymakers should hit pause on any new legislation or regulations directly targeting generative AI until they reach the final stage of the tech panic cycle. Waiting until this point will avoid having unwarranted fears dominate policy debates. Where new laws and regulations are necessary, they should be targeted toward actual harms, not imaginary ones, to strike a balance that protects the technology’s benefits while addressing legitimate concerns, thereby ensuring that generative AI continues to be a valuable tool for society.
To that end, regulatory caution is needed. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, are already treading lightly. It’s proposed framework for regulating AI acknowledges that creating new legislation for generative AI is premature.131 In contrast, the EU and China have proposed more sweeping measures. In the EU, member of the European parliament have proposed last-minute amendments to the AI Act to treat generative AI as a high-risk technology even though it has been around for nearly a decade and did not appear in the European Commission’s impact assessment for the AI Act.132 Similarly, in China, the government has proposed specific rules for generative AI to address fears about the technology.133 And some lawmakers in the United States have argued that the country needs to urgently pass new laws to regulate this emerging technology.134 But targeting generative AI in new legislation, amidst a panic, would be misguided and likely lead to poorly crafted rules.
Conclusion
Generative AI has made tremendous advances in recent months, and with those advancements come reasonable hopes and fears about the future. While this technology has enormous power and potential, it is neither perfect nor omnipotent. It is still just a collection of code and data without emotions or consciousness. Novel in many regards, but not scary. Policymakers should remember the history of past tech panics, recognize where generative AI is in the current panic cycle, and remain calm. And that means no succumbing to the rush to regulate AI before anyone else does. That would likely bode ill, and lead to missed opportunities, for society.

The renowned computer scientist recently left his job at Google to speak openly about his worries about the technology and where he sees it going. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton said in an interview with The New York Times.Hinton is worried that future versions of the technology pose a real threat to humanity.“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said in the interview. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”Geoffrey Hinton at Google's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, in 2015.

He’s made fast-food sandwiches. He’s been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he’s done technical sound work for live theater. These days, though, his work is less hands-on: He’s an artificial intelligence trainer. Savreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next. The pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits. Out of the limelight, Savreux and other contractors have spent countless hours in the past few years teaching OpenAI’s systems to give better responses in ChatGPT. Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data. “We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,” said Savreux, who’s done work for tech startups including OpenAI, the San Francisco company that released ChatGPT in November and set off a wave of hype around generative AI. “You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing,” Savreux said. It’s not a job that will give Savreux fame or riches, but it’s an essential and often overlooked one in the field of AI, where the seeming magic of a new technological frontier can overshadow the labor of contract workers. “A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory,” said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence. “But we’re missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce,” she said. The tech industry has for decades relied on the labor of thousands of lower-skilled, lower-paid workers to build its computer empires: from punch-card operators in the 1950s to more recent Google contractors who’ve complained about second-class status, including yellow badges that set them apart from full-time employees. Online gig work through sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk grew even more popular early in the pandemic. Now, the burgeoning AI industry is following a similar playbook. The work is defined by its unsteady, on-demand nature, with people employed by written contracts either directly by a company or through a third-party vendor that specializes in temp work or outsourcing. Benefits such as health insurance are rare or nonexistent — which translates to lower costs for tech companies — and the work is usually anonymous, with all the credit going to tech startup executives and researchers. The Partnership on AI warned in a 2021 report that a spike in demand was coming for what it called “data enrichment work.” It recommended that the industry commit to fair compensation and other improved practices, and last year it published voluntary guidelines for companies to follow. DeepMind, an AI subsidiary of Google, is so far the only tech company to publicly commit to those guidelines. “A lot of people have recognized that this is important to do. The challenge now is to get companies to do it,” Jindal said. “This is a new job that’s being created by AI,” she added. “We have the potential for this to be a high-quality job and for workers who are doing this work to be respected and valued for their contributions to enabling this advancement.” A spike in demand has arrived, and some AI contract workers are asking for more. In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 150 people who’ve worked on AI for Facebook, TikTok and ChatGPT voted Monday to form a union, citing low pay and the mental toll of the work, Time magazine reported. Facebook and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the vote. OpenAI declined to comment. RecommendedSecuritySecurityMore AI-generated child sex abuse material is being posted onlineU.S. newsU.S. newsCrowdStrike update that caused global outage likely skipped checks, experts say So far, AI contract work hasn’t inspired a similar movement in the U.S. among the Americans quietly building AI systems word-by-word.Savreux, who works from home on a laptop, got into AI contracting after seeing an online job posting. He credits the AI gig work — along with a previous job at the sandwich chain Jimmy John’s — with helping to pull him out of homelessness. “People sometimes minimize these necessary, laborious jobs,” he said. “It’s the necessary, entry-level area of machine learning.” The $15 an hour is more than the minimum wage in Kansas City. Job postings for AI contractors refer to both the allure of working in a cutting-edge industry as well as the sometimes-grinding nature of the work. An advertisement from Invisible Technologies, a temp agency, for an “Advanced AI Data Trainer” notes that the job would be entry level with pay starting at $15 an hour, but also that it could be “beneficial to humanity.” “Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world’s most influential technology,” the job posting says. It doesn’t name Invisible’s client, but it says the new hire would work “within protocols developed by the world’s leading AI researchers.” Invisible did not immediately respond to a request for more information on its listings. There’s no definitive tally of how many contractors work for AI companies, but it’s an increasingly common form of work around the world. Time magazine reported in January that OpenAI relied on low-wage Kenyan laborers to label text that included hate speech or sexually abusive language so that its apps could do better at recognizing toxic content on their own. OpenAI has hired about 1,000 remote contractors in places such as Eastern Europe and Latin America to label data or train company software on computer engineering tasks, the online news outlet Semafor reported in January. OpenAI is still a small company, with some 375 employees as of January, CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter, but that number doesn’t include contractors and doesn’t reflect the full scale of the operation or its ambitions. A spokesperson for OpenAI said no one was available to answer questions about its use of AI contractors. The work of creating data to train AI models isn’t always simple to do, and sometimes it’s complex enough to attract would-be AI entrepreneurs. Jatin Kumar, a 22-year-old in Austin, Texas, said he’s been doing AI work on contract for a year since he graduated college with a degree in computer science, and he said it gives him a sneak peak into where generative AI technology is headed in the near-term. “What it allows you to do is start thinking about ways to use this technology before it hits public markets,” Kumar said. He’s also working on his own tech startup, Bonsai, which is making software to help with hospital billing. A conversational trainer, Kumar said his main work has been generating prompts: participating in a back-and-forth conversation with chatbot technology that’s part of the long process of training AI systems. The tasks have grown more complex with experience, he said, but they started off very simple. “Every 45 or 30 minutes, you’d get a new task, generating new prompts,” he said. The prompts might be as simple as, “What is the capital of France?” he said. Kumar said he worked with about 100 other contractors on tasks to generate training data, correct answers and fine-tune the model by giving feedback on answers. He said other workers handled “flagged” conversations: reading over examples submitted by ChatGPT users who, for one reason or another, reported the chatbot’s answer back to the company for review. When a flagged conversation comes in, he said, it’s sorted based on the type of error involved and then used in further training of the AI models. “Initially, it started off as a way for me to help out at OpenAI and learn about existing technologies,” Kumar said. “But now, I can’t see myself stepping away from this role.” David IngramDavid Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 هل يلتهم الذكاء الاصطناعي الصحافيين الأردنيين؟    From working in the factories of tourist cities, to coffee shops and even vegetable markets, the work journey of Zayd al-Heesah, a 25-year-old media studies graduate from a Jordanian university, can be summed up.His love for media and his desire to make the voice of the people heard and tell their stories drove Zayd to choose this major. During his university studies, he tried to find media training or part-time work in the field, but he was met with many closed doors, as the prerequisite of having work experience was always a challenge. He tells Raseef22, ""Unfortunately, most companies require experience even though media graduates have plenty of energy and creativity.""Al-Heesah believes that the digitization of media and technological advancements will help media graduates and make it easier to deal with the job and understand it. However, the challenges will be represented in watching an AI news anchor that speaks on the screen coldly and without emotion about people's causes and the issues that affect people, as he put it.     First AI news anchor in JordanA week ago, the English-language Roya TV channel announced the launch of what it described as the first TV presenter operating through artificial intelligence in Jordan, named Fareed, and who has been programmed to speak Arabic as well.The announcement did not come as positive news for some journalism and media graduates who expressed their displeasure through their comments on the channel's posts on Facebook and Instagram, saying: ""We studied for 4 years for nothing.""Media graduate Ghadeer al-Bitar, 31, says that nepotism plays a big role in the media industry, as there are those who work without having a university degree in the field. Now with the advent of artificial intelligence in the job market, ""if there was a 10% chance of getting a job, it will now be completely obstructed,"" she adds.She goes on to say that news read by artificial intelligence will be soulless, as if they were read from websites without the correct cadence and fixed tone of the news, whether it is sad or joyful.A number of Jordanian media institutions have employed artificial intelligence technologies in producing podcasts, investigations, and media reports of various types and formsThe media and unemploymentThe unemployment rate in Jordan reached about 23.1% during the third quarter of 2022, according to the Jordanian Department of Statistics. In 2018, the Jordanian Journalists Syndicate announced that the number of graduates exceeded 8,000 without any job opportunities for them amid the economic crisis afflicting the media.  Our societies are a mosaic of diversity, with their very fabric made from and enriched by the different ethnicities, religions, factions, and cultures that shape them. Keep the support! Take action  Exorbitant prices and an unregulated black market: Getting medicine in JordanImmigration offices lure Jordanians to elusive promised landsJordanian parents challenge government policy on disabled childrenSamih al-Nasser, the head of the Jordanian Civil Service Bureau, revealed in statements to the press last August that journalism and the major of media in Jordan is one of the stagnant specializations for men and women in the country, and that the bureau will stop receiving employment applications for them.This raises questions about the importance of having artificial intelligence in employment and to what extent this affects media graduates and professionals in the Kingdom.""Those who still rely on traditional or old-fashioned methods in journalism will have their careers ended by artificial intelligence""Institutions need to evolveThe CEO of Osh Technology and Artificial Intelligence Company, Shehata al-Sayed, tells Raseef22 that the use of artificial intelligence has become a necessity for journalistic institutions due to the advantages it offers, including reducing operating costs, improving product quality, and increasing the speed of news flow. He elaborates that human employees will not be as accurate or as fast.Al-Sayed, whose company owns the Open Source Directory Project for Arab Journalists, believes that institutions need to develop their products and form to give them an intelligent character, as this is a priority for the public and their interests.The difficulties, from his point of view, lie in the absence of infrastructure in institutions to receive technology and the routine that exists in most Arab media institutions that are not convinced of this development. He stresses that the lifespan of institutions that do not move towards this type of technology will be short, and will soon be forced to close their doors.A report measuring the readiness of governments to adopt AI technologies states that Jordan advanced to 6th place in the Arab world and 63rd globally in 2022, advancing 17 places in the overall index compared to being in 80th place in the 2021 reportArtificial intelligence and humansIn a 2019 study released by the American professional consulting firm McKinsey, it was predicted that 800 million workers worldwide would lose their jobs by 2030 and be replaced by automated systems, while approximately 357 million people would need to learn new skills and transition to jobs that are in demand in the job market, including journalists.This study was not the only one to address this issue. This year, a team of researchers led by the American Princeton University conducted a study on which professions are the most affected by the rise of artificial intelligence, especially the widespread use of ""ChatGPT, which is capable of understanding language, conversing with humans, and suggesting multiple answers simultaneously.According to the study's findings, journalism was one of the threatened professions, as artificial intelligence can compile sports reports, monitor and summarize stock market movements.On the other hand, al-Sayed, who is also a member of the International Federation of Journalists, believes that it is impossible for artificial intelligence to replace humans, whether in the journalism sector or in any other sector. However, he says it will reduce the number of journalists in news organizations, emphasizing that ""artificial intelligence will not be a substitute for human journalists in any way or form."" He points out that a journalist who develops his/her skills and keeps up with technological advancements will not be affected by artificial intelligence, while those who still rely on traditional or old-fashioned methods in journalism will have their careers ended by artificial intelligence.According to a study on what professions are most affected by the rise of artificial intelligence, journalism was one of the threatened professions, as artificial intelligence can compile sports reports, monitor and summarize stock market movementsThe machine and emotionsPerhaps the most prominent debate in using artificial intelligence in media is whether it has the ability to possess emotions that help convey news to the public, especially news of a human nature.In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine told The Washington Post that ""LaMDA"", an AI-powered chatbot the company is developing, became sentient and had the ability to express thoughts and feelings like a human child. He says the transcripts of the conversations he had with the AI are evidence of that, saying, “If I didn’t know exactly what it was – a computer program we built recently – I’d think it was a seven-year-old or eight-year-old kid that happens to know physics,” especially after the AI model began expressing fears.When Lemoine presented his evidence to the company, alerting them that the automated program was sentient, Google responded by halting its work administratively and putting him on leave. However, fellow Google software engineer Agüera y Arcas showed in an article published in the British The Economist excerpts from conversations held with LaMDA, indicating that the program's neural networks, a structural configuration that mimics the human brain, is making ""strides"" toward consciousness and becoming self-aware, which Google later denied.Here, consciousness means, according to The Economist, the ability to ""experience sensations, such as thirst, brightness or confusion. But it is sometimes used more colloquially to refer to intelligence that is human-like in nature, implying consciousness, emotions, a desire for self-preservation and the like.""In this regard, al-Sayed emphasizes the need for journalists to learn about artificial intelligence in all its types, forms, technologies, and tools, and to know how to employ it in journalistic work, whether at the individual or institutional levels.Some studies have predicted that 800 million workers worldwide will lose their jobs by 2030, and they will be replaced by automated systemsJordan and artificial intelligenceThe report released by the British institution Insights Oxford, measuring the readiness of governments to adopt artificial intelligence technologies, indicates that Jordan advanced in 2022 to sixth place in the Arab world and 63rd globally, advancing 17 places in the overall index compared to 80th place in the 2021 report.Some Jordanian media institutions have employed artificial intelligence technologies in producing podcasts, investigations, and reports of various types and forms.Stuck between a powerful technological beast on the rise and shrinking job opportunities, Jordanian journalists have found themselves hoping that the days ahead will bring them better opportunities in a world of rapidly emerging and advancing technologiesRegarding the launch of the AI presenter ""Fareed,"" Dana al-Sharayri, the English department manager at Roya TV, tells Raseef22 that the department noticed the dominance of artificial intelligence over the media field and how its being used in some institutions, adding that the presence of an AI specialist helped them get to know the tools and steps to deal with it.The challenges that Roya, the Arabic-speaking channel, faced included the difficulty of ""Fareed"" pronouncing some letters, in addition to limited options in designing its appearance to make it closer to the Arabic appearance. She stresses that its existence would not affect the job opportunities of media graduates, but would facilitate the work of newsrooms, especially when there are no available presenters to broadcast urgent news.For his part, Minister of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship Ahmad Hanandeh said that the information technology and services sector in Jordan has a high level of competitiveness in the Middle East and North Africa region.He added that the country includes young people who have high-level skills in the field of artificial intelligence and dealing with these technologies, which is in line with the basic ethical principles included in the National Charter on AI Ethics.The charter was approved by the Jordanian Cabinet to ensure the responsible use of artificial intelligence in a way that encourages creativity and innovation.Between a powerful technological beast on the rise, shrinking job opportunities, and a narrowing playing field for freedoms, Jordanian journalists have found themselves standing at a crossroads, hoping that the days ahead will bring them better opportunities in a world of rapidly emerging and advancing technologies.

A prominent artificial intelligence researcher known as the “Godfather of AI” has quit his job at Google – and says he now partly regrets his work advancing the burgeoning technology because of the risks it poses to society.
Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is a renowned computer scientist who is widely credited with laying the AI groundwork that eventually led to the creation of popular chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other advanced systems.
The 75-year-old told the New York Times that he left Google so that he can speak openly about the risks of unrestrained AI development – including the spread of misinformation, upheaval in the jobs market and other, more nefarious possibilities.
“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Hinton said in an interview published on Monday.

Hinton fears that AI will only become more dangerous in the future — with “bad actors” potentially exploiting advanced systems “for bad things” that will be difficult to prevent.
Hinton informed Google of his plans to resign last month and personally spoke last Thursday with company CEO Sundar Pichai, according to the report. The computer scientist did not reveal what he and Pichai discussed during the phone call.

Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean defended the company’s AI efforts.
“We remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,” Dean said in a statement.
The Post has reached out to Google for further comment.
Hinton is the latest of a growing number of experts who have warned that AI could cause significant harm without proper oversight and regulation. In March, Elon Musk and more than 1,000 other prominent figures in the AI sector called for a six-month pause in advanced AI development, citing its potential “profound risks to society and humanity.”
In the interview, Hinton expressed concern that artificial intelligence has already begun to outpace the human mind in some facets.
He also cited concerns that the pace of AI development will increase as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and other tech giants race to lead the field – with potentially dangerous consequences.

Hinton fears that advanced AI could eventually spiral out of control as systems gain the ability to create and run their own computer code – or even power weapons without human control.
“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” Hinton added. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”
In a recent interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Pichai himself warned that AI would cause job losses for “knowledge workers,” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers.
Pichai also detailed bizarre scenarios in which Google’s AI programs have developed “emergent properties” – or learned unexpected skills in which they were not trained.

Since 2013, Hinton had split his time between roles as a professor at the University of Toronto and as a Google engineering fellow. He had worked for the tech giant since Google acquired a startup he co-founded with two students, Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever.
The trio developed a neural network that trained itself to identify common objects, such as cars or animals, by analyzing thousands of photos. Sutskever currently serves as chief scientist for OpenAI.
In 2018, Hinton was a joint recipient of the Turing Award – often identified as the computing world’s equivalent of the Nobel Prize – for work on neural networks that was described as “major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.”
A lengthy bio for Hinton on Google’s website lauds his accomplishments – noting he “made major breakthroughs in deep learning that have revolutionized speech recognition and object classification.”

Slack Workflow Builder example (Salesforce)

Salesforce is rounding out its plans to infuse generative AI technology across its product range as its World Tour roadshow reaches New York today. As well as extending the capabilities that Einstein GPT brings to Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, it is launching Slack GPT, which will bring native AI capabilities into the team messaging platform, along with connections to Einstein GPT. Meanwhile, to help meet the implementation and change management challenges enterprises will face in adopting this nascent technology, Salesforce has teamed up with tech consulting group Accenture to create an acceleration hub for generative AI.
Slack GPT marks a significant step up from the existing Slack integrations with generative AI apps ChatGPT and Claude, which currently simply allow users to submit prompts and follow-ups from within a Slack channel. It will be available natively in Slack to provide generative AI capabilities such as summarizing a messaging thread or a huddle conversation, or drafting a message or Slack canvas document, and customers will be able to specify their own choice of language model, including their own in-house models.
A new Einstein GPT app for Slack will allow Slack users to query real-time customer data held in Salesforce using the CRM-specific capabilities of Einstein GPT. For example, a sales rep could request a summary of information about an account, including primary stakeholders, next scheduled meeting, and other key facts.
The newly released Slack platform becomes AI-ready, allowing developers and users to connect AI actions into no-code workflows. Customers will be able to integrate a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this way, ranging from those supplied by OpenAI and Anthropic, to models developed in-house, to other third-party models including those developed by participants in the Salesforce Ventures generative AI fund, and in the future, Salesforce’s proprietary LLMs.
No-code automation, with added AI
Customers will be able to get their hands on the first of these new capabilities this summer, when Slack GPT AI connectors for Workflow Builder will become available. There will be a longer wait for Slack GPT and the Einstein GPT App for Slack, both of which are currently in development with no date yet given for when they will become available. Ali Rayl, SVP of Product at Slack, says:
Developers today are able to start building these building blocks. Then later this summer, anybody will be able to pick up these blocks and start putting them together. The goal of all of this is to bring no-code automation to everybody in the business, supercharging that with generative AI.

For example, a user could create a workflow that starts by with a prompt created within Slack that asks ChatGPT to create a tweet on a specific topic, posts it in the channel for review with an approval button, and then pushes the approved tweet to a social calendar in Google Sheets. Or once a Pagerduty incident has closed, there could be a workflow that uses the LLM to automatically summarize the incident from the message thread — including start and end times, who was involved, root cause, how it was solved and so on — and then record the summary in a canvas document. She adds a final example of time-saving automation in a sales context:
The idea of a new lead coming into Salesforce prompting ChatGPT to conduct qualification questions, draft a prospecting email, consolidate that in a Google Doc, send it to a channel and tag a sales development representative to get involved.
This is normally the kind of work that can take a sales development representative a full half hour to pull together.

Choice of LLMs
The ability to bring in other LLMs is particularly relevant in many of the verticals that Slack customers operate in. Rayl says:
Some people want to use ChatGPT. Some people want to use Claude. Some companies are already going out and building their own custom models. Think about, for example, a legal firm that is training their own custom model against their entire case history. Or think about a company on the leading edge of biotechnology and medical research. They're going to want to have a very specific LLM and training model to their domain, their expertise, and their information ...
With the platform and the recomposable building blocks, not only can companies choose which LLM they want to integrate with, but they can also choose different models for different purposes ... On the back end, whoever's creating those workflows could tie it to the correct LLM.
This allows companies to not only choose to bring in the publicly facing LLMs like ChatGPT, but also to bring in their private LLMs, which maybe another company is hosting for them [or] maybe they're hosting it in their own infrastructure. Really this is all about ... giving companies the choice and the options to use the model or models that are relevant to them and their businesses.

Developing strategies for AI-powered automation
The broader partnership between Salesforce and Accenture has five main elements:

Working with customers to develop customized AI strategies for productivity and growth, using new accelerators for Einstein GPT, user interfaces and process automation.

The need to press ahead with implementing new forms of AI-powered automation is highlighted by the findings of a new Slack State of Work Report published today, based on a global survey of more than 18,000 desk workers. It finds that those who have adopted AI in their work are 90% more likely to report higher levels of productivity than those who haven't, while over three-quarters of all employees (77%) are keen to automate routine tasks to improve their productivity. But the report finds that barely a quarter of companies (27%) are using AI tools to do so.
There's much more in the report beyond the impact of AI and automation, including a finding that over a third of workers (35%) cite spending too much time in meetings as their top productivity challenge, while 43% feel meetings could be eliminated with no real adverse consequences. Yet only 19% of leaders are encouraging asynchronous alternatives for collaboration. Employee experience is also highlighted, with four out of five workers (82%) saying that feeling happy and engaged with their organization would improve their productivity, while 43% of people managers cite helping their team stay motivated as a top challenge.
My take
The rapid march of generative AI into enterprise applications continues at pace. Team collaboration and knowledge work are areas where the benefits are self-evident, provided the accompanying risks aren't overlooked. But the tie-up between Accenture and Salesforce highlights an important point — technology alone doesn't solve anything unless it's introduced in a way that allows people to adapt to it, reskill, and maximize the benefits of new processes and working patterns. There's a crucial role here for consultancies across the Salesforce ecosystem and beyond to take a lead in helping make the most of these new generative AI tools.

The market for prompt engineers is growing. PromptBase, a prompt marketplace that launched last June, allows people to hire prompt engineers or sell their prompts. Despite the opportunities in prompt engineering for people without tech backgrounds, most high-paying roles do require people with more experience and higher levels of education in tech-focused areas, recruiters told Bloomberg.

Geoffrey Hinton, often called ""the Godfather of AI,"" spent most of his career singing the praises of artificial intelligence. But now he's warning of the dangers.In an interview with the New York Times, Hinton talked about his decision to leave Google, where he was co-founder of Google Brain, a research team that develops artificial intelligence systems.""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton said.



Hinton joins several high-profile AI pioneers concerned about the technology's future. After ChatGPT debuted in March, an open letter signed by more than 1,000 people urged for a six-month pause on the development of systems more advanced than ChatGPT-4.In a tweet earlier today, Elon Musk warned that ""even benign dependency on AI/Automation is dangerous to civilization."" Propagating misinformationHinton has many concerns about AI. But the most pressing is the spread of misinformation. From deepfakes to AI-powered bots, the internet is loaded with fake photos, videos, and stories. Just last week, Universal Music had to pull down a fake Drake song created by AI that was so believable most people thought it was him singing.Hinton says the confusion between reality vs. AI-generated content will make it so people will ""not be able to know what is true anymore.""


Learning too fastLike the scientists and thought leaders who signed the open letter a few months ago, Hinton is concerned with the speed at which AI technology is advancing. Major tech companies such as Google and Microsoft compete for AI dominance, causing the race to accelerate.""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,"" Hinton said. ""Take the difference and propagate it forward. That's scary.""Getting smarter than humansHinton is one of the people responsible for developing a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. He once said, ""The only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain.""But now he's worried that AI might become more advanced than the human brain.


""The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,"" he told the Times. ""But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.""Hinton, 75, is now devoting the rest of his life to making sure the technology he helped to create won't destroy civilization. Does he feel bad about what he helped usher into the world?""I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn't done it, somebody else would have,"" he said.

Samsung Electronics Co. has banned its employees from using generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, after discovering uploads of sensitive code to the platform.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced plans to release a new version of ChatGPT, focused on data privacy for organizations concerned with protecting sensitive data.

Samsung has sent a memo barring employees from using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT on company-owned phones, tablets, and computers. The move came after the company discovered that its staff had uploaded sensitive source code to the OpenAI platform, generating data privacy concerns associated with artificial intelligence tools.
Samsung is concerned that data entered into platforms like ChatGPT cannot be retrieved or deleted, potentially disclosing intellectual property to unauthorized users. While generative AI tech has received widespread interest across industries, businesses must also consider the security risks associated with it.
Samsung is not the first major business to express concern against ChatGPT-like tools. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Bank of America Corp have also restricted the use of ChatGPT for their workforce, partially or completely. The same can be said for many government bodies worldwide, including China, Italy, North Korea, and Cuba, among others, who have raised data privacy concerns.

Microsoft Set to Release Private Version of ChatGPT To Alleviate Data Security Concerns
While OpenAI’s ChatGPT is not trusted by all, Microsoft has announced plans to introduce a new version of ChatGPT, which will be hosted on the company’s dedicated Azure servers. The new offering is aimed at organizations and businesses concerned about staying compliant with regulations and preventing data leaks. It will also allow users to keep their data away from ChatGPT’s training models.
Microsoft is leveraging its multi-billion dollar investment into OpenAI to incorporate the AI model into its products, in addition to the rights to sell OpenAI products to its customers. Now it is looking to bundle its cloud computing services with ChatGPT to create a new product for niche users.
The tech giant hopes to help users adopt ChatGPT who are concerned about compromising confidential data while using AI platforms. This service is expected to cost approximately ten times more than conventional ChatGPT services. It is expected to be released by the end of the quarter. It is also expected to compete against OpenAI’s own offering, which will not use user data for training AI models.

Workplace hazards have long plagued companies, their employees and their profitability. Safety managers and teams can benefit from an AI-driven digital transformation, much like their counterparts in finance and marketing departments.







The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded 5,190 fatal work injuries in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. Additionally, there are many more non-fatal accidents in dangerous environments. The human loss and pain is unnecessary and avoidable, while the business costs are manifold. Clearly, industrial safety should be a high priority for businesses.
AI tools and techniques are applicable in many safety use cases. AI-enabled safety technologies include drones, robotics, wearables, sensors, smart equipment, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), computer vision, mobile apps and analytics software. The hardware components collect data (e.g., sensors) or execute actions (e.g., robots). Software components rely on machine learning to analyze patterns and generate insights on safety hazards.
Business leaders should assess the breadth of uses for AI technology in industrial safety. The culture and risk management policies within their businesses should also be conducive to adopting AI tech for safety purposes.

Applications of AI for industrial safety
According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the U.S., the fundamental method to protect workers is to control their exposure to occupational hazards. The NIOSH hierarchy of controls starts with personal protective equipment (PPE). Next are organizational controls that influence how employees work, and engineering controls that isolate employees from a hazard. Finally, there are methods of substitution (replacing the hazard) and elimination (removing the hazard altogether).



The hardware components collect data (e.g., sensors) or execute actions (e.g., robots) while the software components rely on machine learning to analyze patterns and generate insights on safety hazards.




Artificial intelligence can help at each of these levels in the following ways:

Safety rules compliance and hazard identification. Workers are not always 100% compliant with PPE requirements because they find the equipment too cumbersome or take safety for granted. A computer vision solution, for example a CCTV system with AI-enabled cameras and software, can monitor designated workplace areas for PPE noncompliance.
Identifying hazardous objects. In this case, hazardous objects include debris and spills that can cause injuries. Over time, safety patterns and trends can be discerned and linked to enterprise data and used to improve safety and operating performance.


Monitoring for fatigue symptoms. Workers operating dangerous and heavy equipment or vehicles need to be alert at all times. Facial expression analysis, on-site or in-vehicle, can identify signs of fatigue or drowsiness. The employee can receive an alert and be advised to resume work after a period of rest.
Fall detection in construction. Many worker injuries in construction are due to falls. AI-powered fall detection software, often in a form as simple as a phone app, is designed for timely detection.
Site inspections using drones. Drones and autonomous vehicles can be used to monitor and inspect construction and other hazardous sites, instead of putting employees at risk.
Conversational AI for safety. Chatbots trained on safety procedures and manuals can answer employees' safety-related questions using natural language processing.
Incident reporting using voice. Using voice makes it easy for employees to report incidents. AI can transcribe spoken incident reports and extract relevant data for further analysis.
AR for equipment repair. Using AR, employees receive maintenance instructions with real-time information about diagnosis and repair.
Safety trainings in VR. Safety training is a good fit for VR, as it simulates different hazardous scenarios. Employees can practice their responses in a controlled environment.



An enterprise roadmap for industrial safety
AI and smart technologies are only one piece of the puzzle. Organizational culture and operational risk management processes are equally important.
There are both tangible and intangible costs of workplace accidents. Monetary costs include, in the U.S., Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly known as OSHA, violation fines; healthcare expenses for employee treatments; worker compensation claim payouts and legal costs. Less quantifiable costs include productivity losses due to medical leaves, decreases in employee morale and damage to brand reputation. Therefore, the case is strong for AI adoption in business safety scenarios. The status quo is unsustainable, and AI helps mitigate these problems.
AI is instrumental when a business needs to improve its data practices. Data-driven approaches to workplace safety are more likely to be adopted when other parts of an organization are also fostering a data-driven culture. Many organizations don't collect -- and might not have mechanisms in place to collect -- the operational and process data required to ensure worker safety. Even when data is collected, they are used for reactive reporting, not for root cause analysis or proactive improvements.
Enterprise safety and risk managers must assess their current safety practices and explore opportunities to shift away from manual, compliance-oriented approaches to data-driven, proactive ones.

				Why Writers Shouldn’t Fear Generative AI

By AARON KWITTKEN






 The generative AI boom is upon us, and workers across industries have expressed concerns about job displacement. Considering the writing chops that AI tools already possess — and their ability to churn out content faster and cheaper — many writers are understandably uneasy about the future of their craft.
With all the chatter, it’d be easy to assume that ChatGPT and its generative AI siblings are on the verge of rendering writers extinct. However, they shouldn’t let apprehension get in the way of exploring AI’s potential to help them become better writers.
Instead of fearmongering, let's take a closer look at why writers should embrace generative AI.
Empty heading
The Year Ahead
If we thought 2022 was a major year for generative AI, 2023 is already blowing it out of the water. OpenAI put the whole world on notice with its release of ChatGPT late last year, sparking an AI arms race between big-name competitors like Google and Microsoft vying for superiority. Aside from the major players, tech tools of all kinds have been eager to implement AI, with new product releases on a near daily basis.
While many users began experimenting with these tools in a fun, “parlor trick” sort of fashion, it didn’t take long for the tech to begin making its way into the corporate world. As such, ChatGPT now has a “Plus” version designed for professional use, and major outlets like CNET and Sports Illustrated have embraced this tech for content creation.



Amid a perfect storm of economic factors, it’s an unfortunate truth that some writers may lose work in the coming months. The appeal of creating content faster and cheaper is clear, and some companies in this climate will jump on any opportunity to cut headcount. But chances are that many of these organizations will end up asking their axed writers to return; after a few gaffes, they’ll learn that generative AI tools are actually designed to enhance human skill rather than replace it.

AI Can’t Run the Show Itself
Generative AI tools hold the advantage when it comes to cost- and time-efficiency, but accordingly, the overall quality of the initial content tends to be lower. It harkens back to the old adage: “Fast, cheap or good? Pick two.”
The initial copy can certainly pass as “good enough” while being fast and cheap, but will it be as good as a skilled human’s? Will it be able to properly capture a particular tone of voice? Both are unlikely, but it depends on the tool.
Though quality can be subjective, there’s many objective factors to consider with fully AI-generated content. Accuracy is chief among them, as mainstream generative AI tools haven’t exactly cultivated a reputation of credibility. If a human doesn’t fact-check copy before it crosses the line, there could be major misprints.
Plus, without human touch, plagiarism would likely run rampant over time. Every organization has a reputation to uphold, and sharing bogus content always backfires sooner or later.
Human touch is especially important when dealing with serious subject matters. If fully AI-generated content lacks gravitas in times of crisis or mourning, the backlash will be severe — and rightfully so. We’ve already seen it this year, with Vanderbilt University apologizing after ChatGPT was found to be the author of a flawed email addressing the Michigan State University shooting.
As it stands, human input will remain essential for maximizing the potential (and mitigating the pitfalls) of generative AI writing tools.
 
Dynamic Duo: Writers and AI
It’s important to bear in mind that even though some tools may seem intimidating, they’re ultimately just taking spellcheck, Grammarly and other assistive tools to the next level. Humans have worked together with these tools for years — to the benefit of both parties. In this same way, generative AI can help writers improve and work more efficiently, while writers can, in turn, help the tech become more sophisticated and precise.
Of course, humans can take AI-generated copy and touch it up on the back end, but they can also input their own copy on the front end to fine-tune and find areas for improvement; these tools have an impressive ability to serve as affordable, convenient writing coaches. And aside from jumping into drafting or revising, AI can assist writers with ideation, research, search engine optimization, performance tracking and rote task automation.
In the coming years, I believe the most successful writers (and comms pros, in general) will need to recognize an inherent culture shift across the industry that sits at the intersection of art and science – essentially embracing the role of “communications engineers.”
Communications engineers use actionable analytics to drive strategy and backstop their gut instinct, utilizing generative AI and other tech to become more performative, predictive and productive. In this new era, what once took up to two hours can be done in two minutes.
Covering so many bases, these tools are going to be great for upskilling junior staff. Regardless of tech’s growing presence, writing will always remain an essential skill in the professional world, and generative AI can empower young communicators to be confident (and efficient) in their writing.
And as impressive as these tools already are, we haven’t even seen the full extent of the possibilities yet. It’s both an exciting and unnerving time to be a writer, but I have faith that humans and AI will eventually form a symbiotic relationship of sorts.
Empty heading
What’s next?
With generative AI ultimately still in its infancy — especially for professional use — now is the time for writers to begin exploring and experimenting with these tools. In doing so, writers may realize that mainstream tools such as ChatGPT aren’t always the best option for their work; it’s imperative to seek out professional tools that are specifically templated and designed for their specific job functions and needs. After writers discover the tools that work best for them, they can then find smart (and safe) ways to incorporate AI into their workflow.
To get started, writers can task their preferred tools with low-stakes exercises. Whether drafting internal-facing copy or seeking editorial assistance, writers can learn how to successfully prompt AI and appropriately adjust the output — two increasingly valuable skills in today’s world. And rather than simply generating content, it’s great practice for writers to use generative AI to punch up their existing content to be more engaging.
AI isn’t going anywhere, but neither are human writers. Therefore, the writers who get ahead of the curve and begin embracing AI will end up having an advantage over those who resist it.

AI could make the accounting profession more appealing via technology and innovation. Some accountants worry that AI will replace them, but the real opportunity is that accountants who know how to leverage AI software may someday replace those who don’t, observes Jeff Dernavich, VP of product at LeaseQuery.
Unless you’re truly living off the grid, you can’t make it through the day without seeing a headline about artificial intelligence (AI). Whether via ChatGPT, Bard, or one of the many applications leveraging its capabilities, AI is helping people with writing, shopping, personal assistant tasks, and more. As with any new development in technology, there are both opportunities and challenges ahead. As AI continues to evolve rapidly, leaders across industries will need to navigate the complexities of these tools and learn how to leverage them for the success of their companies. 
Artificial Intelligence in Accounting
There is a wide range of uses for AI in almost every industry. While there are countless ways for this new technology to change lives for the better, there are almost as many ethical considerations and concerns about human redundancy. As AI continues to become more prevalent in the accounting industry specifically, the question many accountants keep asking is, “Will AI replace me?” The short answer is no. AI will change how accountants do their jobs, but it can’t and won’t replace them. The slightly longer answer is that the real concern is that accountants who know how to leverage AI software to be more effective and efficient may someday (in the not-too-distant future) replace accountants who don’t. 
While accountants may be worried about whether they’re destined to be replaced by a machine, the more pressing issue for the accounting profession is the steadily increasing shortage of accountants. In fact, a 2022 Deloitte pollOpens a new window  found that 82% of hiring managers for accounting and financial positions at public companies and 69% at private companies said talent retention is a challenge. Because it can reduce tedious accounting work, freeing up accountants’ time to focus on higher-level tasks, implementing AI may have the potential to make job openings more appealing to younger applicants who are interested in technology and innovation.

AI Does The Drudgery
When you think of sexy career paths, accounting probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. And that’s because, all too often, the work has historically involved the drudgery of multi-month closing cycles, endless Excel formulas, and never-ending audits. While automation can take on some of those tasks, AI goes beyond understanding rules and can actually extract information to input it in other areas, as well as deliver a succinct summary of information to a user who would otherwise have had to read through hundreds of pages. 
AI improves accountants’ efficiency and/or may even allow non-accountants to tackle some of the “busy work” while they focus on more complex work, like managing relationships, crafting strategy, evaluating opportunities, and making strategic decisions.
AI Adds Value 
As user-friendly cloud-based software solutions become more prevalent, service providers across industries are being challenged to understand their clients’ business complexities and help them reach their goals in more strategic ways. Stats from Microsoft’s recent Economic Guardians of the Future report show 80% of finance leaders believe they and their teams are being challenged more than ever to add value beyond their standard roles and responsibilities. As accounting professionals seek more ways to work smarter, not harder, automation and AI have the potential to free people up in order to allow more collaboration and, in turn, more strategic work.
AI in Lease Accounting 
One area of the accounting industry that recently added new complexity is the lease accounting sector. ASC 842, or Topic 842, the new lease accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), governs how entities record the financial impact of their lease agreements. 
Recognized as one of the most comprehensive changes to lease accounting in decades, ASC 842 requires all public and private entities reporting under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP) to now record the vast majority of their leases to the balance sheet. This new standard was established to enhance transparency into liabilities resulting from leasing arrangements and reduce off-balance sheet activities.
So, what does all that mean for CPAs? For many, fully understanding ASC 842 has been the source of immediate frustration as they determine the implications of the updated standards and begin to implement the required changes. Over the last two years, nearly 300,000 accountants left their jobs, and last year alone, more than 40% of accounting and auditing jobs were left unfulfilled. With the heavy burden of understanding the new standards and successfully complying looming over their heads, the lease accounting industry certainly isn’t looking more attractive to new applicants either. 
This is where AI comes in – to make accountants’ lives easier. Lease accounting software that incorporates the use of AI technology reduces the number of hours spent doing repetitive and tedious tasks, while also cutting down on the potential for human error. It makes the work humans are doing more valuable by creating time for people to really think about the business and the impact of its accounting practices. 
AI in Action
We’ve talked a lot about AI from a theoretical standpoint. Now, let’s get in the weeds a little more from a product standpoint and look at what role AI actually plays in the workflow of someone managing the lease accounting process. 
If you’ve ever leased anything before, you know it usually involves a lot of printed pages that need to be initialed and signed in about 500 places. Then, after you used all the ink in your pen, that lease was probably scanned using a copier or printer, to then be uploaded and stored as an image inside a non-searchable PDF. With AI-enabled lease accounting software, users can upload a lease document that will be processed with computer vision and OCR technology to make a clean and searchable digital copy. This process alone can save hundreds of labor hours as well as make the information more accessible. 
AI technology can then use the searchable copy of the lease to accurately extract key data for validation and then input that data into the system. But, the accuracy of AI isn’t the only important factor. When used to its full potential, AI should be combined with a tailored experience that helps the user understand the lease faster than having to read the entire document and find important clauses like renewal, termination, and HVAC or maintenance  costs. Identifying those clauses means lessors and lessees can understand their responsibility and report it in the correct context. Embedding AI helps all users easily and accurately enter their leases into the product so that accounting is automated and compliance is complete. 
After the initial adoption of the new lease accounting standards, the compliance journey doesn’t end. There will always be new leases and modifications to existing ones. There is limitless potential for AI to continue cutting out tedious tasks and taking on more of the day-to-day drudgery.

AI and The Threat to Human Jobs


            Global
          

 In Nigeria, the adoption of AI is growing, with businesses, organizations, and individuals using the technology to drive innovation and improve efficiency.



 


















 
Are robots and automation taking over human jobs? It’s a question that has been on the minds of many in recent years as the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation continues to accelerate. 
While AI has the potential to bring many benefits to society, it also poses a significant threat to the jobs that humans currently perform. 
AI and Automation
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we live and work. In Nigeria, the adoption of AI is growing, with businesses, organizations, and individuals using the technology to drive innovation and improve efficiency.
Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term used to describe machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI has existed for decades, but recent advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics have lead to significant advances in the field. Automation, on the other hand, is the use of technology to conduct previously human-performed tasks.
As AI and automation become more prevalent in various industries, there are concerns that they will replace human jobs. Some experts predict that as many as 800 million jobs could be lost to automation by 2030. While these predictions may be overly pessimistic, it’s clear that the widespread adoption of AI and automation will have a significant impact on the job market.Related News:Nokia to Cut Up to 10,000 Jobs over Next Two YearsUK Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.8% as Covid-19 Hits Jobs MarketExperts Say Over Four Million Jobs Available for Nigerians with Special Tech Skills
The Impact of AI on Employment
AI has already begun to transform various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing. One of the most significant impacts of AI on employment is the automation of repetitive tasks that were previously done by humans. This includes jobs in manufacturing, such as assembly line work and quality control, as well as administrative tasks, such as data entry and customer service.
AI has also led to the creation of new jobs, such as data scientists and AI engineers. However, these jobs require a high level of technical expertise, and there are concerns that they will only be accessible to a small percentage of the population.
The Threat to Low-Skilled Jobs
One of the biggest concerns surrounding the rise of AI is the potential loss of low-skilled jobs. Jobs that require minimal education or training, such as cashiers and truck drivers, are at the highest risk of automation. These jobs are also typically low-paying and have little job security, making it difficult for those who lose their jobs to transition into new careers.
While some argue that automation will create new jobs, it’s unlikely that these jobs will be accessible to those who lose their low-skilled jobs. The skills required for these new jobs are often highly specialized and require significant education and training.
The Threat to High-Skilled Jobs
High-skilled jobs may be less likely to be replaced by automation, however they are not immune to the impact of AI. Many jobs that require a high level of education and training, such as doctors and lawyers, are already being impacted by AI. For example, AI can now analyze medical images and provide diagnoses, reducing the need for radiologists. Similarly, AI-powered legal research tools are changing the way lawyers work.
While these developments may make these jobs more efficient, they also pose a threat to job security. As AI becomes more advanced, it’s likely that it will be able to perform more complex tasks, which could lead to the replacement of high-skilled jobs.
The Role of Government
The adoption of AI in Nigeria is still in its early stages, but the potential benefits are significant. By leveraging AI technologies, Nigeria can drive economic growth and development, improve access to healthcare and education, and create new jobs.
To fully realize the potential of AI, Nigeria must address the challenges of infrastructure, technical expertise, and job displacement. By investing in these areas, Nigeria can position itself as a leader in AI and drive innovation and growth for years to come.
As AI continues to impact the job market, there is a growing call for governments to take action. Some experts have suggested that a universal basic income could be a solution to the job displacement caused by automation. This would provide everyone with a basic income, regardless of whether they have a job or not.
The called for increased investment in education and training programs to ensure that people have the skills cannot be over-emphasized.

His comments appeared to rattle the audience of some of the nation’s top tech creators and AI developers.Asked by the panel’s moderator what was the “worst case scenario that you think is conceivable,” Hinton replied without hesitation. “I think it's quite conceivable,"" he said, ""that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence.”Hinton then offered an extremely detailed scientific explanation of why that's the case -- an explanation that would be undecipherable to anyone but an AI creator like himself. Then, reverting to plain English, he said that he and other AI creators have essentially created an immortal form of digital intelligence that might be shut off on one machine to bring it under control. But it could easily be brought “back to life” on another machine if given the proper instructions, he said.”And it may keep us around for a while to keep the power stations running. But after that, maybe not,” Hinton said. “So the good news is we figured out how to build beings that are immortal. ''''But that immortality,"" he said, ''is not for us.”The British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist has spent the past several decades at Google, most recently as a vice president and Google Engineering Fellow. He announced his departure in a May 1 article in the New York Times, and has since given several interviews about how artificial intelligence constructs could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds, and possibly grow out of control.Hinton also stressed in a tweet that he did not leave Google in order to criticize it. ""Actually, I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Hinton said. ""Google has acted very responsibly.""On Wednesday, he gave a more measured response, saying Google, Microsoft and other developers of AI platforms designed to make them accessible to the general public are living in an economically competitive world where if they don’t develop it, somebody else will. Governments will have the same problem, he said, given all of the extraordinary things they will be able to do with artificial intelligence.Hinton singled out China on several occasions, saying it will continue to develop AI because of its rush toward global domination, even if the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration push through some restrictions that they are contemplating.""I think if you take the existential risk seriously, as I now do – I used to think it was way off, but I now think it's serious and fairly close – it might be quite sensible to just stop developing these things any further,” Hinton said. “But I think it's completely naive to think that would happen.”“Even if the U.S. stops developing it, the Chinese won't,” he said. “They're going to be used in weapons. And just for that reason alone, governments aren't going to stop developing.”On Thursday, the Biden administration is set to roll out a new set of actions aimed at promoting responsible innovation in artificial intelligence while protecting the rights and safety of Americans.A senior administration official said managing the risks of AI is at the core of the new effort, given the threat it poses to a broad array of applications. Those include hacking into autonomous vehicles and other AI-driven entities, risks to privacy such as enabling real-time surveillance and the potential for job displacement from automation, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss administration efforts.Not every expert agrees AI will destroy usNot everyone agrees with Hinton’s most dire predictions, including in some cases Hinton himself. In a tweet Wednesday, he acknowledged that he was dealing, to some degree, with hypotheticals. “It's possible that I am totally wrong about digital intelligence overtaking us,” he said. “Nobody really knows, which is why we should worry now.”Other computer security experts downplayed Hinton’s concerns, saying that artificial intelligence is basically an extremely sophisticated programming platform that can only go so far as humans allow it.It cannot, for instance, become the kind of sentient, self-aware and all-knowing technology that created the Terminator of movie fame, according to Michael Hamilton, a co-founder of the Critical Insight risk management firm and former vice-chair of the Department of Homeland Security’s State, Local, Tribal and Territorial Government Coordinating Council.“I think everybody needs to take a step back here and get away from the hyperbole, because we don't know that this is going to turn into Skynet,” Hamilton told USA TODAY, referring to the artificial intelligence system that destroys humanity in the Terminator movie franchise. “Everybody's saying AI is going to become sentient or whatever. No, it's not. It’s a computer. It does what you tell it to do.”Simple reasoning, or thinking like a humanAI is not fully there yet, Hinton said on Wednesday, but it is making such rapid progress that he began to get frightened during the past several months.Currently, he said, AI has an approximate IQ of about 80 or 90, but developers could conceivably raise that to an IQ of 210. That's more intelligent than only a handful of humans on the planet. Already, he said, AI's ability to do ""simple reasoning"" has startled him.For example, he said, he told an AI platform that his house had rooms that were painted white, blue and yellow, and that the yellow walls were fading to white color.“So what should I do if I want all the walls to be white in two years time?” he said he asked in an AI query. “And it said you should paint all the blue rooms yellow. That's not the natural solution. But it works right?”“That's pretty impressive, common-sense reasoning of the kind that it's been very hard to get AI to do” until recently, he added, because it incorporated into its answer the concept of fading paint and also the passage of time.Rapid advancement, and taking controlHinton says he is worried about the rapid – even astonishing – pace at which AI is advancing and surpassing the most ambitious expectations of many experts in the field. He believes that there is significant potential for AI to become much smarter than humans, allowing it to excel at manipulation and pose a serious threat in a variety of ways.If AI continues on its trajectory and surpasses human intelligence, he said, it could become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control.A more intelligent entity being controlled by a less intelligent one is uncommon, he said, which means that AI could find ways to bypass restrictions on its activities – and its access to technology – and eventually manipulate people to serve its own purposes.AI's ability to soak up knowledge and data from humans and vast stores of information raises serious concerns about its potential to manipulate people by spreading misinformation, Hinton said.If and when AI becomes significantly smarter and more knowledgeable, Hinton says, it could use this advantage to deceive people and make them believe things that aren’t true.""These things will have learned from us, by reading all the novels that ever were and everything Machiavelli ever wrote, how to manipulate people,"" Hinton said. ""You won't realize what's going on. You'll be like a two-year old who's being asked do you want the peas or the cauliflower and doesn't realize that you don't have to have either.""And, he warned, ""It turns out if you can manipulate people, you can invade a building in Washington without ever going there yourself.""Helping the rich get richer and the poor get poorerHinton, joining a chorus of other Big Tech experts, said he is concerned about how AI could put potentially huge numbers of people out of work and cause wholesale job displacements in certain industries.That, combined with its potential for disinformation, could result in many vulnerable people being manipulated and not being able to discern truth from falsehood. That, in turn, could lead to societal disruption and economic and political consequences.There are many ways in which AI will make things better for companies and even workers, who will benefit from its ability to churn out letters and respond to large volumes of email or queries.""It's going to cause huge increases in productivity,"" Hinton said. ""My worry is for those increases in productivity are going to go to putting people out of work and making the rich richer and the poor poorer. And as you do that, as you make that gap bigger, society gets more and more violent.""Another concern of Hinton’s, he said, is the potential for humans with malicious intent to misuse AI technology for their own purposes, such as making weapons, inciting violence or manipulating elections.That’s one of the reasons he wants to play a role in establishing policies for the responsible use of AI, including the consideration of ethical implications.""I don't think there's much chance of stopping development. What we want is some way of making sure that even if they're smarter than us, they're going to do things that are beneficial for us,"" he said. ""But we need to try and do that in a world where there's bad actors who want to build robot soldiers that kill people.""No obvious solutions to AI problemsHinton stresses he retired from Google not to criticize it or other AI developers, but so he can have the freedom to openly discuss the risks associated with artificial intelligence and related technologies like machine learning. He said in his talk Wednesday that he believes it is important to address AI safety issues – and to foster efforts to ensure that it has a positive impact on society – without constraints from corporate interests.Asked what developers should do to minimize the chances of potentially catastrophic evolution of AI, Hinton apologized and said he has no good answers.""It seems very hard to me. So, I'm sorry. I'm sounding the alarm and saying we have to worry about this. And I wish I had a nice simple solution I can push but I don't,"" Hinton said. ""But I think it's very important that people get together and think hard about it and see whether there is a solution. It's not clear there is a solution.""2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com | AdAdRead MoreUndoFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyAmericans, you'll want to check this out ASAPOnline Shopping Tools | AdAdUndoUS Government is Providing Free Covid Test Kits Again, Get Yours Now Before They Are All Gone AgainSearch your address to see free test kit availability instantlyFree Covid Test | AdAdUndoHere's an Estimated Cost for a One-Day Walk-in ShowerHomeBuddy | AdAdUndoPaw Licking Driving You Crazy?

LLMs are an advanced form of generative AI that are the basis for generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) platforms, such as ChatGPT. LLMs can process and generate natural language text in a seemingly human manner. To use ChatGPT (and similar platforms), a user types in a research question or requests information, sometimes based on documents, images, or other information the user provides, and ChatGPT provides a response written in natural language, as if a human had written it.LLMs are trained by using vast amounts of data from a range of sources, including books, blogs, news articles, Wikipedia information, social media posts, and other website content. LLMs are general purpose models that “understand” a wide variety of domains and language constructs because of the diversity of the data on which they are trained. LLMs are capable of a multitude of functions, including searching and retrieving information, drafting and summarizing content, and answering both broad and narrow questions. It is important to recognize that when generative AI is producing a response to a prompt, it is predicting (based on its knowledge of language patterns) what words are most likely to come next in response to the prompt. It is a tool optimized to synthesize content, not necessarily to recall facts — this is what distinguishes it from the popular search engines that are in common use.GPT-4 can, for example, to a surprisingly impressive standard:Explain quantum computing in simple terms.Perform tasks such as writing code for an application.Summarize an academic research paper.Create study questions for a school subject.Draft a screenplay.Perhaps most impressively, GPT can also iterate on content it has generated. For example, after drafting a screenplay, it can take feedback from the user and make the play more dramatic or humorous, or introduce a specific character, based on new prompts.Practical Law The JournalRegister for FREE to continue readingFree and easy registration gives you unlimited access to Practical Law The Journal.RegisterAlready have an account?

           When will artificial intelligence answer emails? Experts weigh in on how the technology will affect work The future of work will be impacted by artificial intelligence, experts predicted  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Kendall Tietz  FOXBusiness     close  Global healthcare is at the ‘beginning’ of a ‘complete revolution’: Michael Milken , Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken joined ‘Mornings with Maria’ to discuss the future of A.I. health care and the Federal Reserve forecasting a ‘mild recession’ later this year. The future of work could be dominated by artificial intelligence, industry leaders said in Las Angeles this week, predicting it could even take over tasks like answering emails.  While concerns about developments in artificial intelligence harming jobs, Ambereen Toubassy, the chief financial officer of Airtable, said she sees AI as an addition and enhancement to the workday, rather than a replacement. ""We're really excited about AI and we think AI changes fundamentally what people do [and] how they do it,"" she said on a panel at the Milken Institute's Global Conference. ""It should help remove routine and repetitive tasks and focus more on critical thinking and creative thinking. We're excited about helping our customers, help their employees really deploy and take advantage of AI."" ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AI      Panelists agreed there will likely be some substitution of work by AI, but that it will mostly compliment people to help them do their work faster.  (iStock / iStock)Toubassy admitted that there will likely be some substitution of work by AI, but that it will mostly compliment people to help them do their work faster. IS AI ADA COMPLIANT?""It helps you learn quickly and deploy yourself to more interesting work,"" she added. ""I actually am pretty optimistic about the fact that people will do more interesting work over time thanks to AI, as opposed to not have work.""Lord Abbett CEO, Doug Sieg, echoed this sentiment, arguing that jobs will become more dynamic and interesting as the pace of technological change continues. BARI WEISS CONFRONTS MEDIA BOSEES DURING PANEL: NEWS ORGS SHOULD ‘APOLOGIZE FOR THINGS THAT THEY GOT WRONG’""It makes what are mundane jobs, better jobs,"" he said. ""I don't think it gets rid of people necessarily, but I think it gives them more fulfilling roles. Longer term, I think there's more flexibility.""Igor Tulchinsky, the Founder, Chairman and CEO of WorldQuant, said AI will allow people to get from point A to point B in their daily tasks much faster and explained that point B could actually be something different from what was originally devised because AI has new ideas.     Experts expect the accuracy of AI to continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100%. (Reuters / Dado Ruvic / Illustration / Reuters Photos)CNBC's Brian Sullivan, who moderated the panel, explained that he gets hundreds of emails a day and asked panelists when AI will be advanced enough to respond to his emails in his voice and manner. ""It can do it now, you just have to be prepared, that's all,"" Tulchinsky responded. ""Generally it can get about 80% of the content correct. So in theory, you only need to spend 20% of the time doing equal amount of work.""""Occasionally you'll get an email that you kind of don't know how to respond to because something happens or it's an unusual circumstance … the AI will know how to respond, it knows the proper etiquette, it knows what to say, you just have to go through it, make sure it's kosher."" LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE COULD HAVE ‘FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS’ FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, EXPERTS SAYHe said the accuracy of AI will continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100% because AI ""simply doesn't know everything.""""People always think of it as a replacement, it's not it in the end,"" he said. ""In a human conversation, in the way we communicate, some parts are actually mechanical and redundant, so it can generate that part and leave you with special human touch that's so valuable.""From a financial standpoint, Sieg explained that analysts and portfolio managers make money by judgment, so it would be difficult to rely on a computer for human judgment calls on buy and sell decisions.      Panelists explained that AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one.  ((Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) / Getty Images)""I think they [employees] become better by partnering with a tool that can make them smarter, but I don't think it replaces them from that standpoint, not in our business.""In contrast, Rodney McMullen, the Chairman and CEO of The Kroger Co., said AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""We're about to see some major transformations arising from the fact that companies up until now had so much information, but no way for the information to be integrated and to be seen by any single entity and to be seen as a whole,"" Tulchinsky said. ""One thing that it can do is it can take a tremendous amount of information, digest it [and] summarize it. The insight of what's going on actually in the companies is increasing, which leads to better jobs, more satisfaction and much higher productivity.""

So in theory, you only need to spend 20% of the time doing equal amount of work.&quot; &quot;Occasionally you&apos;ll get an email that you kind of don&apos;t know how to respond to because something happens or it&apos;s an unusual circumstance &#x2026; the AI will know how to respond, it knows the proper etiquette, it knows what to say, you just have to go through it, make sure it&apos;s kosher.&quot;&#xA0; LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE COULD HAVE &#x2018;FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS&#x2019; FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, EXPERTS SAY He said the accuracy of AI will continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100% because AI &quot;simply doesn&apos;t know everything.&quot; &quot;People always think of it as a replacement, it&apos;s not it in the end,&quot; he said. &quot;In a human conversation, in the way we communicate, some parts are actually mechanical and redundant, so it can generate that part and leave you with special human touch that&apos;s so valuable.&quot; From a financial standpoint, Sieg explained that analysts and portfolio managers make money by judgment, so it would be difficult to rely on a computer for human judgment calls on buy and sell decisions.&#xA0;  &quot;I think they [employees] become better by partnering with a tool that can make them smarter, but I don&apos;t think it replaces them from that standpoint, not in our business.&quot; In contrast, Rodney McMullen, the Chairman and CEO of The Kroger Co., said AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one.&#xA0; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP &quot;We&apos;re about to see some major transformations arising from the fact that companies up until now had so much information, but no way for the information to be integrated and to be seen by any single entity and to be seen as a whole,&quot; Tulchinsky said. &quot;One thing that it can do is it can take a tremendous amount of information, digest it [and] summarize it.

IBM plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to replace 7,800 jobs over the next five years, CEO Arvind Krishna said in an interview, sparking fears of widespread job losses across industries.
“Comments, such as the ones Arvind made, validate the claims that AI can reduce support jobs and hence costs for the company. It will set the direction for other enterprises to look for similar opportunities in their support functions,” said Pareekh Jain, lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting.
IBM CEO on Tuesday told Bloomberg that the company was looking to cut down hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI.











 
 
 
These 26,000 roles, which are essentially non-customer facing jobs, include back office functions such as HR, the CEO said, adding that 30% of such roles, or approximately 7,800 jobs could be replaced with AI or automation over the next five years.

AI will replace 85 million jobs globally by 2025, according to The World Economic Forum’s The Future of Jobs report. While the report also predicts that AI may create 97 million new roles, it points out that the jobs AI will create will not be the same as the ones being lost.
IBM’s strategy to turn to AI is a good workforce strategy
Krishna’s comments on AI replacing humans come just months after the company said it would cut 3,900 jobs or 1.5% of its workforce. However, analysts believe it is high time mundane tasks are replaced with AI.











 
 
 
“If IBM is pausing 7,800 jobs that AI could do, it would be a good move for the company, as I wouldn’t think it was a good strategy to hire positions that could have been easily done by AI and automation in the first place,” said Lily Phan, research director at IDC.
In March, IBM spin-off and managed IT services provider Kyndryl said it was “eliminating” a small percentage of global roles in search of efficiency. The layoffs at Kyndryl were followed by job cuts at another IBM-owned firm, RedHat.
Large technology companies such as IBM have continued to reduce their headcount in search of efficiency and cost reduction in the wake of reducing revenue after they went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce.











 
 
 
Jain cautioned that the IBM CEO’s comments were more of a hope than a plan.
“This is just an approximation and extrapolation of current trends for the next five years. The actual numbers might not be that much or might take longer than five years. We don’t know what challenges will come up in scaling these early pilots around AI or AI implementation,” Jain said. “What Arvind has said is that he expects a 30% reduction in the next five years in the HR department headcount because of AI. At this point, I think it is a hope, not a plan.”
Mundane tasks will see automation
Giving examples of roles that are likely to be impacted in the next five years, Krishna said that mundane tasks such as employee verification or moving employees from one department to the other will be fully automated while other tasks such as measuring productivity would stay relevant for the next decade.











 
 
 
The roles that are likely to be impacted globally, according to analysts, don’t require human intelligence at all.
“What Arvind is talking about are the routine jobs that don’t require analysis and judgment and only require accessing information, transactions, and updating. These jobs are at risk as there is not much concern about bias or hallucinations,” Jain said.
“In fact, AI and automation have been impacting routine jobs slowly for quite some time like we see IVR [interactive voice response] or chatbot in customer support for information access and complaints. What generative AI has done is accelerated this development.”











 
 
 
Some analysts are more optimistic than others when it comes to the impact of AI on jobs. The scare of losing jobs to AI, according to IDC’s Phan, could be compared with the time when robots came to the fore.
“The same fears that robots would take up people’s jobs happened a few years ago, but in fact, we are having more jobs today than before. AI’s replacement of jobs would help to do mundane and manual tasks and leave more bespoke/customized tasks to employees that require human skills, relationships, connections, and emotional quotient,” Phan said.
Not all jobs will not be taken over by AI and its proliferation will see the creation of highly skilled jobs, added Deepika Giri, IDC’s head of AI research.











 
 
 
 “Although the looming anxiety around job losses is prevalent, it only will push the workforce to be re-aligned and trained with more relevant skill sets.”

If you ask them the questions in the right manner is where AI can actually help,"" Bhattacharya told IANS recently.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is ""a major advancement"".You Might Also Like:Indian job market to see 22 pc churn in 5 yrs; AI, machine learning among top roles: WEFGlobal technology company Zoho's CEO and co-founder Sridhar Vembu said that AI poses a serious threat to several programming jobs.Referring to the conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT and others, Vembu said that he has been saying internally for the past 4-5 years that ""ChatGPT, GPT4, and other AI being created today will first affect the jobs of many programmers"".According to Carl Benedikt Frey, future-of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, the only thing he is sure of is that ""there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI"".""What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles. Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work,"" Frey told BBC News.You Might Also Like:IBM to pause hiring in plan to replace 7,800 jobs with AIResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT, recently investigated the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs), on the US labour market.The findings revealed that around 80 per cent of the workforce could have at least 10 per cent of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19 per cent of workers may see at least 50 per cent of their tasks impacted.""We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software,"" the researchers noted.Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth.""Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15 per cent of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56 per cent of all tasks,"" they warned.Jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed to AI models, the study said.The World Economic Forum also predicts that AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation, and increased efficiency.Banks have already started incorporating AI into their business models. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organise its wealth management database.Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences, told the BBC that in 15 years, ""90 per cent of news will be written by machines"".Some tech firms have started hiring ""prompt managers"" to help with certain office tasks via AI chatbots.AI appears to be fast turning into a monster that will knock at our doors any time and according to experts, it is pertinent for the future workforce to learn AI skills.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikePlastic Surgeon: Fighting “Turkey Neck” After 60 Comes Down To This 1 ThingDon't let ""Turkey Neck"" make you look 10-15 years older than you actually are.Beverly Hills MDUndoIt's true drivers with daytime headlights should know this (Hint: it saves many money)Why haven't insurers told drivers this?

The arrival of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AGI) models have sparked a real, and bigger threat.What began as a conversational tool via prompts is likely to replace human workers doing certain jobs, beginning with industries like IT/software/tech and media/creative agencies and new-age platforms serving the digital economy.However, it is still early days for AI -- trained on large language models (LLMs) -- to take away jobs across the spectrum amid larger scrutiny but specific clues have emerged.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg in an interview this week:  I could easily see 30 per cent of jobs getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period. The tech giant has around 26,000 workers so nearly 7,800 jobs could be replaced by AI in the coming years.However, this transition won't be immediate and IBM will first pause hiring for those roles it deems could be replaced by AI, particularly those for back-office or non-customer facing roles, said its CEO.According to Arundhati Bhattacharya, CEO and Chairperson for Salesforce India and a former SBI Chairperson, generative artificial intelligence has a blessing in disguise as it can take away a lot of the grunge or repetitive work in India, and leave people to actually perform more creative work. What generative AI actually will help us do is actually curate things so that they can be made relevant to us. If you ask them the questions in the right manner is where AI can actually help,  Bhattacharya told IANS recently.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is  a major advancement .Global technology company Zoho's CEO and co-founder Sridhar Vembu said that AI poses a serious threat to several programming jobs.Referring to the conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT and others, Vembu said that he has been saying internally for the past 4-5 years that  ChatGPT, GPT4, and other AI being created today will first affect the jobs of many programmers .According to Carl Benedikt Frey, future-of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, the only thing he is sure of is that  there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI . What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles. Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work,  Frey told BBC News.Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT, recently investigated the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs), on the US labour market.The findings revealed that around 80 per cent of the workforce could have at least 10 per cent of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19 per cent of workers may see at least 50 per cent of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software,  the researchers noted.Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15 per cent of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56 per cent of all tasks,  they warned.Jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed to AI models, the study said.The World Economic Forum also predicts that AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation, and increased efficiency.Banks have already started incorporating AI into their business models. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organise its wealth management database.Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences, told the BBC that in 15 years,  90 per cent of news will be written by machines .Some tech firms have started hiring  prompt managers  to help with certain office tasks via AI chatbots.AI appears to be fast turning into a monster that will knock at our doors any time and according to experts, it is pertinent for the future workforce to learn AI skills.",,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/hr-policies-trends/ai-a-bigger-threat-than-automation-to-millions-of-job-seekers/articleshow/100038528.cms,AI a bigger threat than automation to millions of job-seekers,Careers,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential rate. Many leaders are scrambling to embrace this software revolution by integrating with AI-enabled plug-ins or incorporating AI-powered technology into their own enterprise platforms. 
4 Ways Generative AI Will Transform Software DevelopmentIncrease the use of low code solutions. 
Integrated AI will streamline cybersecurity efforts.
Accelerate digital transformations and improve remote work.
AI tools will become more effective through developer use.

Some leaders are concerned about the potentially significant impact of AI on human roles and have signed an open letter calling for a pause on the development of generative AI. One thing is clear: We are in the midst of a pivotal shift in software development and workflows across all industries. 
For developers, the emergence of generative AI’s language learning model will revolutionize code creation and become one of the most important tools for developers. Below are some of the ways that generative AI will benefit developers, improve security measures and lead to digital transformation. 
 
How Generative AI Will Benefit Developers 
As AI becomes more integrated into development tools and workflows, it will increase development speed, efficiency, creativity and accuracy. AI will become second-nature to developers and their processes throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), as it continues to become embedded and incorporated within the tools and workflows that developers use daily. Additionally, AI can automate tasks, playing a valuable role in addressing the ongoing challenges of talent shortages in organizations and quality control. 
Code production and code editing are two areas in which AI automation has truly benefited developers. Automatically generated code from AI is much like some of the writing we have seen from ChatGPT. It’s useful, speedily produced and requires human oversight to check the end results. Still, AI produced code cuts down on development time and helps reduce the potential for human error. AI assistance in code editing programs increases the speed with which we find and correct errors, a true asset in shortening the software development life cycle.
Due to recent bouts of tech layoffs and general economic uncertainty in the tech world, many development teams are facing significant pressure. What used to be handled by large teams in the past has now been condensed to a few highly skilled workers who are responsible for managing the workload of the entire team. This can sometimes result in tasks being deprioritized and developer burnout as engineers work extra hours to compensate for the reduced team size. Whether it’s editing code or automating administrative tasks such as testing, monitoring and checking for updates, AI can alleviate some of that pressure and free developers up to focus on more creative tasks.
AI tools that automate tasks will also help smaller developer teams scale their operations and compete with enterprises. Streamlining repetitive tasks will free their developers up to focus on more unique and differentiating solutions.

How Generative AI Will Improve Cybersecurity Measures
Cybersecurity AI is an area that will ultimately strengthen the internal processes within organizations. Incorporating security measures into the software development life-cycle (SDLC) is a crucial part of software development. However, many developers and cybersecurity professionals often struggle to shift left and focus on security early in the process. 
Once AI has been trained properly on security measures, it can help companies ensure compliance as the code is being written, resulting in stronger applications from the outset. As security becomes more integrated within the SDLC, developers will have more time to focus on the creative aspects of app ideation. 
Additionally, talent shortages can lead to an overwhelming workload and increase the potential for exposing vulnerabilities, which could result in a security breach. Generative AI and automation provide developers with confidence that their internal security systems are consistently being monitored for suspicious activity. 
In particular, generative AI can be used to create customized security models. These models can be trained on large data sets of historical security data to identify patterns and anomalies that may be indicative of a potential threat. Automation can then be used to implement these models in real-time, allowing for rapid detection and response to security threats. With this in place, vulnerability management won’t fall through the cracks.

4 Ways Generative AI Will Shape Software Development
DevOps will continue to evolve along with AI by becoming more mature and integrated into existing tools. For example, developers currently utilize IntelliCode, which is an AI-powered tool that recommends auto-completions during programming based on project analysis. 
Below are some more software development changes generative AI will create: 
 
1. Increase the Use of Low-Code Solutions. 
By taking advantage of mature software development kits (SDKs) and libraries like LEADTOOLS, developers and organizations will be able to integrate the eyes of AI into their applications. Other low-code tools and platforms such as Microsoft Power Apps and Google App Maker will also benefit from AI. 
Even less experienced developers will be able to quickly and efficiently build products and solutions with very powerful features, without requiring the extensive coding expertise and experience that would be needed otherwise. Additionally, this eliminates the need to hire more developers to maintain their products since that work can be offloaded to the SDK partner. 
 
2. Integrated AI Will STreamline Cybersecurity Efforts
The rise of remote work and digital transformation exposes more security vulnerabilities, as nefarious bad actors are also using generative AI to write malicious code. AI could be used to monitor network traffic and identify suspicious patterns or behaviors that could indicate a security breach. Most security companies are already working on AI and machine learning solutions to detect and prevent these threats.
 
3. Accelerate Digital Transformations and Improve Remote Work 
COVID-19 forced many organizations to rapidly adopt digital technologies and accelerate their capabilities by five-to-10 years. This acceleration will continue as more developers embrace the remote or hybrid lifestyle, and businesses will be required to adapt and stay competitive in the software market. 
Automating tedious and repetitive tasks will free up employees working remotely to focus on more complex and high-value work. Doing so will improve overall efficiency and productivity. AI-powered virtual assistants that manage schedules and prioritize tasks may also enhance the remote work experience.
 
4. AI Tools Will Become More Effective Through Developer Use
As AI solutions become more integrated into everyday processes and workflows, users will accelerate the growth of the algorithms with more data and feedback. Data sets will expand with consistent feedback and contribute to the maturity of this technology. Even the most incremental updates will seem monumental as this technology continues to evolve. 
As developers discover the benefits of incorporating generative AI into their workflows, their roles will likely shift. New technologies like this should be embraced, rather than feared. 
While every new technology needs regulation and refinement, AI is the next logical step in software development. From smaller companies being able to scale their products and compete with larger enterprises to the average developer streamlining their workflows, the opportunities for growth with AI are exponential. AI is simply another powerful tool in the developer’s toolbox and will increasingly become integrated into the core foundations of software development.

The man known as the ""godfather of artificial intelligence"" quit his job at Google so he could freely speak about the dangers of AI, the New York Times reported Monday.  Geoffrey Hinton, who worked with Google and mentors AI's rising stars, started looking at artificial intelligence more than 40 years ago, he told ""CBS Mornings"" in late March. He started working for the company in 2013, according to his Google Research profile. While at Google, he designed machine learning algorithms.""I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Hinton tweeted Monday. ""Google has acted very responsibly."" 






Many developers are working toward creating artificial general intelligence. Until recently, Hinton said he thought the world was 20-50 years away from it, but he now thinks developers ""might be"" close to computers being able to come up with ideas to improve themselves. ""That's an issue, right? We have to think hard about how you control that,"" he said in March.

Hinton has called for people to figure out how to manage technology that could greatly empower a handful of governments or companies.


""I think it's very reasonable for people to be worrying about these issues now, even though it's not going to happen in the next year or two,"" Hinton said. Hinton also told CBS he thought it wasn't inconceivable that AI could try to wipe out humanity.When asked about Hinton's decision to leave, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean told BBC News in a statement that the company remains committed to a responsible approach to AI.""We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,"" he said.


Google CEO Sundar Pichai has called for AI advancements to be released in a responsible way. In an April interview with ""60 Minutes,"" he said society needed to quickly adapt and come up with regulations for AI in the economy, along with laws to punish abuse.""This is why I think the development of this needs to include not just engineers, but social scientists, ethicists, philosophers and so on,"" Pichai told 60 Minutes. ""And I think we have to be very thoughtful. And I think these are all things society needs to figure out as we move along. It's not for a company to decide.""

See also Digital skills crucial for Africa’s 15m new jobs targetAI will create more jobs than it destroysAmong the 673 million current jobs corresponding to the dataset, this represents a net decrease of 14 million jobs, or 2% of current employment.Macro trends − including the green transition; environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards; localisation of supply chains; and tech advancements − are the leading drivers of job growth, states the report.Economic challenges − including high inflation, slower economic growth, supply shortages and inflation − pose the greatest threat, it adds.The fastest-growing jobs are forecast to be artificial intelligenceARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEGetting started with generative AI?

The largest absolute growth is expected in education, agriculture and digital commerce.“For people around the world, the past three years have been filled with upheaval and uncertainty for their lives and livelihoods, with COVID-19, geopolitical and economic shifts; and the rapid advancement of AI and other technologies are now risks adding more uncertainty,” says Saadia Zahidi, MD of the WEF.“The good news is that there is a clear way forward to ensure resilience. Governments and businesses must invest in supporting the shift to the jobs of the future through the education, reskilling and social support structures that can ensure individuals are at the heart of the future of work.”While technology continues to pose challenges and opportunities to labour markets, employers expect most technologies to contribute positively to job creation.According to the People’s Charter on Jobs in Africa, heavy investments in the technology and digital industries could see the creation of at least 15 million new jobs in Africa by 2025.Dr Suzanne Gildert, SingularityU faculty member in robotics and AI, believes human-like robots, which have the capability to accrue abilities, skills and knowledge the same way humans do, will in the long-term replace every job under the sun, as a result of advancements in robotics.According to The Future of Jobs Report 2023, the fastest-growing roles are being driven by big dataDATAData Sciences: Your Partner in Innovative IT Solutions. Transforming Data into Strategic Value. Visit us today! and AI, which are expected to create the highest number of future jobs, with 75% of survey respondents expecting job growth in this area.The employment of data analysts and scientists, big data specialists, AI machine learning specialists and cyber security professionals is expected to grow on average by 30% by 2027.“AI, a key driver of potential algorithmic displacement, is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and is expected to lead to high churn – with 50% of organisations expecting it to create job growth and 25% expecting it to create job losses,” it says.Training workers to utilise AI and big data will be prioritised by 42% of surveyed companies in the next five years, ranking behind analytical thinking (48%) and creative thinking (43%) in importance.This, as IBM announced this week that it expects to pause hiring for as many as 7 800 jobs, which could be replaced by AI in the coming years.Digital commerce will lead to the largest absolute gains in jobs: approximately two million new digitally-enabled roles are expected, such as e-commerce specialists, digital transformation specialists, and digital marketing and strategy specialists, notes the report.“But while expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, reasoning, communicating and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future.”Urgent reskilling, upskillingCompanies report that skills gaps and an inability to attract talent are the key barriers to transformation, showing a clear need for training and reskilling across industries, says the WEF.Six in 10 workers will require training before 2027, but only half of employees are seen to have access to adequate training opportunities today. At the same time, the report estimates that, on average, 44% of an individual worker’s skills will need to be updated.Strong cognitive skills are increasingly valued by employers, reflecting the growing importance of complex problem-solving in the workplace. The most important skills for workers in 2023 are seen to be analytical thinking and creative thinking, and this is expected to remain so in the next five years.“Our research found that individuals without degrees can acquire critical skills in a comparable time-frame to those with degrees, highlighting the potential for innovative approaches, such as industry micro-credentials and skills-based hiring, to tackle skills gaps and talent shortages,” says Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, who participated in the study.“However, it will require collective action from public and private sectors to provide the affordable, flexible reskilling pathways at scale that displaced workers need to transition into jobs of the future.”Rise of green jobsInvestment in the green transition and climate-change mitigation, as well as increasing consumer awareness of sustainability issues, are driving industry transformation and opening new opportunities in the labour market, says the report.It notes the strongest net job creation effects are expected to be driven by investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses, with more than half of respondents expecting this to occur. As countries seek more renewable energy sources, roles such as renewable energy engineers and solar energy installation and systems engineers will be in high demand, it adds.“Investment will also drive growth in more generalist sustainability roles, such as sustainability specialists and environmental protection professionals, which are expected to grow by 33% and 34%, respectively, translating to growth of approximately one million jobs,” says the WEF.Share",http://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/artificial-intelligence-revolution-to-displace-83m-jobs-by-2027/KPNG878NVmeq4mwD,,2023-05-02T11:54:58+02:00,2024-05-20T09:26:55+02:00,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'ITWeb', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/contributors/organizations/2010/11/resized/itweb-logo-c.xl.gif'}, 'description': 'Business technology news and information portal for South Africa’s tech professionals and decision makers.'}","['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/05/future-factory-2023.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/05/fastest-growing-jobs-2023.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/05/top-10-skills-2023.png']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sibahle Malinga', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/contributors/62j5alrMQl7pYQk1'}]",,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Artificial intelligence revolution to displace 83m jobs by 2027', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/artificial-intelligence-revolution-to-displace-83m-jobs-by-2027/KPNG878NVmeq4mwD'}]",,Artificial intelligence revolution to displace 83m jobs by 2027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATRICK T. FALLON / AFP   Like every innovation, artificial intelligence (AI) fuels fears of job destruction. While the ChatGPT program is arousing the interest of the general public and awakening the appetite of investors, a World Economic Forum survey published on Sunday, April 30, estimated that 14 million jobs will be lost worldwide on balance over the next five years (69 million created and 83 million destroyed), i.e. 2% of total employment. It anticipates that nearly a quarter of employees will change jobs, mainly due to the advent of new technologies. The authors of the study based their estimates on information collected from 803 companies worldwide employing 11.3 million people. The most significant job creation is in the education sector (+10%), and agriculture (especially machine operators), while job losses are mainly in administrative tasks, such as accounting services.  In recent months, there has been an increasing number of reports on the impact of AI on business. In a study published at the end of March, Goldman Sachs predicted that in the United States and Europe, the most affected areas, nearly two-thirds of jobs are ""exposed to some degree of AI automation."" A quarter of them could be automated. The US investment bank added that the increase in productivity alone could mean GDP growth of 7% over the next 10 years. In collaboration with the American University of Pennsylvania, OpenAI, the company that is developing ChatGPT, predicted that for 19% of occupations, especially those with the highest salaries, at least half of the tasks will be affected by so-called ""generative"" artificial intelligence. However, the researchers noted that the potential for new discoveries, behavioral changes, and technological developments can all affect the accuracy and reliability of predictions. 'Efficiency gains' These estimates are fragile and uncertain, as the adoption of new technologies is so unpredictable. In its report, the World Economic Forum noted that ""businesses introducing automation into their operations at a slower pace than previously anticipated"" compared to 2020. The authors refered to a two-speed automation. ""But while expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, reasoning, communicating, and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future,"" they wrote.  Reassuring voices are also being raised to affirm that AI will not have a destructive effect. At the Hannover Fair (Germany), a major trade show that brought together manufacturers from around the world from April 17 to 21, Tony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, explained that the new technologies would assist workers by helping them identify production defects. The boss concluded that they would ""not replace anyone"" and would instead deliver ""efficiency gains."" Dr. Jochen Köckler, Chairman of the Managing Board of Deutsche Messe AG, added  AI can trigger a boost in efficiency in industrial manufacturing, while at the same time reducing the pressure on companies in Germany and Europe that are facing shortages of skilled workers.""

The 36-year-old data-science specialist works in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most coveted experience on the planet after OpenAI demonstrated the breakthroughs of ChatGPT. Chopra, who works outside of New Delhi, sees friends in the field get pay hikes of 35% to 50% each time they switch jobs. “There’s a real shortage of data and AI talent,” he said.An AI hiring frenzy is ricocheting around the world, from Silicon Valley to Europe, Asia and beyond. While tech giants like Google and Baidu Inc dangle top-notch packages for the engineers to build their own AI engines, companies in almost every other field — from health care and finance to entertainment — are staffing up too, to avoid getting blindsided by shifts in their industries.India, perhaps more than any other country, illustrates how the rush for talent is outstripping supply. The country of 1.4 billion people has long been the back office for the tech industry, a source of reinforcements for any emergency. But now even the world’s most populous nation is running out of the data scientists, machine-learning specialists and skilled engineers that companies are looking for.There’s an “insatiable need for talent,” said Rahul Shah, co-founder of WalkWater Talent Advisors, a headhunter for top-level workers. “AI can’t be outsourced, it’s core to the organization.”Recruitment stories verge on the absurd. In one search Shah’s firm just handled, the new employer more than doubled a candidate’s pay. Freedom Dumlao, chief technology officer of Flexcar, interviewed one engineer who said a rival suitor had offered him a BMW motorcycle as a sign-on bonus. “That’s a line I’m not comfortable approaching,” Dumlao said.India’s tech industry is built on a plentiful supply of affordable workers. Companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd invented the model for modern outsourcing, in which Western companies tap engineers halfway around the world to handle support, services and software, typically at a fraction of the cost of local workers. There are now more than five million people employed in tech services in India, according to the trade group Nasscom. Powerhouses like Google, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc set up their own operations in India, hiring locals by the thousands. Google, now part of Alphabet Inc. started with five employees in the country in 2004 and now employs nearly 10,000. But this seemingly endless supply of labor is running short in critical fields. There are about 416,000 people working in AI and data science in the country —- and demand for another 213,000, according to Nasscom’s estimates. “The proportion of unfilled job roles is approximately 51% of the current installed talent base,” it said in a February report, flagging the crunch as a risk to growth.It’s likely to get worse. India added 66 tech innovation centers, so-called global capability centers or captives, last year taking the total to nearly 1,600. These GCCs that used to handle tasks like IT support and customer support have morphed into in-house centers for business-critical technology — like AI. In the first three months of 2023, asset manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP, car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc, entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery Inc and aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney set up R&D hubs in Bangalore, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Walmart Inc.“ChatGPT has driven the larger domain of artificial intelligence out of stealth mode,” said Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of ANSR Consulting, which helps design and establish technology centers for corporations. Last year, Dallas-headquartered ANSR set up 18 such captives in India; Ahuja expects that number to hit 25 this year. “Many enterprises which have India captives are accelerating their AI road map to derive a competitive edge.” Companies large and small are trying to figure out how AI will affect their fates. Can ChatGPT predict future demand with newfound accuracy? Will deep learning technologies prove better at medical diagnosis than any doctor today? Could trading algorithms be fine-tuned to the point finance companies with the best technologies will drive their rivals out of business?“The talent crunch is going to worsen in the next year or two,” said Biswajeet Mahapatra, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. India has the second largest pool of highly-skilled AI, machine learning and big data talent, according to the February report by Nasscom, after the US. It produces 16% of the world’s AI talent pool, placing it among the top three talent markets with the US and China. Dumlao of Flexcar, a Boston-based car subscription startup, says that’s not enough. He has been hunkering down in Bangalore for the past three months trying to assemble a team of data engineers and computer-vision specialists for the startup’s data science hub in the city. Flexcar’s team of 60 engineers helps build AI applications to automatically detect damage when vehicles are returned. The startup has embraced ChatGPT and is piloting a chatbot to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles by querying trained bots. “Bangalore has incredible data engineering talent and the AI talent hunt is only going to intensify,” said Dumlao. The tricky thing is to persuade prized engineers that his startup is their most attractive option. “The freshest ideas and the newest innovations will sprout wherever there’s a concentration of talent,” he said.Dumlao’s competitors come in all shapes and sizes. Chilean retailer Falabella SA is the first Latin American company to open a captive in India for data analytics, AI and machine learning. “We have to compete with the best of the best,” said Ashish Grover, its Santiago-based chief information officer. The efforts are paying off: a personalized customer platform now accounts for over half the incremental sales from digital targeting. An AI-fueled recommendation engine has driven three times more conversions on its mobile app. Home improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc.’s captive tech center in Bangalore helps embed AI into its products, and all its technology will be built “AI first,” said Ankur Mittal, managing director of Lowe’s India. For instance, the team’s predictive algorithms help decide pricing, and fine-tune search features on Lowes.com. The Bangalore hub’s AI-powered computer vision uses videos and imagery from store cameras to help address shoplifting and analyze store footfalls.This being India, many workers are trying to retrain themselves to land a coveted job in AI. Data engineer Deepak Kapoor, who works for a startup called Thinkbumblebee Analytics, is studying up on computer vision and large language models to move into deep learning, where job opportunities are plentiful. He thinks he could easily double his salary in a city like Bangalore.Mahapatra, Forrester’s adviser to global chief information officers, anticipates years of rising demand for skilled workers. India is certain to benefit from the rush to high employees who understand this new world. “We haven’t even touched the tip of the AI iceberg,” he says.",,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/fierce-artificial-intelligenceai-talent-war-shifts-to-india-with-salaries-being-doubled/articleshow/99973817.cms,Fierce artificial intelligence(AI) talent war shifts to India with salaries being doubled,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-99973977,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-31368,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/99973817'}",

Over the next five years, nearly a quarter of all jobs will change as a result of AI, digitization and other economic developments like the green energy transition and supply chain re-shoring, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in Geneva on Monday. While the study expects AI to result in &ldquo;significant labor-market disruption,&rdquo; the net impact of most technologies will be positive over the next five years as big data analytics, management technologies and cybersecurity become the biggest drivers of employment growth.         The emergence of AI applications like ChatGPT, which uses machines to simulate human reasoning and problem solving, will have a particularly pronounced impact by displacing and automating many roles that involve reasoning, communicating and coordinating, the report said. Some 75% of surveyed companies said they expect to adopt AI technologies over the next five years, which they predict will eliminate up to 26 million jobs in record-keeping and administrative positions &mdash; think cashiers, ticket clerks, data entry and accounting. The WEF study surveyed more than 800 companies that collectively employ 11.3 million workers across 45 economies from all over the world. For now, AI remains a smaller threat to labor prospects than other macroeconomic factors like slower economic growth, supply shortages and inflation, the report said. Opportunities for job creation will likely come from investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses, the broader application of ESG standards and a broad reorientation of global supply chains, it said.

Here's how the writers strike is pushing back.,Artificial intelligence could drastically change Hollywood. Here's how the writers strike is pushing back.,N/A,N/A,"By Simmone ShahUpdated: May 4, 2023 2:44 PM EDT | Originally published: May 4, 2023 2:44 PM EDTThe last time the Writers Guild of America went on strike, in 2007, workers pushed back against the nascent streaming industry, advocating for higher residual payments for content released over streaming. Now a new technology, artificial intelligence, stands to drastically change Hollywood again as Guild strikers return to the picket line.Streaming giants like Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+ have come to dominate the industry, changing the models by which content is produced and distributed and making it increasingly difficult for writers to earn a sustainable income. And as artificial intelligence technology rapidly improves, the WGA aims to place limits on the use of AI in movies and TV scripts.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) —which is negotiating the contract on behalf of Hollywood studios, streamers, and production companies—say their priority is “the long-term health and stability of the industry” and they are dedicated to reaching “a fair and reasonable agreement” according to the Associated Press.“AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone…” the AMPTP said in an emailed statement to TIME. “It’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.”The WGA proposed regulations around the use of AI to create source material and write, or rewrite, literary material. A negotiations proposal chart released by WGA on Monday shows that AMPTP rejected their proposal, instead countering with “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.” (The WGA did not respond to requests for comment as of publication.)Writers in other fields should be paying attention to the WGA negotiations. Here's the current position on the use of AI. pic.twitter.com/MWuo6AwKBt— Hari Kunzru (@harikunzru) May 2, 2023
A Pivotal MomentThe battle over AI is just one aspect of the union’s demands around ensuring fair compensation in the streaming age. (The guild’s top priorities are fighting for increased compensation and residuals.) But any limits on AI technology, or lack thereof, have the possibility to impact the future of the industry for decades to come—especially as tools powered by artificial intelligence becomes increasingly commercialized.“Politically, we are at the precipice of when [AI technology] will be institutionalized.” says Alex Hanna, Director of Research at the Distributed AI Research Institute. “Once they are institutionalized, it’s hard to get rid of it.”Though AI technology is not new, it has rapidly become mainstream, as companies push to adopt the technology. “[We’re seeing a] rapid push to release these systems into commercial use, often without very much pre-testing or evaluation of whether they even work as planned,” says Sarah Myers West, Managing Director of AI Now Institute.Jobs on the Line?The commercial adoption is raising questions across sectors about the potential for job cuts. “It’s not so much about what AI is going to do, but what companies are going to use AI to justify,” says Myers West. Studios could have fewer people in the writers’ room, with generative AI writing content that is later edited by a writer. “They could use AI to create a first draft and then bring in someone else to do a second draft. And that devalues their work by not having them do that whole process,” says Meyers West.Experts say that the technology is not yet advanced enough to replace a writer entirely, but it could reduce a creative practice into something akin to copywriting. “AI isn’t necessarily going to replace the job, but it would make it more mundane,” says Meyers West.A Challenge Across IndustriesIn recent months, creatives across industries have been sounding the alarm on the encroachment of artificial intelligence. Many artificial intelligence systems use the work of creatives to teach the tools to generate something similar, raising concerns around intellectual property.The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) released a statement in March requiring the bargaining of the use of artificial intelligence to simulate an actor’s performance, noting that “human creators are the foundation of the creative industries and we must ensure that they are respected and paid for their work.” And just a week after Universal Music Group asked services to prevent AI companies from “scraping” music to create imitations, an AI-created Drake and The Weeknd collab fooled the Internet.Though WGA is one of the first creative labor unions to take on AI, it’s likely to be joined by others soon. “I imagine we’ll see more of this in fields like journalism or graphic design, positions that could be automated with intense human correction afterwards,” says Hanna. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As he leaves office, Hinton has shared two concerns related to the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.According to an interview with The New York Times (via The Verge), Hinton said that his immediate concern is the spread of misinformation and in the longer run, he’s worried about humanity's existence.He warned that AI will eliminate jobs and possibly humanity itself as it begins to write and run its own code. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” Hinton was quoted as saying. 99851036“But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that,” he added.Hinton regrets his life's workHinton recently quit his job at Google after being employed by Google for more than a decade. He said that a part of him regrets his life's work.“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have. It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” he said.He won the 2018 Turing Award for their foundational work that led to the current boom in AI.Hinton joined Google after the company acquired a firm started by Hinton and two of his students. One of his students became chief scientist at OpenAI. 99638620Hinton was happy until...The interview by the New York Times noted that Hinton was happy with Google's success with the technology until Microsoft launched the new OpenAI-infused Bing. The launch challenged Google’s core business and reportedly sparked a “code red” in the search giant office. According to Hinton, such fierce competition might be impossible to stop and it could result in a world with much fake imagery and text that nobody will be able to tell “what is true anymore.”What Google has to say“We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,"" Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, said in a statement.99686718In fact, Hinton also heaped praise on Google saying the company “has acted very responsibly.”“In the NYT today, Cade Metz implies that I left Google so that I could criticize Google. Actually, I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google. Google has acted very responsibly,” he said in a tweet.",,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/godfather-of-ai-quits-google-has-an-artificial-intelligence-warning-for-all/articleshow/99913126.cms,"'Godfather of AI' quits Google, has an artificial intelligence 'warning' for all",,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-99913129,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-8578,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/99913126'}",
