Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are not merely theoretical advances; they are practical tools recalibrating the fundamental operation of our economies.


The recently released World Economic Forum white paper, Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs, developed in collaboration with Accenture, casts a spotlight on this transformation, highlighting the tasks and jobs that will be augmented and those that will be automated. Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep-learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate content, approaching human-level proficiency.

Augmenting Human Capabilities
Fields such as engineering, scientific analysis and mathematics would see professionals focusing on high-value creative tasks while AI systems manage the more routine operations. The augmentation of human capacity in such roles leads to a more rewarding work environment that benefits employees and catalyzes innovation while embracing what it means to be human.

PROMOTED
On the other hand, jobs centered around repetitive language tasks may be impacted by automation. Occupations such as credit authorizers, checkers and clerks could see up to four-fifths of their tasks automated. At the same time, jobs requiring a high degree of personal interaction, such as education and career counselling, will probably be much less impacted by the adoption of LLMs. And as LLMs are adopted more widely, new roles – AI developers, AI content creators and specialists in AI ethics, to name a few – will emerge as well.
These are the findings of an extensive analysis examining 19,000 tasks across 867 occupations. It echoes the findings of the Future of Jobs Report 2023, which anticipates significant job alterations in the next half-decade.

First, foresight and adaptability must be the cornerstones of organizational strategies. Comprehending the implications of leveraging LLMs, negative and positive, is the first step towards a future where technology augments human capabilities.

Second, businesses need to strengthen internal workforce planning and invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling workers towards growing roles, while recruiting new talent in growing jobs.
Policy-makers have a role to play, too, particularly in guiding the development of education and training programs that prepare workers for the jobs that will benefit the most from LLMs. Social safety nets and other forms of assistance will need to be in place as current workers retool and retrain, particularly for those most likely to be affected.
Our AI-augmented future holds great promise. The evolving symbiosis between humans and large language models, and generative AI more broadly, has the potential to create value but only if we guide this transition collaboratively. The onus to capitalize on the opportunities while diligently navigating the challenges falls on all of us – business leaders, policymakers and employees alike.

Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of news organisations surveyed in a new global report published today (20 September) on AI and the media believe generative AI (genAI), such as ChatGPT or Google Bard, presents new opportunities for journalism. 
The new report, Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with AI, from the JournalismAI initiative at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) surveyed over 100 news organisations from 46 countries about their engagement with AI and associated technologies. The survey was conducted between April and July 2023.
Around 85 per cent of survey respondents - including journalists, technologists and managers at news organisations - have at the very least experimented with genAI to help with tasks such as writing code, image generation and authoring summaries.
Some respondents noted that AI can help free up capacity for more creative work by helping with time-intensive tasks such as interview transcription and fact-checking. A France based  AI strategy analyst who was part of the survey, noted: “GenAI can change the way we interact with information, allowing us to grasp massive amounts of data, and level the playing field between high and low data skills.”
Respondents pointed out the affordances of genAI technologies, such as their accessibility, low requirements for technical skills, and what was described as their ability to understand “context”, which make them stand out from other AI technologies that generally require deep specialist expertise in areas like programming.
Despite these opportunities, respondents recognised the need for any AI generated content to be checked by a human to mitigate potential harms like bias and inaccuracy. A debunking editor at a Spanish fact checking platform noted: “No matter how advanced AI becomes, human criteria will always be essential in the whole fact-checking process.”
More than 60 per cent of respondents noted their concern about the ethical implications of AI on journalistic values including accuracy, fairness and transparency and other aspects of journalism. 
While newsrooms globally contend with challenges related to AI integration, the challenges are more pronounced for newsrooms in the Global South. Respondents highlighted language, infrastructural, and political challenges. They noted how the social and economic benefits of AI tend to be geographically concentrated in the Global North, where there is better infrastructure and easier access to resources. Meanwhile, many countries in the Global South grapple with the social, cultural, and economic repercussions of post-independence colonialism. 
A Philippines based respondent commented: “AI technologies developed have been predominantly available in English, but not in many Asian languages…We have to catch up doubly to create AI systems, and AI systems that work with our local languages.”  
With 80 per cent of respondents expecting an increased use of AI in their newsrooms, the report’s authors believe this is a crucial opportunity “for ‘good’ journalists to do more ‘human’ work with the support of AI.”
Commenting on the findings, co-author and Director of JournalismAI Professor Charlie Beckett said: “Journalism around the world is going through another period of exciting and scary technological change. Our survey shows that the new generative AI tools are a potential threat to the integrity of information and the news media. But they also offer an incredible opportunity to make journalism more efficient, effective and trustworthy. This survey is a fascinating snapshot of the news media at a critical juncture in its history.”
Co-author and lead researcher Mira Yaseen added: “It was truly enriching to engage with more than 100 media organisations that vary in size, region, language, mission and business model, and listen to their experiences with and concerns about AI integration in journalism. 
“We’ve known that it’s a double edged sword, like almost everything, but what came through more clearly in our report this year was the global AI disparity. Currently, the economic and social benefits of AI are concentrated in the Global North and its harms disproportionately affect the Global South (e.g. algorithmic bias), exacerbating global inequality. If we are serious about benefiting from AI in an equitable manner, it is imperative that we adopt a power-conscious framing of global AI development and adoption, which is often absent in discussions about AI. Our report attempts to do this in Chapter six by paying special attention to the challenges faced by the global majority.”

More than 860 confirmed they were using AI and other automated technology, with 78% of those companies reporting this had resulted directly in the creation of new jobs.Technologies also increased the need for new skills, reported 83% of businesses, while 69% said they believed they improved job quality either a little or a lot.“This report not only highlights that the adoption of AI is well under way across UK firms, but also that it is possible for this tech transformation to lead to both net job creation, and more ‘good work’ – great news as we try to solve the UK’s productivity puzzle,” said Anna Thomas, director of IFOW.The report’s findings appear to be at odds with concerns about the possibility of AI-induced job losses, and with what the document describes as “dramatic, speculative headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robots”.Wired differently: how neurodiversity adds new skillsets to the workplaceRead moreProf James Hayton, lead author of the report, said: “At least from a research perspective, the story is already changing. The challenge is that it’s not quite so interesting to say ‘well, robots are taking our jobs sometimes, but it depends’, as it is to say ‘in 30 years there will be no jobs at all’.“The evidence we really have about this is that technology tends to create new jobs and upskill jobs. Yes, it does downskill and disrupt other jobs, but in the long run, there tends to be a positive impact on the economy.”While 47% of respondents said AI and automation had eliminated positions within their company, almost 67% reported the technology had created new positions.The report, which was prepared by the Pissarides Review into the Future of Work, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation, found equal rates of adoption among businesses for both physical and non-physical tasks.Despite the positive responses from businesses, the report said the pace at which automation was spreading through the labour market could – if not properly addressed – exacerbate regional inequalities across the UK and lead to “serious erosions in job quality”.“This technology will spread broadly and rapidly through the economy, and therefore we would expect an equally rapid impact on some jobs,” Hayton said. “Society will have to adjust quickly to these issues, quicker than we’ve ever had to adjust before.”Whether adopting technology has a positive or negative impact on workers depends on what is known as regional innovation readiness – the levels of investment in a particular region, and the levels of education among that region’s workers, said the report.“In the context of the levelling up agenda, we know there are regions that do much better, such as the south-east and London, and also the second and third cities in these regions,” said Hayton. “This is compared to, say, the far south-west or far north-west. In our study, it’s quite clear that these regions have a lower level of readiness in terms of investment in education and investment in technology infrastructure.”To help insure against these negative outcomes, the report urges firms and policymakers to focus on human resource practices which invest in workers, and which focus on augmenting their capabilities through automation, rather than replacing them.“The more you invest in your workforce, the more likely they are to be able to successfully utilise these technologies, because they’ve got more skills,” Hayton said. “They’re more flexible, more willing to learn, more confident that you’re not going to fire them. And, therefore, it’s going to be easier to successfully implement the new technology.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workArtificial intelligence (AI)RobotsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceLiveUS elections live updates: Poll shows Harris outperforming Biden against Trump – but former president still has an edge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) will change the software industry, particularly the engineering and sales and marketing functions.
Nearly two-thirds of software engineers say that they expect productivity gains of 20% or more, and many are already deploying AI coding assistants.
About 39% of software companies said that the biggest barrier is the lack of technical skills, so an early investment in upskilling talent could offer a competitive edge.
AI will also help automate sales to smaller businesses and consumers, allowing for smarter self-service.











This article is part of Bain's 2023 Technology Report.


Explore the report 





Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve productivity across industries and business functions, with some estimating that about 20% of all work tasks could be completed faster and at equal quality with assistance from generative AI.
In the software industry, engineering and go-to-market (GTM) functions are among the areas most likely to benefit from AI over the next 18 months. The technology will change how work gets done and also the mix of talent and skills necessary to make it happen.
Because these productivity gains are accessible to every company, they are unlikely to make technology companies structurally more profitable. Firms will instead likely feel the competitive pressure to use productivity gains to build new product—and build it faster, in order to keep up with or outcompete the market. While a small portion of AI productivity gains may flow to the bottom line, most is likely to be reinvested in the business (see Figure 1).



Figure 1




















More than 90% of engineering and go-to-market executives expect gains from AI to be reinvested back into the business











More productive engineering teams
Software engineers see potential for generative AI in comprehending, developing, testing, and documenting code, as well as improving data quality and building user stories that articulate how a feature will provide value. About 57% of the software engineers we surveyed said that they anticipate 20% or better productivity gains from generative AI use cases over the next two years (see Figure 2).
To take advantage of AI and its productivity potential, companies will need to integrate commercial large language models (LLMs)—or in certain cases develop their own LLMs. About 39% of those surveyed said that the biggest barrier to benefiting from AI is a lack of technical skills—especially AI language model training, engineering chains of AI model prompts, machine learning model testing and operations, and data engineering of unstructured data assets. Some of these skills are new capabilities, so an early investment in helping employees develop these skills should be a near-term focus for companies.
As companies seek out the necessary capabilities, their talent mix is likely to shift. They will need more engineering talent for AI and machine learning, particularly with experience building or integrating LLMs. Since these are comparatively new skills, scarcity is likely to continue for some time, underlining the importance of upskilling the existing workforce. The outlook for other engineering roles may remain the same as or less than today (see Figure 3).



Figure 2




















Nearly 60% of software engineers expect AI to improve productivity by more than 20% over the next two years














Figure 3




















Engineering leaders expect the talent mix to shift over the next two years











More automated sales and marketing
Generative AI will change the way that companies market and sell their products and services as it enables significant automation across every step of the customer life cycle. In particular, demand and lead generation, digital self-service sales, customer success, and other support activities all have the potential to benefit from the types of automation that generative AI enables (see Figure 4).
Among the GTM executives we surveyed, 64% believe that consumer sales will see a significant amount of automation over the next two years, partly because they are less customized. Automation in business-to-business sales will vary by segment, but 40% of GTM executives see lots of potential for automation in sales to small and medium businesses. More complex sales at the midmarket and enterprise levels are less ideal for automation, although one-third of the GTM executives surveyed expect to see high levels of automation here, too. More than half of the GTM executives we surveyed believe that generative AI may enable them to serve some customers with a lower-touch or self-service model, ultimately reducing the number of customers served by a more manually intensive, bespoke enterprise effort.

No company can afford to sit back and watch how its competitors and vendors deploy generative AI. The rapid adoption of this technology is changing the basis of competition, and senior leaders should be acting now to understand its strategic implications. Most companies will need to invest significantly in talent to take advantage of generative AI, hiring new engineers and improving the capabilities of their current workforce. Executives will also need to decide how to distribute resources across key areas such as security, data platforms, and experimentation teams, and they will need to find the right balance of investment across customer-facing uses and internal productivity. Making key decisions now will help firms find, train, and retain the talented people they will need to support the evolving generative AI–enabled business model.

From automating mundane tasks to generating novel solutions, these technologies are empowering legal professionals across various industries and domains to achieve more with less. But how do professionals perceive the impact of generative AI on the legal industry? What are the opportunities and challenges they face as they adopt these technologies? And what are the skills and strategies they need to thrive in the future of work? To answer these questions, we conducted a survey of professionals from different sectors and backgrounds, asking them about their perspectives on the current and future state of AI in their industry. We also asked them about the areas where AI has the most potential to help them meet their goals, and if AI would hinder their progress in the same areas. In this blog, we will share a few of the key findings and insights from our new report, “Future of Professionals”, and discuss the implications for legal professionals who want to leverage AI to transform their work and business.  Future of Professionals ReportHow AI is the Catalyst for Transforming Every Aspect of WorkView report  AI as a catalyst for growth Bringing together macro- and organizational trends, we asked legal professionals about the areas in which AI had the most potential to help firms and departments meet their goals, and if AI would hinder progress in the same areas. Not surprisingly, the majority reported net-positive impacts in most areas. They perceive AI as a catalyst for growth.  Legal professionals in both law firms and corporations see AI as having the ability to enable growth opportunities. For law firms, AI reduces friction to launch new services or expand into new markets. For example, AI potentially can free up time for professionals to identify and evaluate attractive markets for expansion. For corporate departments, AI can free up their time to dedicate to supporting their organization’s strategy and growth objectives. To take advantage of all the opportunities that AI offers, and to mitigate the challenges that it poses, legal professionals need to adopt a proactive and strategic approach to the future of work. Here are some of the recommendations we propose based on our survey findings: Embrace lifelong learning and upskilling, and seek to develop a combination of technical, cognitive, and social skills that will enable you to work effectively with AI. Define the role and scope of AI in your work, and identify the tasks that could, or should be automated, augmented, or delegated to machines and the tasks that require human oversight, judgment, and creativity. Consider the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and adhere to the principles of responsible and ethical AI, such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy. AI is transforming the legal profession in unprecedented ways, creating new possibilities and challenges. Our survey revealed expectations and concerns for the future of work, and the areas where AI has the most potential to help or hinder their goals.  Read the full report to help you prepare for the future of work with confidence and optimism.  Read the full report now.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceBusiness DevelopmentInnovationLegal TopicsTechnology",,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published: 12 Jul 2024


 
Until recently, most AI applications used predictive engines to correlate data or make decisions. Although various forms of generative AI have existed for decades, interest within enterprises was mild due to limited capabilities.







The recent success of ChatGPT, which demonstrated the ability to create nuanced and articulated content at scale, highlighted the potential value of generative AI across the enterprise. As a result, executives and business users are starting to make generative AI and predictive AI complementary domains.
Generative AI creates content, code, music and marketing material and can translate data into different formats. Predictive AI makes predictions, recommendations and decisions using various AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Technically speaking, generative AI often uses many predictive processes to incrementally predict the next unit of content within a result. When discussing generative AI vs. predictive AI, the main differences between the two domains are use cases and proficiency with unstructured and structured data, respectively.

Key differences between predictive AI and generative AI
""Generative AI and predictive AI represent distinct paradigms within the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning,"" said Bharath Thota, partner in the advanced analytics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.

Generative AI focuses on creating new and original content, such as images, text and other media, by learning from existing data patterns. It fosters creativity and is valuable in creative fields and novel problem-solving.
Predictive AI uses patterns in historical data to forecast future outcomes or classify future events. It provides actionable insights and aids in decision-making and strategy formulation.
""These approaches are not isolated and can prove to be symbiotic in developing an overarching business strategy,"" Thota said. Generative AI can help design product features, while predictive AI can forecast consumer demand or market response for these features. Generative AI can synthesize realistic data to enhance a predictive model's training set to improve predictive capabilities.

Inna Kuznetsova

Predictive AI forecasts future events by analyzing historical data trends to assign probability weights to the models. Generative AI creates new data, which might be in the form of text and images. ""Think of the first [predictive AI] as a powerful analyst doing magic with numbers, while the second [generative AI] is a creative kind -- a writer, an artist or an assistant in research,"" said Inna Kuznetsova, CEO at ToolsGroup, a supply chain planning and optimization firm.
It's helpful to frame predictive AI as helping to predict whether a certain event will occur as a solution to a classification problem -- such as a loan default -- and forecast the quantitative impact of multiple events on continuous variables as a regression problem, such as credit card portfolio analysis, said Arun Ramchandran, president and global head of consulting and GenAI practice at IT services and solutions provider Hexaware. These solutions are mostly based on structured data from past events.

Arun Ramchandran

In contrast, generative AI is designed to generate novel content based on user input and the unstructured data on which it's trained. These models might provide answers, but more as an opinion with qualitative reasoning.
Ramchandran said generative AI can complement predictive AI in the enterprise to derive value from both structured and unstructured data. Here, predictive models are used to improve business processes and outcomes, while generative models are employed to meet the content requirements of those processes. However, care is required for data governance, security and privacy. In addition, this combination might be used in forecasting for synthetic data generation, data augmentation and simulations.


What is generative AI and how does it work?
Generative AI creates new content using various algorithms pioneered in the mid-2010s that have strengths for different use cases. Among these algorithms are the following:

Generative adversarial networks to create images, synthesize voices, and translate voices and video for use in different languages.
Variational autoencoders to generate structured data.
Diffusion models to generate imagery and videos in response to prompts.
Large language models (LLMs) that excel in text generation; however, newer multimodal approaches can translate across domains, such as creating images, writing code, programming robots and crafting automation in response to a text prompt.



Benefits of generative AI
Some of the key benefits of generative AI include the following:

Automates code generation and other aspects of software development.
Simplifies new content generation.
Summarizes complex documents or data sets.
Easily works with unstructured data.
Creates articulate and simple answers to complex queries.
Works well across different modalities such as text, video, audio, robot instructions and data formats.



Limitations of generative AI
Some of the limitations of generative AI include the following:

Propensity to hallucinate.
Heavy carbon footprint.
Can be expensive to retrain models.
Difficult to remove sensitive data once it's baked into a model.
More challenging to explain or interpret the mechanisms underpinning results.



Generative AI applications in business
Some of the most common generative AI applications in business include the following:

Generating code.
Crafting marketing materials.
Searching multiple manuals.
Personalizing content for customers and employees.
Customizing learning experiences.
Translating data across formats.
Customizing explanations for different levels of expertise or roles.
Localization of content across different geographies and languages.
Researching complex topics.
Distilling and summarizing risks across different domains in risk management.
Summarizing resumes to streamline candidate selection.
Managing skills taxonomies in learning and development.
Summarizing patterns in call center interactions.
Simplifying complex UIs to simple text prompts.



What is predictive AI and how does it work?
""Predictive AI focuses on making decisions based on historical data and current information,"" said Owen Morris, director of enterprise architecture at cloud consultancy Doherty Associates.

Owen Morris

It's used in various applications such as predicting financial market trends, equipment maintenance scheduling and anomaly detection. Predictive AI offers great value across different business applications, including fraud detection, preventive maintenance, recommendation systems, churn prediction, capacity management and logistics optimization.
Predictive AI uses most ML and AI algorithms outside the scope of those used for generative AI, including the following:

Neural networks for a variety of tasks.
Linear regression to find correlations.
Logistic regression to classify data.
Support vector machines to classify data.
Decision trees to estimate outcomes.
Random forests to classify data.
K-means clustering to sort data into groups.
Self-trained naive Bayes classifier to classify data.



Benefits of predictive AI
Some of the benefits of predictive AI include the following:

Automates analytics.
Simplifies complex analysis.
Streamlines data processing.
Works with structured data.
Can improve analysis for well-understood use cases.
Works well for structured and time series data.



Limitations of predictive AI
""While predictive AI emerged as a game changer in the analytics landscape, it does have limitations within business operations,"" Thota said. Understanding and addressing these limitations can help businesses safeguard themselves from these pitfalls. This often involves combining predictive AI with other analytics techniques to mitigate weaknesses.
Some of the limitations of predictive AI include the following:

Bias in underlying data might be amplified. This might lead to inconsistencies in interpretation and ethical concerns. Ramchandran recommends adopting stringent data and model governance practices to reduce these risks.
Overreliance on historical data. Thota said training data should be augmented with real-time and external data sources and feedback loops to update models with recent information.
Lack of interpretability can arise in complex predictive models. These models, built on deep neural networks, can make transparency and explainability difficult. The use of simpler models can help identify and fix issues that arise. Kuznetsova said businesses should consider explainable AI techniques to help business leaders understand how the models work and make predictions.
Overfitting. When an AI model tries to fit itself to the training data too closely, it can lead to inaccurate predictions.
Struggle with causation. Predictive models are good at identifying correlation, but they can struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation. Thota said causal inference methods and randomized controls can help differentiate between correlation and causation.
Too much training on data and business cases can lead to prediction bias. Kuznetsova recommends questioning the number of cases analyzed for an industry subsegment. ""What may work very well in groceries, with a shorter shelf life but less variety of models and sizes, may not be successful in forecasting demand in apparel or footwear,"" she said.




A breakdown of the benefits and limitations of generative AI and predictive AI.







Predictive AI applications in business
Morris said some best practices to ensure organizations get the most value from predictive AI in business include setting clear objectives and KPI definitions and ensuring data quality. It's also important to monitor results to ensure models perform as needed and to review model factors periodically to identify outdated factors and potential biases.
Businesses can use predictive AI in the following ways:

Demand sensing and forecasting. Predictive AI uses historical and causal data to create a more accurate short-term granular demand forecast to support inventory location and allocation decisions.
Inventory optimization. An analytic approach that incorporates predictive AI to better identify and set inventory targets throughout all inventory locations and types in the supply chain.
Customer targeting. Predictive AI analyzes historical data to predict which customers are likely to respond positively to specific offers or promotions.
Risk assessment. Financial institutions and lenders widely use predictive AI to evaluate fiscal and credit risks related to defaults or delinquencies.
Sales forecasting. Forecasting future sales based on historical data, market trends and external factors helps companies allocate resources, manage demand planning and supply chain operations, and optimize inventory levels.
Churn prevention. Predictive AI can analyze historical interactions and other customer demographic data to predict customers likely to churn, which lets companies make proactive retention efforts.
Preventive maintenance. This can help optimize maintenance schedules to reduce costs while reducing the risk of failures.

Survey: Majority of US Workers Are Already Using Generative AI Tools, But Company Policies Trail BehindBy Doug Eadline 

September 18, 2023


A new survey from the Conference Board indicates that More than half of US employees are already using generative AI tools, at least occasionally, to accomplish work-related tasks. Yet some three-quarters of companies still lack an established, clearly communicated organizational AI policy.
The new survey  finds that 56 percent of workers are using generative AI on the job, with nearly 1 in 10 employing the technology on a daily basis. Yet just 26 percent of respondents say their organization has a policy related to the use of generative AI, with another 23 percent reporting such a policy is under development.

The urgency for establishing clear AI usage guidelines will only rise as the technology continues to accelerate in capability and scope: Already, 55 percent of respondents say that the current output of generative AI tools they’re using matches the quality of an experienced or expert human worker.
The latest workforce survey from The Conference Board was fielded from July 26 to August 13 and polled nearly 1100 US employees—predominantly office workers. Respondents weighed in on how they’re using generative AI, the approach their managers and organizations are taking to the technology, the impact on productivity and job prospects, and more. Key findings include:
AI Adoption and Supervision
In all, 56% of respondents are using generative AI tools for work tasks.

31% report using generative AI on a frequent, regular basis—including daily (9%), weekly (17%), or monthly (5%).
25% say they are using generative AI occasionally.
44% have ne­ver used generative AI.  

Among workers who’ve adopted generative AI, a large majority—71%—say their managers or organizations are aware of their usage.

46% say management is fully aware of their AI use.
25% say management is partially aware.
Just 13% say their managers are not aware.

AI Use Cases and Work Quality
Workers are primarily using generative AI tools for basic, foundational tasks involving text.

Drafting written content (68%), brainstorming ideas (60%), and conducting background research (50%) are the most common use cases.
Far fewer respondents are using generative AI for quantitative and technical tasks—such as analyzing data and making forecasts (19%), generating/checking computer code (11%), or image recognition and generation (7%).  

Most respondents believe the quality of AI output matches that of a seasoned human worker:

45% say quality is equal to an experienced worker.
31% say quality is equal to a novice worker.
10% say quality is equal to an expert worker.

“Generative Al is already delivering work product that meets or exceeds the quality of employees with years of experience—at least on specific tasks,” said Diana Scott, Leader of The Conference Board Human Capital Center. “At the same time, few people we surveyed foresee AI technology as a threat to replace their jobs entirely. Rather, they appear to be embracing AI as a solution for repetitive or tedious parts of their work, freeing up bandwidth for more productive and valuable uses of their time.”
AI Productivity and Job Impact
Most respondents—63%—say generative AI tools have positively impacted their productivity.

7% report a significant increase in productivity.
56% report an increase.
36% report no impact.

Many workers foresee generative AI replacing elements of their job functions—but overwhelmingly in a positive, rather than threatening, way.

33% say AI will replace elements of their job in a positive way—e.g., by freeing up time for more valuable or creative tasks.
Just 4% foresee AI replacing parts of their work in a negative way—e.g., by threatening their job altogether.
24% do not expect AI to replace any element of their job.

AI Organizational Policies
Most workers report that their organizations either don’t have a general policy related to the use of generative AI at work or are still developing one.

34% say their organization does not have an AI policy.
26% say their organization does have an AI policy.
23% say a policy is under development.
17% don’t know.

Adoption of AI is proceeding rapidly—and openly—even in the absence of final organization-wide policies.

Even among organizations that lack an AI policy, 40% of employees still report their managers are fully aware that they’re using AI tools at work.
In organizations with AI policies under development, 53% of workers say their managers are fully aware of their AI use—just a hair under the 56% in companies which have an established, finalized AI policy.

1. Cloud pricing optimization
Organizations are leaning on AI to help reduce cloud costs and to find cost-effective solutions for running cloud applications. Airbnb is one company using AI to optimize pricing on AWS, utilizing AI to manage capacity, to build custom cost and usage data tools, and to optimize storage and computing capacity. Dropbox is another company that is using AI to optimize cloud costs and operational expenditures, reducing its dependency on AWS and saving nearly $75 million in the process. AI tools help companies optimize cloud pricing and spending by identifying cloud usage patterns for improved cost prediction, detecting anomalies in cloud usage, identifying opportunities for saving, and uncovering more cost-effective resources to use.
2. Voice assistants, chatbots, and conversational AI
Conversational AI tools such as chatbots and voice assistants have grown in popularity, making technology more accessible, offering support to customers, and reducing the load on IT support representatives. At Estée Lauder, the company has released a voice-enabled makeup assistant designed to assist visually impaired people with applying makeup. Meanwhile, companies such as Pentagon Credit Union (PenFed) are using chatbots and conversational AI to help customers get answers to common questions faster, reducing the load on customer service reps.
 
 
 













 
 

3. Uptime/reliability optimization
For companies that rely on web services or e-commerce, maintaining uptime and website reliability is a top priority. AI helps organizations achieve this by constantly scanning systems, networks, and processes for inefficiencies, potential disruptions, and to identify any looming threats in a way humans could never accomplish. Nearly all major organizations are employing AI to support their unique uptime and reliability needs. Netflix, Uber, Facebook, Salesforce, AirBnB, and many more are implementing AI to monitor, maintain, and keep their services up and running and available for customers. For companies that offer round-the-clock digital services, using AI can help identify problems before they start, while also reducing instances of crashing, hacking, and human error.
4. Predictive maintenance
At GE, AI is leveraged regularly for predictive maintenance, analyzing data directly from aircraft engines to identify any problems, needed maintenance, and to ensure the overall safety of aircrafts. Rolls-Royce has also found use for AI in predictive maintenance to improve the efficiency of jet engines and reduce the amount of carbon their planes produce, while also streamlining maintenance schedules through predictive analytics. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority is using predictive maintenance to identify potential water main breaks and to monitor performance of collection systems. DC Water even has an AI tool called Pipe Sleuth that can review CCTV footage of sewer pipes to assess their maintenance needs in real-time.  
5. Customer service operations
AI has become a go-to tool for customer service operations, helping organizations ensure customers receive the support they need while alleviating some of the burden on service representatives and call centers. When Lufthansa Group’s business was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, its call centers were overwhelmed with customers trying to navigate cancelled and rescheduled flights, accelerating the company’s move toward digital transformation in these areas. For other companies, AI use in customer service has also been driven by consumer’s increased expectations. McKinsey reports that around 67% of millennials “expect real-time customer service,” and 75% of customers expect a “consistent cross-channel service experience.” Unilever, which is leveraging GPT API to create AI tools to minimize food waste and auto-generate product listings, is also using the API to create a platform that filters emails sent to customer service, sorting spam from legitimate messages, and scaling those up to customer service agents.
 
 
 













 
 

6. Personalization
When you log onto your favorite social media app or streaming service, the experience is tailored to your personal taste and browsing habits — all the way down to the targeted advertisements. AI has helped companies deliver products and content to targeted audiences, ensuring that every app or service you use is personally tailored to the user’s unique interests. Spotify will put you onto a new artist, Amazon will remind you that it’s time to stock up on your most purchased products and suggest related products you may be interested in, and YouTube will deliver a curated feed of content suited to your interests. AI personalization utilizes data, customer engagement, deep learning, natural language processing, machine learning, and more to curate highly tailored experiences to end-users and customers. Retail giant Nordstrom also uses AI in its Nordstrom Analytical Platform (NAP) to gain deeper insights into its customers’ activities and to provide predictions for delivering more personalized experiences for its customers. The company also uses AI to manage inventory control, navigate the fulfillment process, and route orders to the nearest store for customers, among other applications.

7. IT operations management
AI IT operations management (AIOps) tools are growing in popularity. According to a report from OpsRamp, enterprises are using AIOps platforms for intelligent alerting (70%), root cause analysis (57%), anomaly and threat detection (52%), incident auto-remediation (50%), and capacity optimization (27%). Delta Airlines has used AIOps to create a “full-scale digital simulation environment for its global operation,” which the company says is a “first in commercial passenger aviation,” to maintain reliability, especially during inclement weather. The platform analyzes operational data points and uses that to create hypothetical outcomes that help Delta employees make “critical decisions before, during, and after large-scale disruptions,” according to a press release from Delta.
8. Process automation
AI has proved to be an effective tool for automating time-consuming processes that are often prone to human error. By automating processes, organizations can free up employees to work on more complex projects. Atlantic Health System uses process automation to streamline the process of obtaining prior authorizations, sparked by the need to alleviate the increased workload caused during the COVID-19 pandemic. Automating prior authorizations helps speed up the time to treatment, freeing up doctors and nurses to focus on patients, and reduces the manual efforts around obtaining authorization and scheduling appointments. Johnson & Johnson has combined RPA with ML, AI, and task mining to identify and automate complex processes that span across departments. AT&T is another company that has made use of process automation since 2015 to alleviate extensive manual data entry tasks, which has since evolved to streamline several processes across the organization.
 
 
 













 
 

9. Financial reporting and accounting
Intuit is one organization using AI to improve data analysis around financial planning for clients, with over 730 million “AI-driven consumer interactions per year, leading to 58 billion machine learning predictions per day.” Using its own Generative AI Operating System (GenOS) platform, Intuit can implement financial large language models that specialize in tax, accounting, cash flow, and more. This helps reduce repetitive tasks for workers and helps streamline and reduce errors with data entry, transaction categorization, and invoice processing. PWC is using AI similarly, to better inform consulting through natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, model operations, automated ML, digital twins, generative AI, embodied AI, responsible AI, and more. The company is investing $1B over the next three years to “expand and scale” AI capabilities, as it’s clear that more organizations are starting to recognize the benefits of AI for financial reporting and accounting practices.
10. Recruiting/hiring
Amazon is one organization utilizing AI in the hiring process to screen resumes, match candidates with best suited roles, perform initial online candidate assessments, and pass data along to recruiters to make contact with candidates. This is quickly becoming a common practice for organizations to help reduce the manual labor involved in sorting through resumes, thereby speeding up the hiring process and time-to-hire. AI can also be used for conducting initial video interviews. Unilever, which processes over 1.8 million job applications each year, partnered with Pymetrics to build an online platform that can assess candidates over video software. In the second stage of interviews, candidates answer questions for 30 minutes while the software analyzes their body language, facial expressions, and word choice using natural language processing and body language analysis technology. Once employees are in the door, organizations such as Schneider Electric, also use AI to help advance and develop employees careers, matching them with opportunities for continued learning, new projects in the organization, and networking opportunities with thought leaders across the organization. 
11. Safety and quality
AI can help organizations automate and streamline safety and quality assurance processes, ensuring there are fewer risks to the company and consumers, while also ensuring better quality products and services. Boeing is using AI to detect anomalies with aircraft sensors, analyze data collected off aircrafts, and improve overall flight safety. AI can also be integrated into products to better ensure their safety and the safety of the people who use them. Google, for example, has implemented AI safety features to its lineup of Nest products, with the ability to detect intruders as well as smoke or carbon monoxide. It can also use AI to help identify whether there’s an actual emergency or if it’s a false alarm. This year, Boeing also partnered with Shield AI to “explore strategic collaboration in the areas of autonomous capabilities and artificial intelligence on current and future defense programs.” Shield AI has created technology called Hivemind, which enables AI to autonomously fly drones and aircrafts without GPS, communications, or a human pilot.
 
 
 













 
 

12. Workforce schedule optimization
AI has found its way into plenty of processes, helping companies streamline efforts that once took up a lot of time for managers. That’s especially true when it comes to workforce schedule optimization, where AI has helped companies optimize scheduling, considering several factors such as employee availability, customer traffic, and employee skillsets and preferences, all at once to identify the optimum schedule. Companies such as Walmart, Starbucks, Costco, Delta Airlines, Target, and many more use this technology to identify the best schedule for the company’s needs.

The prevailing narrative at the time was that the era of the “average” worker was ending, with machines progressively replacing routine and administrative jobs. Highly skilled professionals were the ones reaping the benefits, as computers made them more productive and enabled them to sell their services locally and around the world. A decade on, what is known as generative AI seems to be disrupting such trends: the era of “average” is making a comeback.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Generative AI Creatives Work



Over the past year, we have seen an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, across multiple industries. With all of the advantages that AI has to offer, there is no denying that it is truly transforming the way creatives work. Artificial intelligence has enabled new ways of creating art and copy while freeing professional creatives from mundane or repetitive tasks. It’s also motivating some creatives to reimagine work — reframing challenges through the lens of new AI capabilities and rethinking procedures in current creative processes.
The spotlight on generative AI is only getting brighter, but this new technology poses considerable questions for designers whose primary role is based on creative, compelling visuals.
Will creatives need generative AI to succeed in the future? What sort of prompting will elicit the best generative AI output? Does generative AI even need designers to become and stay meaningful?
AI Disrupting Conventional Methods
Creativity has long been viewed as a uniquely human quality, forging new ways of thinking, unlocking new patterns, and using empathy. With applications like ChatGPT enabling rapid content creation and Midjourney driving an explosion of AI-generated art and images, many worry that human’s claim to creativity may become a thing of the past. In the time since these technologies flooded the market, we are already seeing changes in how people create audio, text, and even written content. The reaction to generative AI is mixed.
Generative AI in Non-Creative Roles
For those outside of traditionally creative professions, generative AI has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for writing, designing, and crossing the boundaries of their creativity. That said, most agree that creative output through AI tools lacks the emotional aspect of content produced by humans and only benefits from human involvement.
Artificial intelligence has wholly disrupted art and copy alike in the content-creation economy.
For individuals who work in content-creation roles — such as copywriters, designers, UX experts, or marketing communications professionals — the introduction of generated AI into creative processes has helped to increase the volume of written content, idea generation, and visual output.
How Generative AI is Changing Creative Work
When it comes to generative AI and creativity, there are several ways that individuals and industries of all sizes are taking advantage of this transformational tool. We see countless businesses utilize artificial intelligence to own and accelerate the end-to-end process. Generative AI is expanding how we create by empowering businesses, from ideas to tests to personalization for every customer.
Artificial intelligence has eliminated some technical constraints for those with more ideas than resources, allowing creatives to design and execute complete experiments without relying on an entire team to accomplish them. As more individuals turn to artificial intelligence, we will continue to see a rapid iteration in creativity.
The Benefits of Generative AI and Creativity
1. Increased productivity: Artificial intelligence allows creators to increase the number of images and words created instantly. Many individuals utilize this technology at all content-creation stages, from start to finish.
2. Overcoming creative blocks: Many find that artificial intelligence enables them to fill in the gaps when creating alternative product versions. AI effectively allows creatives to overcome production bottlenecks and combat unavailable resources with little effort.
3. More sophisticated options: Given the speed of artificial intelligence, creatives can generate words, content, and even code at a much higher volume. This gives them many different ways to create art in the digital space.
4. Idea generation: We’ve all experienced brain fog or struggles while brainstorming ideas for content. With artistic creativity in artificial intelligence, AI can provide creatives with various ideas for any project, allowing professionals to work more efficiently.
5. Automation: Through pattern-driven design — such as subject lines, header image creation, old images, meta descriptions, and even module designs — we can expect some sense of automation moving forward.
Generative AI will continue to actively learn from prompts and inputs, evolving through increased use from those committed to understanding how to work with AI models and derive value from AI. Regarding the future of creative work, we expect artificial intelligence to enhance, rather than replace, human-generated content.
What to Watch For in Generative AI Models
In the short term, how creatives interact with AI models will also change. By refining our interactions, creatives will steer AI models to produce more consistent, desired outcomes that meet brand standards, achieve communication goals, and cater to specific challenges and business needs.
We’ll evolve from simply generating more art and copy to creating valuable, usable assets. You only need a creative mind, access to AI tools, and an openness to exploring AI to get there.
Very soon after, how we frame and phrase problems and challenges to AI will become more critical than prompting. As AI learns, it becomes more intuitive and adept at understanding natural language. Problem formulation — the ability to identify, analyze, and describe problems — will move the forefront of interactions with AI. And this should feel familiar: We no longer need to put search terms in parentheses or use keywords to surface relevant content on the internet.
The Future and Beyond
Finally, digital asset management may become challenging due to the significant increase in digital assets created by artificial intelligence and limited documentation around ownership since it’s so new. Plan on discussing the governance and maintenance of content if you’re starting to use generative AI at work. You’ll want to think through content ownership and attribution, storage, and licensing terms (similar to rights-managed content). Work with your legal team so they can develop a point of view and terms of service, especially if you’re at an agency doing work on behalf of a client.
Artificial intelligence allows you to make more personalized and relevant content, which can benefit everyone around you. We expect that a hybrid approach to creation will be the future norm. Undoubtedly, it will be fascinating to see the value of “human-made.” As more and more people continue to utilize artificial intelligence, it will become less of a disruptor. People will likely boost productivity while viewing it more as a creative partner than a complete replacement.
Moving forward, independent contractors and agencies adopting AI early on are more likely to stand the best chance of success as the economy evolves. If you are a creator who is curious about AI, now is a perfect opportunity to step up and stand out as an emerging expert in this exciting field.

It offers a hugely exciting opportunity, and sometimes, it can be more than a little scary. And without a doubt, the big development in AI making waves right now is generative AI.
What Is Generative AI: A super-Simple Explanation Anyone Can UnderstandAdobe Stock

Just like it sounds, it's AI that can create, from words and images to videos, music, computer applications, and even entire virtual worlds.

What makes generative AI different and special is that it puts the power of machine intelligence in the hands of just about anyone.

We're used to using AI-powered applications and tools in our everyday lives. Google uses it to find the information we need; Amazon uses it to suggest things we should buy; Netflix uses it to recommend movies; Spotify uses it for music - it's all powered by AI.

PROMOTED
But the new generation of generative AI tools goes even further, giving us the power to build and create in amazing ways. With a little practice, we can even use them to build our own AI-powered apps and tools. Because it breaks down the technical barriers, it can truly be seen as the beginning of the long-awaited democratization of AI.
So, in this article, I'll give an overview in simple terms to show why it's so powerful and what you can do with it. I'll also take a non-technical look at how it works, but most importantly, I'll explain why it's going to change the world and what everyone should be doing to prepare for it.

The term AI, as it's used today, refers to computer algorithms that can effectively simulate human cognitive processes - learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and even creativity.
It's this last and perhaps most human quality where generative AI comes into the picture. Like all modern AI, generative AI models are trained on data. They then use that data to create more data, following the rules and patterns they've learned.

For example, if you train it on pictures of cats, it will learn that a cat has four legs, two ears, and a tail. Then, you can tell it to generate its own picture of a cat, and it will come up with as many variations as you need, all following those basic rules.
One distinction that's worth understanding is the difference between generative AI and discriminative (or predictive) AI. Discriminative AI focuses mainly on classification, learning the difference between ""things"" - cats and dogs, for example. This is what's used in recommendation engines like those used by Netflix or Amazon to distinguish between things you might want to watch or buy and things you're unlikely to be interested in. Or in navigation apps to distinguish between good routes from A to B and ones you should probably avoid.
Generative AI, instead, focuses on understanding patterns and structure in data and using that to create new data that looks like it.

So What Can Generative AI Do?
The first use cases for generative AI typically involved creating text and images, but as the technology has become more sophisticated, a world of possibilities has opened up. Here are some of them:
Images: Many generative AI tools – such as Midjourney or Stable Diffusion – can take a natural language (i.e., a human language) prompt and use it to generate a picture. Tell it you want an image of a two-headed dog wearing an Elvis costume flying a spaceship into a black hole and watch as it (or something close to it) appears before your eyes.
Text: ChatGPT is probably responsible for kicking off the intense hype surrounding generative AI at the moment, but there are other generative text tools like Google’s Bard and Meta’s Llama. They can be used to write anything from essays and articles to plays, poems and novels.
Coding: As well as ChatGPT, tools like Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon’s CodeWhisperer make it easy for anyone to generate computer code with very little technical knowledge.
Audio: Generative AI tools can create human-like voices (voice synthesis), allowing computers to speak words that have never before been uttered by a human, as well as music and sound effects.
Video: While not yet as advanced as text or image generation, tools are beginning to emerge that allow us to create and edit video simply by describing what we want to see.
Data augmentation: Generative AI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data sets for use in training other AI models that follow real-world rules without conferring privacy and data security obligations on those who store and use it.
Virtual environments: Think of virtual reality (VR) environments or video game worlds that can be explored and interacted with, or the rather hyped-up concept of the metaverse. Designing these is a highly complex task that can be greatly accelerated with the help of generative AI.

How Does It Work?
Like all of the AI we see today, generative AI grew out of a field of AI study and practice called machine learning (ML).
While traditional computer algorithms are coded by a human to tell a machine exactly how to do a particular job, ML algorithms get better at their jobs the more data they are fed.
Put a bunch of these algorithms together in a way that allows them to generate new data based on what they've learned, and you get a model - essentially an engine tuned to generate a particular type of data.
Some examples of models used in generative AI applications include:
Large Language Models (LLMs) - By ingesting large amounts of text, they learn the semantic relationships between words and use that data to generate more language. An example of an LLM is GPT-4, created by OpenAI, which powers the ChatGPT tool.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - These work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and another tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. This type of generative model is typically used to create images, sounds, or even video.
Variational Autoencoders - This is a type of model that learns how data is constructed by encoding it in a simple way that captures its essential characteristics and then figuring out how to reconstruct it. It's often used to generate synthetic data.
Diffusion models - These work by adding random data (known as ""noise"") to the data it's learning about, then figuring out how to remove it while preserving the original data - thus learning what's important and what can be discarded. Diffusion models are most commonly used in image generation.
Transformer Models - This is something of an umbrella term for a group of models that includes LLMs but covers any model that works by learning the context and relationships between different elements in its training data.

Generative AI in Practice
There are already many incredible examples of generative AI being used to create amazing (and sometimes terrible) things.
Take Coca-Cola’s Masterpiece advert, for example – a collaborative creation between human artists and AI that brings many of history’s greatest works of art to life on the screen in a way that’s never been done before.
It’s also been used to create a new Beatles song by rebuilding partially recorded lyrics by John Lennon, combined with new material by Paul McCartney.
Generative design is a term for an emerging field where generative AI is used to create blueprints and production processes for new products. For example, General Motors used generative tools created by Autodesk to design a new seatbelt bracket that’s 40% lighter and 20% stronger than its existing components.
And it’s also being used to speed up drug discovery, with one UK company recently announcing that it’s created the world’s first AI-generated immunotherapy cancer treatment.
Generative AI is also the technology behind the recent phenomena of deepfakes, which blur the lines between reality and fiction by making it appear as if real people have done or said fake things.
Deepfake Tom Cruise was one of the earliest and most famous examples. More insidiously, potential candidates on both sides of the upcoming 2024 US presidential elections have starred in deepfakes aimed to discredit them for political ends.
And while spreading propaganda is bad enough, there are also outright criminal uses - including attempts to extort money by staging hoax kidnappings using cloned voices and fraudulently scamming money by posing as a company CEO.

The Ethical Questions Around Generative AI
While generative AI is clearly capable of amazing things, it's clear that its existence is forcing us to confront some difficult issues and questions.
Perhaps one of the biggest is when we will get to the point where it's impossible to tell the difference between what's real and what's generated by AI.
Given the incredibly rapid pace of innovation in the field, it's likely to happen sooner rather than later.
Which leads to the question of what (if anything) we should do about it. Countries, including China, have already passed legislation making it illegal to deepfake people without their consent – should the world follow suit?
And then there's the question of how this will affect human jobs - will the livelihoods of creators be threatened if the companies that employ them can create as many images, sounds and videos as they need just by telling a computer to do it?
Another issue that needs to be addressed is copyright. If an AI is used to create a work of art, who owns it? The person who used the AI to create the art? The creator of the AI itself? Or all the (probably) thousands of artists whose work was used (in practice, often without permission) to train the AI?
All of these questions need to be answered - and, given the accelerating pace at which this technology is being developed, soon. How we answer them may well play an important role in determining the future of generative AI in society and in our lives.

GitLab (GTLB) helps make the software development process easier, faster, cheaper and more secure. The company is now infusing generative AI across its DevSecOps platform.

GitLab’s platform delivers enhanced operational efficiency by doing away with time-consuming manual work, increasing productivity and boosting software development velocity. Security is an important element in modern software development. GitLab embeds protection early in the development process, leading to improved security, quality and overall compliance.


GitLab eliminates the need for numerous point solutions. This cuts down on costs. DevOps used to be made up solely of teams using a bunch of different tools. The problem with all of these point solutions is they don’t work well together, meaning there isn’t much actual collaboration taking place. Trying to manually integrate all of these tools makes things even worse—leading to longer development times, higher costs and poor user experiences.

GitLab operates in a total addressable market worth an estimated $40 billion. The company competes mainly with homegrown DevOps as well as Microsoft’s GitHub unit. There’s plenty of upside potential, as GitLab and GitHub combined control less than 5% of the overall market. Gartner forecasts that 75% of all organizations by 2027 will have switched to a DevOps platform from multiple point solutions, a big jump from 25% today.

PROMOTED
Before the end of this year, GitLab will start to monetize its various AI capabilities. The company’s Code Suggestions functionality, which uses generative AI to recommend code to developers, will be priced at $9 a month per user.
The company currently has 10 AI capabilities in its GitLab Duo suite. The Suggested Reviewers AI feature, now bundled into the Ultimate tier (priced at $99 a month per user), is a workflow tool that helps developers find the right person to review code, a task that’s critically important when it comes to getting software to market promptly. Suggested Reviewers already has more than 100,000 users. Another key AI capability, Explain This Vulnerability, provides developers with details related to security vulnerabilities discovered in code.

GitLab’s AI advancements are part of a growing set of positives at the company. In fiscal Q2 (July), GitLab closed its largest DevSecOps deal ever—a multi-year arrangement worth over $30 million with a major multinational company. This customer was at the end of the third year of a five-year contract with GitLab when it saw the savings it was realizing by using the company’s platform and decided to sign up for another five years, according to GitLab CFO Brian Robins.

In FQ2, GitLab added 409 new base customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of at least $5,000, a bump up from 404 additions in the previous quarter. There are now 7,815 total base customers, up 33% from the year-ago level. The company gained 50 customers with ARR above $100,000, bringing this customer segment to 810 accounts, up 37% year over year.
The new GitLab Dedicated offering looks promising. It’s a single-tenant DevSecOps SaaS platform aimed at larger organizations in highly regulated industries that have complex compliance and security requirements. Now generally available, Dedicated is fully deployed and managed by GitLab. For customers, the product offers the control and compliance of a self-hosted solution, while saving them the operating costs associated with self-management.
Following the release of the FQ2 report in early September, TD Cowen raised its GitLab price target to $63 from $56 because it thinks the company’s DevSecOps value proposition is resonating well with customers. The firm was encouraged by an improvement in customer expansions in the latest quarter.
Barclays lifted its target to $65 from $60, saying the solid FQ2 earnings report reassured investors. The firm noted that GitLab is starting to benefit from the recent price uplift for the Premium tier (now $29 a month per user, up from $19 previously).
Last week, GitLab received two positive Wall Street initiations. Bernstein started coverage at ‘Outperform’ with a price target of $62. The firm says GitLab is one of only a few developer tool companies operating at scale and with strong competitive durability.
Bernstein believes GitLab over the next two years is capable of growing as much as 2x faster than Wall Street anticipates. For fiscal 2025 (Jan.), the latest consensus revenue estimate of $722.9 million represents growth of 29.5%. Plus, the firm sees a roadmap to a 30% operating margin based on GitLab’s operating leverage.
Canaccord started GitLab at ‘Buy’ with a price target of $62, saying the company’s DevSecOps platform cohesion creates a rare opportunity to capture value in the evolving market. The firm likes GitLab’s best-in-class gross retention rate and strong pricing power.

         Making AI work for you: Best practices for tax professionals








A collaborative future with AI




The dawn of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns across various industries about the potential replacement of human workers with machines. With the recent release of tools like ChatGPT, apprehensions about job security are growing among many professionals, including those in the tax and accounting space.
By definition, AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, decision-making, and problem-solving. When it comes to the tax and accounting space, AI can essentially do the work of a human professional in preparing an individual’s tax returns or auditing a business of virtually any size.
Scary, right? But, if we think back to several years ago, tax software solutions that streamlined an accountant’s workflow begged the same question: will technology replace my job? The answer has been just the opposite. Tax preparation software has shifted the work of today’s tax and accounting professionals—from mundane data entry to more meaningful and strategic work.
Now, with the power of AI, today’s tax professionals can take these advantages to the next level.
Job security: AI is an enhancement, not a replacement
Contrary to the fears of job displacement, AI in the tax world does not necessarily mean the replacement of human tax professionals. Rather, it means the transformation of work—for the better.
Let’s take a look at some of the many ways AI can enhance the work of tax professionals.

Automation of repetitive tasks. AI can handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks like data entry, data validation, and basic calculations, freeing up tax professionals to focus on higher-value activities such as strategic tax planning and client interaction.
Improved accuracy. AI can significantly reduce the risk of human error by performing calculations and cross-referencing data with precision, leading to more accurate tax returns.
Enhanced compliance. AI can continuously monitor and analyze changes in tax laws and regulations, helping tax professionals stay updated and ensuring their clients’ compliance with the latest rules.
Data analysis and insights. AI can analyze vast amounts of financial data to identify patterns, trends, and potential deductions that may go unnoticed by manual practices. This can lead to better tax-saving opportunities for clients.
Skill enhancement. AI can be a valuable tool for tax professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge. It can assist in research and analysis, allowing professionals to provide more informed advice to their clients.
A client-centric approach. Instead of replacing client relationships, AI can complement them. AI-driven analytics provide clients with personalized tax strategies tailored to their unique financial situations and long-term financial goals.


Thomson Reuters is committed to understanding how the changing landscape is truly impacting the future of the professionals we serve, the industry and society at large – today and tomorrow. Download our “Future of professionals” report to learn more.

Making AI work for you: Best practices for tax professionals
When introducing new AI technologies into your daily tax workflow, it’s often smart to start with small-scale implementations and gradually build them into your tech stack. Like any workplace change, integrating AI typically works best when it is phased in at a manageable pace.
Think about your existing workflow. Is there a specific problem or challenge you’d like to address? Or maybe a step you’d like to enhance? While AI isn’t an all-knowing solution, it is an enabler for problem-solving. So, start by identifying a need and explore AI-driven solutions that will help you tackle it.
Here’s an example. Like most professional services, tax preparation comes with tedious data entry work that, while often mundane, must be done quickly and accurately. This is a great opportunity to showcase the value of AI. By automating manual data entry tasks, you can shift your focus to high-value advisory services that boost client relationships and growth.
A major benefit of AI also lies in its ability to process massive data sets quickly. The breadth of these data sets can range from financial statements and reports to emails and even social media content. That means tax professionals now have the ability to quickly consume these data sets using techniques like predictive analytics and anomaly detection. The result is insight into patterns, trends, and potential deductions that can lead to tax-saving opportunities for your clients.
In addition, AI can also help improve how tax and accounting professionals communicate with clients. Natural language reports and summaries can be generated from a client’s numerical data sets, opening up new opportunities for client engagement and relationship-building. Plus, AI’s natural language generation can provide effective chatbot user interfaces derived directly from its data sources.
In short, AI is a transformative tool for tax professionals, enabling a pathway toward a leaner, more productive, and, ultimately, more profitable business.
A collaborative future with AI
There is no doubt that the tax and accounting profession is in the midst of profound change, and concerns about job security are understandable. However, AI presents an enormous opportunity for tax professionals to harness its power and enhance the quality of client service—from automating manual tasks to delivering real-time tax insights to providing tailored financial guidance.
So what are you waiting for? By adopting AI and incorporating best practices, the possibilities for tax professionals are boundless.

NYC ban on ChatGPT in public schools repealed as students return to class.
Artificial intelligence could be a useful tool for teachers.
Videos spreading misinformation to children on YouTube were generated by AI.

Just under a year ago, artificial intelligence in education was the cause of massive angst in schools. Initially, the advent of generative AI was deemed a major threat – New York City public schools banned ChatGPT from in-school devices a week after its launch.
Now, as students are returning for a new school year, the early alarm felt by educators has given way to pragmatism and more understanding of the ways that generative AI will impact the classroom.    
David Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, wrote that the district was now “determined to embrace” generative AI.

One reason that the AI-hysteria has lessened is a better understanding of its weaknesses. Its tendency to “hallucinate” or fabricate information have somewhat assuaged fears that it would enable rampant cheating and plagiarism; there are pretty obvious tells that a piece of writing was generated by artificial intelligence.
Students have also been handing in work with citations that don’t exist, though in fairness, lawyers have done this too.
Artificial intelligence in education isn’t a new thing – for the past decade it’s been used by systems like Carnegie Learning and Aleks to analyze student response to questions and adapt learning materials to meet their individual needs.
Generative AI is what caused the spike of alarm, but it can also be employed as part of a curriculum. No doubt, education will be disrupted by artificial intelligence, but can it be harnessed, rather than regarded as hostile?

Seven months ago, artficial education in education was seen by many as the enemy.
Using AI in education
The most direct application for generative AI chatbots in education is in translation and language learning. At one point, stocks in Duolingo dropped due to investors’ fears that users would use the free option of ChatGPT rather than the app. Instead, Duolingo began integrating ChatGPT features into the app.

In March 2023, the company launched Duolingo Max, which uses GPT-4 technology to add two new features to Duolingo Super. Those features explain wrong answers to users and offer a role-playing feature that allows users to practice conversations in different scenarios.
As well as the use of chatbots to outsource homework and essay tasks, generative AI also offers benefits for students learning to write – or write more clearly. Grammarly is a well-known tool that uses AI to help users with their writing.
ChatGPT and others can rewrite, edit, or make changes to documents as needed. Alternatively, it might be used by creative writers to generate prompts, dialogue and story ideas. Teachers could also use it in this way when setting tasks.
Generative AI could be to the literary world what the calculator is to mathematics: providing aid in the tedious parts of the work and allowing for more to be achieved, despite specialists arguing that the tedious parts are significant to an understanding of the whole.

In early childhood education, AI can be used to create interactive games to teach children academic and social skills. It can also be used to power monitoring systems that track children’s behavior and provide insights into their development.
As with every sector, there’s a dark cloud over the ease that AI can bring to a job: if you can use it, what’s stopping your employer cutting out the middleman and giving a chatbot your job title?
Luckily for human beings with mortgages or rents to pay, although AI is useful in some educational settings, it’s not likely to replace teachers anytime soon. The pandemic proved the value of human-to-human, in-school learning. Still, AI is a helpful tool for teachers and, at the very least, saves time on admin, which can be redirected to more valuable tasks.
READ NEXTHere’s the latest: AI income, regulation and infighting
The tasks that AI programs like ChatGPT can help with include creating lesson plans, assisting with grading papers and homework, offering personalized help to students, and even creating videos from textbooks.
Plagiarism isn’t a new problem
Plagiarism did not just pop out of thin air the day OpenAI launched ChatGPT. It has always been a consideration that teachers have had to adapt to. In fact, even in the world of generative AI, it still depends on a very human impulse – the moment at which someone decides to take what isn’t their own and present it as though it is.
That hasn’t stopped a widespread pushback against the bots using material from the internet for training.
Turnitin, a plagiarism checker, has developed an AI detection tool that highlights which portions of a piece of writing may have been generated by AI. After reviewing more than 65 million submissions, it found that 10.3 percent of those contained AI writing in potentially more than 20 percent of their work.
There is a four percent false positive on its detector. Because of this, Turnitin recommends educators have conversations with students, rather than instantly failing them or making immediate accusations based on the checker’s results. “It’s just supposed to be information for the educator to decide what they want to do with it,” says Annie Chechitelli, Turnitin’s chief product officer. “It is not perfect.”
AI: exposing education
One argument is that AI is highlighting the flaws in the education system. Its ability to pass assessments doesn’t reflect the ‘intelligence’ of machine learning, but our failure to build education systems that nurture and value unique human intelligence.
A tool like ChatGPT has no understanding or knowledge – at least, not yet. It just collates text input based on statistics. For more on this, Google-search ‘stochastic parrots.’
‘Painting’ generated by AI. Dare we suggest it be named “Stochastic Parrot”?
The academic success of artificial intelligence in educational assessments demonstrates that they don’t test knowledge and understanding, but rather whether students have collected and memorized information.
Teachers are designing lesson plans specifically with this in mind. If a chatbot can easily churn out decent work in response to assignments, they might need adjusting: Educators may try giving their assignments to a chatbot to see what’s generated, says Emily Isaacs, executive director of the Office for Faculty Excellence at Montclair State University in New Jersey.
Lisa Parry, a K–12 school principal and AP English Language and Composition teacher in rural Arlington, South Dakota, told Wired that she plans to have her English students use ChatGPT as “a search engine on steroids” to help brainstorm essay topics. “ChatGPT has great power to do good, and it has power to undermine what we’re trying to do here academically,” she says. “But I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.”
To stay ahead of AI in education, the sector will have to radically rethink what education is for and how success is measured.
Artificial intelligence in education, education on AI
Another key change will be the need to educate children (and their parents, and their teachers!) on AI. In Japan, regulations stressing the importance of students understanding artificial intelligence have already been enforced.
Savior? Destroyer? Who can tell the future of artificial intelligence in education?
Key to effective use of AI is critical thinking – something that generative chatbots haven’t shown much skill at yet. Not only will tasks set to test it make it harder for students to use chatbots to complete work, but critical thinking will (hopefully) slow the spread of misinformation that AI has accelerated.
The trouble is that children aren’t equipped to distinguish fact from fake. Investigative BBC journalists found more than 50 YouTube channels in more than 20 languages spreading disinformation disguised as STEM [Science Technology Engineering Maths] content.
The videos included pseudo-science, false information and conspiracies. YouTube recommends these videos alongside legitimate educational content – and videos tagged as “educational content” are more likely to be recommended to children.
Revenue on YouTube videos incentivizes creators to chase as many views as possible, and to use AI to generate so-called educational content, which will be pushed by the algorithm and shown to children all over the world.
As part of their experiment, the journalists shared some of the recommended false science content to two groups of 10-12-year-olds – one in the UK and one in Thailand.
When the journalists then explained to the children those videos were made using AI and contained false information, they were shocked.
READ NEXTAI is in the news but should it be reading it?
“I’m actually really confused. I thought it was real,” said one boy. Another said: “I would’ve probably believed it, if you hadn’t told us it was fake.”
“These videos do well because they are conspiratorial [suggesting they are exposing a secret most people don’t know about],” says Professor Vicki Nash, Director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “We are all fascinated by things that run counter to what we’re officially told, and children are more susceptible to this than adults.”
As AI tools continue to improve, misleading content will become easier to create and the quality of the videos will no longer indicate whether they are artificially generated content. The waters get muddier still if we think about some of the potential uses of AI in educational settings.
If a teacher generates a video summary from a textbook, the robotic voice-over and simple animations of an AI-generated clip will become synonymous with educational resources. As artificial intelligence in education becomes more and more the norm, we run the risk of making students less and less wary of AI-generated content over time, irrespective of the facts of the real world.

Could AI be a disruptive but positive influence on the education system?

Among the sectors, the manufacturing sector is poised to reap substantial benefits, with a potential value capture of USD 270-460 billion. Major manufacturers from the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries have already embraced Generative AI, focusing on key areas such as Personalization, Design, Automation, and Optimization.Generative AI Use Cases in Manufacturing & ProductionIn this article, we’ll explore some interesting generative AI applications for manufacturing & production. We’ll also showcase real-world case studies to illustrate how manufacturers are leveraging Generative AI to transform their production processes.Virtual assistants for the Production teamManufacturing and production engineers spend 40% of their time on non-value-added tasks such as information search and data checks. Generative AI offers a solution by enabling manufacturing firms to develop virtual assistants for engineers. These AI assistants can assist in information retrieval and data analysis through natural language conversations.Automated machine data analysisA McKinsey study finds that just 0.5% of machine data gets analyzed, citing challenges in data quality, data volume, complexity, and analytics expertise. Generative AI offers a solution by automating data processing, uncovering patterns, and detecting anomalies in machine data. This helps manufacturing firms prevent equipment failures, improve quality control, and boost employee productivity.Automated Production reportsAccording to Gartner, employees spend an average of 10 hours per week on production report creation. This time investment varies based on factors such as process complexity, factory size, data automation, and reporting tools. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating data analysis and report generation. It can directly connect to the production systems, process large volumes of data rapidly, and generate comprehensive reports with minimal human intervention.Gen AI-based production planning & schedulingOver 70% of manufacturers grapple with production planning and scheduling challenges, leading to lost sales, elevated costs, and customer dissatisfaction. Key hurdles include data complexity, diverse systems, and manual processes. Generative AI emerges as a transformative solution, automating scenario planning and scheduling. By incorporating scenario simulation, complex optimization, real-time adaptation, and continuous improvement capabilities, manufacturers can enhance planning quality and overcome these challenges effectively.Synthetic Machine data generationPredictive maintenance models require access to large amounts of data to create AI/ML models. This data can be difficult to obtain, especially for older assets that have not been equipped with sensors. AI-generated synthetic data can be used to supplement real data when there is not enough data available to train a predictive maintenance model. This can be the case for older assets that don’t have adequate sensors, or for assets that are operating in harsh environments where data collection is difficult.Generative AI: Real World Case Studies in Manufacturing  Discover how manufacturers are reshaping production with successful Gen AI implementationsM&M deployed Gen AI-powered Virtual assistants for the production team to reduce downtime Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), a leading automotive manufacturer, has leveraged generative AI to empower its workforce. By aggregating technical data and maintenance records of industrial robots, M&M developed a Virtual Assistant using LLMs. This tool equips production teams to swiftly address technical issues by querying them with error codes. The Virtual Assistant then provides step-by-step instructions, reducing machine downtime and expediting issue resolution.BMW utilizes Generative AI to optimize manufacturing operationsBMW Group has implemented a Quantum-Inspired Generative Model, known as generator-enhanced optimization (GEO) for plant scheduling. In this novel approach, classic optimization solvers first analyze data and generate schedules. Then, GEO’s quantum-inspired generative models refine these results. Notably, GEO often surpasses traditional solvers by minimizing assembly line idle time while meeting monthly vehicle production targets.Merck creates synthetic images using generative AI for defect detectionMerck, a global pharmaceutical leader, has harnessed generative AI to tackle the common challenge of limited training data for AI/ML models. Facing the shortage of defect images for inspections worldwide, Merck’s AI Engineers leveraged generative AI techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders. They created synthetic defect image data for complex defects. These synthetic images played a critical role in training defect detection models, resulting in remarkable accuracy improvements and a significant reduction in time-to-market for new models.Hitachi leverages Generative AI to train new workers in maintenance & manufacturing.Hitachi, a major equipment manufacturer taps into generative artificial intelligence to transfer expert skills in maintenance and manufacturing to younger workers to mitigate the impact of mass retirements. The AI system generates training videos depicting challenges and accidents in sectors like railways and power stations by simulating real-life scenarios on screens in a 10-square-meter room, providing immersive training experiences for their employees.Sereact is giving vision to warehouse robots through Generative AISereact is a leading provider of AI-based robotic solutions provider based out of Germany. Sereact revolutionizes warehouse operations by enabling robots to autonomously perform “pick-and-pack” tasks, which typically account for 55% of warehouse costs. Unlike competitors, Sereact employs a transformer model, trained on billions of simulated images. This image-trained model also interacts with a language model, which allows the operator to type in text commands to a chat interface, which will automatically create a plan of action for the robot to complete its task.ConclusionGenerative AI is not just a fleeting trend; it’s going to be a permanent fixture in the manufacturing landscape. Its potential spans R&D, Innovation, Production, Quality, Sales and commercial, IT, and Customer Experience. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for choosing generative AI use cases. Success lies in identifying the right applications based on your AI maturity level. Begin with small POCs and less complex use cases, then scale up. Prioritize assessing business impact, AI readiness, and data readiness before embarking on Gen AI endeavors.

											Karen Dahut, CEO for Google Public Sector speaks at FedTalks in Washington, D.C.										





Government agencies are demonstrating the power of generative artificial intelligence to improve communications and mission outcomes with citizens and employees, Google Public Sector CEO Karen Dahut said during an on-stage interview at FedScoop’s FedTalks in Washington, D.C.
Dahut acknowledged that there are still a lot of questions government leaders are asking about how to properly implement the technology across the government space. Among them, she said, is how to implement AI capabilities into mission activities while protecting agency data.
“Google is the first cloud provider to develop world-class generative AI enterprise tools—like Vertex AI—which allows you to create a special and unique enclave for your data, so your data isn’t exposed to the public,” she explained.
Citizen engagement
Dahut touched on ways government agencies are implementing generative AI tools to improve how citizens engage with public services.
For example, in Dearborn, Michigan, where 48% of the population is non-English speaking, city officials implemented a translation AI tool powered by Google Cloud Contact Center AI (CCAI) to help its citizens access information.
“The city has a long history of immigration and bringing people from across the globe to work in the car industry in Dearborn,” she explained. “They’re U.S. citizens. They just happen to speak Arabic, Spanish and French as their primary languages. And so now they can engage with their government in a really meaningful way.”
At a time when there is a lot of public attention on the role of government, Dahut stressed the importance of modernizing access to services as a method of trust-building between government and citizens.
Employee empowerment
Another benefit Dahut touched on is the idea that generative AI “empowers government employees with AI superpowers.”
She cited two new products that can assist with, and expedite, certain workflows. The first, Duet AI, is an “always on assistant” that is trained to help employees be more productive on Google Workspace, for example, by pulling together a presentation or creating content. And second, she said, is Codey, a generative AI tool that assists with developing or correcting code in more than 20 different programming languages.
“Generative AI is going to be the thing that drives digital transformation across government, because it’s going to require cloud services, it’s going to require the data enterprise to be applied and available to you, and I do think that it will enable and empower digital transformation,” Dahut stressed.
Getting started
Dahut shared her experience working with customers on implementing generative AI projects and concluded that organizations that engage in a long process to develop an AI strategy will quickly find three things that tend to stand in their way—technology, trust and having the right talent.
“I always say, let’s just get started. Let’s just go!”
Dahut explained that there are always people within an organization who want to use the latest technologies that can fit within the organization’s current reference architectures, and they can produce good results on a small scale.
Getting started on small ideations and small innovations can help drive an organization’s modernization strategy in a meaningful way, she said.

Why are AI prompt engineers in such high demand? (Image – Shutterstock)
AI prompt engineers: The most wanted job in techBy Aaron Raj






AI prompt engineers design, develop, and refine generative AI text prompts for various applications.There are many courses available for prompt engineering todayGenerative AI tools provide the best results with the right prompt. While artificial intelligence (AI) is about automating tasks and making work more straightforward, many still struggle to understand how to use the technology properly. Generative AI tools, which have seen enormously broad adoption in businesses around the world, can enhance productivity.However, to get the most out of the technology, it has to be appropriately used by the organization. Large language models (LLMs) are advanced conversation partners that use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and generate human-like text. That is the basis of generative AI.Remember MS-DOS? You needed to prompt the command correctly to access a particular program. In some way, that’s precisely where some see generative AI being at this point. While any prompt will generate a reply, the real question is, can companies afford to spend much time to get the correct information from the AI?GARTNER: CHATGPT HAS PROMPTED INCREASE IN AI INVESTMENTSAaron Raj | 8 May, 2023  Take OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example. To get a reply to a query, a user would need to prompt ChatGPT with a question or instructions. While ChatGPT can provide an answer, it may not be the desired result the user is seeking.This is where prompt engineering comes in. The Guardian defines prompt engineering as a technique for effectively communicating with generative AI models. AI prompt engineering is the process of structuring text (commands or instructions) that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. Generative AI models provide results based on their prompts. A weak or incomplete prompt may not give the desired outcome and require more attempts at refining the prompt.Just as with any technology, without guidance or instructions, it will not know what it is required to do. Even robots need instructions on their work or are programmed to work based on the instructions given. For generative AI tools, without prompt engineering, the technology would not be able to work as it should.A Tweet by OpenAI’s Sam Altman on prompt engineering.The need for AI prompt engineersBusinesses worldwide that have invested in generative AI tools now realize that prompting the technology is not as easy as it seems. While any employee can type out a prompt, to get the best results, a company would need to have a prompt expert. As such, the role of AI prompt engineer has quickly evolved into being.SALESFORCE BETS BIG ON EINSTEIN AND AIAaron Raj | 18 September, 2023AI prompt engineers are focused on and responsible for working with cross-functional teams to design prompts for generative AI, discuss product development, and identify the uses of AI tools. Put simply, AI prompt engineers design, develop, and refine generative AI text prompts for various applications.While the role sounds simple, finding the right AI prompt engineers is a challenge for most organizations today. Most companies realize the need to hire AI prompt engineers after heavily investing in generative AI tools but still failing to get the most value out of their investment.According to a study by Workyard, AI prompt engineers top the list of the most in-demand jobs in tech today. The list is based on evaluating data from Google searches, LinkedIn, and Indeed job openings and the number of professionals currently available.
AI prompt engineers are in high demand. (Image – Shutterstock)Becoming an AI prompt engineerFrom OpenAI to Stanford University, many online courses are available today on how to become an AI prompt engineer. However, most organizations feel that soft skills are more critical to the role than technical skills.This includes communication and organizational skills. Communication skills are the most important, as the role involves constantly communicating with the AI and with teams. An AI prompt engineer must be precise and clear in their prompts. It’s all about perfecting the details and depth of each prompt to get the best result.HERE’S HOW AI ASSISTANTS ARE MAKING WORK EASIERAaron Raj | 5 September, 2023Another critical skill is subject matter expertise. For example, an AI prompt engineer in a healthcare facility using AI would need to understand health jargon to ensure a smooth process.In a LinkedIn post, Vaikuntan Rajaratnam, hand surgeon, medical educator, and instructional designer, explained that prompt engineering in healthcare would mean designing prompts that help AI models generate differential diagnoses, propose treatment options, or even draft patient communication materials.“Prompt engineering represents a fascinating convergence of technology and healthcare, offering new avenues for enhanced care delivery. As with any technological advancement, the key to effective integration lies in education, skill development, and ethical considerations. Healthcare professionals, armed with the dual expertise of their domain and AI capabilities, can act as the much-needed bridge between technological possibility and ethical effective care delivery,” said Rajaratnam.So you think you want to be an AI prompt engineer?(Source: @RavitJain)Will technology perfect prompt engineering?As the demand for AI prompt engineers increases, technology is also evolving a way of solving the problem. A report by ZDNet highlighted that Google’s DeepMind unit researchers have created a program called OPRO. OPRO makes LLM try different prompts until they reach one that gets closest to solving a task. Put simply, it automates the trial-and-error process of prompting.In a research paper, the team stated that OPRO is expected to optimize anything with a language model. This makes the program produce better answers, which not only saves time for businesses but also could reduce the reliance on AI prompt engineers in the future.Thankfully as far as AI prompt engineers are concerned, this macine-led obsolescence may take some time to deliver, so for now, the role of AI prompt engineers remains firmly in demand, with some companies offering up to US$300k in salary.

The use of AI and conversational voice tech will enable doctors and clinicians to automate medical note-taking, order medications and view lab reviews while also more easily reviewing a patient's medical record, executives said. (Oracle)
Software giant Oracle has integrated generative AI services into its Cerner electronic medical record system as health IT companies race to harness this cutting-edge tech for providers.The use of AI and conversational voice tech will enable doctors and clinicians to automate medical note-taking, order medications and view lab reviews while also more easily reviewing a patient's medical record, Oracle executives said during the Oracle Health Conference, which kicked off Monday in Las Vegas.""We've completely rethought how long it takes somebody to get their job done using the system. I think that we are on the verge of completely eliminating 'pajama time' as a result. This is not about going from 10 clicks to seven clicks or six clicks to five clicks. This is about completely eliminating clicks, where we can and where it makes sense. That is not a tomorrow or that's years away. That is a tomorrow that's here,"" Mike Sicilia, executive vice president, industries at Oracle told the audience at the Oracle Health Conference.The company acquired Cerner in a $28 billion deal a year ago with bold plans to modernize Cerner's Millennium EHR platform.The company unveiled this week its Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant to enable providers to leverage the power of generative AI together with voice commands to reduce manual work so clinicians can focus more attention on patient care.Oracle executive also said the digital assistant makes it easier for patients to take self-service actions such as scheduling appointments, paying a medical bill or checking clinical information using simple voice commands. Patients also can use the tool to get generative AI-driven answers to questions such as, ""What happens during a colonoscopy?""The multimodal voice and screen-based assistant participates in the doctor-patient appointment using generative AI to automate note-taking and to propose context-aware next actions such as ordering medication or scheduling labs and follow-up appointments, executives said in a press release.RelatedEpic taps Microsoft to accelerate generative AI-powered 'copilot' tools to help clinicians save timeThe generative AI tool also responds to conversational voice commands from providers who can ask questions, such as ""Show me the patient’s latest MRI results,"" to look up elements of a patient’s EHR record during an appointment. The technology then provides the information and images to physicians in a relevant order to help them gain insight into the appropriate treatment path without requiring a multimenu, multistep interaction with the EHR, executives said.The new solution will be available in the next 12 months.""The EHR should be a provider’s best ally in delivering engaging, personalized care to the patients they serve,” said Suhas Uliyar, senior vice president of product management at Oracle Health, in a statement. “By bringing comprehensive generative AI and voice-first capabilities to our EHR platforms, we are not only helping providers reduce mundane work that leads to burnout, but we are also empowering them to create better interactions with patients that establish trust, build loyalty, and deliver better outcomes.”Clinicians also can communicate with patients via web chat embedded in their secure patient portal, such as reminding patients to bring required lab results to an upcoming visit.RelatedOracle Q4 revenue up 18%, boosted by Cerner acquisition and strength in cloud businessesSicilia said Oracle Health was making all of its application programming interfaces (APIs) publicly available. ""Our investment in OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] will allow us to build a more open, intelligent, cloud-based healthcare platform,"" he told the audience Tuesday. ""To do so, we're announcing that we're going to increase the surface area of the APIs—that's the things that your IT department, your partners and other third parties are using to connect to Cerner Millennium—by 300% in the next 12 months. And, we're making every single API public, which means that you can use them yourself to replace components, your partners can use them, and frankly, our competitors are welcome and encouraged to use them as well.""Oracle's move to incorporate generative AI into its Cerner EHR comes several months after rival Epic has charged ahead to infuse the technology into its clinical and health IT systems. The company announced back in April during the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference in Chicago that it was working with Microsoft to integrate large language model tools and AI into its electronic health record software. The health IT vendor and the tech giant are collaborating to combine the Azure OpenAI Service with Epic’s EHR software with an initial focus on drafting message responses.The EHR giant has continued to roll out more tools to help clinicians save time and access critical data at the point of care. Tapping into Microsoft's AI capabilities, Epic launched ""copilot"" solutions to help providers with medical note summarization, offer coding suggestions and provide access to real-world evidence for patient care.Epic also is working with Abridge to integrate the startup's generative AI for clinical documentation into its EHR workflow.Google is collaborating with Meditech to bring generative artificial intelligence to EHRs, including at Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA Healthcare.

Work management software company Smartsheet unveiled its next-generation platform today, debuting features designed to provide users with new generative-AI powered capabilities at scale.
Work in the Smartsheet platform centers around “sheets” that contain information relating to a particular project or projects, within which users can include a variety of details such as a description, status, due dates, and which workers have been assigned to complete a task.
“Our goal is to make our platform not only powerful, but intuitive, beautiful, and delightful to use. And with this announcement, we’re giving customers more and better ways to visualize their work in Smartsheet,” said Ben Canning, senior vice president of product experiences at Smartsheet, during a press conference. The company is taking a very practical approach to AI, he said.











 
 
 
“We want to make sure that we are providing practical capabilities that use AI to empower our customers to achieve their goals faster and remove some of the drudgery from work,” he said.

Available from today in private beta, the revamped Smartsheet allows customers to use conversational prompts to generate data insights and visual charts, a capability that is currently limited to individual sheets but in the future will be derived from thousands of active projects and data stores.
Users will be able to offer up simple descriptions in order generate formulas or content such as sheet summaries, translations, and image captions through its digital asset management tool, Brandfolder. Additionally, users will be able to create custom solutions simply by responding to questions posed by the platform.











 
 
 
Smartsheet’s new AI-powered assistant can also provide customized, natural language responses to questions posed by customers.
“Smartsheet is being pragmatic with its AI capabilities focusing them on addressing common friction points in the Smartsheet user experience like working with formulas and more quickly building custom solutions,” said analyst Chris Marsh, who leads workforce productivity and collaboration research practice in S&P Global Market Intelligence.
He added that the company had opted to apply AI where there is scale advantage such as analyzing large volumes of data in its grid and autocaptioning images, and focus less on text generation.











 
 
 
Building out the platform at scale
In addition to the AI capabilities now on offer from Smartsheet, the updated version of the platform is also designed to make it easier for users to work at scale. By January, the Smartsheet Control Center will support 20,000 active projects per business program, a 20-fold, year-over-year increase, and in 2024, every sheet will also support five million cells and allow five million sheet links — a 250-time increase above the current level — per sheet.
A new timeline view will give teams a big-picture look into date-based work and allow data to be organized into visual groups or by project milestones, making it easier to see key dates. Smartsheet is also previewing its refreshed Grid and Card Views and customers can soon create more modern and colorful dashboards that provide multiwidget editing, scaling optimizations and wider canvases. Soon -to-be released dashboard snapshots will allow users to schedule regular, automatic dashboard deliveries.
Business and Enterprise users will soon have access to two new features: Workload Heatmap and Workload Schedule. Available directly in project sheets, these new tools give project managers the ability to quickly identify who is working on what, address over-allocations, and make data-driven staffing decisions to ensure the successful delivery of projects.











 
 
 
Finally, for advanced protection, Enterprise plan customers can purchase Smartsheet Safeguard, a collection of security and governance controls that includes customer-managed encryption keys, data egress policies, event reporting, and data retention controls.
“The things Smartsheet is announcing speak to the opportunity the category has around scaling into more strategic customer deployments,” said Marsh, who noted that much of the growth in work management software is being driven by large customer deployments where capabilities like sophisticated project and portfolio management, advanced security and governance features, and massive capacity in managing volumes of data are needed.
Though companies are still in the discovery phase of how AI can benefit them on a daily basis, vendors are quickly jumping on the bandwagon, said Margo Visitacion, principal analyst for portfolio management and enterprise architecture at Forrester.











 
 
 
“Right now, it’s the vendors leading the charge, but they need to bring real value to the table in terms of automation, smart decision making and ultimately successful business outcomes to sustain interest and adoption — and sustainability means vendors must be ethical in how they are dealing with customer data,” she said.

This summer, images abounded of striking writers and actors wielding picket signs as they marched outside major media corporations. Though their demands are wide-ranging, one issue has dominated headlines — artificial intelligence. It is a topic that has made its way to the bargaining sessions of labor unions across industries, including journalism. As news executives scramble to cobble together guidelines for their newsrooms and assemble working groups to experiment with AI, their employees are organizing to find ways to protect their jobs from the new technology. They are fighting to ensure that AI won’t replace the work they do and that content produced with the help of AI tools meets rigorous journalistic standards. “This is a really hot topic of conversation in union circles because we realize the power it (AI) has,” said Mike Davis, a reporter and the unit chair of the APP-MCJ Guild, which represents journalists at the Gannett-owned Asbury Park Press, Home News Tribune and Courier News in New Jersey. “This stuff’s going to get better and better. I would be hard-pressed to find a Gannett bargaining unit that is not thinking about this.” Unions representing hundreds of journalists, including editorial staff at The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times, have proposed contract language addressing AI this summer. At least one unit has found success. Last month, journalists at the Financial Times Specialist ratified their first contract, which includes the right to bargain over the effects of newly introduced technology like AI. FT Specialist Guild shop steward David Isenberg said his union had been in conversation with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, who had a clause addressing new technology in their contract. The FT Specialist Guild’s new contract requires the company to discuss in advance the introduction of any new technology that “materially impacts” employees. Union members may also raise concerns individually, and the guild has a right to “bargain expeditiously” with the company over the effects the new technology will have on employees’ wages, benefits and working conditions. At first, the company wanted the right to just discuss changes, not bargain over them, Isenberg, who covers the Securities and Exchange Commission for FT Specialist, said. However, the union pushed for the word “bargain” because it comes with special legal obligations. “Bargaining under the law means they have to actually consider granting concessions and try working in good faith to find an agreement,” Isenberg said. “A discussion is, ‘Hey, this is what we’re going to do,’ and then the union says, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that.’ And they say, ‘Hey, we discussed it with you,’ and then they implement exactly what they want.” Other unions are still struggling to negotiate AI-related agreements. The chief concern among many is the potential loss of jobs. The proposals put forth by the APP-MCJ Guild and the AP News Guild, which represents journalists and technicians working for the Associated Press in the United States, both require their respective companies to provide 90 days advance notice of new technology affecting newsroom functions and prohibit using such tools to reduce or eliminate union work. “If such technology involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning or deep learning, it shall be limited to supplementing the collection, organization, recording or maintenance of information,” their proposals read in part. (APP-MCJ Guild and the AP News Guild are separate units, but they share the NewsGuild as a parent union.) “AI shall not be used to perform work that is editorial in nature, including but not limited to the interpretation or analysis of information, communications with sources or generation of news content or illustrations.” IAPE Local 1096 — which represents 1,400 Dow Jones employees, including Wall Street Journal journalists — has also put together a proposal barring the company from displacing union members via AI. Union president and Dow Jones content operations specialist Jodi Green said that some audio journalists have shared concerns about AI being used to replicate their voices to generate content. Though many news outlets have pledged not to replace workers with AI, at least one has already gone back on its word. As a result, unions are pushing companies to commit to protections against AI by enshrining them in contracts, which usually remain in effect for several years. Last month, G/O Media laid off its four-person Gizmodo en Español team in favor of AI-powered translations even though CEO Jim Spanfeller had told Vox a month earlier that the company would not use AI to replace staff. GMG Union, which represents workers at Gizmodo, Jezebel, The Root, A.V. Club, Deadspin and several other G/O Media brands, released several statements condemning the company’s use of AI. The union ratified a contract last year, before AI exploded in popularity, but one editor told Digiday that the union has been lobbying the company to return to the bargaining table to add AI-related language to the contract. Union leaders representing staff at Gannett’s New Jersey newsrooms, Dow Jones and the AP all said that management has refused to agree to their proposals. Gannett has said it reserves the right to unilaterally make decisions regarding AI, Davis said. Dow Jones has taken a similar stance, according to Green. The company has compared AI’s usage to outsourcing, she said. The union’s contract currently requires Dow Jones to notify the union ahead of time if it wishes to outsource jobs and to provide affected employees with money for additional training, and the company wants to set up similar provisions for AI. Spokespeople for Gannett and Dow Jones declined to comment on union contract negotiations. At the AP, management has pushed for the ability to use AI to perform the work of people who have already left, News Media Guild president Vin Cherwoo said. AP spokesperson Lauren Easton objected to this, writing, “AP has used AI and automation for nearly a decade to free up journalists to do more meaningful work, not as a replacement for journalist jobs. AP has no plans or desire to use AI to replace journalists.” Among AP’s uses of AI are earnings reports and sports briefs. Cherwoo, a sports reporter and editor for AP, said the automated sports stories lack context that only human journalists can provide. He added that using generative AI to produce stories in the future raises concerns about accuracy, as many AI programs tend to “hallucinate” and make up facts. In January, CNET came under fire when its AI reporter was found to have plagiarized other writers’ work to produce stories filled with factual errors. The incident made employees, who were already organizing with the Writers Guild at the time, realize that they needed to address AI. CNET journalists went public with their union drive in May, and they are preparing to negotiate their first contract with owner Red Ventures this fall. Bargaining committee member and CNET editor Laura Michelle Davis (no relation to Mike Davis) said the CNET Media Workers Union wants a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows and transparency about what data is used to train any AI tools the company uses. They are also seeking the editorial discretion to not use AI if it fails to meet publishing standards, the right to opt out of using AI without reprisal, and the assurance that AI will not be used to modify already published content after employees leave CNET. “We’re concerned about protecting our staff, our writers and editors, and their bylines,” Laura Michelle Davis said. “We don’t want them to be held responsible either externally or internally for any decisions made by management around artificial intelligence.” The unions are all talking formally and informally with other unions, as well as their parent organizations, about the issue. The Writers Guild has held several industrywide meetings on AI, and members of the digital media shops have joined the striking screenwriters on the picket lines in solidarity, Isenberg said. Many of the AI-related issues facing the screenwriters of the Writers Guild and the actors of the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are very different from those of journalists. Nevertheless, Mike Davis said he has found the Hollywood strikes to be a “wonderful tool” for keeping people energized and informed. “I think the SAG-AFTRA strike and WGA strike are hugely important because we’re all news people, so we all pay attention to the issues affecting the news and media industry, but also … a lot of us like to watch movies and TV shows,” Mike Davis said. “So when the people we appreciate in that field are talking about this stuff and how important it is, I think it just naturally takes a little bit of a bigger place in your mind. I think we pay attention to it a lot more.” Cherwoo said that if unions aren’t discussing AI now, they definitely will once their contracts expire and they return to the bargaining table. He added that those unions will likely look back at the conversations happening today to determine what protections they should seek in the future. “We’re kind of setting the stage for everybody,” Cherwoo said. “The language that we get, that we bargain for, is going to be the standard, most likely, that other news unions are going to be presenting to their companies.”

Generative AI is making it easier to work multiple jobs at the same time. AI tools will lift earnings from multiple jobs by at least $83 billion by 2030, Morgan Stanley says.Multi-earning in the US has increased 11% in the past year, the bank's survey work found.

If AI can do some of your job, why not take another one on the side?That's the thinking behind a big new study released this week by researchers at Morgan Stanley.The investment bank conducted surveys in several countries, including the US, UK, and India, to get a sense for how many people have or plan to take on multiple jobs or set up multiple earnings streams in other ways.

Official data tracked by Morgan Stanley shows 5% of the population working multiple jobs, with that growing 5% a year. Unofficial data suggests it's more like 8-10% of the population, with interest in multiple jobs growing more than 18% a year, the bank's researchers wrote in a note to clients.

The bank conducted a similar study about a year ago, and since then the multi-job trends has picked up, with the rise of generative AI powering the change. ""The main driver which has changed since our original thesis is the advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratised access to generative AI tools,"" the researchers wrote.

They forecast $400 billion in income from multiple jobs by 2030, with generative AI contributing about $83 billion of that. In a much more bullish scenario, the bank sees $1.4 trillion in multi-earning income, with generative AI kicking in $300 billion of that.

There's been an explosion of AI tools in the past year, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4 from OpenAI, Bard and underlying AI models from Google, Claude 2 from Anthropic, and Midjourney. These services can answer questions convincingly, generate images on command, complete software code, and perform a host of other tasks.

With these new tools, employees suddenly have ways of producing work more quickly than before, making it easier to juggle multiple jobs. Morgan Stanley noted a 14% lift in call center productivity and a 55% boost for writing code, as examples. Side hustles where generative AI can help include affiliate marketing, e-commerce dropshipping, content creation, tutoring, graphic and web design, programming, and renting rooms or other space, according to Morgan Stanley. In content creation and e-commerce, 37% and 34% of respondents respectively said their income had been boosted with the help of generative AI tools.The average multi-earner is making $8.50 an hour when using generative AI, and $7 an hour without the technology, Morgan Stanley's surveys found.

AdChoicesADVERTISING“There’s  a tremendous amount of hype in the market around generative AI and a lot of  confusion over its potential impact on cost and staffing. But for the first  time, we’ve taken a fact-based approach to validating the eye-popping headlines  and quantified the potential benefit based on an analysis of data from our  extensive benchmarking of Global 1000 companies across the various SG&A  functions. We’ve concluded that generative AI plays a critical role in the  intelligent automation framework, which includes robotic process automation,  intelligent data capture, cognitive tools and more. It has a multiplier effect  in terms of enabling dramatic efficiency and effectiveness improvements in  structured, unstructured and interactive work. Without generative AI, companies  will see only incremental reductions in cost and staffing from these other  intelligent automation technologies,” says The Hackett Group principal Vin  Kumar. Key  takeaways:For a typical $10 billion company, generative  AI has the potential to reduce SG&A costs by more than $180 million  annually, the research found. The analysis considered the elimination of  structured work through hyper-automation; the ability to enable unstructured  work by adopting digital assistants; and enhancing interactive work through  personalization at scale. The Hackett Group also launched its Generative  AI Executive Advisory Program, and completed development of its AI Explorer  assessment tool to help clients understand the impact of AI on their  operations.Facebook IconLinkedIn IconTwitter X iconLatest in AI/ARSponsoredUnlock Your Food & Beverage Fleet's Full PotentialJuly 2, 2024Triimble’s New End-To-End Asset Lifecycle Management Software Suite to Help Connect Digital WorkflowsJuly 22, 2024SponsoredDigitize Loading Dock ManagementJuly 1, 2024Port of Long Beach Data Project Speeds Cargo DeliveryJuly 12, 2024RecommendedHiringHyundai Material Handling Announces Director of Dealer Development & National AccountsPersonnel updates sees new appointments at Cirba, HeroWear and more.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 11, 2024RetentionPost-Pandemic Supply Chains: An SCN Summit RecapWithout a crystal ball, the best way to solidify operations might be to reflect on previous practices and merge the best qualities with the technologies available to keep up with the market, demands and expectations of tomorrow.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 4, 2024Mentorship ProgramsShattering Glass Ceilings at This Year’s Women in Supply Chain ForumRegister today for this year's Women in Supply Chain Forum, scheduled for Nov. 12-13 in Atlanta.Marina MayerApril 1, 2024","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.sdcexec.com/software-technology/ai-ar/news/22873506/the-hackett-group-inc-generative-ai-will-drive-reductions-in-sga-cost-and-staffing'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Marina Mayer'],,,https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2023/09/Kaikoro_AdobeStock_245853295.6509aea3ea8e6.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&q=70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
