The one sure way not to forecast the impact of artificial-intelligence technologies is technological determinism.
Judith Clifton
Will artificial intelligence affect how and where we work? To what extent is AI already fundamentally reshaping our relationship to work? Over the last decade, there has been a boom in academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about these possible effects of AI—creating both utopian and dystopian visions of the future workplace. Despite this proliferation, AI remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood.  
Amy Glasmeier
Many studies have tried to answer the question whether AI and automation will create mass unemployment. Depending on the methodologies, approach and countries covered, the answers are wildly different. The Oxford University scholars Frey and Osborne predict that up to 47 per cent of US jobs will be at ‘high risk’ of computerisation by the early 2030s, while a study for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by Arntz et al asserts that this is too pessimistic, finding only 9 per cent of jobs across the OECD to be automatable.
Mia Gray
In a new paper, we argue that the impact of AI on work is not deterministic: it will depend on a range of issues, including place, educational levels, gender and, perhaps most importantly, government policy and firm strategy.

Highly uneven
First, we challenge the commonly held assumption that the effects of AI on work will be homogeneous across a country. Indeed, a growing number of studies argue that the consequences for employment will be highly uneven. Place matters because of the importance of regional sectoral patterns: industrial processes and services are concentrated and delivered in particular areas. At present AI appears to coinhabit locations of pre-existing regional industry agglomerations.
Moreover, despite globalisation, national and local industrial cultures and working practices often vary by place. Different cultural work practices mean that, once deployed, the same technology may operate distinctly in diverse environments. 
Secondly, education matters. Generally, jobs occupied by less-educated workers are more susceptible to the impacts of AI and automation, compared with better-educated peers performing more complex and discretionary tasks. For example, in the financial and insurance sectors repetitive, data-intensive operations may be more automatable in the US than in the UK, due to the differences in average education levels within these professions. Another example is legal services, where those in paralegal, less-skilled occupations are at most risk of displacement.

Thirdly, it appears men’s jobs are currently more vulnerable to automation—especially those requiring lower educational attainment, since these tend to be routine industrial tasks amenable to mechanisation. This may however change in the future.
Women dominate many care jobs in ‘high touch’ occupations, where emotional and cognitive labour are significant. These jobs appear more resistant to technological encroachment, as they involve face-to-face work. In the medium term, though, emerging applications aim to augment even these service functions with machine assistance and are likely to interact with and produce new gendered divisions of labour.
Narrow focus
Fourthly, the consequences of AI on work will depend, crucially, on policy and the firm. Acemoglu and Restrepo argue that productivity increases could outweigh the displacement effect of technologies under the ‘right’ type of AI: if governments actively support AI which enhances jobs, rather than AI which seeks to eliminate jobs, the outcome could be positive overall.
To do this well, government also needs to accompany AI with social policy. Governments have started publishing AI policies in the last few years. But a comparative analysis of government AI strategies shows that, to date, the great bulk of policy has focused narrowly on economic gains, with very little attention paid to social issues. Yet understanding the latter is a precondition of societies being able to evaluate, and regulate, new applications of AI.
Firms, too, can opt to promote the ‘right’ type of AI—or not. Meanwhile, they may increasingly turn to AI to support recruitment.
This could be problematic, since AI algorithms have been found to contain embedded gender and racial biases. The use of such technologies as facial and voice recognition, automated screening of curricula vitae and targeted profiling may inadvertently reduce the pool of eligible job-seeking applicants in profoundly prejudicial ways. If businesses put these to use for recruitment purposes, the distribution of job opportunities could be profoundly affected, and AI might reproduce pre-existing biases around gender, ethnicity, and class.
Two paths
At its starkest, we see two paths forward. Fuelled by scare tactics and the ‘great unknown’, consulting firms are pushing companies to jump on the AI bandwagon, to avoid becoming economic ‘laggards’. Each consultancy is carving out a niche toward distinct trajectories, from relying on cutting costs to eliminating low-skilled labour—and encouraging government AI policies to focus on economic gains.
Another path is however possible. The potential exists for AI applications to enable the reskilling of existing workforces, thus allowing workers to use their skills alongside new technologies. AI and associated technologies can be used to help transform education and health and, even, attain peace.
There is nothing preordained about how AI will be deployed. The application consequences of these technologies will reflect choices made at the organizational, political and societal levels. The future of AI is too important to be left to technology specialists. Social scientists, lawyers of technology and experts in the ethics of technology need actively to engage in shaping and structuring its development and adoption.

Now, researchers are finding that machines can bring out the best in group work.It’s long been recognised that when groups of people come together to solve a problem they can become more than the sum of their parts. The ‘wisdom of the crowd’ has been acknowledged as far back as Ancient Greece, when Aristotle noted that many unremarkable men often make better collective judgments than great individuals.Multiple people weighing in on a problem might intuitively seem to lead to a better outcome, but as any manager will tell you, keeping a large team on task is not easy. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) could make harnessing this collective wisdom much easier, making us more effective at our jobs and better able to solve pressing social challenges.“We know that the future of work is all about collaboration and problem solving,” says Peter Baeck, who leads the Centre for Collective Intelligence Design at Nesta, a UK charity that funds and promotes research into groundbreaking ideas. “One of the most obvious opportunities is using AI to better create connections within often quite chaotic messy networks of people who are working on a common challenge.”The biggest factor affecting how collectively intelligent a group can be is the degree of coordination among its members – Anita WoolleyThe biggest factor affecting how collectively intelligent a group can be is the degree of coordination among its members, says Anita Woolley, a leading expert in organisational behaviour at Carnegie Mellon University. Smart tools can be a boon in this area, which is why Woolley is working with colleagues to develop AI-powered coaches that can track group members and provide prompts to help them work better as a team.“The roles these [AI] tools can play are virtually endless,” says Woolley. “Fostering communication among the different components, reminding people of stuff they might have forgotten, being a repository of information, helping the group coordinate its decision making.”Getty ImagesSome firms are looking to the collective decision-making of bee swarms to help humans work together better (Credit: Getty Images)Hive mindsThere are already promising examples of how AI can help us better pool our unique capabilities. San Francisco start-up Unanimous AI has built an online platform that helps guide group decisions. They’ve looked to an unlikely place to guide their AI: the way honeybees make collective decisions.“We went back to basics and said, ‘How does nature amplify the intelligence of groups?’,” says CEO Louis Rosenberg. “What nature does is form real-time systems, where the groups are interacting all at once together with feedback loops. So, they're pushing and pulling on each other as a system, and converging on the best possible combination of their knowledge, wisdom, insight and intuition.”What nature does is form real-time systems, where the groups are interacting all at once together with feedback loops – Louis RosenbergTheir Swarm AI platform presents groups with a question and places potential answers in different corners of their screen. Users control a virtual magnet with their mouse and engage in a tug of war to drag an ice hockey puck to the answer they think is correct. The system’s algorithm analyses how each user interacts with the puck – for instance, how much conviction they drag it with or how quickly they waver when they’re in the minority – and  uses this information to determine where the puck moves. That creates feedback loops in which each user is influenced by the choice and conviction of the others allowing the puck to end up at the answer best reflecting the collective wisdom of the group.Several academic papers and high-profile clients who use the product back up the effectiveness of the Swarm AI platform. In one recent study, a group of traders were asked to forecast the weekly movement of several key stock market indices by trying to drag the puck to one of four answers — up or down by more than 4%, or up and down by less than 4%. With the tool, they boosted their accuracy by 36%.Credit Suisse has used the platform to help investors forecast the performance of Asian markets; Disney has used it to predict the success of TV shows; and Unanimous has even partnered with Stanford Medical School to boost doctors’ ability to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays by 33%.Getty Images‘Swarm intelligence’ can help radiologists reduce errors by a third when diagnosing pneumonia (Credit: Getty Images)Team buildingBut designing technology that can mesh well with human teams can be surprisingly difficult, says Woolley, who is working with colleagues to develop AI-powered coaches that can track group members and provide prompts to help them work better as a team.In one study, her team tried out three different tools designed to maximise collective intelligence: one that gave real-time feedback on team members’ effort, another that helped divide and assign tasks and a chatbot that helped the group talk about their skills and expertise.It's easier to be harmful or to create things that annoy people than it is to create things that are honestly helpful – Anita WoolleyThe first tool appeared to demotivate people, while the second ended up distracting teams with unnecessary planning. Only the final tool helped, by ensuring the best-suited people worked on each task. “What we keep discovering is that it's easier to be harmful or to create things that annoy people than it is to create things that are honestly helpful,” says Woolley.It is still really difficult to build AI with social intelligence, she says, because machines continue to struggle to pick up the nuanced social cues that guide so much of group dynamics. It’s also evident from Woolley’s research that these kinds of systems only work if humans truly trust AI decision making, and if users are only receiving gentle nudges from the system. “As soon as it's heavy handed, people are looking for ways to disable it,” says Woolley.Getty ImagesRobots struggle with the social cues that make up group dynamics, and humans struggle to trust AI systems that are too heavy-handed (Credit: Getty Images)But the reasons why it can be hard to combine machines and humans are also central to why they work so well together, says Baeck. AI can operate at speeds and scales far out of our reach, but machines are still a long way from replicating human flexibility, curiosity and grasp of context.A recent report Baeck co-authored with Nesta senior researcher Aleks Berditchevskaia identified a number of ways AI could enhance our collective intelligence. This includes helping make better sense of data, finding better ways to coordinate decision making, helping us overcome our inherent biases and highlighting unusual solutions that are often overlooked.But the report also showed that combining AI tools with human teams requires careful design to avoid unintended consequences. And there is currently a dearth of research into how groups react to being corralled by AI, says Berditchevskaia, making it hard to predict how effective these systems will be in the wild.“It can potentially stretch us in new ways or enhance our speed when we need to be reacting quicker,” she adds. “But we're still at very early stages of understanding and being able to navigate the individual reactions to those kinds of AI system in terms of issues of trust and how it affects their own sense of agency.”Humanising AIOur combined wisdom can also help give a more human element to AI technology, and better guide its decisions.At London-based start-up Factmata, which has built an AI moderation system, the company has enlisted more than 2,000 experts, including journalists and researchers, to analyse online content for things including bias, credibility or hate speech. They then used this analysis to train a natural-language processing system to automatically scan web pages for problematic content.“Once you have that trained algorithm it can scale to those millions of pieces of content across the internet,” says CEO Dhruv Ghulati. “You're able to scale up the critical assessment of those experts.”While AI is often trained on data labelled by experts in a one-off process, Factmata’s experts continually refresh the training data to make sure the algorithms can keep up with the ever-shifting political and media landscape. They also let members of the public give feedback on the AI’s output, which Ghulati says ensures it remains relevant and free of bias itself.Entwining ourselves and our decisions every more tightly with AI is not without risks, however. The synergy between AI and collective intelligence works best the more information we give the machine, says Woolley, which involves difficult choices about how much privacy we’re happy to surrender.We can have some very smart individuals working on different components in isolation, but if we don't have coordination it's really hard to make any headway – Anita WoolleyBut given the world’s complex multifaceted challenges, such as climate change and pandemics, harnessing our collective intelligence more effectively is essential, she says.There are already examples of how the approach could tackle these kinds of problems. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon are currently forecasting the Covid-19 pandemic in real time by using machine learning to combine voluntary symptom surveys, doctors’ reports, lab statistics and Google search trends. Elsewhere, the Early Warning Project in the US has identified countries at greatest risk of atrocities using a combination of crowd-sourced predictions, expert assessments and machine learning algorithms.“We can have some very smart individuals working on different components in isolation, but if we don't have coordination it's really hard to make any headway,” says Woolley. “I think it's going to be critical to helping these different components actually coordinate in the ways needed to address the biggest collective action problems.”Technology",NewsArticle,,,['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p08d0715.jpg'],,,How AI can help us harness our 'collective intelligence',2020-05-14T03:16:35.000Z,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Edd Gent', 'url': ''}",,,,,2022-02-25T06:48:21.050Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 12, 2020, 12:00 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by James Bareham / The VergeFacebook on Monday released a new report detailing how it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human fact-checkers and moderators to enforce its community standards. The report — called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months — has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators. Facebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms’ employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform. Facebook says the data it’s compiled its most recent report doesn’t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. “This report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,” writes Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. “We anticipate we’ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.’Given the state of the world, Facebook’s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools. Facebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month“During the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,” the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. “Since March 1st, we’ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.”Facebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links. “We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos,” the company says in a separate hate speech-specific blog post about its recent moderation findings and research. “As with other content, hate speech also can be multimodal: A meme might use text and image together to attack a particular group of people, for example.”This is a tougher challenge for AI to tackle, the company admits. Not only do AI-trained models have a harder time parsing a meme image or a video due to complexities like wordplay and language differences, but that software must also then be trained to find duplicates or only marginally modified versions of that content as it spreads across Facebook. But this is precisely what Facebook says it’s achieved with what it calls SimSearchNet, a multiyear effort across many divisions within the company to train an AI model how to recognize both copies of the original image and those that are near-duplicates and have perhaps one word in the line of text changed. “We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos.”“Once independent fact-checkers have determined that an image contains misleading or false claims about coronavirus, SimSearchNet, as part of our end-to-end image indexing and matching system, is able to recognize near-duplicate matches so we can apply warning labels,” the company says. “This system runs on every image uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and checks against task-specific human-curated databases. This accounts for billions of images being checked per day, including against databases set up to detect COVID-19 misinformation.” Facebook uses the example of a misleading image modeled after a broadcast news graphic with a line of overlaid text reading, “COVID-19 is found in toilet paper.” The image is from a known peddler of fake news called Now8News, and the graphic has since been debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations. But Facebook says it had to train its AI to differentiate between the original image and a modified one that says, “COVID-19 isn’t found in toilet paper.” The goal is to help reduce the spread of duplicate images while also not inadvertently labeling genuine posts or those that don’t meet the bar for misinformation. This is a big problem on Facebook where many politically motivated pages and organizations or those that simply feed off partisan outrage will take photographs, screenshots, and other images and alter them to change their meaning. An AI model that knows the difference and can label one as misinformation and the other as genuine is a meaningful step forward, especially when it can then do the same to any duplicate or near-duplicate content in the future without roping in non-offending images in the process.  Image: Facebook“It’s extremely important that these similarity systems be as accurate as possible, because a mistake can mean taking action on content that doesn’t actually violate our policies,” the company says. “This is particularly important because for each piece of misinformation fact-checker identifies, there may be thousands or millions of copies. Using AI to detect these matches also enables our fact-checking partners to focus on catching new instances of misinformation rather than near-identical variations of content they’ve already seen.”Facebook has also improved its hate speech moderation using many of the same techniques it’s employing toward coronavirus-related content. “AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove, up from 80.2 percent the previous quarter,” the company says. “In the first quarter of 2020, we took action on 9.6 million pieces of content for violating our hate speech policies — an increase of 3.9 million.”Facebook is able to rely more on AI, thanks to some advancements in how its models understand and parse text, both as it appears in posts and accompanying links and as overlaid in images or video. “AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove.”“People sharing hate speech often try to elude detection by modifying their content. This sort of adversarial behavior ranges from intentionally misspelling words or avoiding certain phrases to modifying images and videos,” the company says. “As we improve our systems to address these challenges, it’s crucial to get it right. Mistakenly classifying content as hate speech can mean preventing people from expressing themselves and engaging with others.” Facebook says so-called counterspeech, or a response to hate speech that argues against it but nonetheless usually contains snippets of the offensive content, is “particularly challenging to classify correctly because it can look so similar to the hate speech itself.”Facebook’s latest report includes more data from Instagram, including how much bullying content that platform removes and how much of the content is appealed and reinstated. It applied its image-matching efforts toward finding suicide and self-injury posts, raising the percentage of Instagram content that was removed before users reported it.Suicide and self-injury enforcement on Facebook also expanded in the last quarter of 2019, when the company removed 5 million pieces of content — double the amount it had removed in the months before. A spokesperson says this spike stemmed from a change that let Facebook detect and remove lots of very old content in October and November, and the numbers dropped dramatically in 2020 as it shifted its focus back to newer material.Facebook says its new advances — in particular, a neural network it calls XLM-R announced last November — are helping its automated moderation systems better understand text across multiple languages. Facebook says XLM-R allows it “to train efficiently on orders of magnitude more data and for a longer amount of time,” and to transfer that learning across multiple languages. But Facebook says memes are proving to be a resilient and hard-to-detect delivery mechanism for hate speech, even with its improved tools. So it built a dedicated “hateful meme” data set containing 10,000 examples, where the meaning of the image can only be fully understood by processing both the image and the text and understanding the relationship between the two. An example is an image of a barren desert with the text, “Look how many people love you,” overlaid on top. Facebook calls the process of detecting this with automated systems multimodal understanding, and training its AI models with this level of sophistication is part of its more cutting-edge moderation research.  Image: Facebook“To provide researchers with a data set with clear licensing terms, we licensed assets from Getty Images. We worked with trained third-party annotators to create new memes similar to existing ones that had been shared on social media sites,” the company says. “The annotators used Getty Images’ collection of stock images to replace the original visuals while still preserving the semantic content.”Facebook says it’s providing the data set to researchers to improve techniques for detecting this type of hate speech online. It’s also launching a challenge with a $100,000 prize for researchers to create models trained on the data set that can successfully parse these more subtle forms of speech that Facebook is seeing more often now that its systems are more proactively taking down more blatant hateful content. Update May 12th, 3:55PM ET: Added information about Facebook’s $52 million settlement with third-party contract moderators.

The report — called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months — has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators. 

Facebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms’ employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform.

Facebook says the data it’s compiled its most recent report doesn’t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. “This report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,” writes Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. “We anticipate we’ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.’

Given the state of the world, Facebook’s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools. 

""Facebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month""

“During the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,” the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. “Since March 1st, we’ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.”

Facebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links.

Picking out pests from plants is one use of this AI that can see past camouflageRolf Nussbaumer Photography / Al
Camouflaged objects are difficult to detect, for both humans and artificial intelligence. But now an AI has been trained to parse objects from their backgrounds.
This could have a variety of applications, such as being used for search-and-rescue work, detecting agricultural pests, medical imaging or in military settings.
Detecting camouflaged objects requires visual perception and knowledge. Until now, many AIs have struggled with this task because their algorithms rely on visual cues, such as differences in colour or…

MyOpenCourt currently features two free and simple-to-use web-based tools that harness artificial intelligence and data science technologies. 


As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, millions of Canadians are out of work and facing uncertainty about returning. These circumstances can put workers, particularly those in ‘gig economy’ jobs, in situations where their legal rights are unclear. 
MyOpenCourt, a project of the Conflict Analytics Lab at Queen’s University’s Faculty of Law and Smith School of Business, will now help these workers understand their rights – and options. 
“Most Canadian workers cannot afford an employment lawyer, or live in areas with few skilled employment law experts,” says Samuel Dahan, Director of the Conflict Analytics Lab and a professor in the Faculty of Law with a cross-appointment to Smith. “Since COVID-19’s arrival in Canada, we have seen nearly 2 million jobs lost with terminations and layoffs across many different sectors, and decided to launch our tools to help Canadians who have lost work.”
MyOpenCourt currently features two free and simple-to-use web-based tools that harness artificial intelligence and data science technologies. Both are available at the project site at myopencourt.org. 
The “Am I an employee or contractor?” application can determine the likelihood that a work arrangement is an employment relationship or that of a contractor through a fast, anonymous questionnaire.
Workers who believe they have been wrongfully dismissed can use the “How much severance am I entitled to?” tool to calculate reasonable notice for dismissal.
“These tools are as valuable for employers as they are for workers,” Professor Dahan says. “Navigating employer-contractor relationships is challenging, and severance is difficult to calculate. We hope to provide both workers and employers with ways to avoid pitfalls and find equitable solutions to the challenges created by the pandemic.” 
Powerful AI technology lies behind both tools. Working from thousands of Canadian employment law cases, MyOpenCourt can make predictions that can offer guidance to workers in these uncertain situations. While these applications cannot take the place of a lawyer, they can help users understand if they have a case before contacting one.
Should a user discover they have a case, MyOpenCourt will automatically connect the user to a partner law firm at no cost. 
The MyOpenCourt tools have been developed by students and researchers at Queen’s Law, the Smith Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence, Queen’s Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, and partners like McGill University and institutions based in the U.S. and Europe. Professor Maxime Cohen of McGill and Professor Jonathan Touboul of Brandeis University provided data science expertise, helping to translate the case data into predictions.
“We are thrilled that the Conflict Analytics Lab has been able to launch this platform, at a time when these tools will be able to help many Canadians,” says Yuri Levin, Executive Director of the Analytics and AI ecosystem at Smith and an instrumental player in the creation of the Conflict Analytics Lab.
 MyOpenCourt reasonable notice calculator cannot currently be used to generate case outcomes for Québec-based users.

One of the hum-drum housekeeping tasks that AI already handles at VFX studio Industrial Light & Magic is overseeing the workflow of rendering animation and visual effects. ""We use it for scheduling render jobs on the render farms to get our workloads done every single night in a predictable fashion,"" says Rob Bredow, senior vp, executive creative director and head of ILM, whose recent work includes Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. ""One of the things that's interesting about machine-learning algorithms is, even when they're only 80 or 90 percent effective, sometimes their guesses tend to pretty much align with if you had put a person there and had them make that guess.""

Bones editor Harry B. Miller relates that AI is used for certain tasks in various editing systems including Avid's Media Composer, ""which has a software add-on that matches dialogue spoken in dailies to the script, allowing the editor to quickly find every take and angle for that part of a scene."" Adobe's Premiere Pro can also use AI ""to reframe video for different aspect ratios,"" adds Miller, though he sees limitations. ""A computer may know what a joke is, but it can't tell what is funny,"" he says. ""Stanford University has worked on software that takes motion picture dailies and assembles shots in script order. But it can't tell what is the best dramatic scene. To know what 'works,' for now, takes a human.""

VFX house Digital Domain used AI as part of its Masquerade facial capture system to superimpose Josh Brolin's performance onto the villain Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. ""We've seen huge advancements in that area of research lately,"" says Darren Hendler, director of the studio's digital human group. ""Real-time rendering together with our AI-driven, real-time facial capture system is changing the timelines for creating movie creatures. Soon we'll be able to generate realistic Thanos-like performances live on set."" Hendler says a suite of deep-learning technologies on the horizon ""can potentially allow us to quickly and realistically transform a stunt double into an actor or change an actor's lines.""

AI is having a ""drastic"" effect in the world of digital humans, says Christopher Nichols, director of Chaos Group Labs and key member of the Digital Human League, a research and development group: ""The massive challenges that were put on artists and tools to find all those subtle nuances that make a human look real are actually much easier to solve through deep learning."" The improvements have also led to deepfakes, such as the viral faux PSA using FaceSwap AI in which Jordan Peele ventriloquizes former President ""Barack Obama"" calling President Trump a ""complete dipshit."" Says Nichols: ""A great number of people want to stop the technology and outright outlaw it. [But] the tools themselves have huge potentials that we should all continue to explore."" He concludes, ""What I believe is that we need more education on the subject and better tools that help detect what is real and not real. We have come to accept that Photoshop can manipulate images very well and easily, and we are not banning that as a tool. But we have come to understand and doubt every image that is presented to us.”

How About a Movie From Scratch?Share

""Decades from now, an AI algorithm will make your movie simply from the text of the script,"" even in a particular director's style, predicts Paul Debevec, senior scientist at Google. ""Both scripts and features are just strings of 0's and 1's on a computer. If we provide a sufficiently large neural network and enough training pairing scripts and movies, it will learn the mapping and generate an entirely new movie from an entirely new script. You could even ask it to make your new film — or remake an old one — in the style of Kubrick, Tarantino or Scorsese by emphasizing the correlations between each of their scripts and movies.""

It sounds like it belongs in a history book, filed somewhere between bloodletting and velocipedes. We’d like to think that judging people’s worth based on the size and shape of their skull is a practice that’s well behind us. However, phrenology is once again rearing its lumpy head. In recent years, machine-learning algorithms have promised governments and private companies the power to glean all sorts of information from people’s appearance. Several startups now claim to be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help employers detect the personality traits of job candidates based on their facial expressions. In China, the government has pioneered the use of surveillance cameras that identify and track ethnic minorities. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of schools installing camera systems that automatically sanction children for not paying attention, based on facial movements and microexpressions such as eyebrow twitches. Perhaps most notoriously, a few years ago, AI researchers Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang claimed to have trained an algorithm to identify criminals based on the shape of their faces, with an accuracy of 89.5 per cent. They didn’t go so far as to endorse some of the ideas about physiognomy and character that circulated in the 19th century, notably from the work of the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso: that criminals are underevolved, subhuman beasts, recognisable from their sloping foreheads and hawk-like noses. However, the recent study’s seemingly high-tech attempt to pick out facial features associated with criminality borrows directly from the ‘photographic composite method’ developed by the Victorian jack-of-all-trades Francis Galton – which involved overlaying the faces of multiple people in a certain category to find the features indicative of qualities like health, disease, beauty and criminality. Technology commentators have panned these facial-recognition technologies as ‘literal phrenology’; they’ve also linked it to eugenics, the pseudoscience of improving the human race by encouraging people deemed the fittest to reproduce. (Galton himself coined the term ‘eugenics’, describing it in 1883 as ‘all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had’.) In some cases, the explicit goal of these technologies is to deny opportunities to those deemed unfit; in others, it might not be the goal, but it’s a predictable result. Yet when we dismiss algorithms by labelling them as phrenology, what exactly is the problem we’re trying to point out? Are we saying that these methods are scientifically flawed and that they don’t really work – or are we saying that it’s morally wrong to use them regardless? There is a long and tangled history to the way ‘phrenology’ has been used as a withering insult. Philosophical and scientific criticisms of the endeavour have always been intertwined, though their entanglement has changed over time. In the 19th century, phrenology’s detractors objected to the fact that phrenology attempted to pinpoint the location of different mental functions in different parts of the brain – a move that was seen as heretical, since it called into question Christian ideas about the unity of the soul. Interestingly, though, trying to discover a person’s character and intellect based on the size and shape of their head wasn’t perceived as a serious moral issue. Today, by contrast, the idea of localising mental functions is fairly uncontroversial. Scientists might no longer think that destructiveness is seated above the right ear, but the notion that cognitive functions can be localised in particular brain circuits is a standard assumption in mainstream neuroscience. Phrenology had its share of empirical criticism in the 19th century, too. Debates raged about which functions resided where, and whether skull measurements were a reliable way of determining what’s going on in the brain. The most influential empirical criticism of old phrenology, though, came from the French physician Jean Pierre Flourens’s studies based on damaging the brains of rabbits and pigeons – from which he concluded that mental functions are distributed, rather than localised. (These results were later discredited.) The fact that phrenology was rejected for reasons that most contemporary observers would no longer accept makes it only more difficult to figure out what we’re targeting when we use ‘phrenology’ as a slur today. Both ‘old’ and ‘new’ phrenology have been critiqued for their sloppy methods. In the recent AI study of criminality, the data were taken from two very different sources: mugshots of convicts, versus pictures from work websites for nonconvicts. That fact alone could account for the algorithm’s ability to detect a difference between the groups. In a new preface to the paper, the researchers also admitted that taking court convictions as synonymous with criminality was a ‘serious oversight’. Yet equating convictions with criminality seems to register with the authors mainly as an empirical flaw: using mugshots of convicted criminals, but not of the ones who got away introduces a statistical bias. They said they were ‘deeply baffled’ at the public outrage in reaction to a paper that was intended ‘for pure academic discussions’. From Wu and Zhang (2016) Notably, the researchers don’t comment on the fact that conviction itself depends on the impressions that police, judges and juries form of the suspect – making a person’s ‘criminal’ appearance a confounding variable. They also fail to mention how the intense policing of particular communities, and inequality of access to legal representation, skews the dataset. In their response to criticism, the authors don’t back down on the assumption that ‘being a criminal requires a host of abnormal (outlier) personal traits’. Indeed, their framing suggests that criminality is an innate characteristic, rather than a response to social conditions such as poverty or abuse. Part of what makes their dataset questionable on empirical grounds is that who gets labelled ‘criminal’ is hardly value-neutral. One of the strongest moral objections to using facial recognition to detect criminality is that it stigmatises people who are already overpoliced. The authors say that their tool should not be used in law-enforcement, but cite only statistical arguments about why it ought not to be deployed. They note that the false-positive rate (50 per cent) would be very high, but take no notice of what that means in human terms. Those false positives would be individuals whose faces resemble people who have been convicted in the past. Given the racial and other biases that exist in the criminal justice system, such algorithms would end up overestimating criminality among marginalised communities. The most contentious question seems to be whether reinventing physiognomy is fair game for the purposes of ‘pure academic discussion’. One could object on empirical grounds: eugenicists of the past such as Galton and Lombroso ultimately failed to find facial features that predisposed a person to criminality. That’s because there are no such connections to be found. Likewise, psychologists studying the heritability of intelligence, such as Cyril Burt and Philippe Rushton, had to play fast and loose with their data to manufacture correlations between skull size, race and IQ. If there were anything to discover, presumably the many people who have tried over the years wouldn’t have come up dry. The problem with reinventing physiognomy is not merely that it has been tried without success before. Researchers who persist in looking for cold fusion after the scientific consensus has moved on also face criticism for chasing unicorns – but disapproval of cold fusion falls far short of opprobrium. At worst, they are seen as wasting their time. The difference is that the potential harms of cold fusion research are much more limited. In contrast, some commentators argue that facial recognition should be regulated as tightly as plutonium, because it has so few nonharmful uses. When the dead-end project you want to resurrect was invented for the purpose of propping up colonial and class structures – and when the only thing it’s capable of measuring is the racism inherent in those structures – it’s hard to justify trying it one more time, just for curiosity’s sake. However, calling facial-recognition research ‘phrenology’ without explaining what is at stake probably isn’t the most effective strategy for communicating the force of the complaint. For scientists to take their moral responsibilities seriously, they need to be aware of the harms that might result from their research. Spelling out more clearly what’s wrong with the work labelled ‘phrenology’ will hopefully have more of an impact than simply throwing the name around as an insult.

Tech chiefs are looking for some approaches to implement artificial intelligence technologies into their organizations to draw obstruction and include values, for example, AI is immovably utilized in the banking and media industry. There is a wide arrangement of methods that come in the space of artificial intelligence, for example, linguistics, bias, vision, robotics, planning, natural language processing, decision science, etc. Let us learn about some of the major subfields of AI in depth..Machine Learning.ML is maybe the most applicable subset of AI to the average enterprise today. As clarified in the Executive's manual for real-world AI, our recent research report directed by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, ML is a mature innovation that has been around for quite a long time..ML is a part of AI that enables computers to self-learn from information and apply that learning without human intercession. When confronting a circumstance wherein a solution is covered up in a huge data set, AI is a go-to. &quot;ML exceeds expectations at processing that information, extracting patterns from it in a small amount of the time a human would take and delivering in any case out of reach knowledge,&quot; says Ingo Mierswa, founder and president of the data science platform RapidMiner. ML powers risk analysis, fraud detection, and portfolio management in financial services; GPS-based predictions in travel and targeted marketing campaigns, to list a few examples..Neural Network.Joining cognitive science and machines to perform tasks, the neural network is a part of artificial intelligence that utilizes nervous system science ( a piece of biology that worries the nerve and nervous system of the human cerebrum). Imitating the human mind where the human brain contains an unbounded number of neurons and to code brain-neurons into a system or a machine is the thing that the neural network functions..Neural network and machine learning combinedly tackle numerous intricate tasks effortlessly while a large number of these tasks can be automated. NLTK is your sacred goal library that is utilized in NLP. Ace all the modules in it and you'll be a professional text analyzer instantly. Other Python libraries include pandas, NumPy, text blob, matplotlib, wordcloud..Deep Learning.An explainer article by AI software organization Pathmind offers a valuable analogy: Think of a lot of Russian dolls settled within one another. &quot;Profound learning is a subset of machine learning and machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that accomplishes something smart.&quot;.Deep learning utilizes alleged neural systems, which &quot;learn from processing the labeled information provided during training and uses this answer key to realize what attributes of the information are expected to build the right yield,&quot; as per one clarification given by deep AI. &quot;When an adequate number of models have been processed, the neural network can start to process new, inconspicuous sources of info and effectively return precise outcomes.&quot;.Deep learning powers product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix. It works in the background of Google's voice-and image-recognition algorithms. Its ability to break down a lot of high-dimensional information makes deep learning unmistakably appropriate for supercharging preventive maintenance frameworks.Robotics.This has risen as an extremely sizzling field of artificial intelligence. A fascinating field of innovative work for the most part focuses around designing and developing robots. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering consolidated with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and numerous others. It decides the designing, producing, operating, and use of robots. It manages computer systems for their control, intelligent results and data change..Robots are deployed regularly for directing tasks that may be difficult for people to perform consistently. Major robotics tasks included an assembly line for automobile manufacturing, for moving large objects in space by NASA. Artificial intelligence scientists are additionally creating robots utilizing machine learning to set interaction at social levels..Computer Vision.Have you taken a stab at learning another language by labeling the items in your home with the local language and translated words? It is by all accounts a successful vocab developer since you see the words again and again. Same is the situation with computers fueled with computer vision. They learn by labeling or classifying various objects that they go over and handle the implications or decipher, however, at a much quicker pace than people (like those robots in science fiction motion pictures)..The tool OpenCV empowers processing of pictures by applying them to mathematical operations. Recall that elective subject in engineering days called &quot;Fluffy Logic&quot;? Truly, that approach is utilized in Image processing that makes it a lot simpler for computer vision specialists to fuzzify or obscure the readings that can't be placed in a crisp Yes/No or True/False classification. OpenTLA is utilized for video tracking which is the procedure to find a moving object(s) utilizing a camera video stream..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The award was for $210,000, not $210 million. The headline was also changed the reflect the correct amount. The Department of Justice awarded a $210,000 contract to artificial intelligence company Veritone, the firm announced May 12.Under the two-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract, Veritone will provide audio and video transcription services as well as translation services to the department and its 94 U.S. attorneys offices across the country.According to Veritone, the service will reduce the time associated with discovery processes and lower costs.“We appreciate being selected as the provider of AI-based transcription and translation services for the DOJ to assist their agencies with audio and video based discovery, securely and at scale,” said Jon Gacek, head of government, legal and compliance at Veritone. “In our pursuit to help transform government operations through AI-enabled solutions that provide actionable intelligence and tools that save cost, resources and time, this contract represents a major milestone and opportunity for Veritone.”Veritone’s platform, called aiWARE Government, was approved for use in the federal government by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, in March 2019. Its authorization was sponsored by the DOJ.This is Veritone’s first major federal government contract, a company spokesperson confirmed. It previously provided services to the federal government as a subcontractor, including work at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Army.Veritone is looking to expand its footprint in federal contracting. On a May 11 earnings call, Veritone’s president and co-founder Ryan Steelberg said the company is “very optimistic” about its federal business. Its platform is currently used by the Air Force as part of the service’s AFWERX program, a rapid acquisition initiative.“We’re starting to see a lot of those deals start to come in and actually close,” Steelberg said. “So, we are very optimistic about the pipeline for [government, legal and compliance], both from I’ll say more legal-centric initiatives with the DOJ, but also with [the Department of Defense] and other related opportunities within the government.”About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

At the very least though, these bots are pretty useful when it comes to writing parody songs. So, what happens when all of AC/DC's lyrics and music are filtered through AI? The hysterical song ""Great Balls"" is what happens.YouTube user Funk Turkey has used artificial intelligence to create ""new"" songs by certain artists, such as Nickelback, in the past and, here, elected to see what would happen with AC/DC, whose narrow lyrical themes typically center around rocking both the stage and the bedposts, money, cars, gambling.Curiously, the word ""rock"" didn't make a single appearance in this new set of lyrics for ""Great Balls,"" but dogs, women and balls are in overabundance. To craft the song, Funk Turkey ran AC/DC's lyrics through the lyrics.rip service, which then spat them back out as seen below. A predictive algorithm was then used to generate the music.Read the lyrics for ""Great Balls"" directly below and listen to the song at the bottom of the page. Funk Turkey does a pretty passable job at tackling Brian Johnson's voice, which makes this whole thing even greater.I'm gonna ride on the dog a touch too muchThe dog a truck 'cuz I'm justI’m on youShot to fire at will, yeah‘Cause I shoot to shoot my gunAt the triggerIt wasn’t the lightsAnd put your hand out to killYou fool around, you womenWith too many pills, yeahShe got great ballsAnd big ballsToo many women with the ballsSeems like a bone givin’ the ballsA whole ‘lotta woman ‘cuz I’m a ballPoker face was holding a french maidForeign chef I’m givin’ the queenYeah, we’re doin’ fineI’ve got money, neck tiesJust a-givin’ the dog a life of them allShe wouldn’t do, I won’t take you downI’m just givin’ the foolsPull it, pull it, pull it, pull itWasn’t the dog a touch too young to thrill?Great ballsAnd Big ballsToo many women with the ballsSeems like a bone givin’ the ballsA whole ‘lotta woman ‘cuz I’m a ballBollocks, knackers!And I’m not too old to the highway to MarsAss and roll ain’t no Mona LisaForget about the dog, a woman gets meSo what I’m gonna die!Great ballsBig ballsToo many women, yeahGreat ballsAnd big ballsToo many women with the ballsSeems like a bone givin’ the ballsA whole ‘lotta woman ‘cuz I’m a ballGreat ballsAnd big ballsToo many women with the ballsSeems like a bone givin’ the ballsA whole ‘lotta woman ‘cuz I’m a ballYeahRide on my brainOoooh yesAI Bot Creates AC/DC Parody ""Great Balls""See AC/DC's Angus Young in the Top 66 Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Timeloading... Filed Under: AC/DCCategories: Funny, Metal, News, Rock, Songs, Videos, WTFAround The WebA Simple Method to Reduce Neuropathy (Watch)Health Today NewsA 70-year-old Engineer Designed This Nail Clipper for Seniors All Over the WorldSherum1 Simple Trick to Cut Your Electric Bill by 90% (Try Tonight)GadgetVanguardIt's Time to Say Goodbye to Bulky Air Conditioners That Take Up SpaceOutfanyHere's What New Gutter Guards Should Cost You in 2024LeafFilter PartnerWhat Causes of Macular Degeneration Will Surprise YouMacular DegenerationKeurig Alert: the Shocking Fact That Almost Ended Many Users' Loyalty!Coffee MagazineErase Nerve Damage (Neuropathy) With This Simple Daily RoutineWellness Gaze NueroBlurry Vision No More: the 20-second Daily Habit That Restores ClarityHealth News | VisionLoad MorePowered by RevContent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
