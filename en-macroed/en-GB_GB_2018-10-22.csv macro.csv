When we talk about the jobs at risk, artificial intelligence is often seen as the main threat. However, this technology is still at its very beginning, while a lot of jobs are already transforming and even disappearing. Conversely, other jobs seem to resist, even if technologies already exist to replace them.
The extinction of some jobs
You don’t need to be an expert to observe how some jobs are already dying, and the supermarket cashier is one of the most typical examples. For some years, increasing numbers of cashiers have been replaced by self-checkout machines, several of which can be run by one employee… The same can be seen in the fast-food restaurants, at the cinema, at the airport, etc. More and more companies are implementing machines based on apps, tablets, printers, and more, replacing people formerly in charge of the ordering, registering or payment processing. The remaining employees only check the machines and assist customers if needed.
The disappearance of these jobs has nothing to do with the rise of artificial intelligence, as the technologies used have been on the market for a while. More precisely, any job based on delimited tasks, following a specific order, and making predefined choices could already be replaced by the existing technologies.
This is not a new phenomenon. Throughout the last century, a lot of jobs were replaced by machines. Who remember the ticket punchers, aircraft listeners, lamplighters or knockers up? All of these jobs disappeared decades ago, and were being replaced by machines. Actually, they were easily replaced by machines because they were designed as clear-cut, measurable and regularly scheduled tasks. Inherited mainly from the industrial and bureaucratic era, most of these jobs were designed based on the model of the machine. At the end of the day, it was not so difficult to design machine to replace them.
Resisting the rise of automation
However, some jobs resist the rise of automation, in spite of technologies already available on the market. A good example is the librarian: Even if we can consult or buy any book online, librarians have transformed public libraries to stay relevant. The same applies for booksellers, bartenders, florists and more. For instance, in spite of the implementation of numerous automatic coffee machines in most of the public places (train stations, universities, libraries, etc.), people still go and spend time in coffee shops. In a way, the success of chains such as Starbucks can seem a bit anachronistic, as it is cheaper to buy a coffee at the automatic coffee-machine.
Of course, there are many reasons to go to the coffee-shop rather than just grabbing a cup of coffee at the automatic coffee machine, and if we put the quality of the coffee aside, one of the main reasons seems to be the social experience we live. In a 2018 book, Palaces for the People, Eric Klinenberg suggests that places such as public libraries are social infrastructures that play an increasingly important role in our social lives. In a time when people can easily feel isolated, we need more and more places to connect people – and the jobs that make them possible.
Why do some jobs resist while other are dying?
This is an important lesson about the evolution of work as it means that not all the jobs will disappear, but rather those are more based on technical and routine tasks than social ones. According to a 2013 Oxford University study, if your job participates in the making of (good) social experiences for people, you might keep your job. This is an important lesson about the evolution of work and it means that not all jobs will disappear. Plus, it is not the less-qualified jobs that are likely to disappear first, but those are more technical than social. Those who worked as “knockers up” – people paid to wake up other people by knocking at the door or the window in the morning – or the subway-system ticket puncher did important jobs, but they did not participate directly in making connections between people. In a way, most of the jobs currently at risk are facing the same issue.
Conversely, the bartender and the bookseller provide a social experience that people like. It is unlikely – this is always a risky bet to predict the future – that robots will replace the bartenders as they participate in providing a good social experience when we go to the bar or the restaurant. This is even, one might guess, one of the main reason why we go to a bar. Of course, the artificial intelligence will sooner or later affect the world of work as this technology will even be able to perform some creative and cognitive tasks or to express emotions, but we do not need to wait for it to think the future of work.
If you are doing a more technical job than a social one, then your position is at risk (except maybe if you’re doing a creative one). Not in the next 5 to 10 years, but right now. It means that some people might face unemployment, whatever the evolution of technologies. However, if one considers that the social skills will be more and more important – the technical ones can already be partly or entirely automated – qualities such as the empathy, emotional intelligence, and even kindness could well be rewarded on the job market. At the end of the day, no robot or app will replace a smile, a glance or a friendly gesture. At least, not yet.

The first-ever work original work of art created using artificial intelligence to come to auction, Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), smashed expectations at Christie’s New York this morning when it was hammered down for $350,000 after a lively bidding war that lasted for more than six minutes.
The final price, with premium, was $432,500—a whopping 4,320 percent increase from the presale high estimate of $10,000. Intense competition from bidders over the phone, in the room, and online swiftly drove the work over its $7,000 to $10,000 estimate. The action only began to slow after the price exceeded $200,000. An anonymous phone bidder won the lot after a battle between two phone bidders, an online participant in France, and one man in the room.
According to Christie’s catalogue description, the painting—”if that is the right term”—is one of a group of portraits of the fictional Belamy family created by an AI trained by Obvious, a Paris-based collective. Its members—Hugo Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel, and Gauthier Vernier—explore the fields of art and artificial intelligence using a set of algorithms that goes by the acronym GAN, which stands for “generative adversarial network.”

According to Caselles-Dupré, the algorithm used to create the work is composed of two parts: “On one side is the Generator, on the other the Discriminator,” he explained in Christie’s description of the lot. “We fed the system with a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th century to the 20th. The Generator makes a new image based on the set, then the Discriminator tries to spot the difference between a human-made image and one created by the Generator. The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. Then we have a result.”
The AI-generated work was the final lot in a prints and multiples sale at Christie’s New York that included works by Jeff Koons, Banksy, and Christo. The Obvious work was the second most expensive lot in the sale; the top lot was Andy Warhol’s suite of 10 screenprints, Myths (1981), which sold for $780,500.
Perusing the sale beforehand, curious observers might have realized something was afoot. The AI lot is the only one that doesn’t have an artist listed. Instead, the medium for the Belamy portrait is listed as “generative Adversarial Network print, on canvas, 2018, signed with GAN model loss function in ink by the publisher, from a series of eleven unique images, published by Obvious Art, Paris, with original gilded wood frame.”
The head of the prints and multiples department told The Art Newspaper that he is hardly an AI expert—in fact, he only learned about Obvious after reading an article on artnet News about a collector’s purchase of one of their works for around €10,000 ($12,000). (Considering the latest price, that somehow seems like a bargain.)
But Obvious has also attracted its fair share of critics, who contend that the hype about what AI technology can do on its own is premature—and that the current interest is driven more by speculation and novelty than deep engagement.
“People have been working with low resolution GANs like this since 2015,” Robbie Barrat, a young artist who works with AI, recently told artnet News. Barrat adds that last year, when he was 17 years old, he did a project using the exact same type of neural network and an identical data set. “No one in the AI and art sphere really considers them to be artists—they’re more like marketers,” he said.

The portrait, produced by artificial intelligence, hung on the wall opposite an Andy Warhol print and just to the right of a bronze work by Roy Lichtenstein.There were some smiles and at least one frown. Two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work, which looked as though someone had taken a sponge to a 17th-century oil portrait. The arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world’s leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly, with a nod of understanding and a sip of mezcal margarita.Christie’s is hoping for a more explosive reaction on Thursday, when the gavel comes down on “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,” formally testing the art market’s interest in AI art. The work — estimated at $7,000-$10,000 — was a collaboration by the members of Obvious, a French trio composed of a student of machine learning and two business school graduates, none of whom have a background in art. There was no paint or brushes involved, just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans — in this case, thousands of portraits spanning the 14th century to the 20th.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut is it art? Frédérique Baumgartner, an art historian at Columbia University, said the AI work raised questions about “intention and authorship,” but so, too, did artists from the past, including Marcel Duchamp (who famously made art out of a urinal). She went on to compare the portrait’s contrasting tones, coupled with the subject’s sober dress, with the old master of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt van Rijn — though she quickly added, “That’s if I look half-closing my eyes.”ImagePierre Fautrel, one of the three members of the group Obvious that made the portrait using AI, in New York last week.Credit...Nathan Bajar for The New York TimesThe unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in a culture that moves at WiFi-enabled speeds. Christie’s — which shattered auction-house records in 2017 when it sold a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting — reached out directly to Obvious this year, rather than working through a seller. (It is the only AI work in Thursday’s sale of 363 lots.)Surprisingly, the loudest criticism has come not from the art establishment but from the small but passionate community of artists who work with AI, many of whom say that what Christie’s and Obvious suggested was groundbreaking was in fact effectively AI Art 101. Ahmed Elgammal, the director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University, said that the technology used to create the work, Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, had been used by artists since around 2015. “This group was totally irrelevant,” he scoffed.Mario Klingemann, a German artist known for his work with GANs, put it bluntly. “When I saw that announcement” of the auction, he said, “my reaction was ‘you can’t be serious.’” He compared the portrait by Obvious “to a connect-the-dots children’s painting.”Richard Lloyd, the International Head of the Prints & Multiples department at Christie’s, who brought the work in, acknowledged that he hadn’t made an exhaustive search of the small but very active field of AI art. “I just responded to it and thought it’d be cool,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe added of AI art, “It’s just a personal sort of interest I’ve had for quite a few years.” He said he had been inspired by a report earlier this year that Nicolas Laugero Lasserre, a French collector, had privately purchased a portrait from Obvious, for about 10,000 euros, or about $11,400.Image“5908/79530 Self Portraits,” by Mario Klingemann, an artist working with AI who criticized Christie’s for selling the creation by Obvious.Credit...Mario KlingemannWhat struck Mr. Lloyd most, he said, was the work’s resemblance to European portraiture. “It looks like something you’d expect Christie’s to sell,” he explained. “We’re the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million.”He thought that the work Obvious was doing would be a good way to ease potential buyers at Christie’s into work made with AI. “I like the fact that it didn’t at first blush look different,” he said.Many artists and researchers who specialize in artistic applications of AI technology, while generally glad of the potential exposure the sale could bring, say that the portrait chosen by Christie’s is derivative. Codes written to produce the kind of images Obvious has made are also shared freely online among enthusiasts, raising questions of originality.For its part, Obvious acknowledges that the technology it used was gleaned from others. “It’s open source,” explained Pierre Fautrel, one of the group’s members, in an interview in New York last week. “We took a lot of different parts from different people.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe biggest difference between the Obvious portrait and their predecessors’ is the fact that Obvious had theirs printed on canvas and “signed” in the bottom right corner with a mathematical function used to produce it. They also had it extravagantly framed. “We’re introducing it to people who do not necessarily know what a GAN algorithm is,” Mr. Lloyd explained, speaking to the presentation. “It has to be, all things being equal, comparatively simple.”Image“Perception Engines,” by Tom White, another AI artist, was shown at the New Delhi gallery Nature Morte in 2018.Credit...Nature Morte, New DelhiThe opportunity to capitalize on the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence fits in with Christie’s efforts to market itself in new ways.In July it held its first Art & Tech summit, focused on the theme of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (Obvious themselves have sold art on SuperRare, an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell digital artwork using cryptocurrency.)Brick-and-mortar auction houses have been slow to accept art that explores new technologies. To be sure, Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips offer plenty of digitally generated works by blue-chip artists like Andreas Gursky and Christopher Wool. But the sort of digital video and virtual reality pieces that are featured routinely at contemporary art biennials rarely, if ever, appear at auction houses.Artists in the field are hoping that works sold at auctions like Christie’s will increasingly enter private collections. That appears to be happening more often. Earlier this year the New Delhi art gallery Nature Morte hosted what was billed as India’s first exhibition of work made entirely by AI, including works by Mr. Klingemann, Tom White, Memo Akten, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler. In December, Dr. Elgammal of Rutgers will exhibit AI art for sale at SCOPE Miami Beach, a satellite fair during the time of Art Basel Miami Beach.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWho knows what art historians of the future will say about these works and the impact of AI as a tool for artists. But Dr. Baumgartner at Columbia offered a gut response to the Obvious portrait.“It’s just so strange,” she said.A correction was made on Oct. 23, 2018: An earlier version of this article misstated where AI work will be exhibited for sale in Miami.

The development and diffusion of new information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) continue apace, but how are these factors likely to change work styles and worker well-being? More than a few observers take the view that AI will deprive workers of their employment and constitutes a threat to them. However, new information technologies such as AI might affect not simply employment and wages, but also the way workers approach their work, and could influence aspects of their well-being, such as job satisfaction, stress, and health, in a variety of ways.

Relationship between technological innovation, employment, and wages

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, economists have raised the possibility of ""technological unemployment,"" in which employment is lost as a result of technological innovation. In addition, from the 1980s onward, findings of much research by labor economists have shown that the emergence of ""skill-biased technological change,"" the benefits of which accrue only to highly skilled workers causes an increase in wage disparity. In recent years, there have been forecasts that new information technologies such as AI will deprive many of their work, and concerns that this will result in even more serious wage disparities have frequently been expressed.
However, the effects of technological innovation are not limited to employment, unemployment, and wages, but a wider range of issues, for example, on the content of tasks in which workers are engaged, on the workplace environment, and on job satisfaction, stress, and health. Since the range of tasks to which new information technologies can be applied is extraordinarily broad, there should be both positive and negative effects occurring in multiple directions.

Increased job satisfaction and stress caused by the diffusion of new information technologies

In the project of the Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency, we implemented an original survey of approximately 10,000 workers, and analyzed the impact of new information technologies on approaches to work and on well-being. One interesting outcome of this analysis is that, as shown in the Figure, the more advanced the stage of adoption for new information technologies such as AI, the larger is the increase in worker job satisfaction. Conversely, there is a tendency for work-related stress to also increase.

Figure. Changes in Well-Being and Tasks as a Result of the Introduction of New Information Technologies (Subjective Impact)

Note: These are the results of collating responses to the question of how much change has occurred (or how much change is forecasted to occur) in tasks and well-being as a result of the introduction of new information technologies


Increasing task complexity

It is likely that this is related to changes in the content of tasks in which workers are engaged. Because, as shown in the Figure, the more advanced the stage of adoption for information technologies, the greater is the shift in the nature of tasks performed by the worker from highly repetitive routine tasks to non-routine tasks that require complex problems to be resolved. This suggests that when AI technologies are adopted, there is a tendency for workers to move away from tasks that can be accomplished by such technologies, and instead use the time thus freed up to concentrate on more complex tasks that can only be performed by humans.
We interpret this as meaning that many of those workers who have experienced the introduction of new information technologies feel work-related stress as a consequence of increasing task complexity. At the same time, the more complex the work, the greater is the sense of satisfaction when it is accomplished, resulting in a rising trend for job satisfaction.
As shown in the figure, the influence of AI technologies on well-being and approaches to work is complex, it is important to conduct more analyzes on the changes brought about by the emergence and subsequent diffusion of technological innovation.

Job demands-resources model

As shown in the example analysis presented above, the spread of new information technologies may have positive effects, such as an increase in job satisfaction, but it may also cause negative outcomes such as an increase in stress, and arguably it is necessary to find some way of dealing with this issue.
In such situations the ""job demands-resources model"" developed in the occupational health studies provides a useful insight. According to this model, the stress on the worker rises as the demands of the job increase, whereas stress decreases when more resources are made available.
In this context, ""job demands"" includes the number and difficulty of tasks. This corresponds to the introduction of new information technologies, as a consequence of which task difficulty increases, and new skills and knowledge must be acquired to cope. In other words, the increase in stress shown above can be interpreted as an increase in job demands caused by the introduction of new information technologies.
On the other hand, ""job resources"" incorporates a range of factors, such as the support and leadership of line managers, assistance from and trust relationships with coworkers, and efforts made by human resource management. A variety of measures and methods to reinforce those resources is theorized to exist at the firm, workplace, individual, and other levels (Shaufeli et alia (2009), Shimazu and Shaufeli (2009)).

""Job resources"" mitigate increases in stress

We have also reviewed the nature of the influence of ""job resources"" on worker stress and mental health in the course of projects at RIETI. For example, in Kuroda and Yamamoto (2018a, 2018b, 2016), and Sato (2015), the panel data used made it clear that factors such as unambiguous work goals, the amount of individual discretion allowed, a low level of unscheduled work, a workplace culture not based on the assumption of long working hours, the volume of communication between line managers and their subordinates, and the level of ability of line managers all led to improvements in the state of worker mental health, even after controlling for wages, continuous years of service, and other individual attributes. Namely, it is precisely these factors that can be interpreted as ""job resources.""
Since new information technologies such as AI generate a positive influence on work approach and individual well-being, it would seem reasonable to facilitate the maximum possible enjoyment of such benefits. However, negative side effects such as increases in work-related stress and deterioration in health may also occur. Extracting the maximum benefit from the positive aspects of new information technologies requires that ""job resources"" be strengthened, and that side effects be minimized.

IBM is betting on it.IBM has developed a scent algorithm, and it’s coming for the fragrance aisle.by  Chavie LieberOct 24, 2018, 4:30 PM EDTFacebookLinkIBM has developed an AI called Philyra, which can create perfumes for specific customer demographics. Tetra Images/Getty ImagesThe creation of a perfume is often treated as a bespoke art. The French pride themselves on centuries in the olfactory business, and professional scent masters — often referred to as “noses” — spend decades learning the craft, apprenticing under masters. Giant cosmetic companies such as Coty and Estée Lauder write huge checks to storied fragrance agencies, which will employ meticulous perfume chemists, scrupulous in the art of aromachology.A common theme here is that the skill of developing a fragrance is extremely valuable — and extremely human. Scent is, after all, the sense that science says has the strongest ability to evoke memories, or trigger emotions and moods.Now IBM is attempting to turn the traditional model on its head by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to develop scents.Symrise, a major global fragrance company based in Germany with clients including Estée Lauder, Avon, Coty, and Donna Karan, recently tapped the tech giant to study how machine learning can be applied in the world of fragrance.IBM developed an algorithm that studies existing fragrance formulas and then compares the ingredients to other data sets, like geography and customer age. This algorithm, which was created in IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center and which the company has named Philyra, can now develop new perfumes that will target very specific market segments.Achim Daub, a Symrise executive, says the company has already sold two AI-developed perfumes to O Boticário, Brazil’s second-largest beauty store. The two scents, whose names were not shared with Vox, will start selling inside O Boticário’s 4,000 locations next year.It all sounds a bit futuristic. How exactly does the process work? And how can an algorithm understand the sensual, transformative, and personal components of choosing fragrances?How does IBM’s perfume AI work?Symrise has 1.7 million fragrance formulas that it’s collected over the years. These include scents that were sold to companies like Estée Lauder and Coty, which then market and package them as fancy perfumes, as well as flavors and concoctions used for things like toothpaste, pet food, detergent, candles, snack foods, and soda.Symrise shared this list of fragrance formulas, along with information on how they performed sales-wise, with IBM. Philyra added these to a database and compared them to additional customer data provided by Symrise, like which scents were best-sellers and where, who was buying them, and which age demographic prefers which scents the most. Philyra can then use that information to create new formulas targeted to specific demographics.A Symrise perfumer plays with fragrances created by IBM AI, Philyra. SymriseRichard Goodwin, a research scientist at IBM who is part of the team that developed Philyra, describes this artificial fragrance developer as “a system whose learned to create a fragrance like a human apprentice.”“Just like an apprentice would learn from a master what combinations of ingredients would work well, like what would be a good substitute for orange oil and when, or when to add rose oil instead of lemon, machine learning will create a fragrance based off which formula worked best,” he says.In the case of the perfumes Philyra made for Boticário, the brand asked for scents that would target millennials living in Brazil. Philyra compared formulas against scents that were popular in that area and age range and came up with two. The first, according to Symrise senior perfumer David Apel, smells like “things I only can associate with exotic cuisine … fenugreek seeds, green cardamom pods, carrot seed, all wrapped with a milky, buttery, rich base note.” The other fragrance is a fruity, floral scent — seemingly aimed at girls — and has scents of Osmanthus tea with lychee and patchouli, which Apel calls “innocent, sparkling, effervescent.”Daub says both fragrances received stellar responses from focus groups, and came out on top even when tested against other perfumes popular with Brazilian millennials.Goodwin believes Philyra is an example of how “computers can be creative.” It can quickly create a new perfume by sifting through 1.7 million data sets with ease. This is similar to other AI creations, like how a data scientist created the Meow Generator by adding thousands of photos of cats into a generative adversarial network.Daub says Symrise decided to hire IBM after reading about Chef Watson, IBM’s AI cooking app. The same supercomputer that dominated Jeopardy in 2011 made headlines for its ability to concoct new recipes in a partnership with Bon Appétit.Daub felt the mixing, brewing, and smelling components of the food world was similar to the development of commercial fragrances, and thought AI could help the company innovate. Symrise also recently invested $6 million into Phlur, the fragrance startup that sells its perfumes to customers online by pairing scents with music and photography. Daub believes AI will ultimately help the fragrance market make money by targeting “missed opportunity” in fragrance sales.He’s careful to say that Philyra won’t replace humans in the fragrance development process — not yet anyway. In the case of the two perfumes that will be sold at O Boticário, a machine developed the fragrances but a master perfumer at Symrise tweaked the product “to emphasize a certain note and improve how long it lasted on the skin,” according to Goodwin.“It’s a very human reaction to be concerned about technology replacing a human, and we’re not talking about replacing perfumers tomorrow,” says Daub. “This isn’t something to necessarily market to customers, but the internal capability is that can increase efficiency and speed.”Instead, he says Philyra will function like “an apprentice that the master perfumer will be able to work with” — which sounds a whole lot like replacing apprentice perfumers to me, but details! Symrise plans to roll out the use of Philyra into its perfume school soon.IBM’s perfume AI is the latest example of the tech industry moving into beauty and fashionIt makes sense for Symrise to want to increase its speed and efficiency in developing fragrances: There’s plenty of money to be made. The global fragrance market is worth $48 billion, per Euromonitor. Perfumes are cash cows for fashion brands because they are an accessible purchase. Most can’t afford a Chanel handbag, let alone Chanel clothing, but a bottle of Chanel No. 5 is far more attainable.Britney Spears promoting her fragrance, “Curious” in 2004 at a Macy’s in New York City. Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesFragrances are also huge business opportunities for celebrities; stars like Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears have made millions by attaching their name and image to perfumes.And algorithms now drive fashion brands big and small, from Stitch Fix to Choosy. They’ve even piqued the curiosity of huge retail giants like H&M, which wants to learn how to better predict what it will sell so that it doesn’t end up sitting on $4.3 billion worth of unsold clothes again. Skin care startups are also keen on using AI to perfect and develop personalized beauty products.The idea with all these companies is that data sets can work just as well as and often even better than people, in gathering information and developing products.Applying machine learning to the fragrance industry, for instance, could help companies dupe highly coveted scents without violating trade secrets by using an algorithm to simply tweak the formula slightly. “The outcome of this is still quite open,” Goodwin says. “Will this be used to develop fragrance formulas faster? Will we understand market successes in different parts of the world, and better be able to learn about customer preferences? Will leaner formulas be designed? We’re still halfway through exploring.”The pushback, of course, is that something as personal as beauty, fragrance, and style, served as an algorithm, can feel sterile.As Chandler Burr, a former New York Times perfume critic turned scent master, said in 2014, “perfume transforms from a merely artisanal craft to a true art because it lies. The point of art is to make people feel things, to manipulate people. The stronger and deeper the emotional and intellectual reaction is, the more successful that work of art is.”Burr describes fragrance as something that gives people “an emotional and intellectual response.” A computer can generate the formula for a best-selling perfume among a certain demographic, but does it understand why those formulas are so popular — like why perfumes that are sweet and flowery are marketed to teen girls, and why some actually prefer to push against this stereotype?There are those on the small business end of the fragrance industry who see Philyra as something that could benefit big companies but probably won’t be useful to more niche perfumers.“The technology does what could be considered by some as ‘busywork’ — the building the skeleton and main body of a fragrance,” says Julia Zangrilli, the founder of the customer fragrance company Nova. “Maybe not romantic in a classic creation sense, but this is super useful technology for big companies [because it] both identifies new pathways and saves time and labor.”Symrise doesn’t yet know whether tech like Philyra will affect the cost of perfumes, and it’s too early to tell if this type of AI can be rolled out on a large scale, to the point that everyone can get their own personalized fragrance with the press of a button. So for now, AI’s effect on customers is probably small.There will no doubt be the purists who will only want to buy fragrances that are handmade and “authentic,” but Zangrilli compares IBM’s take on perfumes to buying premade pizza —except each one is unique — and adding toppings. Perhaps it’s not the same as artisanal, bougie pizza, but it can still be delicious.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

An Artwork Made by Artificial Intelligence Just Sold for $400,000. I Am Shocked, Confused, Appalled.

          New York’s senior art critic

Last night Christie’s did it again! The auction house sold an iffy object for an astronomical price.
Last year the company sold a portrait for $450 million that was said to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci — a work many now suspect might have been painted by a studio assistant or a follower, at best, or even only an adept copyist with major assists from recent over-restoration and an all-out Christie’s worldwide public-relations campaign. This time something estimated to go for $7,000 to $10,000 was hammered down at more than 40 times that already inflated price, $432,000. The work? What Christie’s claimed was the “first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.”
Before it was sold to an anonymous phone bidder in France, it was obvious that Christie’s smelled a payday in the making from the painting, called Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy. The house publicized the work as being “on canvass” and “in a gilded frame,” granted interviews, spread information, contacted press and clients, held tony private viewings and public showings — and installed the work between Warhol and Lichtenstein to pump the price and bestow cred. In this world, stagecraft really works. Within days Christie’s has been able to pass off something probably never seen by the buyer in the flesh, or researched at all and falsely touted as “the first” of its kind, on someone willing to take the bait. This opens the gates for more of the same. Mission accomplished, Christie’s.
The work was made by a French group of students of “machine learning” and “business school.” They go by the fitting name Obvious. (You can’t make this stuff up.) The picture is a typical computer-printed ink-on-canvass image. Visually, surface- and scale-wise, it is like every other image/painting/print like this that I’ve ever seen — 100 percent generic. This one depicts a blurry portrait of a man dressed in all black with a stark white collar. He has olden-style longish dark hair in a pageboy cut. All unfinished around the edges, resembles a fuzzy 17th-century Dutch portrait. In the New York Times someone already compared it to a Rembrandt. Really, it’s a poster.
The method used to make the poster has been widely used in and out of the art world for a long time. It is an open-source program called GAN. Obvious fed a computer around 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th century. The machine was then programmed to then create an optical common denominator from the data and print it out. Click print, done.
The Christie’s bigwig who brought the work to auction says he knew nothing about so-called “AI art,” quipping, “I just responded to it and thought it was cool.” He then chirped, “We’re the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million.” Indeed, Christie’s told the Times that this is “a good way to ease buyers … into works made with AI.” So much for integrity, scholarship, research, and transparency.
What makes this sale totally bogus is not only that the poster looks like a lousy 1950s Larry Rivers painting, or that as far back as the 1970s Sol LeWitt was generating written instructions that others used to make his art, or  that the process used here is a standard art student and computer-programmer exercise — it’s that these algorithmic programs and codes have been in use for a very long time to make the exact same looking things. Some of them are “on canvass” and in “gilded frames.” An expert in the field rightly scoffed that the Christie’s work is “AI Art 101.”
They’re right. I’ve seen the process done with landscapes, flowers, dogs, movie stars, clouds, buildings, and food. This poster is an individual image, but it’s not unusual to see it done in grids or series of images printed out. People have done it with Hollywood blockbusters arranged by superhero, color, setting, and even credits. It’s been done with porn films that render one Ur-orgy, superstar, or set of sexual fetishes. I’ve seen every abstract painting reduced to one meta-abstraction and seen it done with these same abstract paintings morphing endlessly one into the next like a hypnotic screensaver. Benjamin Edwards has been doing it in paintings since the late 1990s — compiling all the Starbucks in Seattle, for example, into one wild structure. Artists Jason Salavon and the late Jeremy Blake were doing this sort of thing in video and painting back then too. Julie Mehretu’s paintings are said to be handmade versions of the same visual overlay strategies. Really, this generic tic has never not been around since these sorts of digital files, compiled pictures, found footage, and captured images became a genre. World famous photographer Thomas Ruff has made, shown, and sold pictures like this for almost 20 years. In other words, it is a flat-out lie that this is the “first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.” The question is, why did so many collectors go crazy for it?

            “Edmond de Belamy” has made history as the first work of art produced by artificial intelligence to be sold at auction. 
    

            The slightly blurry canvas print, which has been likened to works by the Old Masters, sold Thursday for $432,500 – dramatically exceeding its original estimate of $7,000-$10,000 – at a Christie’s auction in New York.

            “Christie’s continually stays attuned to changes in the art market and how technology can impact the creation and consumption of art,” Richard Lloyd, international head of prints and multiples at Christie’s, said in a statement before the auction. 
    

            “AI has already been incorporated as a tool by contemporary artists and as this technology further develops, we are excited to participate in these continued conversations. To best engage in the dialogue, we are offering a public platform to exhibit an artwork that has entirely been realized by an algorithm.”

            While the print is signed “min G max D x [log (D(x))] + z [log(1 – D (G(z)))]” after a section of the algorithm’s code, it was conceived by Obvious, a Paris-based trio fascinated by the artistic potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
    

            Though none come from an art background, friends Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier first started experimenting with art and machine learning last year. 
    

            “We saw algorithms were capable of creating new images, and we were astonished by the potential they had,” Vernier said.

            To produce “Edmond de Belamy” and the 10 other portraits in the “La Famille de Belamy” series, Obvious fed a two-part algorithm 15,000 images of portraits from different time periods. After reviewing these submissions, the first part of the algorithm began generating its own portraits, trying to create original works that could pass as man-made.

            “All the data has similarities, so common features. So, first algorithm creates new examples of those images and tries to fool the second algorithm into thinking that those pictures created are, actually, real portraits, so human-made,” Vernier said.       
    

            “We’re looking at these portraits the same way a painter would do it. Like walking in a gallery, taking some inspiration. Except that we feed this inspiration to the algorithm, and the algorithm is the part that does the visual creation.”

            While inventive, this approach hasn’t been without critics. Many working in the field of art and artificial intelligence criticized or dismissed Obvious’ inclusion in the Christie’s sale since the type of algorithm used – generative adversarial networks, or GANs – have been used by artists for years.
    

            Speaking to The New York Times ahead of the auction, Mario Klingemann, an artist known for his work with machine learning, likened “Edmond de Belamy” to “a connect-the-dots children’s painting.”

            But in light of the auction result, it’s likely Obvious will remain undaunted by naysayers. Their work has raised interesting points around the nature of human creation – and clearly caught the attention of the world’s collectors.
    

            “I think (artificial intelligence) has its place in the art world because it tries to replicate what any artist would do, like trying to create from what he knows,” Vernier said. “It forces you to try to understand your own creativity and how you would be able to replicate it.”

The future won’t be made by either humans or machines alone – but by both, working together. Technologies modeled on how human brains work are already augmenting people’s abilities, and will only get more influential as society gets used to these increasingly capable machines.
Technology optimists have envisioned a world with rising human productivity and quality of life as artificial intelligence systems take over life’s drudgery and administrivia, benefiting everyone. Pessimists, on the other hand, have warned that these advances could come at great cost in lost jobs and disrupted lives. And fearmongers worry that AI might eventually make human beings obsolete.
However, people are not very good at imagining the future. Neither utopia nor doomsday is likely. In my new book, “The Deep Learning Revolution,” my goal was to explain the past, present and future of this rapidly growing area of science and technology. My conclusion is that AI will make you smarter, but in ways that will surprise you.
Recognizing patterns
Deep learning is the part of AI that has made the most progress in solving complex problems like identifying objects in images, recognizing speech from multiple speakers and processing text the way people speak or write it. Deep learning has also proven useful for identifying patterns in the increasingly large data sets that are being generated from sensors, medical devices and scientific instruments.
The goal of this approach is to find ways a computer can represent the complexity of the world and generalize from previous experience – even if what’s happening next isn’t exactly the same as what happened before. Just as a person can identify that a specific animal she has never seen before is in fact a cat, deep learning algorithms can identify aspects of what might be called “cat-ness” and extract those attributes from new images of cats.



Deep learning systems can tell which of these is a cat.

The methods for deep learning are based on the same principles that power the human brain. For instance, the brain handles lots of data of various kinds in many processing units at the same time. Neurons have many connections to each other, and those links strengthen or weaken depending on how much they’re used, establishing associations between sensory inputs and conceptual outputs. 
The most successful deep learning network is based on 1960s research into the architecture of the visual cortex, a part of the brain that we use to see, and learning algorithms that were invented in the 1980s. Back then, computers were not yet fast enough to solve real-world problems. Now, though, they are. 
In addition, learning networks have been layered on top of each other, creating webs of connections more closely resembling the hierarchy of layers found in visual cortex. This is part of a convergence taking place between artificial and biological intelligence.

Deep learning in real life
Deep learning is already adding to human capabilities. If you use Google services to search the web, or use its apps to translate from one language to another or turn speech into text, technology has made you smarter, or more effective. Recently on a trip to China, a friend spoke English into his Android phone, which translated it to spoken Chinese for a taxi driver – just like the universal translator on “Star Trek.”

These and many other systems are already at work, helping you in your daily life even if you’re not aware of them. For instance, deep learning is beginning to take over the reading of X-ray images and photographs of skin lesions for cancer detection. Your local doctor will soon be able to spot problems that are evident today only to the best experts. 
Even when you do know there’s a machine involved, you might not understand the complexity of what they’re actually doing: Behind Amazon’s Alexa is a bevy of deep learning networks that recognize your request, sift through data to answer your questions and take actions on your behalf. 
Advancing learning
Deep learning has been highly effective at solving pattern recognition problems, but to go beyond this requires other brain systems. When an animal is rewarded for an action, it is more likely to take similar actions in the future. Dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia of the brain report the difference between expected and received rewards, called reward prediction error, which is used to change the strengths of connections in the brain that predict future rewards. 
Coupling this approach, called reinforcement learning, with deep learning can give computers the power to identify unexpected possibilities. By recognizing a pattern and then responding to it in a way that yields rewards, machines might approach behaviors along the lines of what might be called human creativity. This coupled approach is how DeepMind developed a program called AlphaGo, which in 2016 defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol and the following year beat the world Go champion, Ke Jie. 
Games are not as messy as the real world, which is filled with shifting uncertainties. Massimo Vergassola at the University of California, San Diego, and I recently used reinforcement learning to teach a glider in the field how to soar like a bird in turbulent thermals. Sensors can be attached to actual birds to test whether they use the same cues and respond the same way. 
Despite these successes, researchers do not yet fully understand how deep learning solves these problems. Of course, we don’t know how the brain solves them either. 
While the brain’s inner workings may remain elusive, it is only a matter of time before researchers develop a theory of deep learning. The difference is that when studying computers, researchers have access to every connection and pattern of activity in the network. The pace of progress is rapid, with research papers appearing daily on arXiv. Surprising advances are eagerly anticipated this December at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Montreal, which sold out 8,000 tickets in 11 minutes, leaving 9,000 hopeful registrants on the waiting list.
There is a long way to go before computers achieve general human intelligence. The largest deep learning network today has only the power of a piece of human neural cortex the size of a rice grain. And we don’t yet know how the brain dynamically organizes interactions between larger brain areas.
Nature already has that level of integration, creating large-scale brain systems capable of operating all aspects of the human body while pondering deep questions and completing complex tasks. Ultimately, autonomous systems may become as complex, joining the myriad living creatures on our planet.

On Thursday, the AI-generated “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” sold for $432,500—some 45 times its estimated value—in a sale trumpeted by Christie’s as the first auction to feature work created by artificial intelligence.
It’s a moment likely to be marked in the timeline of both AI and art history, but what, exactly, does the sale signify? For the AI community, the Verge’s James Vincent writes in the days preceding the bidding war, the auction provoked controversy among those who argued that the humans behind the canvas (a trio of 25-year-olds best known as the Paris-based art collective Obvious) relied heavily on 19-year-old Robbie Barrat’s algorithms yet failed to sufficiently credit him.

Then again, the entire draw of the otherwise mundane portrait is its attribution to an intimidating mathematical equation:





If the work was truly authored by this string of numbers and letters, does it matter who built and trained the AI? And, given the relatively blurred, imprecise vision the portrait—which Vulture art critic Jerry Saltz scathingly describes as “100 percent generic”—offers of its dour-looking subject, does “Edmond Belamy” even deserve a place in the art history canon?
There are no straightforward answers to these questions. The boundaries between AI, artists and AI-produced art are still amorphous, a fact readily exemplified by the current conflict between Obvious and Barrat. But before diving into the issue at hand, it’s worth revisiting the basics of the technology at the heart of this debate.
Back in August, Hugo Caselles-Dupré, one of Obvious’ three co-founders, outlined the collective’s creative process to Christie’s Jonathan Bastable. As he explained, Edmond and the sprawling network of Belamys depicted in a series of family portraits emerged thanks to a machine-learning algorithm known as the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). American AI researcher Ian Goodfellow developed GAN in 2014, and as TIME’s Ciara Nugent notes, the rough French translation of “Goodfellow”—bel ami—provided the inspiration for the fictional family’s name.
Obvious’ GAN consists of two parts: the Generator, which produces images based on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries, and the Discriminator, which attempts to differentiate between manmade and AI-generated works.
“The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits,” Caselles-Dupré said. “Then we have a result.”
The Verge’s Vincent likens the training process to tricking a bouncer at a club. At first, a drunk individual may not be able to act sober enough to gain entry, but with enough practice, an inebriated person’s performance may convince a bouncer to change their tune.
“The networks know how to copy basic visual patterns, but they don’t have a clue how they fit together,” Vincent writes. “The result is imagery in which boundaries are indistinct, figures melt into one another, and rules of anatomy go out the window.”
Barrat, a recent high school graduate now conducting research at a Stanford University AI research lab, has been at the forefront of this algorithm-powered revolution, which is tentatively termed GANism. In an interview with the Washington Post’s Meagan Flynn, Barrat explains that he started experimenting with the technology two years ago, first training GAN to produce original rap songs based on a set of 6,000 Kanye West lyrics and later expanding to surreal landscapes and nude portraits.
After fine-tuning his code, Barrat uploaded it to the sharing platform GitHub, where it was freely available to aspiring AI artists like Caselles-Dupré and the remaining members of his three-man team, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier. GitHub exchanges between Barrat and Obvious further speak to the former’s contributions, with Caselles-Dupré repeatedly asking Barrat to tweak the code.
It’s worth noting, too, that Tom White, a New Zealand-based academic and AI artist, conducted tests designed to compare Barrat’s model with those produced by Obvious. As he tells the Verge, the series of Barrat portraits produced by the analysis look “suspiciously close” to that of Edmond Belamy.
(You can judge for yourself below.)


Caselles-Dupré readily acknowledges that Obvious drew heavily on Barrat’s work, but he tells the Verge the collective tweaked the algorithm to develop a unique portrait style.
“If you’re just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified,” Caselles-Dupré says. “But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there.”
Obvious’ borrowed code isn’t the only factor contributing to AI art world ire. As the New York Times’ Gabe Cohn writes, many members of the community find the Belamy portraits wholly underwhelming. Vincent points out that critics have further identified technical shortcomings, including low resolution and smeared textures.
In an interview with Cohn, Mario Klingemann, a German artist who has worked extensively with GANs, likened “Edmond” to a “connect-the-dots children’s painting.”
Speaking separately with the Post’s Flynn, Klingemann added, “It’s horrible art from an aesthetic standpoint. You have to put some work into it to call it art. … You have to put your own handwriting on it, make your own mark with these tools. That takes some learning and work and finding something different to say.”
Still, the debate over authorship barely begins to address larger questions of AI autonomy. Christie’s has been quick to capitalize on the Belamy portrait’s singular status, defining its medium with a heady catch-all description: “generative Adversarial Network print, on canvas, 2018, signed with GAN model loss function in ink by the publisher, from a series of eleven unique images, published by Obvious Art, Paris, with original gilded wood frame.” Obvious itself initially marketed the work as “created by artificial intelligence,” but Caselles-Dupré tells the Verge he now regrets using such definitive language.
Jason Bailey, the digital art blogger behind Artnome, explains why such phrasing is misleading, arguing that “anyone who has worked with AI and art realizes” algorithms are tools, not active collaborators or autonomous agents.
Regardless of Edmond Belamy’s true nature, the Christie’s sale marks a turning point. As a specific example of AI-generated art, it isn’t the revolution of Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain”—an actual urinal turned on its side that sparked the rise of modern and conceptual art—but the kind of work the painting (if you can call it that) represents certainly points to a departure from traditional definitions of art. And, judging by the hefty price tag seen at yesterday’s auction, collectors with large pockets, at least, certainly seem ready to embrace the burgeoning field of AI-led art.

Gellerson for The New York TimesBy Jane L. LevereOct. 25, 2018This year, three Washington-based museums of the Smithsonian Institution deployed a half-dozen four-feet-tall, humanoid robots, nicknamed Pepper, to answer visitors’ questions and tell stories, using voice, gestures and an interactive touch screen. They also dance, play games and pose for selfies.Rachel Goslins, director of the Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building and overseer of the robots’ deployment, said she has been “blown away” by visitors’ reactions to them.Pepper, she added, “feels totally aligned with the museums’ mission. We are asking people to be present, engaged, to have a communal experience. We’re not making you look at your phone even more; we’re creating a playful, joyful human experience.” She said 80 more robots eventually would be rolled out, helping to guide the work of the Smithsonian’s educators and docents.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT(The museums using Pepper are the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and National Museum of African Art, as well as the Smithsonian Castle, which is using eight robots, four of which can travel elsewhere.) The robot was created by SoftBank Robotics.The Smithsonian venture into artificial intelligence to engage visitors is just one example in a rapidly moving trend mixing art and technology.The Museums Special SectionDark Awakening: Many artists are dimming the lights of their museum shows, for a mix of symbolic and spiritual reasons.A Story Told in 183 Canvases: A 122-foot-long painting by Noah Saterstrom explores mental illness.Striking a Balance: In a biennial between two museums on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, artists tell fresh stories of their homeland.Exploring History: In North Miami, the Haitian artist Manuel Mathieu weaves the personal and the political.More on Museums: Institutions are striving to offer their visitors more to see, do and feel.Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used today by museums of all sizes worldwide, which employ it to develop everything from robots, chatbots and websites, to tools that help them analyze visitor data and their collections, and determine admission policies and exhibition content.ImageThe Dot kiosk at the Akron Art Museum.Credit...via Akron Art MuseumThe Akron Art Museum is encouraging visitors to use their phones to interact with Dot, its chatbot digital tour guide, which sports dark glasses and a pink pageboy. Introduced in August, Dot is accessible by the Facebook Messenger platform; when visitors enter the museum, they are directed to a kiosk that explains how Dot works.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTShe takes visitors on a six-stop “choose your own adventure” tour of the museum’s permanent collection, discussing 60 works of art and asking visitors questions. In front of a Sol LeWitt mural in the museum’s lobby, for example, she explains that LeWitt did not personally paint the mural but that a drafter did. She calls this process delegating, and asks, “What part of your job do you wish you could assign to someone else?”Mark Masuoka, director of the museum, called Dot “a great way to connect people with art and each other. And she doesn’t require prior knowledge of the artwork.” He said the museum would analyze usage of the chatbot, which he said could help it make “more informed decisions about how we want to develop projects and exhibitions.”The Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro collaborated with IBM to develop an IRIS+ chatbot that uses IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence technology and was introduced last year.ImageThe Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro.Credit...Buda Mendes/Getty ImageOn arrival, museum visitors receive a card embedded with a chip to use IRIS+. When they finish touring the core exhibition, IRIS+ asks, via an iPad, “After everything you learned in the main exhibition, what are your concerns in today’s world?”During the conversation that follows, the app exchanges data with IBM’s cloud and suggests initiatives suited to the visitors’ concerns, basing these, in part, on personal information the visitors are invited to provide, such as their date of birth and where they live.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVisitors also are encouraged to take a selfie for a wall at the end of the core exhibition. This wall displays visitors’ photographs, along with their first names and personal interests; the wall also tracks and graphically displays all visitors’ top concerns.The Barnes Foundation used artificial intelligence when it introduced a new collection website last year, as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of its move to downtown Philadelphia.Emulating the criteria the museum’s founder, Albert C. Barnes, used to display his art collection in ensembles, the new website lets visitors search the collection by visual properties, such as light, line, color and space, filtering images according to aesthetic similarities. More than 2,000 of the roughly 3,000 works in the Barnes’s collection have been published on the site. The number of visitors going to the Barnes’s website has tripled since the new collection display was introduced, according to Shelley Bernstein, the museum’s consulting creative technologist.ImageA project, enron.email, which was developed by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain and explores the more than 100,000 emails relating to Enron’s corporate fraud, is at the New Museum in New York.Credit...Sam Lavigne and Tega BrainThe New Museum in New York, which was founded in 1977 to exhibit new works by living artists, has also worked often with artificial intelligence. Rhizome, an affiliate of the museum since 2003 that is dedicated to what it calls “born-digital art and culture,” recently commissioned a project, enron.email, which was developed by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain and explores the more than 100,000 emails relating to Enron’s corporate fraud. Working with Nokia Bell Labs through NEW INC, the museum’s incubator, is Fei Liu, an artist who is teaching robots how to play simple games as a way to better understand the human capacity for empathy. NEW INC is also working with Channel Studio, a group of artists that is mining two decades of original music to make new interactive apps to create compositions.The Museum of Modern Art is using artificial intelligence to analyze visitors’ comments, while The Broad in Los Angeles is using it to analyze visitors’ behavior, such as ticket and gift shop purchases and website visits. Diana Pan, chief technology officer of MoMA, which is now undergoing expansion, said the data produced by artificial intelligence could help it determine new signage and navigation requirements. Heather Hart, director of information technology for The Broad, said the data it collects could not only help it improve ticket distribution and exhibition planning, but also possibly what it sells in its gift shop and publishes in its newsletter.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTArtificial intelligence has allowed the Art Institute of Chicago to track how long visitors stay in its galleries, leading it to offer more small exhibitions focusing on its permanent collection.And A.I. is aiding the conservation and attribution efforts of Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. He is developing tools that allow visitors to his museum’s website — which contains over 300,000 digital photographs of objects in its collection — to use artificial intelligence when they try to make comparisons among these objects, exploring, for example, all works — beside the museum’s famous Vermeer painting of a milkmaid — of women preparing food.Another possible application of artificial intelligence, according to Elizabeth Merritt, director of the American Alliance of Museums’ Center for the Future of Museums, could be the ability of visitors to interact with historical figures at history museums, through chatbots developed using the figures’ published writings and archives, as well as oral histories.Robert Stein, executive vice president and chief program officer of the American Alliance of Museums, warned that museums must be aware of privacy issues as they use artificial intelligence, for example, protecting whatever personal information their visitors provide.“Any time you talk about an emerging technology, museums have an important role to play teaching the public about it. Artificial intelligence is going to be incredibly important in shaping the world we live in, in profound ways. We need to understand the technology and the issues it raises,” added Ms. Merritt.A correction was made on Oct. 26, 2018: Because of an editing error, a picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the name of an art museum.

On Thursday, it sold for well over double the price realized by both those pieces combined.“Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy” sold for $432,500 including fees, over 40 times Christie’s initial estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The buyer was an anonymous phone bidder.The bidding late this morning lasted just under seven minutes, during which the buyer competed against an online bidder in France, two other phone bidders and one person in the room in New York. When the hammer came down, the bids had reached $350,000, the final price before fees.The distorted portrait, by the French art collective Obvious, was marketed by Christie’s as the first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It is an exciting moment,” Obvious said in a statement. “Our hope is that the spotlight on this sale will bring forward the amazing work that our predecessors and colleagues have been producing.”The auction was inspired by a sale earlier this year, in which the French collector Nicolas Laugero Lasserre bought a portrait directly from the collective for about 10,000 euros, or about $11,400.The Andy Warhol print that hung across from the portrait last week sold for $75,000; the Roy Lichtenstein work sold for $87,500. Both prices include fees. Those two pieces were part of the same sale as “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.” (The sale included 363 lots.)Auctioning the work seemed to be a test by Christie’s of the traditional art market’s interest in AI art. But the strongest response after the announcement of the auction came from other artists who work with AI, many of whom have said that the portrait is unoriginal. Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, the technology used to create the portrait, have been used in art since around 2015, including by the artists Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler and Robbie Barrat. Obvious first started gaining attention earlier this year.Much discussion over the past few days has centered on Mr. Barrat, an artist who said that code he had written and shared online was used in the production of “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.” Obvious told the technology website The Verge on Tuesday that it did use Mr. Barrat’s code, but modified it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We would like to thank the AI community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm,” Obvious said in its statement today. “And artist Robbie Barrat, who has been a great influence for us.”A version of this article appears in print on Oct. 27, 2018, Section C, Page 3 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

DW spoke to technologists and historians to better understand some of the technological and societal upheavals humanity is facing.https://p.dw.com/p/36j4uCopy linkImage: picture-alliance/dpa/TUAdvertisementDoes technology favor tyranny? That's one of the surprising — and unsettling — questions Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari asks in his much-quoted new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.
Whereas 20th-century technology favored democracies as they were able to distribute power to make decisions among many people and institutions, according to Harari, artificial intelligence (AI) might make centralized systems that concentrate all information and power far more efficient as machine learning works better with more information to analyze.
""If you disregard all privacy concerns and concentrate all the information relating to a billion people in one database,"" Harari writes, ""you'll wind up with much better algorithms than if you respect individual privacy and have in your database only partial information on a million people.""
The rise of AI swinging the pendulum from democracies toward authoritarian regimes is just one of the feared adverse impacts of technologies: Others include job displacement, concentration of power, diminishing privacy, rising income inequality and losing our ""free will."" Yet most people have little or no knowledge about how AI, blockchain, the Internet of Things or genetic engineering could affect their lives.""The conflict between democracy and dictatorship is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems,"" not ethical ones, says Yuval Noah Harari. The historian also wrote the international bestsellers 'Sapiens' and 'Homo Deus'Image: picture alliance/dpa/NurPhoto/J. Nicholson
As there's reason to believe that these technological trends and transformations will pose existential challenges for humankind over the next decades, it makes sense to put them into a wider perspective, thereby hopefully creating some clarity.
After all, ""if the future is decided in our absence,"" as Harari puts it, ""we won't be exempt from the consequences.""
Industrial revolutions vs ""information revolutions""
At the Oslo Innovation Week in September, an annual conference in the Norwegian capital, Oxford University researcher and author Chris Kutarna offered some historical context. His key message: The prevailing ""micro view"" of history, which focuses on economic forces like capital and technology as well as industrial revolutions as the main drivers of progress, is too narrow to understand and navigate the forces currently changing our world as we know it.Big leaps forward: over the past 250 years, humanity 'progressed' thanks to inventions like the steam engine, the assembly line and the Internet. During the current fourth industrial revolution, sometimes called Industry 4.0, the speed of change is unprecedented
A ""macro view,"" in contrast, reveals four ""information revolutions"": The first one, starting some 100,000 years ago, was speech; Then came writing, then print, and now digital, which is by far the most impactful.
Each of these revolutions allowed humanity to mine more information, turn this information into knowledge and, consequently, improve overall quality of life. The corresponding dramatic increase in average life expectancy over the past half century, according to Kutarna, is a much better indicator of humanity's development than GDP growth or technological advances.Similar to the Renaissance in Western societies, sparked by the advent of the printing press in the 15th century, Kutarna today sees humanity in the middle of a similar contest for the ""values and the ideas that are going to govern the future for generations to come""Image: Oslo Business Forum/S. A. Rasmussen
""It's how technology interacts with law, ethics, politics and other important drivers of societal change that ultimately shapes the future we live in,"" Kutarna told DW in a Skype interview after the conference.
Technology, Kutarna said, ""is not the panacea;"" so-called dual-use technology like atomic power, for instance, was once deemed the secret to abundant energy. Now, countries are now phasing it out because of the ecological and military risks associated with it. In other words: New technology might solve a few problems, but it always creates new challenges, too.
Unprecedented speed of change
Since 1971, the number of transistors per square inch has doubled approximately every two years, an observation known as Moore's Law. Although computing power, which underpins most technological progress including artificial intelligence, has therefore doubled about 32 times, the speed of change is — by and large — not dramatic yet.
This moderate growth is one reason technology can probably do less right now than you think. Another, perhaps, is that science fiction movies make us believe robots are more advanced than they actually are. But as we're entering the next decade, the speed of change will accelerate so fast that technology will quickly do more than you probably think in more places.New research from McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) on five categories of AI — computer vision, natural language, virtual assistants, robotic process automation and advanced machine learning — suggests that by 2030, some 70 percent of companies will adopt at least one type of AI technology, and that AI could create a $13 trillion (€11 trillion) uptick in the world economyImage: picture-alliance/dpa/S. Shaver
And as it starts evolving at a pace humans were not evolved to move forward at, the social consequences could be far more wrenching than in past transitions like the first industrial revolution, when humans had multiple human generations to adapt.
Arguably no other technology reflects these rapid changes more than artificial intelligence. In certain areas like vision, speech, language and cognition, AI has already achieved or surpassed human abilities. Computer vision, for example, is now better than human vision at detecting differences and identifying things like different types of dogs.
Current discussions on ethical challenges raised by intelligent systems, for instance what autonomous vehicles ought to do when faced with unavoidable accidents, and the often hectic efforts to address them are also indicative of societies' and regulators' struggle to rein in ever-faster technological advancements.
""It's important to consider the impact of technology on not just the best-case outcome but the worst-case outcome of systems as we design them,"" Amber Baldet, founder of blockchain-based decentralized app store Cloyvr, told DW during Oslo Innovation Week.
Although most experts acknowledge that technology carries the philosophies of those who create it, the big companies that develop algorithms are slow to identify or correct biases, for example. Case in point: in September, German software giant SAP was only the first European technology company to introduce ""guiding principles"" and an external advisory board on AI ethics. In the US, Microsoft and Google are among the smaller number of companies building formal ethics principles and processes.""We often take for granted that much of the Internet as we know it was developed in the West and has been a democratizing force in carrying open information,"" Amber said. ""It is not necessarily true that all technology will operate thusly""Image: Oslo Innovation Week
Yet there are signs of a heightened awareness and a sense of urgency: Earlier this month, for instance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced a $1 billion (€860 million) initiative to ""address global opportunities and challenges"" presented by AI.
(When) are robots coming for our jobs?
Although artificial intelligence and automation will leave no area of life untouched, the job market will presumably be affected most profoundly. At Oslo Innovation Week, former US President Barack Obama warned that ""people fear getting left behind and seeing their economic and social status decline. This breeds fear and resentment.""""We need to compensate for some of the harshness and rapidity of change by creating stabilizers in our social and economic arrangements,"" Obama told a crowd of 3,000, citing examples like social welfare, education, eradicating poverty and the SDGs. ""Without that,"" he added, ""those imbalances over time will break the system""Image: Oslo Business Forum/A. Eriksson
Similarly, Israeli academic Yuval Noah Harari talks about the emergence of a ""useless class"" by 2050 — the consequence of a ""shortage of jobs or a lack of relevant education"" and ""insufficient mental stamina to continue learning new skills.""
While a dystopian future like a 'two-class-society' is anything but predictable, it's fairly certain that, in the near term, lines of work are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.
A decade or so out, however, we'll likely see big shifts in the job market. In a 2017 report, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that by 2030, up to a third of the American workforce will have to switch to new occupations or upgrade skills. Automation and AI will undoubtedly lift productivity and economic growth; eventually, however, it might even cause 'white-collar' jobs that demand high expertise and ingenuity to gradually disappear.AI and automation will presumably increase the demand for technological, social and emotional, and higher cognitive skills, while reducing demand for physical and manual skills and basic cognitive skills. Under most scenarios, more jobs will be gained than lost due to AI and automation. Still, millions worldwide may need to switch occupations
While almost every human job is threatened to some extent, the predictable ones, i.e. those that are manually or cognitively repetitive, are particularly vulnerable to automation. Let's take two occupations from my industry to illustrate this: Editors, on the one hand, have a low risk at losing their jobs to computers as their work is typically creative and non-repetitive; technical and financial writers, on the other hand, are already being replaced as more and more of their repetitive, data-driven stories are written by AIs.
Another set of occupations changing in value are highly paid radiologists and poorly paid nurses. As well-trained AI will presumably be much better at detecting tumors in the not-so-distant future, radiology will ultimately decline in value; in contrast, jobs like nurses will rise in value as humans will likely have an edge over machines when it comes to empathy — at least for a few more decades.
Where to go from here
In Oslo, Oxford researcher Chris Kutarna said humanity needed to adopt ""new values and behaviors"" — societal incentives for collaborative behavior, the ""courage to act now like society should 20 years from now,"" metaphorical language that's ""more precise"" than words like 'disruption' and ""redrawing old mental constructs"" similar to when humanity realized it needs a new world map after Columbus discovered the Americas during his quest for Asia.
""Above all, we need to work on being skills like compassion,"" the Oxford scholar told DW. ""Only then can we actually enact some of the big changes that are required.""
Other well-known thinkers echo Kutarna's plea. In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari argues that we ought to invest at least as much time and money in ""exploring and developing human consciousness,"" particularly wisdom and compassion, as we invest in improving AI. Otherwise, AI ""might serve only to empower the natural stupidity of humans, and to nurture our worst … impulses, among them greed and hatred.""
Similarly, author and former president of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee, advocates for using AI's ""economic bounty"" to ""double down on empathy.""Are killer robots coming for us? ""There is no particular reason to believe that AI will develop consciousness as it becomes more intelligent,"" Harari writes. ""We should instead fear AI because it will probably always obey its human masters, and never rebel."" As a result, Harari says, ""it will almost certainly allow the already powerful to consolidate their power further""Image: Getty Images/AFP/C. Court
And what can we as individuals do to better cope with the challenges of the digital revolution and capitalize on its opportunities?
Education is always a good place to start. Both Kai-Fu Lee's website and brandnew findings from McKinsey Global Institute provide good overviews; if you have a little more time, consider the University of Helsinki's free online course on AI; and a reality check of the anticipated future value of occupations and skills certainly can't hurt.
It's our responsibility to know the times we're living in; and we cannot know them unless we learn at least a little bit about the technologies that shape our present. Only then can we make educated choices for the future.

The process involved feeding the algorithm a set of paintings, and having it generate an image based on the difference between its own work and the original.A section of the artwork ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy,"" created by an algorithm by French collective named OBVIOUS, at Christies in New York on Oct. 22, 2018.Timothy A.

But we found that portraits provided the best way to illustrate our point, which is that algorithms are able to emulate creativity,” said Hugo Caselles-Dupré of Obvious.The portrait has drawn a significant amount of media attention with some speculating about what artificial intelligence means for the future of art.“AI is just one of several technologies that will have an impact on the art market of the future – although it is far too early to predict what those changes might be,” said Christie’s specialist Richard Lloyd.",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/9btOAu4C/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Painting Made by Artificial Intelligence Has Been Sold at Auction for $432,500",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-10-26T14:06:16.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/9btOAu4C.m3u8,PT1M12S,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5435683/artificial-intelligence-painting-christies/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",https://time.com/5435683/artificial-intelligence-painting-christies/,,,,,,,,,,

Christie's 1st to auction AI portrait 











Christie's first to auction portrait created by artificial intelligence
04:38

If there was ever a question of whether the art world was ready to embrace work created by artificial intelligence, there is no longer. In the first-ever auction of its kind, a painting created by AI has sold for nearly half a million dollars. Christie's sold the piece titled the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" on Thursday to an anonymous buyer for $432,500. The auction house had initially estimated it would sell between $7,000 and $10,000.The Paris-based art collective, Obvious Art, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using a computer and algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 human-made paintings from between the 14th and 20th centuries.
""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy""  

            
                CBS News

                          
After that analysis, the computer started spitting out its own versions of portraits to run through what's called a discriminator, which tries to determine whether it was created by a computer or not. The cycle finishes when the computer can no longer tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version. 






Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, brought the portrait to the ""CBS This Morning"" studio last week and addressed questions about how this might affect human artists. ""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said.

In the first-ever auction of its kind, a painting created by AI has sold for nearly half a million dollars. Christie's sold the piece titled the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" on Thursday to an anonymous buyer for $432,500. The auction house had initially estimated it would sell between $7,000 and $10,000.The Paris-based art collective, Obvious Art, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using a computer and algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 human-made paintings from between the 14th and 20th centuries.After that analysis, the computer started spitting out its own versions of portraits to run through what's called a discriminator, which tries to determine whether it was created by a computer or not. The cycle finishes when the computer can no longer tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version.Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, brought the portrait to the ""CBS This Morning"" studio last week and addressed questions about how this might affect human artists. ""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said. ",,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/19/e761f736-ba68-4f1d-b304-61b93fb2a453/thumbnail/1200x630/57cb9beef25558ecef2c2ba7dfbd0032/ctm-clean-8am-cr470c-20181019-frame-83781.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/
