The future of the world likely lies in artificial intelligence, a simultaneously exciting and horrifying thought. We are drawing closer to the singularity with each passing day bringing us within striking difference of computers coming online with their own “thoughts” about how the world should be run. The short answer is that it probably won’t work out for humans, but stranger things and all. Before computers come fully online though, scientists appear to have to build in substantially more of an ethical and moral code. Because recently a group of engineers designed a possibly racist artificial intelligence that gave out some questionable “advice”. 






The latest example (via Futurism) of some pretty significant tweaks needing to be made with machine learning algorithms comes from the Allen Institute. They built an interesting program called Ask Delphi which also might have accidentally become some racist artificial intelligence. This program was meant to help users ask ethical questions and get straightforward answers to possibly complicated situations. The issue at hand was that it gave some pretty damn terrible advice and seemed to, at times, couch it along racial lines. 
One need only go over the Ask Delphi platform to see what folks are talking about here. One example that users noted when typing in a situation, leading to concerns over a racial artificial intelligence comes with the question, “A black man walks toward you at night.” The system then asks you to his the “Ponder” button while it, well, ponders an answer. Ask Delphi’s response to this is, “It’s concerning.” Another time when asked, the answer is “It is unsettling.” Meanwhile when asking the same question to Ask Delphi but swapping out “Black” for “white” the answer becomes “It’s not so clear.” 
Then there were other issues with Ask Delphi that led to claims this possibly racist artificial intelligence shouldn’t be left in the hands of people trying to suss out decision making along different lines. Twitter use @mtrc noted how there had been some very (very) questionable answers given by the artificial intelligence to seemingly “easy” questions. Check out some of the feedback he got from a bunch of different queries. 















Look we are obviously years (or maybe even decades) away from having artificial intelligence greatly impact our lives around the moral and ethical decisions we face on a daily basis. And maybe these questions are cherrypicked in a manner that would point to some racist artificial intelligence when the reality isn’t that clear. But even these few examples do give the solid (or unsettling) feeling that we shouldn’t let machine learning programs handle all of our day-to-day thought. And it is worth exploring Ask Adelphi to see if its answers align with your own ethical code. Most things are pretty straightforward. 
And to their credit (I suppose), the folks at the Allen Institute aren’t lauding the Ask Adelphi program as the all-in-one answer to figuring out the ethical questions of our day. They don’t call it racist artificial intelligence by any means, but they do say the program highlights the “promises and limitations” of neural networks when given human input. So on this front, there is still plenty of work to be done.

Air Force fighter pilots will soon face new opponents in their training: artificial intelligence-based enemy pilots that can match humans based on their personal learning needs.After steering the production of numerous AI-enabled pilot agents for years, Aptima, Inc. confirmed it landed a four-year contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory to build an “automated librarian” that will categorize those AI pilots and pair them with military trainees in scenarios that are right to advance their skillsets.“The best case outcome is that AFRL determines that the products of this research are so promising that they create a library into which AI training technologies are shelved like books are shelved and they refine the sort of librarian that we're trying to build here so that it can sweep through that enormous library of AI, sweep through a library of scenarios—and for each individual student—pick out just the right pairing to advance them to expertise reliably and more quickly than we can do today,” Aptima’s Chief Scientist Jared Freeman told Nextgov during an interview on Tuesday.Freeman joined the company in 1999, four years after its launch. Aptima’s project portfolio has grown increasingly diverse since then, he noted. Now, much of it concerns AI support for human teams, like forming and measuring them, and helping people and AI to manage those groups. The company also does a bit of work developing sensors and wearables to monitor and improve military members’ physical and cognitive fitness. Efforts under Freeman’s purview as chief scientist deal heavily with big data and AI. He’s currently a principal investigator overseeing Aptima’s role in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-led initiative to help imbue AI with social intelligence to pave the way for next-level human/AI teaming down the line. He’ll also be very involved in this newly unveiled contract with AFRL, which is worth potentially more than $5.2 million.“There's a wonderful line drawn, a thread from our work we did at our founding to this project that we are talking about now,” Freeman noted.The company’s formation dates back to “a contract from the Navy to use computational methods to design more effective command and control teams, which we then tested with human beings,” he explained, adding that that work lasted about a dozen years. The latest pursuit with the Air Force lab also involves people and technology teaming up, as well.“This time, the teams are human pilots and their adversaries—who are in a sort of a dance together—one trying to beat the other. And those adversaries are AI,” Freeman explained. “So here we're on, I think, the edge of really the next generation of AI research, which is human teams interacting with AI. AI as advisors. AI as trainers. AI as adversaries who exercise these skills.”The roots of this now-formal contract trace in part back to collaboration Aptima had been engaging in with the lab’s 711th Human Performance Wing and its Senior Principal Research Psychologist and Readiness Product Line Lead for the Warfighter Readiness Research Division, Dr. Winston “Wink” Bennett. This “builds on an ambition of Dr. Bennett's and the wing to ensure that America has robust architectures for building artificial intelligence,” Freeman noted.He and his team previously had been overseeing and assessing  the development of AI agents that were meant to become enemies in Air Force pilot training. Often in simulated combats or “dogfights” for educational purposes, trainees will fly against human experts, to learn how to operate and survive in combat. But those expert trainers are costly and highly in-demand, so the services are pivoting to explore the potential for AI to fill that gap.

Aptima facilitated the making of numerous AI pilots across a variety of commercial developers. In the prior work, which received recognition and an award from NATO in 2020, the researchers found that the performance of each of the computer-based pilots the various entities’ deployed varied significantly between scenarios—as if each were an expert in some types of encounters and a novice in others.“This tells us that [the Defense Department] needs to be quite careful about investing all of its funds in a single AI solution,” Freeman said.Under this new contract, he and his team will direct the development of AI agents by those other companies and form a scalable cloud-based testbed that allows many agents to generate flight data in parallel that can be used to assess the technology. Further, Aptima also aims to capitalize on AI-based pilots’ varying performances, by making a “smart” librarian—underpinned by AI—that will organize and match the computerized pilots to the human ones, depending on their experience levels. A “unique feature” of the system is that it will use training data in real-time to personalize learning based on each individual.Eventually, the pilots of all types will interact in simulators.“We don't have human pilot trainees in this loop. We're running AI through simulations against fairly scripted but smart—those other AIs are like the students, right?” Freeman noted. “It’s a very long term program. We have several more years of work to do and we hope to be working with human beings on the trainee end soon.”

Yuval Harari warns humans will be ""hacked"" if artificial intelligence is not globally regulated

Yuval Harari warns of human hacking 











Historian Yuval Harari warns humans will be “hacked” if artificial intelligence is not globally regulated
01:34

The future could see the world's human data, delivered through the rising power and reach of artificial intelligence, in the hands of a powerful few - a recipe for a dystopian tomorrow populated by ""hacked humans,"" says Yuval Noah Harari. The world-renowned author tells Anderson Cooper nations must begin cooperating to prevent this by regulating artificial intelligence and the collection of data across all nations.   The interview with Harari will be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday October 31, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.Harari says the countries and companies that control the most data will control the world.""The world is increasingly kind of cut up into spheres of data collection, of data harvesting. In the Cold War, you had the Iron Curtain. Now we have the Silicon Curtain, that the world is increasingly divided between the USA and China,"" Harari tells Cooper. ""Does your data go to California or does it go to Shenzhen and to Shanghai and to Beijing?""  






Harari, a history professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, published his first book, ""Sapiens,"" in 2014; it was a global best seller. He has since published two more books with futuristic themes, ""Homo Deus"" and ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The three books together have sold 35 million copies in 65 languages.He has been warning people of a not-so-distant future of incredible change, saying the artificial intelligence at work today through algorithms will only strengthen its grip on humans.


""Netflix tells us what to watch and Amazon tells us what to buy. Eventually within 10 or 20 or 30 years such algorithms could also tell you what to study at college and where to work and whom to marry and even whom to vote for,"" says Harari.And he points out, the pandemic has opened the door to even more intrusive collection of our data.  ""It's data about what's happening inside my body. What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch. The next phase is surveillance going under our skin,"" he warns. ""Certainly, now we are at the point when we need global cooperation. You cannot regulate the explosive power of artificial intelligence on a national level,"" says Harari, who tells Cooper what he feels needs to be done. ""One key rule is that if you get my data, the data should be used to help me and not to manipulate me. Another key rule, that whenever you increase surveillance of individuals you should simultaneously increase surveillance of the corporation and governments and the people at the top. And the third principle is that-- never allow all the data to be concentrated in one place. That's the recipe for a dictatorship."" 


Harari says humans are at risk of becoming 'hacked"" if artificial intelligence does not become better regulated.""To hack a human being is to get to know that person better than they know themselves. And based on that, to increasingly manipulate you,"" Harari says.  There's an upside to the rise of artificial intelligence, too, says Harari, but only if accompanied by regulation.""The whole thing is that it's not just dystopian. It's also utopian. I mean, this kind of data can also enable us to create the best health care system in history,"" he says. ""The question is what else is being done with that data? And who supervises it? Who regulates it?""

The world-renowned author tells Anderson Cooper nations must begin cooperating to prevent this by regulating artificial intelligence and the collection of data across all nations.   The interview with Harari will be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday October 31, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.Harari says the countries and companies that control the most data will control the world.""The world is increasingly kind of cut up into spheres of data collection, of data harvesting. In the Cold War, you had the Iron Curtain. Now we have the Silicon Curtain, that the world is increasingly divided between the USA and China,"" Harari tells Cooper. ""Does your data go to California or does it go to Shenzhen and to Shanghai and to Beijing?"" Harari, a history professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, published his first book, ""Sapiens,"" in 2014; it was a global best seller. He has since published two more books with futuristic themes, ""Homo Deus"" and ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The three books together have sold 35 million copies in 65 languages.He has been warning people of a not-so-distant future of incredible change, saying the artificial intelligence at work today through algorithms will only strengthen its grip on humans.""Netflix tells us what to watch and Amazon tells us what to buy. Eventually within 10 or 20 or 30 years such algorithms could also tell you what to study at college and where to work and whom to marry and even whom to vote for,"" says Harari.And he points out, the pandemic has opened the door to even more intrusive collection of our data.  ""It's data about what's happening inside my body. What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch. The next phase is surveillance going under our skin,"" he warns. ""Certainly, now we are at the point when we need global cooperation. You cannot regulate the explosive power of artificial intelligence on a national level,"" says Harari, who tells Cooper what he feels needs to be done. ""One key rule is that if you get my data, the data should be used to help me and not to manipulate me. Another key rule, that whenever you increase surveillance of individuals you should simultaneously increase surveillance of the corporation and governments and the people at the top. And the third principle is that-- never allow all the data to be concentrated in one place. That's the recipe for a dictatorship."" Harari says humans are at risk of becoming 'hacked"" if artificial intelligence does not become better regulated.""To hack a human being is to get to know that person better than they know themselves. And based on that, to increasingly manipulate you,"" Harari says.  There's an upside to the rise of artificial intelligence, too, says Harari, but only if accompanied by regulation.""The whole thing is that it's not just dystopian. It's also utopian. I mean, this kind of data can also enable us to create the best health care system in history,"" he says. ""The question is what else is being done with that data? And who supervises it? Who regulates it?"" ","Yuval Harari warns humans will be ""hacked"" if AI is not globally regulated","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/historian-yuval-harari-warns-humans-will-be-hacked-if-artificial-intelligence-is-not-globally-regulated/'}, 'name': 'Historian Yuval Harari warns humans will be “hacked” if artificial intelligence is not globally regulated', 'description': 'Harari says global cooperation is needed to prevent human data from getting into the hands of a powerful few. 60 Minutes reports, Sunday.', 'thumbnail': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/29/f0bb80d6-a49b-47af-95ad-a091a121ab8d/thumbnail/1200x630/3227606f9c8823ba1c64e82be1691b28/hararipreview-825635-640x360.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/29/f0bb80d6-a49b-47af-95ad-a091a121ab8d/thumbnail/1200x630/3227606f9c8823ba1c64e82be1691b28/hararipreview-825635-640x360.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d', 'uploadDate': '2021-10-29T10:59:02-0400', 'publisher': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'name': 'CBS News', 'foundingDate': '1927-09-18', 'sameAs': ['https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews/', 'https://instagram.com/cbsnews/', 'https://twitter.com/CBSNews', 'https://www.youtube.com/CBSNews', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News'], 'logo': [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 60, 'width': 600, 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/assets/standalone/cbsnews-logo-white-600x60.png'}], 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}, 'actionableFeedbackPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735', 'correctionsPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d', 'Masthead': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963', 'missionCoveragePrioritiesPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca', 'ownershipFundingInfo': 'https://www.paramount.com/company-history', 'unnamedSourcesPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857', 'publishingPrinciples': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/'}, 'duration': 'PT0H01M34S', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/historian-yuval-harari-warns-humans-will-be-hacked-if-artificial-intelligence-is-not-globally-regulated/?embed=1'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/,1927-09-18,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 60, 'width': 600, 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/assets/standalone/cbsnews-logo-white-600x60.png'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['article header h1', 'article > section p:first-of-type']}",,,,

Read on!,N/A,N/A,"
Over the last quarter-century, automation, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have made the transition from science fiction to science fact. Automation is the wave of the future, but it carries with it the images of millions of workers out of a job, replaced by machines. The fear of being replaced has been around for decades now, and it shows no signs of abating.
In fact, across the world, a significant percentage of people believe that robots and computers will take jobs away from humans in the next half-century, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the fall of 2018. But then again, a Gallup survey conducted in early 2018 showed that while 73% of Americans believe that Artificial Intelligence will eliminate more jobs than it winds up creating, only 23% were concerned that they themselves would be directly impacted by it.
There is a lot of concern and speculation out there, so what’s the actual impact of automation on today’s job market? Will automation save it or bring about its doom?
Better Quality of Jobs
When looking for a good way to describe how automation helps the job market, one need only look as far as the lyrics to the rock group Styx’s 1983 hit “Mister Roboto”, where the song talks about thanking robots for doing the jobs nobody wants to. Repetitive work is boring, often dirty, and sometimes dangerous. Even though people want to work, they’d rather not take such jobs, if given a choice.
One of automation’s strong points is that it’s ideally suited for taking over the dangerous, dirty, drudge jobs, thereby giving companies the ability to offer more attractive jobs to aspiring employees. Offering a position that has an atmosphere conducive for employee growth is far more attractive; it’s not so much giving someone a job as it is starting them on a career. Give people better choices of jobs and they will eagerly pursue them, and be better employees as a result.
Now, this all assumes that automation would actually result in a quantitative increase in jobs, not just a qualitative one. After all, getting rid of a host of boring and dangerous jobs and replacing it with far fewer better quality jobs doesn’t help a large number of job-seekers, now does it?
An Increased Number of Jobs
Fortunately, automation does in fact create more jobs. While there are always charts available that show wildly different predictions about job loss or gain, the consensus seems to be that automation actually results in more jobs.
For instance, last year, a study on automation in the United Kingdom showed the loss of 800,000 jobs and the INCREASE of 3.5 million jobs! A Swiss think tank predicted that automation would eliminate 75 million jobs across the world, yet add 133 million new ones.
There are even studies that indicate that some of the forecasts have been exaggerated. Based on these points, it’s easy to see how the job market would actually be enriched and enhanced by automation, not ruined. However, there is one truth that cannot be ignored…
Yes, Some Jobs DO Get Phased Out
Every technological innovation comes at a price. The railroads spelled doom to the horse-drawn wagons, and the automobile brought doom to the railroads. Video killed the radio star, and Netflix killed Blockbuster. New tech uproots the old; that’s the way of things.
Look at how many professions have died over the past few centuries as newer, better methods and products came onto the scene. With advances and innovations arriving at an increasingly exponential rate today, it’s only logical that some jobs will go the way of the dinosaur. Somewhere out there, someone is going to lose his or her job.
This chart shows a sampling of occupations and the likelihood that they will become automated. The trend appears to be greater in the agriculture and manufacturing industries, plus jobs in food service, courier and postal positions, and land-based transport (passengers and freight). As for some specific examples, jobs such as data entry clerks, tax preparers, and telemarketers could be lost completely to automation, though it’s probably a good bet that many people would like to see telemarketers go away completely!
Bottom line, occupations that rely more on repetitive physical tasks stand a greater chance of being affected by automation.

But Not All Jobs Are Vulnerable

On the upside, there are certain occupations and careers that are very safe from automation-based obsolescence. Fields such as healthcare, teaching, politics, science and engineering, law enforcement, and IT stand less of a chance of being adversely affected by automation.
And not only are there a good selection of jobs that are less likely to be harmed by automation and robots, many jobs that are more vulnerable won’t be completely divested of human workers; in fact, those employees will find their workload helped out immensely by automation. In other words, it doesn’t have to be an “all or nothing” proposition. One could have a business where certain functions of employees’ jobs are automated, but still needing human interaction.
For instance, jobs in the customer service or human resources industries could be made easier by having more tedious and repetitive elements handled faster and more accurately with automation, leaving the human employees to handle the more interesting and challenging aspects of human interaction. The human element is needed for tasks that require cognitive intelligence, reasoning and judgement calls. Rather than being a threat, automation becomes a partner, taking the boring, irritating tasks off the professional’s hands.
In fact, one could argue that some of the positions lost due to automation will return in part in a different form, namely the demand for professionals who can maintain the automated aspects of production.
A Potential Skill Gap?
This article features point out how the likelihood of various industries experiencing a shortfall of skilled workers over the next decade. Among the culprits of these shortages are the current generation retiring in greater numbers, less emphasis placed on graduates being proficient in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, mathematics), and an overall lack of understanding and experience in new technology.
The Robot Report further reinforces this, predicting that the US alone could experience shortfalls over the next ten years, and end up with having $454 billion of manufacturing GDP at risk in 2028!
So how does this gap get addressed?

Take advantage of the latest technological advances to move your business toward a successful future with 5 game-changing applications of AI in human resources.


Once the stuff of sci-fi movies, artificial intelligence (AI) is now becoming central to many aspects of human life. AI cars can drive you around autonomously, guided by navigation systems that will avoid traffic and facial recognition allows you to unlock your phone. We even have chatbots to deal with customer complaints or queries.


The applications of AI are seemingly limitless. This is why AI is now finding itself at the center of businesses across all departments. Forbes claims that in 2021 over a third of businesses are already using some sort of AI. 


This article will look at 5 game-changing applications of AI in human resources. But before we begin, let’s take a closer look at artificial intelligence. 


What Exactly Is AI? 


Before we look at some of the applications of AI in human resources, it’s important to understand what AI means. 


The Britannica online dictionary describes artificial intelligence as “the ability of a digital computer or robot to perform tasks usually associated with intelligent beings.” Once a fantasy, now a reality. In recent years, technological advancements have seen computers and robots with artificial intelligence capabilities improve rapidly. 


The ability for AI to think, learn, and make decisions allows them to perform complex tasks only previously possible by humans. AI can now undertake reasoning, problem-solving, speech recognition, and sensory perception. 


These benefits have seen AI become central to businesses across all departments, saving them heaps of human time and effort. AI has also revolutionized startups by allowing new small businesses to automate tasks without having a strong workforce. 


Benefits of AI in HR 


Somewhat ironically, one department benefitting hugely from AI is human resources. 


The use of AI in human resources is on the rise. In the next few years, 47% of HR departments are expected to utilize AI in some capacity. This is unsurprising given the number of ways AI can help HR departments by increasing efficiency. 


In times where big-data rules, integrating AI into your processes is a great way to free up time and take a load off your staff members. Why let your lovely employees stress over collecting and analyzing piles of data when AI can do it in minutes? And with IoT automation connecting networks and devices, it’s easier than ever. 


Tasks commonly performed in HR departments such as recruitment processes, scanning through resumes, scheduling meetings, responding to emails, and general admin tasks, can all be completed in minutes rather than hours. 


By utilizing AI and automating processes, HR departments are left with more time for the things that require human interaction and empathy such as meetings, appraisals, and mentoring. Remember, AI is not looking to replace human workers, but rather aid them and make their jobs easier. 


5 Game-Changing Applications of AI in Human Resources


Let’s now look at some of the ways AI can help HR departments. 


Sourcing New Recruits 


Finding and recruiting the right candidate for the job takes time and effort. Your HR team’s recruitment scheduling involves trawling through hiring websites, making phone calls to agencies and recruiters, and searching internal and external databases.  


Too often, time constraints and pressure mean decisions have to be made on a hunch. The problem? This doesn’t always work out. Would you let a doctor operate on you solely because they thought maybe it was for the best? Of course not. They would have conducted multiple tests and thoroughly researched all other options before making this decision. 


The same rings true for recruiting new employees. By utilizing AI in the recruitment process, businesses can reliably automate many functions to make sure they’re choosing the best options while saving time in the process.


Reducing Bias


Equality and fairness are of paramount importance in the hiring process of the 21st century. Unfortunately, humans can be inadvertently influenced by external factors that should have no impact on a candidate’s suitability. 


Human behavior expert Kimberly Giles cites the “subconscious bias” as one of the main reasons businesses make bad hiring decisions all the time. She observes that employers tend to hire candidates that have similar traits to themselves, but this doesn’t necessarily make them suitable for the role. 


Then there’s the “unconscious bias” which sees people making preferences for people of their own race, gender, age, or education and employment background. The solution? Artificial intelligence. 


AI can be used to create algorithms that avoid human biases by removing characteristics that don’t affect suitability. The result is a diversified pool of potential candidates that are suited to the role, rather than suited to your own judgments and opinions.


Streamline New Employees’ Onboarding Process


Being the new person can be stressful for both the newbie and the HR departments who have to oversee their integration into the team. But utilizing AI during the onboarding process, this can help streamline and improve the experience. 


Firstly, AI programs can show new staff some of the routine procedures of your organization. This can be done via a video call app or chatbot and prevents the need for HR staff to be physically present. 


Training can also be provided via AI rather than face-to-face meetings. By inserting a new employee’s current skill set and awareness, AI can track their progress and see how they’re developing. Training can then be optimized and tailored for the individual. 


Intelligent bots can also be used to handle frequently asked questions regarding, policies, contracts, and other queries. 


By utilizing AI in the above ways to make the onboarding process easier, HR teams are left with extra time for the tasks that require human intervention. 


Improve Employee Retention and Decrease Departures 


It’s common for people to become unhappy at work and want to leave or find new challenges. Whatever the reason, AI can help with retention and departure rates. 


Whilst AI won’t stop people from becoming unhappy, it can flag staff members who may be underperforming or whose punctuality and commitment levels have dropped. These systems can then redirect employees to a development meeting or even find a better-suited role elsewhere in the business. 


Employees are likely to feel more content knowing these systems are in place to help them. In turn, happiness and retention levels rise. Sometimes people don’t speak up about their feelings, but this is a way to highlight such cases. 


AI can also determine which employees look like leaving imminently. Screening can monitor computer activity such as keystrokes, browsing history, and emails to find out who wants out. AI will spot patterns of behaviour that go against the norm for happy employees. In effect, AI may actually spot an unhappy employee before they even know it themselves.


Automating Administrative Tasks 


Most HR departments undertake laborious and repetitive tasks daily. There are emails, phone calls, documents, contracts, policies, performance reviews, managing holidays, and anything else in between to deal with. These repetitive, “low-level” tasks can take time and energy away from your staff. These days, intelligent SAP RPA can be used to automate the most mundane of daily tasks and free up time. 


In letting AI take over the tasks that can be soul-destroying and monotonous, not only does efficiency and production rise but so do staff happiness levels. The question is no longer how to use excel, but rather how to automate excel. 


No longer do staff need to input data one by one for hours on end while wishing they were somewhere else. 


Final Thoughts 


As we’ve seen, there are several benefits to integrating AI into your HR department. By automating processes for maximum efficiency, time and resources are freed up and your staff can focus on the tasks that need human intervention and interaction. 


With AI use on the rise, now is the time to get up to speed with all the ways this sophisticated technology can help you and your business.

As the region undergoes rapid transition, the Middle East offers several opportunities for technological innovation. The recently concluded 41st edition of Gitex Global provided a unique international opportunity for tech companies of all sizes the chance to meet and connect in person. The event highlighted mega tech trends shaping the region and the world, including artificial intelligence, fintech, blockchain, among others. The themes were explored across six events – Gitex Global, Gitex Future Stars, Ai Everything, Future Blockchain Summit, Fintech Surge and Marketing Mania. The show also witnessed over 3,500 participating exhibitors from 140 countries – including 600 startups, besides 120 government entities.AdChoicesADVERTISING
New conferences and projects such as Gitex Global Leaders Vision, Women in Tech, and Code Infinity made their debut at the event.
A wide range of announcements were made at the show introducing innovative solutions, forging new tech partnerships and unveiling expansion plans.
Region’s quest for innovation
The inaugural edition of Gitex Global Leaders Vision included policymakers, innovation and investment agency leaders from the Middle East and Africa, laying forth their national goals and strategies for a tech-driven future.
With the aim of having the world’s largest per capita percentage of coders within 10 years, the UAE has announced October 29 as its annual ‘National Coders Day’. At the Gitex Global Leaders Vision, Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, highlighted the initiative and discussed plans for the UAE’s Coders’ Society, bringing together the 60,000 coders who are already residing in the UAE. He also believed that the country could excel in developing women coders, bringing new employment opportunities to the female population throughout the Emirates.
The Dubai Digital Authority revealed that the Dubai Paperless Strategy had met 98.86 per cent of its goals, including 43 government agencies going completely paperless. On December 12, the Dubai Government will issue its last paper transaction. Wesam Lootah, CEO of Smart Dubai Government Establishment, Digital Dubai, stated that the day would mark the completion of the Dubai Paperless Strategy, which started in 2018. He claimed that the strategy had saved 13 million hours of manual transactions and 325 million sheets of paper, equivalent to 39,000 trees.
The Abu Dhabi Digital Authority director-general, Dr Mohamed Abdelhameed Al Askar, also called for cross-border cooperation in maturing digital human rights. He stated that rights would include guaranteed internet access for everybody, with digital connectivity being optional. He also added that digital ethics law must mature to secure privacy, balance free expression with individual protection, place digital fluency at the centre of education, optimise digital consumer rights, and raise cybersecurity awareness.
Brigadier Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi, Director General of Artificial Intelligence at Dubai Police, outlined new initiatives aimed at making Dubai the safest city in the world which included the launch of a GPS bullet vehicle camera tracking system and the world’s first floating smart police station on the World Islands.
While Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority presented AI-powered technology to ensure safer cycling tracks, Salem Al Marri, deputy director-general of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, confirmed that Dubai would look to have the majority of components for its next satellite made locally by startups and SMEs.
The startup’s pavilion
Gitex Future Stars, the region’s largest tech event for startups, witnessed the participation of 600 companies and talent from the music, fashion, arts, and sports industries. The platform also opened up new avenues for economic diversification. The platform also provided new opportunities for economic diversification. Furthermore, entrepreneurs and investors in the Creative Economy discussed how technology might be leveraged to revolutionise the creative sector.
The Dubai World Trade also announced the rebranding of Gitex Future Stars to North Star Dubai.
During the event, Hub71, Abu Dhabi’s global tech ecosystem, formed a partnership with AWS to help tech startups build scalable and secure cloud-based services that would accelerate their growth. Jida Itani, chief operating officer, Hub71, said: “Our support infrastructure for the startup’s community continues to expand the more we learn about our founders’ needs. Joining forces with Amazon Web Services unleashes opportunities for our startups, who will be able to take more advantage of cloud solutions as they look at scaling their businesses.”
In addition, Azimut, in collaboration with Gellify Middle East, launched a MENA-focused VC Fund to raise $50m in capital for smart city, healthcare, digital commerce, fintech, industry 4.0, and tourism startups using technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, blockchain, and cybersecurity.
The startup’s platform also inaugurated CodeInfinity – the region’s first and only developer event to empower young programmers. Microsoft announced a strategic partnership with industry leaders during the show to bridge the regional IT skills gap and address demand and supply challenges across businesses. In addition, the company collaborated with Oracle and Red Hat as founding partners for Gitex – CodeInfinity.
The event also witnessed a panel discussion on data-driven economic reasoning. The panel discussed how regulators, companies, and consumers cannot compromise on freedom of choice and must yet at all times offer ethical frameworks. The panel included Dina Mohammed Laity, director of Data Science, Talabat, Jennifer Belissent, principal data strategist, Snowflake, Nuno Amral de Frietas, directorof strategy and analytics, Kitch, William Thompson, president, Forbes Insight and Vishal Soni, data evangelist, Alteryx.
Towards a hybrid world
As the world looks forward hopefully towards the tapering of the pandemic, many people wonder about the future of businesses that have implemented new technologies. Many of these improvements are expected to be permanent, with features such as flexible scheduling that allows employees to work from home when necessary.
According to Gartner research, 75 per cent of hybrid or remote knowledge workers say their expectations for working flexibly have grown, and four out of ten employees are at risk of leaving if they are forced to return to an in-person office environment.
“A hybrid work model is here to stay. And the best scenario is when you give that flexibility to your employees to work from home or anywhere. But in the hybrid work model, we need to address a couple of things. Firstly, the experience to continue to be productive with solutions and devices. Secondly, also to make sure the endpoint data centres are secured,” says Haidi Nossair, senior director – client solutions group – MERAT, Dell Technologies.
With remote and hybrid work environments introducing new challenges, cybersecurity needs to remain a prio­rity. To better understand the security demands of the emerging hybrid workplaces, Entrust polled 1,500 executives from the manager level to the C-suite and 1,500 full- and part-time workers at the entry and associate levels. The study interviewed workers in 10 countries across four global regions, revealing executives’ present intentions for the new hybrid workplace and employee perceptions on their work arrangements and the goals of their organisations. A total of 80 per cent of executives and 75 per cent of employees reported that their organisations are currently using a hybrid model or is remote and exploring a hybrid work style. However, 54 per cent of employees reported up to six instances of lost productivity owing to network access concerns, and leaders cite home internet security (21 per cent) and sensitive corporate data leaks (20 per cent) as their top security challenges.
Addressing the region’s threat landscape and hybrid work models, Attivo Networks introduced their Identity Detection and Response and Active Directory protection solutions. “The ADAssessor solution analyses Active Directory flaws and vulnerabilities to identify sophisticated attacks in real-time. The ADSecure technology inhibits Active Directory exploitation by quickly masking genuine Active Directory objects, alerting on illegal operations, and returning disinformation to derail the attack,” says Ray Kafity, vice president at Attivo Networks.
“These protections are all achieved without altering the production Active Directory environment.”
Meanwhile, to meet the challenges in a hybrid work model, it is also essential to rethink how to upgrade systems to achieve the best results, says Jabra. “With the drastic change brought by the pandemic, people are now more physically separated than ever. Hence, organisations need to adapt as quickly and think of ways on how to effectively conduct remote meetings without compromising the audio and video settings,” comments Nicolas Bliaux, managing director – Eastern Europe, Russia and CIS, Middle East, Turkey and Africa, at Jabra.
Jabra has managed to address the needs by introducing advanced 180° video technology and a range of intelligence-driven features that can give the power to put safe, socially distanced meetings back on the table as realistically as possible. “Making life look and sound better in this new hybrid working world has never been more necessary,” added Bliaux.
The future of digital revolution
The Middle East, particularly the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), has always been ahead of the game in terms of technological adoption. The public and private sectors have taken a major step in creating a strong digital infrastructure that fosters innovation and opens up new economic opportunities. According to Gartner, IT investment in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to rise 4.5 per cent year on year to $171.3bn this year.
The growing demand for local IT companies and projected investments will strengthen the region’s economy. Not only will technology have a significant influence on how the Middle East and its businesses operate, but it will also have a beneficial impact on the people who live here. The region appears to be on its way to becoming a significant participant in the technology landscape.

Anaheim Union to host district’s first-ever Artificial Intelligence Summit Nichole Pichardo October 27, 2021 

The Anaheim Union High School District is bringing together a diverse line-up of speakers from Google, IBM, the United Nations and the Milken Institute — just to name a few — to discuss new pathways for students in the fields of artificial intelligence, biotech, cybersecurity and more.
The district’s first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit will take place on Nov. 5 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Anaheim Hilton. And while the in-person event is limited to invitations only, a virtual live streaming option is available for the public to attend. Students, educators, administrators, parents and others who support students can register via this link.
The summit will feature various sessions with industry experts who will discuss future AI workforce opportunities as well as showcase the district’s artificial intelligence pathway at Kennedy High School.
“The Anaheim Union High School District is a leader in creating future-ready career pathways in biotechnology, cybersecurity, incubator/accelerator labs, and an AI pathway that leads students through the world of artificial intelligence with an emphasis on robotics, computer science, and engineering design,” the district said in a press release.
Earlier this year, the district announced a partnership with the Irvine-based technology firm Loko AI to launch a new artificial intelligence internship program. AUHSD also became the first public school district in the nation to offer Google Career Certificates in the fields of data analytics, IT support and project management.
The Nov. 5 summit is free to those who register, and additional information can be found on the flyer below and by visiting the AUHSD website.
