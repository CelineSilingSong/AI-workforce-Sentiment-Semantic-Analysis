And, most recently, that includes reaping the benefits of step changes in generative AI. Take London-based VC firm Moonfire. Late last year, the early-stage firm was trying to improve one of the machine-learning-based tools it uses to identify promising companies. One engineer made the model 5% better after three months of work — a result partner Mike Arpaia called “awesome”. Then large language model (LLM) GPT-4 was released in March this year. In a single afternoon, the same engineer improved the model by a further 20%. Advertisement“GPT-4 was really the step change in model performance…we’re entering an industrial revolution,” says Arpaia. A number of investors tell Sifted that they’re beginning to explore sourcing and classifying deals using generative AI models, as more powerful models have become widely available and easily accessible.How VCs are using generative AIInvestors say that there’s a key difference between the rise of generative AI and previous developments in data-driven deal sourcing. Generative AI refers to a class of deep learning models that are exceptionally good at generating and understanding content such as text and images. “There’s been a shift in VCs engaging with AI, as access has been democratised,” says Arpaia. “Before you needed to be a linear algebra expert to do deep learning at that scale reliably, but now all you need is an OpenAI key.” New models like GPT-4 are helping VCs cut down on hours of laborious work classifying startups in their internal databases. Episode 1 has a proprietary data platform that sources 300-400 potential investments — from a number of places like Companies House, LinkedIn and GitHub — each week and has begun to use generative AI models to quickly classify them. “We invest in B2B software companies, so we can ask a generative pre-trained transformer model [ChatGPT-like software] to filter out the ones that are in our scope,” Adam Shuaib, principal at Episode 1 tells Sifted. “Without that tech, I would have to spend five or six hours manually going through 400 descriptions…this wouldn’t have been possible a year ago.”Blossom Capital has built a model that generates a one-pager about a company with details such as founder background and employee growth. It‘s planning on adding more generative AI features over the next 12 months, such as factoring in details like who owns shares, company job posts, customers and competitors.  Classifying startups using generative AI models “is definitely going to be a core part of how we source deals,” says Imran Ghory, partner at Blossom Capital and backer of Checkout.com and Pigment— and it’s hiring data scientists as it looks to double down on the tech.Making analysts 10x fasterPan-European investor Speedinvest, too, has recently onboarded an engineer  — the first it’s hired specifically to work on the tech — to build generative AI tools for its investment team. The VC is working on a tool that can assess founders based on attributes like previous experience and education.AdvertisementThis is more challenging because of how much more nuanced the question of a founders’ experience is than the sector of a startup, says Florian Obst, principal at Speedinvest. Hallucinations can happen even when asking generative models simple things, let alone the complex matter of what makes a top founder. “It’s a less forgiving exercise because we don’t want to miss out on good deals or focus on bad ones,” he adds.Speedinvest hopes to roll out more advanced models to its investment teams towards the end of this year. “The idea is to make every analyst 10 times faster than before,” Obst tells Sifted.While Obst says that extra efficiency will mean analysts can spend more time focusing on the “people side” of investing, others think automation means jobs could take a hit.“You might find that the bigger funds at Series B and C might not need as many analysts or associates because a lot of that manual work can be done very easily and effectively by generative AI models,” says Episode 1’s Shuaib.The future generative AI in VCVCs using generative AI are careful about positioning the tech as something that will change the fundamentals of the business.“VC is an industry where you can make good money in a number of ways, and it’s not absolutely necessary for VCs to have AI-driven company and founder evaluation,” says Arpaia. While Moonfire has “pinned its efficiencies” to emerging tech like generative AI, a number of bigger funds might not be so quick to buy into it, he adds. “You don’t need to see all of the world to make 12 good investments each year.”And some VCs will continue to focus on getting dealflow through their network, says Obst. While VCs like Speedinvest that cover multiple geographies will need to use tech like generative AI to source deals, “a lot of deals are still done between people where they don’t even hit the market”, he adds.Even some of the most sophisticated data-driven, deal-sourcing VCs aren’t convinced by the power of generative AI models just yet.Swedish VC EQT Ventures’ internal data and machine learning platform, Motherbrain, is run by a team of 25 people. It scrapes huge amounts of data online and suggests companies that investors should investigate.“We’re not actually using generative AI — if you define generative AI as generating new content based on existing content,” says partner Lars Jörnow. While he doesn’t rule out integrating LLMs like GPT-4 into EQT’s models in the future, they aren’t as good at burrowing down into granular data as Motherbrain’s machine-learning models at the moment, Jörnow adds. And there are worries that filtering startups based on AI models could further entrench the wildly uneven fundraising landscape in VC. “A dumb AI model might look at the European unicorns, see that founders are typically white and went to Cambridge University and try to find more with those attributes,” says Blossom’s Ghory. There are a number of cases where generative AI tools have been found to double down on biases. But, on the flip side, well-trained models could help to identify founders who normally wouldn’t be on a VC’s radar, he adds. “But you can also train AI models to focus on the things that really matter, like if a company is winning great customers or making great hires. It could mean that companies who might not be on your radar have an easier time finding funding.”","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://sifted.eu/articles/will-generative-ai-revolutionise-the-way-vcs-find-deals'}","['https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/07174520/moonfire-2023-team-53.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1367&amp;q=75&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=compress,format']",Sifted,"['https://www.facebook.com/siftedeu/', 'https://twitter.com/siftedeu', 'https://uk.linkedin.com/company/siftedeu', 'https://www.instagram.com/siftedeu/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, we have seen artificial intelligence (AI) developing rapidly. The profound implications for areas such as art, politics, work and education are now becoming apparent, leading to a heated public debate about the best ways to harness the benefits of this new technology while mitigating the risks. In this Q&A with Maayan Arad, Giulia Gentile discusses how AI is transforming our judicial system and the impact this may have on public perceptions of justice.

Which aspects of AI development have you focused on? 
My research explores the tensions between the advancement of AI in the management of the State and public values. I have been focusing on two areas in particular. First, I am investigating the impact of AI on the legal field and in particular on judicial systems. I’m currently leading a project on the challenges related to, on the one hand, the introduction of AI tools in courts systems, and, on the other hand, compliance with the rule of law in the EU.
Second, I am coordinating a collaborative research project funded by the EU Commission together with Orla Lynskey on the protection of public values in privately digitised public services. In recent years, several public services, such as justice or education, have been digitised through forms of public-private collaborations. Could these partnerships be liable to deprive public services of their “publicness”, by subtly subjecting them to private interests? How can we ensure that this cooperation does not undermine public values, such as transparency and accountability? Our research ultimately aims to identify the safeguards that should exist to ensure that public-private cooperation in the digitisation of the State respects public values.
What have been your key findings?
A first finding is that, due to the bias that is intrinsic in data, and, by reflection, in AI systems, there’s no guarantee that AI-assisted courts, or other aspects of the administration of the State, will be compliant with fundamental values such as judicial independence, non-discrimination and ultimately the rule of law.
A second finding is that the increasing use of AI in the public administration, and particularly in court systems, is inevitably transforming the role and the public perception of State authority in society. If judges are no longer purely human but AI-enhanced, for example, their function and social standing will inevitably change. These technological transformations are likely to affect public trust in the State, especially in courts. The introduction of AI in the courtroom could undermine some of the foundations of the administration of justice.
In what ways is AI currently being used in the legal profession and in the courts?
Law firms are increasingly using algorithms to draft contracts or skeleton arguments for litigation. AI also helps speed up due diligence and e-discovery exercises (an automated process that classifies the relevance of evidence in the context of litigation).
When it comes to courts, AI has been employed at different stages of judicial proceedings. In the pre-trial phase, AI can be used, for instance, to guide the parties of a litigation in submitting their claim, or to automatically distribute workload to judges. AI could be further applied in the deliberative phase for research support or to produce a skeleton judgment.
Who is responsible at the moment for creating these tools? 
That’s a very good question: because of the far-reaching effects of AI on the delivery of public services and, more generally, on our democracies, the “who”, “how”, and “why” questions become topical. However, currently, the media and the public at large are not particularly concerned with the creators of AI tools used in the public field.
In the UK, the development of technologies for courts has occurred through public-private partnerships. Public procurement rules were used to identify the partners of the UK government in delivering these technological innovations. An example is the Money Claim Online system that was developed in cooperation with a private company, Kainos. Yet the public procurement framework focuses essentially on value for money. The provider that better matches the requirements of the tender at the lowest price will be selected. The same rules are likely to be used for the introduction of AI tools in UK courts. Should we radically transform our public services and interactions with the state in areas so crucial for our democracy, such as the administration of justice, by merely assessing value for money? Certainly, keeping the costs of digitisation and AI tools low is important to avoid excessive spending. But giving absolute prevalence to the value of the transaction over public values, such as fairness, non-discrimination, transparency and accessibility, ultimately undermines the pedigree of our democratic system.
Should we radically transform our public services and interactions with the state in areas so crucial for our democracy, such as the administration of justice, by merely assessing value for money?
Even more problematic from the angle of compliance with public values are the more informal kinds of cooperation between the state and private entities. For instance, during the pandemic, Google for Education provided its products to several schools in the UK. As a result of this cooperation, pupils’ data is processed by Google software, which now shapes the learning experience of thousands of children across the UK. Google’s offer of these services was not subject to any specific procedures or safeguards and, accordingly, public accountability appears reduced.
Under both scenarios, there was no careful assessment by the government or other public bodies on the implications of these technological developments on public services and values. Accordingly, the recent examples of public-private cooperation used to digitise public services in the UK appear to hinder foundational principles such as non-discrimination, fairness and accessibility. Undermining the public nature of these services has adverse effects for UK democracy: it risks worsening poverty and inequality in UK society, while consolidating the market power of digital services providers, and threatens fundamental rights. To counteract this, I aim to devise a legal framework that can better embed public values in public-private collaborations in the digitisation of the State.
As this technology becomes more advanced, how do you expect it will change the nature of courts and how they function?
Any transformation brings novelties but also losses. Similarly, introducing algorithms in judicial systems will reshape courts in the sense that they may become more efficient. But inevitably “something” else will be lost. We need to assess the new dynamics and implications that AI technology will introduce in the justice system.
To begin with, we can observe a loss of “humanness”. Traditionally, parties of a litigation are confronted with a human judge, an individual who can empathise with the parties’ problems while interpreting legal rules to solve the pending matter. When the adjudicator becomes a robot, an AI entity, the shared “humanness” among the actors of the litigation goes missing. The absence of humanness could influence the authority and the constitutional standing that courts have in society. An algorithm might be seen as less or more authoritative or empathetic than a human depending on the context. One might imagine that systems affected by a backlog of cases of minor importance might benefit from a speedier resolution of disputes through algorithms. But where algorithms are used to solve cases that directly impact fundamental rights, this may cause more concern.
In China, for example, relatively simple claims are already being decided through algorithms. But in the case of criminal or constitutional cases, knowing that the ultimate authority on the litigation will be a robot inevitably makes a difference. How would you feel knowing that your liberty may be limited by an AI entity?

How might these changes redefine the role that emotions and other innately human characteristics play in judicial processes and decision-making in court? Could removing this element reduce biases and discrimination or might it have more negative effects? 
This question goes to the heart of the conundrum of courts’ digitisation. AI could be a potential panacea for the psychological factors and especially the bias problem that shape litigation. If a judge, for example, has a certain preference, whether political or simply personal, towards certain parties, certain arguments, or certain interpretations of the law, he or she may be unconsciously biased, and in extreme cases judicial impartiality would be affected. The question of how to manage the psychology of judges is very complex. There are several rules already in place designed to measure and assess whether judges are independent and impartial, and the law provides safeguards to ensure diversity and inclusivity among the judicial benches. AI could be seen as a solution to the potential judicial biases by providing more reliable, mathematical input in the courtroom.
AI could exacerbate biases and potential inequalities in the interpretation of the law because of its exponential nature.
But that’s where the conundrum comes in. The reality is that AI systems are in themselves biased. This is because AI relies on data produced by humans, which is imbued with human preferences and inclinations. Data reflects pre-existing biases. So the alleged solution to potential biases in the mind of a judge may not be effective after all. On the contrary, AI could exacerbate biases and potential inequalities in the interpretation of the law because of its exponential nature. So using AI to make judicial decision-making more neutral may not be the right way forward.
How can we make sure that AI isn’t used in a destructive way now that it’s becoming more sophisticated and powerful?
The answer to this question is regulation. We need to regulate as soon as possible before AI reaches a level of advancement that could seriously undermine not only the job market, but also some very essential aspects of our society, such as a free press, access to the internet and the right to be informed. If AI is used to manipulate public information and create fake news, good, reasonable governance may become virtually impossible.
Additionally, we should reflect on which values should guide the use of AI, and which usages of this technology should be permitted because they benefit society at large.
Prohibition of certain uses of AI could be a possible way forward, for instance, by singling out in which fields AI should be prohibited because of the potential excessive risks to human and democratic values.
I am pleased that the UK government recently acknowledged, for the first time, that AI bears very serious risks. And I very much hope that this will lead to rules that have regulatory bite in the UK.

AI to replace 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2030, many fewer than other forms of automation

It's not all bad news. Poets are safe. And machines will take some jobs no human wants




Katyanna Quach                                



Wed 6 Sep 2023                                     // 
23:59 UTC                                



































Generative AI will replace 2.4 million US jobs by 2030, and influence another eleven million, but other forms of automation will cost more jobs, according to a report from analyst firm Forrester.
The firm’s 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast [paywall] predicts that the tech will reshape more jobs than it replaces, but also includes a section titled “Let’s Be Clear: Generative AI Is Coming After White Collar Jobs”.
White collar workers most at risk of being left behind will be technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, copywriters, and those in administrative positions.







The biggest disruptions will be felt by workers that have college degrees, perform white-collar jobs, and are middle class. People with annual salaries less than $60,000, for example, will be impacted less by generative AI than those that earn $90,000 or more. Here's a chart below showing how much different types of jobs can expect to be influenced by technology:














Such workers have a couple of years in which to prepare, Forrester’s analysts suggest, because its modelling assumes it will take time for “questions on intellectual property rights, copyright, plagiarism, model refresh rates, model bias, ethics, and model response reliability” to be resolved.







The report also predicts that while generative AI will cost jobs, other forms of automation will have a greater impact. In 2023, the report predicts, generative AI will cause 9.3 percent of jobs lost to automation, rising to 30.4 percent by 2030.
Not every job replaced by automation is a job lost to humans, the report asserts, because humans don’t want certain jobs.
“In some cases, automation will stand in for jobs that have been hard to fill,” the report states. “For instance, physical robotics and automation are only beginning to fill the workforce gaps that have plagued frontline work in the 2020s.”


But other jobs will impact humans and Forrester’s analysts warn of “deep social challenges like those faced in the post-industrial Rust Belt.”

Creative types: meet your robot assistant
Forrester’s analysts reckon that workers in more creative industries, like editors, writers, authors and poets, and lyricists, are more likely to incorporate generative AI tools in their jobs and are less likely to be replaced.
Forrester urged leaders to figure out how to use generative AI in a way that will boost worker productivity and improve customer outcomes, and outlined a few roadblocks that might stand in the way.
Despite the technology's potential, it may actually lead to poor performance. Analysts highlighted that tools like ChatGPT can generate ""coherent nonsense"" that could lead to inconsistent customer service or lead to workers having to fix issues.
There will also be a gap in people's skills. ""[Companies will] need to hire new, potentially scarce, and expensive talent — developers, business analysts, prompt engineers, even ethicists. The market for this talent will be tight. On the other side, you might lose valuable legacy talent if the pace of change is too fast,"" they warned.
In some cases, automating some tasks could lead to substandard outcomes but companies might be pressured to stick with AI anyway. To incorporate generative AI in operations smoothly, companies should analyze which jobs would benefit the most from automation and train employees to learn new skills like prompt engineering, a technique that involves refining input prompts to software with the goal of obtaining specific outcomes.
""[Enterprises] won't be able to plan for every contingency, but [they] can build a workforce generative AI strategy that better prepares [them] for the Wild West of generative AI at work. [Their] strategy should include investments, guardrails, and checkpoints,"" the report concluded.
The Register has asked Forrester for more comment. ® Sponsored: Why sustainability matters more than ever to telcos

The rise of artificial intelligence has created growing excitement and much debate about its potential to revolutionize entire industries. At its best, AI could improve medical diagnosis, identify potential national security threats more quickly, and solve crimes. But there are also significant concerns—in areas including education, intellectual property, and privacy.
Today’s WatchBlog post looks at our recent work on how Generative AI systems (for example, ChatGPT and Bard) and other forms of AI have the potential to provide new capabilities, but require responsible oversight.

The promise and perils of current AI use
Our recent work has looked at three major areas of AI advancement.
Generative AI systems can create text (apps like ChatGPT and Bard, for example), images, audio, video, and other content when prompted by a user. These growing capabilities could be used in a variety of fields such as education, government, law, and entertainment. As of early 2023, some emerging generative AI systems had reached more than 100 million users. Advanced chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation tools are examples of generative AI systems in widespread use. As news headlines indicate, this technology continues to gain global attention for its benefits. But there are concerns too, such as how it could be used to replicate work from authors and artists, generate code for more effective cyberattacks, and even help produce new chemical warfare compounds, among other things. Our recent Spotlight on Generative AI takes a deeper look at how this technology works.
Machine learning is a second application of AI growing in use. This technology is being used in fields that require advanced imagery analysis, from medical diagnostics to military intelligence. In a report last year, we looked at how machine learning was used to assist the medical diagnostic process. It can be used to identify hidden or complex patterns in data, detect diseases earlier and improve treatments. We found that benefits include more consistent analysis of medical data, and increased access to care, particularly for underserved populations.  However, our work looked at limitations and bias in data used to develop AI tools that can reduce their safety and effectiveness and contribute to inequalities for certain patient populations.
Facial recognition is another type of AI technology that has shown both promises and perils in its use. Law enforcement—federal, as well as state and local—have used facial recognition technology to support criminal investigations and video surveillance. It is also used at ports of entry to match travelers to their passports. While this technology can be used to identify potential criminals more quickly, or those who may not have been identified without it, our work has also found some concerns with its use. Despite improvements, inaccuracies and bias in some facial recognition systems could result in more frequent misidentification for certain demographics. There are also concerns about whether the technology violates individuals’ personal privacy.

Ensuring accountability and mitigating the risks of AI use 
As AI use continues its rapid expansion, how can we mitigate the risks and ensure these systems are working appropriately for all?
Appropriate oversight will be critical to ensuring AI technologies remain effective, and keep our data safeguarded. We developed an AI Accountability Framework to help Congress address the complexities, risks, and societal consequences of emerging AI technologies. Our framework lays out key practices to help ensure accountability and responsible AI use by federal agencies and other entities involved in the design, development, deployment, and continuous monitoring of AI systems. It is built around four principles—governance, data, performance, and monitoring—which provide structures and processes to manage, operate, and oversee the implementation of AI systems.
AI technologies have enormous potential for good, but much of their power comes from their ability to outperform human abilities and comprehension. From commercial products to strategic competition among world powers, AI is poised to have a dramatic influence on both daily life and global events. This makes accountability critical to its application, and the framework can be employed to ensure that humans run the system—not the other way around.

How the education sector can safeguard students using generative AI

 September 6, 2023   



Image: @Vertigo3d | iStock
The emergence of free-to-access generative AI programmes has the potential to transform the classroom in ways we’re only beginning to understand, how can we protect students from the dangers of AI
The internet, perhaps the last major technological innovation that’s comparable to AI, changed the way that students communicate, work, and access information. But tools like ChatGPT appear to be doing much more than that. They’re changing the way that students live, work, and interact with technology every day.
Just as with the internet, it’s difficult to predict now what this technology may lead to in a decade’s time. What is clear is students have been very quick to utilise these tools to support their school work. Recently commissioned research from RM Technology reveals that over two thirds of school students are using the technology frequently, with some using it to solve mathematics problems, write English essays, translate texts in foreign languages, and more.
Despite the huge opportunities AI tools offer, many students are also struggling with its rapid introduction into their education.This is an aspect of the technology that too few are talking about. And we’ll need to do exactly that if we’re to guide children towards using the technology efficiently and safely, and protect them from the dangers which come from others misusing AI.
Ultimately, anyone with a stable internet connection and a computer is now able to produce harmful multimedia content, which could have a severe impact on a student’s wellbeing.
Providing ‘safety rails’ is key  
While the majority of school children are using AI to help with their school work, its popularisation has also increased their anxiety about education. Seventy per cent are now worrying that they’ll struggle in exams without the support of AI tools. Although 68% of students say they are now achieving better grades since they started using it, at least half of those children are experiencing guilt about doing so.
It’s clear that there’s a significant lack of guidelines for the use of AI in schools. Definite ‘safety rails’ that describe effective practice could help to dispel anxiety and reduce guilt. They would ensure that, in whatever way students use AI, it will not hamper their potential in exams.
Introducing effective safety rails, though, is going to present a considerable challenge to the sector. The technology is advancing at a pace that regulators struggle to match. The Online Safety Bill now passing through the House of Lords may soon be outdated.
Legislation and guidance take time and experience to draft. With AI, we have little of either.
The public and private sectors need to come together to ensure that schoolchildren in the UK are protected from the potential harms of this new technology.
Parents and teachers must be equipped so they can work together to safeguard students 
Government regulation will, without a doubt, prove crucial in guiding students’ use of AI in schools. Nevertheless, other stakeholders will need to play their part, since effective regulation remains a faint reality at some point in the distant future.
That’s where teachers come in. Yet, it can be difficult without any guidance or training for teachers to effectively guide students’ use of AI. Indeed, just over a third of teachers believe that students have a better understanding of AI than they do.
Schools must work with their technology partners to implement comprehensive training plans that cover every aspect of the use of AI, both in the classroom and outside it. Teachers must be equipped with the knowledge to decide how and where it is appropriate and beneficial, and how to spot when a student is misusing AI.
Safeguarding outside the classroom
Outside the classroom, it becomes difficult for teachers to guide and protect their students while they use AI. But parents will play an important role, since teachers can only do so much once a child has left the classroom.
Communication between parents and teachers is therefore vital if students are to be safeguarded outside the classroom. Informative material around the schools policy on the use of AI and how parents can safeguard their children is a great example of how schools can work with parents to ensure students continue to have a safe experience with AI outside the classroom.
It is clear that the education sector needs to introduce guidelines for students’ use of AI – and quickly. What we must also recognise is that government regulation may take a long time before it can offer that guidance and protection. Teachers, parents, and the private all have an important role to play. And through effective training and collaboration, they can ensure children can continue to learn in a safe and productive environment.

75% of people who use generative AI use it for work and 70% of Gen Z uses new generative AI technologies, according to a new 4,000-person survey by Salesforce, which has been integrating AI into its products for years. Also found: 68% of those who haven’t tried generative AI are Gen X or boomers.


“There’s a generative AI divide,” says Salesforce senior director of product marketing Kelly Eliyahu. “49% of the population has used it, and 51% has never used it.”

Generative AI has been around for a long time, with generative models dating back as far as 1972, according to Intel AI expert Ilke Demir. But it has burst onto the popular consciousness with the emergence of OpenAI with ChatGPT and visual creations from technologies like Creative Diffusion, MidJourney, and Adobe Firefly.

Apparently, more for some people than others.

For those who use the new technology, a third use it every day, Eliyahu says, while the rest use it weekly or more. Most are looking to automate work tasks, while about a third use it for fun, and a third use generative AI for learning about topics that interest them.

The generative AI divide is largely a generational divide. Non-believers tend to be older and more cautious around new technology. 68% of non-users are Gen X or baby boomers, and almost nine out of 10 non-users don’t see how generative AI will impact their life, and 40% says they aren’t familiar with the technology. That’s unfortunate, because that means that the oldest people in the population—who are most vulnerable to non-online shopping scams—don’t understand existing uses of deepfakes created with generative AI for financial and political scams. Another third of non-users say the technology is not useful for them
Those who use generative AI, however, see plenty of benefits:


46%: saves time
42%: easy to use
37%: fun to use
35%: teaches new things
32%: helps with complex concepts
29%: help make decisions quicker
28%: helps make more informed decisions
28%: keeps me more organized
26%: provides inspiration
22%: helps me succeed at work

According to the survey, people would use generative AI more if it was more secure and safe, if they understood it better and knew more about how to use it, and if it was integrated into the technology they already use. People who do use generative AI mostly say it’s improved even as they’ve been using it and almost 90% say the results of generative AI models have met or exceeded their expectations.

White Collar Workers: AI is Coming For Your Job The AI takeover may not be as bad as once feared — unless you’re working a white-collar job — according to a new report by IT research company Forrester.The company’s 2023 Generative AI Impact Forecast predicts that 2.4 million US jobs will be replaced by 2030, a dwarfed figure in comparison to the 300 million full-time jobs that Goldman Sachs forecasted would be lost to automation in April of this year.However, those on salaries of $90,000 or more will be bearing the brunt of AI much more than those on lower incomes due to the high automation potential of professional tasks.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer.

Source: forrester.comForrester’s latest findings don’t come as a major surprise, with mounds of previous research highlighting the impact AI will have on many white-collar workers. Yet, with the research company likening the deep social challenges that may result to those experienced in the postindustrial Rust Belt, the report is still likely to raise alarm bells for many US high-salaried workers.But fortunately, not all job replacements will come at a loss. The research firm also predicts that the technology will be able to fill many workplace gaps that have existed in frontline industries since the 2020 pandemic. Creative Industries Are Safe for NowForrester’s research also found that generative AI is likely to influence a grand total of 11 million jobs by 2023, making the tech 4.5 more likely to reshape a role than stamp it out altogether.Generative AI is expected to transform jobs in a number of ways, including by giving workers opportunities to upskill and retrain, as well as simplifying business workflows through automation.According to the report, creative professionals like poets, writers, and editors are less likely than white-collar workers to have their jobs replaced altogether as their skill sets are harder to replicate. Instead, Forester predicts that the nature of these jobs will evolve as AI tools become further embedded in our daily practices. How to Get AI Implementation RightAI is already uprooting the business landscape in major ways, with our own research revealing that 47% of business leaders are currently considering using AI over new hires.But while failing to embrace AI fast enough is a valid concern, doing so without adequate guardrails could open your business up to numerous risks including poor AI performance, negative employee experiences, and security issues.While it’s impossible to account for every contingency, to sidestep major pitfalls Forrester outlines the importance of building an informed generative strategy. According to the research firm, here are some major factors businesses should consider:Invest in the robot quotient (RQ) – RQ is a measure that evaluates your company’s readiness for robotic process automation. Self-assessing your team under this criteria will help you focus on which areas will benefit the most from AI automation.Prioritize augmentation – Enhancing roles with AI tools instead of replacing roles with technology will have a much more beneficial outcome on your business.Identify which jobs will benefit from AI the most – AI doesn’t assist all roles evenly. Analyzing which jobs will benefit the most will ensure that experience and precision don’t get lost in your transformation efforts.Hire or upskill to fill AI gaps – Most companies currently lack adequate AI know-how, so hiring or upskilling workers with relevant skills like prompt generation will be a solid return on investment.To learn more about how to get AI implementation right, read our guide on important AI principles, guidelines, and frameworks to consider in 2023.

Many employees worldwide are concerned about artificial intelligence (AI) replacing them.
However, a recent study by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) has indicated that AI, especially generative AI, will more likely augment jobs than destroy them.
Here are a few findings from the recent study.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been looked upon with suspicion by a significant number of employees worldwide for a few years, as most fear that the technology will render them jobless. However, a recent United Nations (UN) study has indicated that AI will more likely augment jobs rather than destroy them.
The studyOpens a new window  by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) examined the potential effects of ChatGPT and a few other platforms on job quality and quantity. The research suggested that most industries and jobs are only partly exposed to automation.
The organization said that most jobs are “more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT.” It further said, “Therefore, the greatest impact of this technology is likely not to be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.”
AI’s Effects May Vary Across Professions and Regions
While the study suggested that AI, especially generative AI, will more likely augment jobs, it also suggested that the effects will vary significantly between regions and professions.
According to the study, clerical work is the category of jobs having the most significant technological exposure. While about 24% of tasks are considered highly exposed, 58% of tasks have medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups, including technicians and managers, a small percentage of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about 25% had medium-level exposure.
Meanwhile, the study suggested that higher-income nations would experience the biggest impact from automation due to a significant share of para-professional and clerical jobs in the job distribution. It found that 5.5% of the total employment in high-income nations was potentially exposed to generative AI’s automation properties. On the other hand, only 0.4% of employment in low-income countries was exposed to generative AI’s automation properties.

Women Are More Likely To See Their Job Impacted
When comparing generative AI’s impact on men and women, the study highlighted that women were more likely than men to see their job affected. It indicated that the share of employment possibly affected was more than twice as high for women as for men. This was primarily due to the overrepresentation of women in clerical work, especially in middle- and high-income countries.
The Right Policies Offer Important Benefits
While the above stats look a little discouraging, the research suggested that the potential for augmentation was almost equal across countries. ILO said, “With the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.”
However, it cautioned that while augmentation may indicate positive developments like freeing up time for innovative tasks, it may also be implemented to accelerate work intensity or limit workers’ agency. Hence, according to the study’s authors, countries should design policies that support a fair, orderly, and consultative shift.

The Balance Between Using Artificial Intelligence and Authentic Intelligence to Find Talent 
Artificial intelligence and its impending impact on the workforce are dominating news and social media these days. But what exactly are the implications for finding talent? A recent report from LHH Knightsbridge Search breaks it down.

 September 6, 2023 – We live in a day and age when artificial AI continues to gain steam. Consider how it has already changed our everyday lives. It’s omnipresent and it’s no surprise that technology leaders such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI lead the way. All three recently released groundbreaking AI-powered chatbots that can code, converse, debate, plan, write; you name it. But as exciting as this advancement is, it can also be equally worrying for America’s workforce, according to a recent report from LHH Knightsbridge Search.
“The pros and cons can vary based on context, so first, let’s identify ours, the labor market—the blue- and white-collar workers and the companies which employ them,” the study said. “In this context, the list of pros and cons could be painfully long, so LHH Knightsbridge Search sticks to the three most pressing for each.”
The Pros
1. Accuracy – AI is programmed, and constantly learning, to be accurate. “While it’s not perfect—there have been notable errors—it’s close,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search report said. “This applies across the workplace spectrum, from robots welding automobiles in plants to analytics programs providing data in offices.”

2. Availability – LHH Knightsbridge Search also notes that it’s available 24/7/365, barring any unexpected downtime or major outages. The firm says that perhaps the most illustrative example of this is chatbots and while they may not resolve every customer service issue, they are available at every moment to at least help.
3. Creativity – “It complements humans by offering new ideas or enhancing existing ideas. Take the shiny new ChatGPT,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search said. “Provided with basic information, it can ideate and even create relevant, albeit robotic content, taking some of the legwork out of a difficult process.”
The Cons
1. Cost – AI can be expensive to not only develop, but also to use, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. “Despite the current low cost of the aforementioned ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus is currently $20 per month), other forms of AI can be expensive when factoring in costs associated with purchase, implementation, and use,” the firm said.

2. Disconnect – AI also lacks a human-to-human connection and it cannot build camaraderie with employees or develop genuine relationships with customers. Nor will it ever be an authentic and empathetic voice to represent a brand.
3. Unemployment – While AI will eliminate some jobs, a recent Forbes article said  it may create enough jobs to offset the loss. Regardless, the LHH Knightsbridge Search notes that it has—and will—take over some jobs and the jobs it creates could require new skill-sets that don’t even exist today.
What it Could Mean for Workforce Management
As much as AI is being entrenched in work, LHH Knightsbridge Search says that it’s difficult to measure its future impact on a macro level. “Estimated AI-influenced job gains and losses in America range from hundreds of thousands to millions over the next decade,” the firm said. “Wherever we end up, it’s clear that the world of work will change to some degree. What exactly could that mean for employers?”
Recruitment
As AI plays a larger role in many jobs and requires new hard and soft skills from humans, recruiters say that finding the right talent could become increasingly difficult. For example, if AI can elevate a complex customer service complaint to a certain point in a process, “it may be beneficial to have a customer service representative with a high degree of emotional intelligence take over at said point to resolve the complaint in a personal, empathetic manner,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search report said. “On the B2B client services side, the client relationship management data that some AI programs produce may need to be interpreted by an analytical human. Why did the program identify this data? How can this data be leveraged to help the client? How can we present it with the right context? On a positive note, AI is already helping companies to source and upskill the right talent. Here at LHH, it’s likely that an increasing reliance on AI, paired with a human touch, will help us solve any recruitment-related challenges.”


Leveraging AI for Executive Search Success
In today’s fast-paced business landscape, the role of executive search firms has never been more critical in helping organizations identify and recruit top-tier leadership talent. The demand for exceptional leaders who possess a unique blend of skills, experience, and cultural fit has intensified, prompting recruiters to explore innovative solutions to stay ahead of the competition. One game-changing tool that has emerged as a strategic imperative is artificial intelligence.

“What is really interesting to me about AI is that if we look at it from an information perspective, the talent space can benefit tremendously,” said Laurie Chamberlin, head of LHH Recruitment Solutions, North America. “The last several years, everyone has been talking about talent—scarcity, upskilling, wage inflation, right-sizing workforces, productivity, hybrid/remote workers, purpose, culture, and the list goes on. If we can harness the data we have and predict for companies how to best tackle their talent challenges, we all benefit.”
Layoffs
The LHH Knightsbridge Search report notes that AI will inevitably lead to some layoffs. “We’ve already seen this in automotive manufacturing, food production, and supply chain and logistics when robots were ushered in,” the firm said. “In the future, it could potentially happen with more professional services positions. To what degree and at what time remains an educated guessing game. Regardless, this puts employers in a difficult position. For any company, layoffs are difficult to navigate. They can damage reputation, drain resources, and trigger unrelenting worry about the people whose lives changed at the drop of a hat. If AI increases productivity at a lower cost, making certain jobs redundant and a layoff possible, ask these questions, first. Is there a way these employees can complement the AI? Can we move them to different roles? Is a layoff necessary? If so, how can we help them with their careers? Which type of outplacement services and upskilling can we offer them during their transitions?”
Skills
In regard to skills, AI will continue to demand more, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. “Whether they know it or not, almost every worker has a first or second-degree connection to automation or predictive analytics or robotics,” the report said. “They may have already developed skills because of this connection. They may have even lost their job because of this connection. Either way, there’s been a paradigm shift. It’s becoming insufficient to have a single razor-sharp skill; It’s now necessary to have that skill and develop new ones. Employers should play a part in this. They can nudge an employee down the path of advancement, creating a win-win for both parties. Companies invest in employees, which is often less costly than replacing them with someone with the right skills, and employees are more likely to reciprocate in the form of loyalty and productivity.”

The good news is this is happening partly based on the demand from workers. Per LHH’s “Global Workforce of the Future” report, 31 percent of workers state that the primary reason to quit is a lack of progression and re-skilling and upskilling opportunities, while 44 percent of those who want to stay at their current company want to progress/upskill for a new job. Today, employers have a range of upskilling options, from internal training programs, to third-party courses, to leadership coaching and development.
“We can use AI to predict skills that our candidates need to acquire in our service to make them more marketable given the supply and demand of the job market,” said John Morgan, president of LHH. “We are currently working on an algorithm to help candidates understand skills needed, jobs that are likely to be automated, new adjacent jobs that will emerge within their career track, and how their personal brand matches available jobs they are targeting.”
The Responsibilities of HR Leaders
Recruiters say that AI is having a profound effect on the world of work, and in turn, workforce management. As a leader—particularly those in HR—it’s imperative that you’re a part of this evolution, familiar with the latest AI developments that could affect your business, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. The firms asks: Are you listening to your colleagues in finance, marketing, operations, production, and other departments? Better yet, are you proactively asking them about automation, robotization, and other technology that could enhance and/or replace jobs?
“You need to know what’s on the horizon so you can plan accordingly,” the report said. “More importantly, remember your people. Over the past few years, there’s been talk about work-life balance, and work and life being one, more than ever. Not being equipped to capitalize on AI-induced changes can literally be life altering. Consider the efforts your company is taking to upskill employees and offer them career mobility, especially when new technologies are being integrated into their roles, even if there’s a chance their newfound mobility could take them elsewhere. And consider what you would do for them in the event AI does replace their role, whether it’s reskilling and moving or laying off with the support of a severance and outplacement.”
“You’ve probably already been faced with these challenges, and if you haven’t, it’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” LHH Knightsbridge Search said. “The more you prepare today the better off you’ll be tomorrow to strike the right balance between artificial intelligence and authentic intelligence.”

Since ChatGPT’s release in November of 2022, there have been countless conversations on the impact of similar large language models. Generative AI has forced organizations to rethink how they work and what can and should be adjusted. Specifically, organizations are contemplating Generative AI’s impact on software development. While the potential of Generative AI in software development is exciting, there are still risks and guardrails that need to be considered.
Members of VMware’s Tanzu Vanguard community, who are expert practitioners at companies across different industries, provided their perspectives on how technologies such as Generative AI are impacting software development and technology decisions. Their insights help answer questions and pose new questions for companies to consider when evaluating their AI investments.
AI won’t replace developers
Generative AI has introduced a level of software development speed that didn’t exist before. It helps increase developer productivity and efficiency by helping developers shortcut building code. Solutions, like the ChatGPT chatbot, along with tools such as Github Co-Pilot, can help developers focus on generating value instead of writing boilerplate code. By acting as a multiplier effect of developer productivity, it opens up new possibilities in what developers can do with the time they save. However, despite its intelligence and benefits to automating pipelines, the technology is still far from completely replacing human developers.
Generative AI should not be seen as being able to work independently and still needs to be supervised – both when it comes to ensuring the code is correct and when it comes to security. Developers still need to be able to understand the context and meaning of AI’s answers, as sometimes they are not entirely correct, says Thomas Rudrof, DevOps Engineer at DATEV eG. Rudrof believes that AI is better for assisting with simple, repetitive tasks and acts as an assistant rather than replacing the developer role.
Risks of AI in software development
Despite Generative AI’s ability to make developers more efficient, it is not error free. Finding bugs and fixing them may be more challenging using AI as developers still need to carefully review any code AI produces. There is also more risk related to the software development itself as it follows the logic defined by someone as well as the available dataset, says Lukasz Piotrowski, developer at Atos Global Services. Therefore, the technology will only be as good as the data provided.
On an individual level, AI creates security issues as attackers will try to exploit the capabilities of AI tools while security professionals also employ the same technology to defend against such attacks. Developers need to be extremely careful to follow best practices and not include credential and tokens in their code directly. Anything secure or containing IP that can be revealed to other users should not be uploaded. Even with safeguards in place, AI might be capable of breaking security.  If care is not taken in the intake process, there could be huge risks if that security scheme or other info are inadvertently pushed to generative AI, says Jim Kohl, Devops Consultant at GAIG.
Best practices and educationCurrently, there are no established best practices for leveraging AI in software development. The use of AI-generated code is still in an experimental phase for many organizations due to numerous uncertainties such as its impact on security, data privacy, copyright, and more.
However, organizations already using AI need to use it wisely and should not trust the technology freely.  Juergen Sussner, Lead Cloud Platform Engineer at DATEV eG, advises organizations to try to implement small use cases and test them well, if they work, scale them, if not, try another use case. Through small experiments, organizations can determine for themselves the technology’s risks and limitations.
Guardrails are necessary when it comes to the use of AI and can help individuals effectively use the technology safely. Leaving AI usage unaddressed in your organization can lead to security, ethical, and legal issues. Some companies have already seen severe penalties around AI tools being used for research and code, therefore acting quickly is necessary.  For example, litigation has surfaced against companies for training AI tools using data lakes with thousands of unlicensed works.
Getting an AI to understand context is one of the larger problems with leveraging AI in software development, says Scot Kreienkamp, Senior Systems Engineer at La-Z-Boy. Engineers need to understand how to phrase prompts for AIs. Educational programs and training courses can help teach this skill set. Organizations serious about AI technologies should upskill appropriate personnel to make them capable of prompt engineering.
As organizations grapple with the implications of Generative AI, a paradigm shift is underway in software development. AI is going to change the way developers work. At the minimum, developers leveraging the technology will become more efficient at coding and building software platform foundations. However, AI will need an operator to work with it and should not be trusted independently. The insights shared by VMware’s Vanguards underscore the need for cautious integration and the need to maintain guardrails to mitigate risk in software development.

How should education change to address, incorporate, or challenge today’s AI systems, especially powerful large language models? What role should educators and scholars play in shaping the future of generative AI? The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 triggered an explosion of news, opinion pieces, and social media posts addressing these questions. Yet many are not aware of the current and historical body of academic work that offers clarity, substance, and nuance to enrich the discourse.
Linking the terms “AI” and “education” invites a constellation of discussions. This selection of articles is hardly comprehensive, but it includes explanations of AI concepts and provides historical context for today’s systems. It describes a range of possible educational applications as well as adverse impacts, such as learning loss and increased inequity. Some articles touch on philosophical questions about AI in relation to learning, thinking, and human communication. Others will help educators prepare students for civic participation around concerns including information integrity, impacts on jobs, and energy consumption. Yet others outline educator and student rights in relation to AI and exhort educators to share their expertise in societal and industry discussions on the future of AI.
Nabeel Gillani, Rebecca Eynon, Catherine Chiabaut, and Kelsey Finkel, “Unpacking the ‘Black Box’ of AI in Education,” Educational Technology & Society 26, no. 1 (2023): 99–111.
Whether we’re aware of it or not, AI was already widespread in education before ChatGPT. Nabeel Gillani et al. describe AI applications such as learning analytics and adaptive learning systems, automated communications with students, early warning systems, and automated writing assessment. They seek to help educators develop literacy around the capacities and risks of these systems by providing an accessible introduction to machine learning and deep learning as well as rule-based AI. They present a cautious view, calling for scrutiny of bias in such systems and inequitable distribution of risks and benefits. They hope that engineers will collaborate deeply with educators on the development of such systems.
Jürgen Rudolph, Samson Tan, and Shannon Tan, “ChatGPT: Bullshit Spewer or the End of Traditional Assessments in Higher Education?” The Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching 6, no. 1 (January 24, 2023).
Jürgen Rudolph et al. give a practically oriented overview of ChatGPT’s implications for higher education. They explain the statistical nature of large language models as they tell the history of OpenAI and its attempts to mitigate bias and risk in the development of ChatGPT. They illustrate ways ChatGPT can be used with examples and screenshots. Their literature review shows the state of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) as of January 2023. An extensive list of challenges and opportunities culminates in a set of recommendations that emphasizes explicit policy as well as expanding digital literacy education to include AI.
Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angela McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell, “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜,” FAccT ’21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (March 2021): 610–623.
Student and faculty understanding of the risks and impacts of large language models is central to AI literacy and civic participation around AI policy. This hugely influential paper details documented and likely adverse impacts of the current data-and-resource-intensive, non-transparent mode of development of these models. Bender et al. emphasize the ways in which these costs will likely be borne disproportionately by marginalized groups. They call for transparency around the energy use and cost of these models as well as transparency around the data used to train them. They warn that models perpetuate and even amplify human biases and that the seeming coherence of these systems’ outputs can be used for malicious purposes even though it doesn’t reflect real understanding.
The authors argue that inclusive participation in development can encourage alternate development paths that are less resource intensive. They further argue that beneficial applications for marginalized groups, such as improved automatic speech recognition systems, must be accompanied by plans to mitigate harm.
Erik Brynjolfsson, “The Turing Trap: The Promise & Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 272–87.
Erik Brynjolfsson argues that when we think of artificial intelligence as aiming to substitute for human intelligence, we miss the opportunity to focus on how it can complement and extend human capabilities. Brynjolfsson calls for policy that shifts AI development incentives away from automation toward augmentation. Automation is more likely to result in the elimination of lower-level jobs and in growing inequality. He points educators toward augmentation as a framework for thinking about AI applications that assist learning and teaching. How can we create incentives for AI to support and extend what teachers do rather than substituting for teachers? And how can we encourage students to use AI to extend their thinking and learning rather than using AI to skip learning?
Kevin Scott, “I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Work & Scale,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 75–84.
Brynjolfsson’s focus on AI as “augmentation” converges with Microsoft computer scientist Kevin Scott’s focus on “cognitive assistance.” Steering discussion of AI away from visions of autonomous systems with their own goals, Scott argues that near-term AI will serve to help humans with cognitive work. Scott situates this assistance in relation to evolving historical definitions of work and the way in which tools for work embody generalized knowledge about specific domains. He’s intrigued by the way deep neural networks can represent domain knowledge in new ways, as seen in the unexpected coding capabilities offered by OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, which have enabled people with less technical knowledge to code. His article can help educators frame discussions of how students should build knowledge and what knowledge is still relevant in contexts where AI assistance is nearly ubiquitous.
Laura D. Tyson and John Zysman, “Automation, AI & Work,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 256–71.
How can educators prepare students for future work environments integrated with AI and advise students on how majors and career paths may be affected by AI automation? And how can educators prepare students to participate in discussions of government policy around AI and work? Laura Tyson and John Zysman emphasize the importance of policy in determining how economic gains due to AI are distributed and how well workers weather disruptions due to AI. They observe that recent trends in automation and gig work have exacerbated inequality and reduced the supply of “good” jobs for low- and middle-income workers. They predict that AI will intensify these effects, but they point to the way collective bargaining, social insurance, and protections for gig workers have mitigated such impacts in countries like Germany. They argue that such interventions can serve as models to help frame discussions of intelligent labor policies for “an inclusive AI era.”
Todd C. Helmus, Artificial Intelligence, Deepfakes, and Disinformation: A Primer (RAND Corporation, 2022). 
Educators’ considerations of academic integrity and AI text can draw on parallel discussions of authenticity and labeling of AI content in other societal contexts. Artificial intelligence has made deepfake audio, video, and images as well as generated text much more difficult to detect as such. Here, Todd Helmus considers the consequences to political systems and individuals as he offers a review of the ways in which these can and have been used to promote disinformation. He considers ways to identify deepfakes and ways to authenticate provenance of videos and images. Helmus advocates for regulatory action, tools for journalistic scrutiny, and widespread efforts to promote media literacy. As well as informing discussions of authenticity in educational contexts, this report might help us shape curricula to teach students about the risks of deepfakes and unlabeled AI.
William Hasselberger, “Can Machines Have Common Sense?” The New Atlantis 65 (2021): 94–109.
Students, by definition, are engaged in developing their cognitive capacities; their understanding of their own intelligence is in flux and may be influenced by their interactions with AI systems and by AI hype. In his review of The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do by Erik J. Larson, William Hasselberger warns that in overestimating AI’s ability to mimic human intelligence we devalue the human and overlook human capacities that are integral to everyday life decision making, understanding, and reasoning. Hasselberger provides examples of both academic and everyday common-sense reasoning that continue to be out of reach for AI. He provides a historical overview of debates around the limits of artificial intelligence and its implications for our understanding of human intelligence, citing the likes of Alan Turing and Marvin Minsky as well as contemporary discussions of data-driven language models.
Gwo-Jen Hwang and Nian-Shing Chen, “Exploring the Potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education: Applications, Challenges, and Future Research Directions,” Educational Technology & Society 26, no. 2 (2023).
Gwo-Jen Hwang and Nian-Shing Chen are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of incorporating generative AI into education. They outline a variety of roles a large language model like ChatGPT might play, from student to tutor to peer to domain expert to administrator. For example, educators might assign students to “teach” ChatGPT on a subject. Hwang and Chen provide sample ChatGPT session transcripts to illustrate their suggestions. They share prompting techniques to help educators better design AI-based teaching strategies. At the same time, they are concerned about student overreliance on generative AI. They urge educators to guide students to use it critically and to reflect on their interactions with AI. Hwang and Chen don’t touch on concerns about bias, inaccuracy, or fabrication, but they call for further research into the impact of integrating generative AI on learning outcomes.

Lauren Goodlad and Samuel Baker, “Now the Humanities Can Disrupt ‘AI’,” Public Books (February 20, 2023).
Lauren Goodlad and Samuel Baker situate both academic integrity concerns and the pressures on educators to “embrace” AI in the context of market forces. They ground their discussion of AI risks in a deep technical understanding of the limits of predictive models at mimicking human intelligence. Goodlad and Baker urge educators to communicate the purpose and value of teaching with writing to help students engage with the plurality of the world and communicate with others. Beyond the classroom, they argue, educators should question tech industry narratives and participate in public discussion on regulation and the future of AI. They see higher education as resilient: academic skepticism about former waves of hype around MOOCs, for example, suggests that educators will not likely be dazzled or terrified into submission to AI. Goodlad and Baker hope we will instead take up our place as experts who should help shape the future of the role of machines in human thought and communication.
Kathryn Conrad, “Sneak Preview: A Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights for Education,” Critical AI 2.1 (July 17, 2023).
How can the field of education put the needs of students and scholars first as we shape our response to AI, the way we teach about it, and the way we might incorporate it into pedagogy? Kathryn Conrad’s manifesto builds on and extends the Biden administration’s Office of Science and Technology Policy 2022 “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.” Conrad argues that educators should have input into institutional policies on AI and access to professional development around AI. Instructors should be able to decide whether and how to incorporate AI into pedagogy, basing their decisions on expert recommendations and peer-reviewed research. Conrad outlines student rights around AI systems, including the right to know when AI is being used to evaluate them and the right to request alternate human evaluation. They deserve detailed instructor guidance on policies around AI use without fear of reprisals. Conrad maintains that students should be able to appeal any charges of academic misconduct involving AI, and they should be offered alternatives to any AI-based assignments that might put their creative work at risk of exposure or use without compensation. Both students’ and educators’ legal rights must be respected in any educational application of automated generative systems.

Published: Sep 07, 2023 03:33 PM ESTShubhangi Duaa year ago0ShareGenerative AI to replace jobs as soon as 2030Moor Studio / iStock A new report published by Forrester forecasted the future impact of generative artificial intelligence and how the technology will mainly impact white-collar jobs. 
The report description of generative AI stated:
“A set of technologies and techniques that leverage massive corpuses of data, including large language models, to generate new content (e.g., text, video, images, audio, code). Inputs may be natural language prompts or other non-code and nontraditional inputs.” Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

Forrester alluded to the finding, noting that the technology will replace approximately 2.4 million jobs in the United States by 2030, implying that humans will not be necessary for these tasks and that automated technology will take over. 
Impacting white-collar jobs
Additionally, generative AI may influence another 11 million jobs in the US. The report emphasized that white-collar jobs will be mainly affected. The roles that could be at risk include technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, copywriters, and those in administrative positions.
“Let’s be clear: Generative AI is coming after white-collar jobs,” the report added. “Automation and AI overall will replace 4.9 percent of US jobs by 2030.”
They predicted a loss of 0.6 percent loss owing to automation through 2030. Emphasizing that automation will supersede jobs that are harder to fill, such as in the case of physical robotics being employed to aid frontline workers in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, Generative AI intends to make up nearly 30 percent of the jobs lost to automation by 2030. “Generative AI will make up a growing percentage of all US jobs lost to automation and AI, climbing from 9.3 percent of jobs lost to automation and AI overall in 2023 to 30.4 percent by 2030,” the report noted.
However, job losses in the next two years will most likely remain subtle until questions on intellectual property rights, copyright, plagiarism, model refresh rates, model bias, ethics, and model response reliability are resolved. 
Human-based roles are still necessary
Although, Forrester highlighted that the technology’s potential could also lead to poor performance. For instance, models like ChatGPT often generate “coherent nonsense,” which brings issues of inconsistent customer service to light and as a result, they need to be fixed manually.
The Register cautioned: “Companies will need to hire new, potentially scarce, and expensive talent — developers, business analysts, prompt engineers, even ethicists. The market for this talent will be tight. On the other side, you might lose valuable legacy talent if the pace of change is too fast.”RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

It’s also possible in some scenarios that automating tasks may yield subpar results but companies may still feel compelled to embrace AI. Firms will have to identify jobs that benefit most from automation to integrate generative AI smoothly. 
Employees will have to be trained in skills like prompt engineering and refining input to achieve specific outcomes.
The report stated: “[Enterprises] won’t be able to plan for every contingency, but [they] can build a workforce generative AI strategy that better prepares [them] for the Wild West of generative AI at work. [Their] strategy should include investments, guardrails, and checkpoints.”

      Key Takeaways    



        Product teams can let AI do the legwork for them.
      


        AI helps customer teams create responsive, tailored experiences.
      









    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

The parabolic growth of accessible AI tools has intriguing implications for businesses. Analysts imagine that generative AI, for example, will have a massive impact on productivity across multiple business functions. Many organizations are scanning the horizon for a long-term AI-fueled transformation, eager to make the most of bullish CAGR projections. And while leaders mustn't lose sight of long-term goals, staring out too far into the future may be overwhelming — distracting, even.Rather than redesign their business' entire approach just to meet AI somewhere along the horizon, leaders can instead take a more practical route and ask how AI can improve their current strategy. Can AI accelerate current tactics? Can it help teams do things better? Can it help organizations reach their goals with less overhead? The answer, especially regarding product, customer success and internal processes, is overwhelmingly ""yes.""Related: The Robots Are Coming — But They Can't Outsmart Us When It Comes To This Particular Skill.



Product teams can let AI do the legwork for themAI's impact on product development begins with the nitty gritty. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can help teams with everything from documentation to marketing briefs and website content. My team has leveraged AI for these very purposes, letting AI rewrite code into additional languages once we create the initial sample code. Humans are still an essential part of the process, but AI helps provide a kickstart.Tech companies have taken AI a step further, embedding it into their products. AI represents both a tremendous opportunity and a threat for security solutions providers. Bad actors have new tool sets that enable them to create more sophisticated attacks faster and more intelligently. Cyber product teams use the same tools to defend against emerging threats and offer in-product help to ensure their customers are more productive, better informed and ultimately satisfied with the experience.


Non-tech companies should be thinking about the experience around their products, and, indeed, many are. Car manufacturers use AI to enhance their collision-detection systems. Healthcare solutions providers embed AI in their diagnostics and imaging products. Nike uses AI to power its product personalization efforts.AI helps customer teams create responsive, tailored experiencesCustomer-experience chatbots have been around for a long time, but concerns about data privacy, unnatural language and unhelpful results have kept them from becoming ubiquitous. Recent advancements have helped fine-tune chatbots such that they can answer questions more efficiently and accurately than a support desk person. AI-enhanced chatbots have helped transform these experiences from feeling like an impersonal human replacement to a better and more responsible customer experience, yet some consumers are still wary. Most will use chatbots, provided there is always an option to transfer to a live agent.Chatbots aren't the only way organizations can infuse their customer experience with AI. Many companies effectively employ powerful data analytics, feeding valuable purchase and customer data into algorithms that help create ever-evolving seamless, personalized omnichannel experiences – think about how Spotify recommends new songs based on listeners' history and allows them to switch from one device to the next easily.AI allows everyone to escape process mundanityFor both product and customer experience teams, much of the AI magic happens behind the scenes. Chances are those teams are also using intelligent tools to automate workflows and speed up processes so that people can do their jobs more effectively. Teams for nearly any business function can use AI to do everything from creating images for a slide presentation to drafting website content and writing documentation.


Leaders interested in process-focused AI can begin by asking, ""How can AI help deliver a product or service more effectively?"" and ""What are we spending time on that AI could/should be doing?"" By leaning into existing tools, such as those that Microsoft, Google and OpenAI provide, organizations can simplify mundane tasks involved in creating documents, spreadsheets and slide decks to free up their workforce for more creative and mission-critical work.Related: Automation Is Becoming a Business Imperative: Don't Wait Until It's Too LateAI: the ultimate means to achieving business goalsOn my product management team, we're exploring all facets of our roles and asking ourselves how AI can help us spend more time analyzing information instead of gathering and summarizing it. This approach has been a tremendous shortcut for some components of our research and is a helpful way to think about AI as it relates to our company's trajectory. When we ask how AI can help us fulfill our goals, we stay focused rather than become distracted navigating to some nebulous AI-enabled future along the horizon.Making AI work for us — not the other way around — is also a useful reminder that modern intelligent tools aren't here to replace employees. In fact, a human in the loop is critical, regardless of AI's application. Product teams must validate AI's documentation; customer experience teams need to review modeling output for errors and continue to interact with customers when the time comes.


The next time you make a decision about AI, remember that it is just a practical means to achieving business goals and not the end goal in and of itself.

Generative AI expected to replace 2+ million US jobs by 2030, those with higher education and wages more at risk
""Let's be clear: generative AI is coming after white collar jobs""

Forward-looking: Another study on the effect generative AI will have on jobs has been carried out, and it's a familiar story for white-collar workers: the technology will replace 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2030 and influence 11 million more. The (slightly) good news is that those job losses represent a lower figure than what many others have predicted. 
Analyst firm Forrester's 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast offers a similar conclusion to IBM's recent study: that while generative AI is going to cost many people their jobs, it will augment more roles than replace them. Forrester notes that 4.5 times more jobs will be ""influenced"" by the tech, which it defines as reshaping, retraining, and upskilling existing workers to incorporate generative AI tools into the daily workflow.
In the part of the report titled 'Let's Be Clear: Generative AI is Coming After White Collar Jobs,' it's stated that automation and AI overall will replace 4.9% of US jobs by 2030, with generative AI making up 30% (2.4 million) of those lost jobs. The likes of ChatGPT are predicted to replace 90,000 jobs in 2023, representing 9.3% of all jobs lost to automation and AI this year.

As we've heard before, the jobs most at risk of being impacted by generative AI include technical writers, social science researchers, research assistants, proofreaders, and copywriters. Harder-to-automate jobs with high generative AI influence, such as editors, writers, authors and poets, lyricists, and creative writers, are more likely to influence how jobs are conducted (via augmentation) rather than replace them.
Another finding is that the more education a worker has, the higher the influence generative AI will have on their job. Occupations with lower educational requirements like transportation and warehousing, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing will see less job influence, while those requiring bachelor's degrees or higher are going to see the biggest disruption.

It's a similar trend with wages: workers who earn under $60,000 are going to be less impacted than those earning $90,000 or more.
Job losses from generative AI are expected to be modest over the next couple of years as issues surrounding the tools are addressed, such as intellectual property rights, copyright claims, and plagiarism.

Forrester warns of potential AI roadblocks such as the prospect of generative AI producing ""coherent nonsense"" and the massive backlash against these systems from the public, as was seen with the Secret Invasion TV show's opening credits and the D&D book illustrations.
One of the earliest studies claimed generative AI could affect 300 million jobs globally. Forrester's conclusion is more optimistic, but it does warn that some workers will lose jobs they need, creating deep social challenges like those faced in the postindustrial Rust Belt. It's no wonder many tech execs are turning to drink and drugs to cope with the stress.

Greg Meyers has run tech and digital for three multi-billion-dollar revenue companies, including Motorola Solutions and at Syngenta Group. He is as deeply curious as he is deeply technical. For the past year and a half, Meyers has been the Executive Vice President and Chief Digital & Technology Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). During the December holidays of 2022, he jumped into the deep end with a technology that he had only dipped his toe in the water to explore in the few weeks prior: ChatGPT 3.5. At the end of last year, few had delved deeply into OpenAI’s product, as the tool that would kick off a revolution was only released on November 30. The major uptick in adoption would occur early in 2023. The holiday break provided Meyers just the right amount of time to explore this more thoroughly, aiding him in getting better acquainted with the solution and, by extension, the opportunity it might present. “I would say after maybe an hour or two of using it, I knew this was probably the biggest breakthrough we've seen since at least the iPhone,” he underscored.


Meyers has long believed that tech and digital leads must model the curiosity and experimentation that are the basic ingredients of innovation. Rather than rely on consultancies or the start-up community to define these opportunities, he is inclined to get his hands dirty, figuratively speaking, to draw his own conclusions. Given how long he and his team have been immersed in generative artificial intelligence solutions, they have had time to draw conclusions about their relative merits and risks.

The first opportunity he identified was document review. “Our industry is a very document-intensive industry,” he said. “Think about clinical trials and studies and essays and publications. Being able to get a relatively simple answer to a complicated question that may exists in a document somewhere or in someone's head could take days to find the right person who knows where the right document is, to know where to look to get the answer to the question.” Meyers’ team has put tens of thousands of documents in the large language model to be queried. The results are fast and remarkably accurate.

The second opportunity has been to take data that is in tabular form, perhaps related to a clinical trial, and have generative AI convert it into a narrative that can be stored and leveraged more easily. There is still a “human in the loop,” as members of Meyers’ team remain involved to ensure that the data is accurate. A primary value of this, however, is speed, as the standard processes would often take days, and that has been reduced to less than a minute in many cases.

The third area of value that has Meyers excited has been in research. “If you think of computational pharmacology, which is creating medicines, large language models are directly translated in protein expression. Protein sequences are a lot like a human language. They're represented by a string of letters. In our industry parlance, we have protein motifs and domains. These are the functional building blocks of how proteins come together to be able to do some mechanical action in the body. In many ways, these two things are akin to words or phrases in a human language. We're doing quite a bit of work in trying to see how useful they can be in helping us understand how proteins might fold or interact with other proteins as part of our ongoing work to do new drug design and drug discovery.”

Meyers has also been impressed with how generative AI can make human programmers more productive. “A human being that knows coding well can go through and debug and paste code together,” he said. “[Generative AI] does a nice job in helping you debug human errors, pasting in code. For sure, this is something that I think is going to take an average developer and make them 10 times more productive eventually.” In many ways, generative AI will act as a junior member of the team. The AI can do more menial and repeatable tasks, and it is learning more sophisticated methods, as well, but the human remains essential for purposes of context and nuance that the AI cannot yet grasp.

Meyers understands the necessity of incorporating guardrails for the team to ensure that generative AI is used both responsibly and effectively. He has taken a three-pronged approach to mitigating the risk associated with it. First, his team has developed a responsible AI policy, which is a set of guidelines that help practitioners figure out how to practice AI in a responsible way. Meyers believes that by keeping a human in the loop, by regularly cross-checking work for bias, and by monitoring compliance, risks can be reduced to an appropriate level.
Second, his team has created an internal version of ChatGPT to avoid issues of sensitive data residing in public large language models. “We built our own ChatGPT inside Microsoft Azure using ChatGPT's APIs, which offers us the ability for every employee in the company to experiment in terms of how these tools can help make them be more productive, but they don't need to be nervous about where the data goes,” Meyers highlighted. “Building this internal tool gives people the flexibility to be able to do that without worrying about where the data goes because of the agreements we have in place with Microsoft.”
Third, Meyers has created what he refers to as a “community of practice,” which he calls the AI Collective. “It's a group of practitioners from across the company,” he said. “This includes research development, product supply and manufacturing, commercial, business insights and analytics. All these different groups, including IT, they all work together to do two things. First, to be an internal advisory board answering questions like, ‘Should we either be contributing to or taking from the open-source world?’ These are very important questions we'll have to face over the next couple of years, but then also acting as a voluntary group of people who can work on projects that may pop up somewhere in the organization, like finance where maybe they don't have a lot of AI practitioners, but other people in the organization would be willing to work on projects that are important to them.”
Meyers is crowdsourcing ideas from across the company to determine if there are existing processes that have the potential to improve by ten times through the use of artificial intelligence either through productivity, speed, or efficiency improvements. The solution may not always be generative AI, and it need not be incumbent on the non-technologists to know the solution to be used. “Put forward those ideas and then leave it to the experts to figure out whether it's a Bayesian classifier or it's machine learning or it's a deep learning or it's a neural network, for example,” he offered. The practitioners outside of the digital and tech organization need not focus on the solution. He advises his colleagues to focus on the job that needs to be done, and let the experts help guide which is the right tool for the right job.
To further separate hype from reality, Meyers advises staying close with one’s peers to understand use cases that are emerging. Their ideas may not directly apply, but by understanding what other chief information officers are doing to take advantage of generative AI, more ideas will bubble up.
Meyers closed the conversation by noting that he believes that he is seeing history repeat itself a bit with generative artificial intelligence, again returning to the analogy of the iPhone and its release in 2007. At the time, it was banned by many companies as a security risk to the enterprise. “Then we [CIOs] stood in front of that freight train,” he said. “There was a history of CIOs standing in front of these freight trains. I think that when you're able to experiment, the first thing you try to do is control it. We tend to worry about cost, control, security. There's a handful of things that we always traditionally work around. I think that the two lessons are you just have to go and see. Is it really going to be useful? Is the benefit worth the risk? There's a risk-benefit equation. Then you have to try to quickly find a way to channel the enthusiasm. Because if you just try to block it and a lot of IT companies blocked the iPhone just like they're blocking ChatGPT, it's sort of like sticking your head in the sand. It's not like employees aren't going to use it on their own. What you want to do is lean in and say, ‘Okay, this genie's not going back in the bottle.’ You just have to create a framework where people can experiment in a way that's both safe and effective.”

Forrester: AI will influence way more jobs than it replaces



By Jill Barth

September 8, 2023 

According to a new report from Forrester Research, “AI injects both magic and mayhem into the future of work.” That’s a poetic way of saying that AI is creating both disruption and solutions in the same space right now, and for HR leaders, that space is the workplace.

Forrester’s paper, 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast, U.S., emphasizes that while generative AI is expected to eliminate some jobs, exponentially more will be advantageously influenced by this technology. From robot bartenders in Las Vegas to chatbots that give faulty advice to the “Iron Man suit for recruiters,” the news cycle is full of anecdotes and data about generative AI taking over. 
However, the Forrester report supports the viewpoint that most jobs will still need people, but that—for many—their work will be augmented by AI. This methodology is based on public financial documents and executive interviews, as well as Forrester’s proprietary primary research and surveys. 
Investments in genAI
Forrester analysts predict that “generative AI will influence 4.5 times more jobs than it replaces” and that by 2030, the tech will augment more than 11 million U.S. jobs. Often, influence will manifest as enhancements to vendor offerings, they say. This was clearly demonstrated by the Top HR Tech products submissions the HRE team tested this summer. It’s been less than a year since the introduction of ChatGPT and investment in generative AI tools has soared and is expected to continue. Data from CBInsights reveals there are now 13 genAI unicorns ($1 billion-plus valuations), and that they reached this status about twice as fast as other unicorn companies.
According to Forrester, 55% of the AI software market will be centered on generative tools by 2030. Already, HR tech vendors are proposing embedded generative AI functions to chat with employees in a conversational tone, generate job descriptions to target needed skills, transcribe interviews, create emails to candidates, develop collaborative insights and offers answers and suggestions based on complex documents. It’s all work that can augment HR professionals’ current jobs.
There have been stark predictions about genAI. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs suggested that 300 million full-time jobs could be automated. However, as noted by the Forrester report, concrete evidence for these predictions in real-world job data has yet to be proven. “Exaggerated forecasts, heart-wrenching anecdotes, general panic—it can be hard to see the scope of the fire amid all this smoke,” write report authors. “Only through analysis grounded in the most robust data can we understand the impact generative AI will have on jobs.”
Tech and skills management
According to Forrester’s predictions, individuals in roles requiring “judgment, insight and moral reasoning” are less likely to see their jobs replaced by generative AI. This aligns with the skillset typically possessed by HR leaders and executives, many of whom are now at the forefront of devising strategies to implement generative AI for their teams, colleagues and organizations. In fact, HR is largely the function tasked with evaluating vendor offerings, recruiting individuals with the necessary skills to work with AI and distributing its benefits throughout the organization.
HR leaders have been advised to hire and upskill workers with generative AI expertise. This summer, a report issued by the McKinsey Global Institute indicated that workforce development would necessitate that HR professionals expand their hiring approach. The report suggests that “employers will need to hire for skills and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as rural workers and people with disabilities) and provide training that keeps pace with their evolving needs.”

Forrester analysts also predict that vendor offerings will impact employees: “It’ll change how users in a majority of roles in most industries do everyday things like write emails, build spreadsheets and put together presentations.” Forward-thinking HR tech vendors anticipated this shift and continue to enhance their products accordingly. Steve Boese, program chair of the HR Technology Conference and co-founder of H3 HR Advisors, notes, “The skills conversations have led to more development and innovation in many of the core areas of talent management like learning, succession planning, career pathing and more.”
Currently, researchers say, it is premature for many organizations to cut jobs with the expectation that generative AI can serve as a substitute. While the technology may seem ready, there is still a need to identify individuals with the right skills to drive employee success, business sustainability and end-user satisfaction.

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Director, finance, banking and insurance industry, 1,000 - 5,000 employeesI have mixed feelings as the use of AI reduced the need for authentic expression, yet the candidate who uses AI demonstrates tech literacy.VP, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, 1,000 - 5,000 employeesThe majority of HR professionals report the benefits of GenAI in the hiring process outweigh the risks, and most report their organization will be increasing investments over the next 12 months22% of respondents report investments in GenAI for their hiring process will significantly increase at their organization over the next 12 months.

Artificial Intelligence Likely To Augment, Not Destroy Jobs – OpEd

The growing new global phenomenon—Artificial Intelligence (AI)—has sparked both positive and negative reactions, including a perceived threat that it will eventually replace humans in most workplaces.





But a new study, Generative AI and Jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality, points out that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT.
The study, released on August 21 by the Geneva-based International Labour Organization (ILO), says the greatest impact of this technology is likely to be “not job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity, and autonomy”.
Clerical work had the most significant technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure.
In other occupational groups—including managers, professionals, and technicians—only a tiny share of tasks were highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.
The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.





Among its findings: about 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4 per cent of employment.
On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries, according to the study.
Robert Whitfield, Chair of the Transnational Working Group on AI of the World Federalist Movement / Institute for Global Policy, told IDN it a serious study, indicating a shift in jobs under threat from repetitive, low-skilled jobs to knowledge jobs.
“Whilst it might appear to be good news for developing countries, the study assumes that the tasks being assessed would be executed in high-income countries—and therefore with the economic gap between developed and developing countries widening,” said Whitfield, who is also Chair of the One World Trust.
The study also points out that the potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.
This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
Socioeconomic impacts 
The study concludes that the socioeconomic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed, and it argues the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair, and consultative transition.
“Workers’ voice, skills training, and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.
The authors also note that the “outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans behind the decision to incorporate such technologies, and humans need to guide the transition process”.
Meanwhile, the United Nations is developing “a Code of Conduct for Information Integrity on Digital Platforms”—ahead of the UN Summit of the Future scheduled to take place in September 2024.
“The Code of Conduct will be a set of principles that we hope governments, digital platforms and other stakeholders will implement voluntarily,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters on June 12.
The proposals in this policy brief, in preparation for the Code, include:
– A commitment by Governments, tech companies and other stakeholders to refrain from using, supporting, or amplifying disinformation and hate speech for any purpose.
– A pledge by Governments to guarantee a free, viable, independent, and plural media landscape with strong protections for journalists.
– The consistent application of policies and resources by digital platforms worldwide to eliminate double standards that allow hate speech and disinformation to flourish in some languages and countries while they are prevented more effectively in others.
– And agreed protocols for a rapid response by governments and digital platforms when the stakes are highest—in times of conflict and high social tensions.
– Plus, a commitment from digital platforms to ensure all products account for safety, privacy, and transparency.
Citing a report from the Center for AI Safety, the New York Times reported on May 31 that a group of over 350 AI industry leaders warned that artificial intelligence poses a growing new danger to humanity and should be considered a “societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars”.
“We must take those warnings seriously. Our proposed Global Digital Compact, New Agenda for Peace, and Accord on the global governance of AI will offer multilateral solutions based on human rights,” Guterres said.
“But the advent of generative AI must not distract us from the damage digital technology already does to our world. The proliferation of hate and lies in the digital space is causing grave global harm—now. It is fueling conflict, death, and destruction—now. It is threatening democracy and human rights—now. It is undermining public health and climate action—now,” he warned.
Meanwhile, the Paris-based UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) calls on governments to implement appropriate regulations and teacher training to ensure a human-centered approach to using Generative AI in education.
To this end, the agency has published its first global Guidance on Generative AI in Education and Research, designed to address the disruptions caused by Generative AI technologies.
UNESCO said that generative AI can be an opportunity for human development but can also cause harm and prejudice. It adds that it cannot be integrated into education without public engagement and the necessary safeguards and regulations from governments.

Cognitive technologies are already at the forefront of a significant change in the conception and execution of work processes in organizations. Organizations are using these technologies more frequently as they radically reinvent their work architectures. In the post-COVID world, defining work would depend heavily on leveraging these technologies. Cloud-based solutions now serve as the foundation of every IT toolkit. From the standpoint of the employee experience, businesses are seeking to improve workplace security while simultaneously changing how they provide services to their customers through more surveillance and expedited processes. The world therefore will be about finding the right balance between human intervention and technology. Automation cannot replace humansThere is a widespread misconception that automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is aiming to replace the workforce. However, this is untrue. Businesses must consider how to incorporate AI into current procedures since it offers enormous potential for expansion. A successful human-automation strategy takes into account how AI and automation can improve the customer experience while also empowering employees. The need to realign the current talent acquisition and management procedures in multiple ways is a result of companies looking for new tactics for acquiring and retaining people.Reallocation: As expectations and skill sets evolve, it will be necessary to reallocate the workforce. Employers can remap their current workforce to meet changing demands in new technological fields by using individuals with higher levels of ability. People with finer skills and relatively more work experience, working in professions that don't harness these attributes will have to reposition themselves, while those with more creative ability may move to suitable departments. Or, a given job's tasks can be divided and reorganized in various ways, either by redesigning company procedures or lateral shifting the staff to match the skill and demand better.Reskilling: The ability of employees to reskill will determine the success of the future workforce, and businesses must make significant investments in educating and training their staff in cutting-edge technologies and specialized digital fields so that they can take on difficult tasks. For individuals aiming to maximize automation and AI, advanced IT skills, coding knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving talents are crucial.Recruiting: The need for competent workers may outpace their supply in many areas. By introducing intelligent matching criteria, AI can be utilized to speed up the process of employing workers who have received the necessary training. Matching staffing needs with skills outside of the current portfolio will also be possible. Freelancers and gig workers can provide pre-made skills right now, but this is only useful for non-core or temporary needs.Drawing the line between automation and workforceThe widespread use of automation and AI has resulted in the creation of around 97 million new employees. In contrast, the division of labor between people and machines will result in the displacement of 85 million job roles by 2025. This puts forth a huge opportunity for businesses to clear the line between automation and workforce. They must use workplace data to make wise decisions and prevent automation-related job losses. They must use AI tools in areas where employees are wasting time and contributing little to the bottom line. It is also crucial to establish a new hybrid workforce culture in which data and technology are regarded as tools that help people and not enslave them or make them obsolete. This will grow more challenging as AI becomes smarter and more thoroughly integrated into every element of a business. Balancing technology and workforceAlthough automation can increase production while requiring less labor, technology is not always the ideal solution. Humans may not be as quick or efficient at some things, but their skill set is considerably more varied and dynamic. Robots, on the other hand, excel at executing a single task. Technology can help us with work-related duties, but it can also make some tasks more difficult, such as managing a remote workforce that is dispersed around the globe. Just as technology can raise friction and distance between employees and employers, it can also exacerbate issues between companies and their customers. Paradoxically, achieving the ideal balance of technology and human interaction in the future will need careful use of technology, not just to reduce transaction costs but also to provide long-term value for businesses and worthwhile employment for people. Technology is bound to render certain tasks obsolete. However, we don't need to be alarmed by this reality. Instead of attempting to thwart progress, we should concentrate on wisely utilizing technology.The removal of people from the process is not possible through automation. Instead, technology gives us various opportunities to work ""smarter."" By having computers do the manual labor while humans take on more intellectually demanding tasks in the process, we have the opportunity to increase human productivity. We can all benefit from a more productive society that is also better educated and happier if we let technology operate in this way. This is the reason why this isn't just a post-pandemic phenomenon; it's the tale of the workplace of the future, one that will be propelled by employee empowerment.(Views expressed are personal)","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ettelecom.com

In fact, according to the most re&shy;cent research and market surveys, by 2025, AI will increase annual&shy;ly at a rate of 52%, meaning that businesses all over the world will adopt it swiftly. National securi&shy;ty, healthcare, logistics, and ed&shy;ucation are just a handful of the sectors using AI right now. The World Economic Forum estimates that automation in the developing world might result in the loss of two-thirds of jobs. The population of Pakistan and the stability of its government may be significantly impacted by this. Another factor that may in&shy;crease the negative impacts of job loss due to AI automation is Paki&shy;stan&rsquo;s lack of access to education and technology. It is crucial to re&shy;member that the influence of gen&shy;erative AI on the labour market in Pakistan is likely to be complicat&shy;ed and multidimensional and will depend on a range of factors, in&shy;cluding the particular industries and job categories in question as well as governmental policies and regulations.

It can boost productiv&shy;ity in manufacturing and agricul&shy;ture by automating specialised op&shy;erations like data processing and decision-making. Increased pro&shy;ductivity and economic expansion may result from this. Additional&shy;ly, the application of generative AI in developing nations can open up new job prospects in AI-relat&shy;ed industries like data analysis, software development, and ma&shy;chine learning in Pakistan, where unemployment is already high. It can also aid in enhancing school&shy;ing. For students, it can be uti&shy;lised to design tailored learning experiences. This could result in better educational achievements and more people having access to school in developing nations. It&rsquo;s crucial to keep in mind that the beneficial effects of generative AI in Pakistan will be influenced by the availability of resources like ener&shy;gy, internet connectivity, and a com&shy;petent workforce, as well as by gov&shy;ernmental rules and regulations. A few countries are making signifi&shy;cant investments in AI. Developed nations are gaining an advantage by moving first. Pakistan should, there&shy;fore, work to provide a better set&shy;ting for the application of AI. Assailant kills 6 people and wounds 6 others at a care home in central Croatia, officials say ENGR.
