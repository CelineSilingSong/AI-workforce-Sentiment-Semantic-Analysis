During this ongoing pandemic, we've seen first-hand the urgent need to quickly analyze and interpret data on the spread of viruses around the world. Governments, global health bodies, academic research centers, and industry have come together to develop new ways that information can be collected, aggregated, and worked with. We’ve become used to seeing the results of this on the news every night, when the latest infection or death rates are given for our own regions.

Technological advancement is the main reason that this pandemic hasn’t (yet) killed as many as, for example, the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak that claimed up to 50 million lives. From advancement in medical technology and standards of care, to advances in communication technology that enabled outbreaks to be spotted more quickly and lockdowns imposed. Over the next year, AI will be added to the list of technological developments that are enabling us to more effectively deal with pandemics.

The growth in the amount of scientific and medical literature alone is enormous, with more than 28,000 papers published by April this year relating to Covid-19. A dedicated search engine powered by natural language processing (NLP) algorithms has already been made available, so anyone can get AI assistance when investigating this massive dataset.
Work is also ongoing to develop AI solutions to help deal with the huge backlog of other medical issues, such as cancer, where treatment has been affected as resources are diverted to fight Covid-19. Over the next year, we are likely to see the accelerated adoption of AI across many other areas of healthcare, not only related to tackling viruses.
 By developing our ability to apply machine learning problem-solving to these massive, real-time global datasets, we will spot outbreaks more easily, track contact between infected people, enable more accurate diagnoses, and, by predicting ways that a virus might evolve in the future, develop more effective and lasting vaccinations.

Automated Detection and Prevention
We have already seen the use of drones in several jurisdictions, including the US, to at least test the possibility that they can be used to monitor whether social distancing guidelines are being followed. More advanced applications are on the horizon – such as drones with the capability of detecting COVID symptoms such as high temperature in individuals within a crowd. These systems use computer vision technology to analyze data captured by cameras on the drones and inform authorities or local administrators of statistics and probabilities around the spread of the virus. 
Another related growth area will be the use of facial recognition technology, also powered by computer vision algorithms. Somewhat more controversial as it focuses on the identification of individuals, rather than patterns among groups of people, facial recognition has been used by police to detect lockdown and quarantine-avoiders, as well as to track the movements of individuals displaying symptoms within a crowd.
The evidence seems to suggest that the public has become more tolerant of surveillance tactics that would previously have been considered overly draconian, due to the health risks posed by the virus. This tolerance is likely to be further tested over the coming 18 months as technologists become more adept at AI-driven surveillance and even enforcement.

Business on the rebound – predicting behavioral transformation
The way we live, work, and socialize has been hugely impacted by the spread of Covid-19. While there has been a steady, strong trend towards digital in many aspects of society, this year, we’ve witnessed a stampede. Amazon’s sales during the second quarter of 2020 were up 40% on the same period last year, as even those who have so far shunned online retail were forced to re-assess their options.
AI tools and platforms are already in place to help businesses understand the way their customers are adapting to a new reality. Organizations that were previously lagging in their uptake of digital channels for commerce and relationship nurturing have come to understand the urgency of the situation and are quickly getting to grips with concepts such as behavioral analytics and personalization. Tools providing organizations with self-service access to this technology will become increasingly prevalent throughout 2021, as small and medium-sized enterprises are seeking to establish their competitive edge.

Shutting down the next pandemic before it even starts
Most AI algorithms are geared towards prediction, and the holy grail of AI-assisted epidemiology will be to build systems that can accurately predict when and where future outbreaks will take place. This research has been ongoing for some time, and in fact, some of the earliest alerts about the current outbreak were generated by AI. Toronto-based BlueDot’s tool was already scanning 100,000 governmental and media data sources daily when it issued an alert about a potential outbreak in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019.
We can expect AI research to yield further breakthroughs over the coming 18 months that will increase our ability to spot and react to the danger of viral outbreaks. For this to happen, though, it will also require ongoing global cooperation between governments and private industry. How this plays out will most likely be affected by global politics and legislators, as well as the course of technological development. For this reason, issues such as access to medical datasets and barriers to the international exchange of information will also be hot topics over the coming year.

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (A.I.) is expected to significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare in the near future. While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype around the topic is unprecedented1. There is a growing list of publications on the subject in the form of academic articles, health policy reports, statements from professional societies, and popular media coverage (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Number of medical A.I. studies by year from 2010 to 2020; and by medical specialties.a The number of studies as found on Pubmed.com using the search term)“machine learning” OR “deep learning”) and choosing a year in advanced search. b The same search method was used followed by (AND specialty) without specifying a time frame. The number in the circles determine how many studies we found.Full size imageA.I. has been used extensively in industries such as transportation, entertainment or IT during the last decade. It has been used to control self-driving vehicles; to trade on the stock market; social media platforms, web browsers and search engines. It is likely that the reader of this paper used some forms of A.I. today for more than an hour by using services such as Google Maps, Waze, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or Google Search, among a myriad of others. It has potentials in medicine, drug design and healthcare, yet, the proof and evidence are yet to be convincing enough for the general public and the medical community to adopt the technology2.The technology is still in its infancy and more studies are published each year than the year before. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful.There is no doubt that A.I. will have a beneficial role in healthcare and can penetrate the boundaries of adoption only if medical professionals serve as knowledgeable and supportive guides and leaders in the process3.For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities A.I. has. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I.We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as we attempt at providing a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice.Definition and levels of A.I.A.I. is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, among others. According to its simplest definition, artificial intelligence (A.I.) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. It is sometimes also described as “machines that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving”4.Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, described three major levels in the development of A.I. in his book Superintelligence (Fig. 25).Fig. 2: Levels of A.I.The three levels of A.I. as defined by Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence. The green dot indicates a theoretical threshold for what the ideal scenario would be.Full size imageArtificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)ANI already has incredible pattern recognizing abilities in huge data sets, which makes it perfect for solving text, voice, or image-based classification and clustering problems. It is an algorithm that can excel at a precisely defined, single task. It can play chess like nobody else ever, yet its IQ is zero.Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)one day could have a human being’s comprehensive and total cognitive capacity. This is human level A.I. It can reason, argue, memorize and solve issues like you doArtificial SuperIntelligence (ASI)theoretically could have humanity’s combined cognitive capacity or even more. Humanity, obviously, would not be able to grasp its knowledge and understand its reasoning. Many organizations work hard to avoid ever reaching this stage.How does A.I. work?A.I. works through a method called machine learning. As there are challenges and tasks so complicated in healthcare that writing traditional algorithms for solving those was not enough anymore, a new method was needed. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed6. If you feed the algorithm with enough data of good quality, machine learning allows them to create strategies for excelling at that particular task.If I want to write a program that can spot cats on photos, I had better turn to machine learning. The reasons why quickly become clear if you try to devise rules that such a program should be based on. How can you spot a cat in a photo? If you devise features you think easily depict cats such as having two ears, two eyes, four legs and such, you find yourself in a situation where you also have to define all these expressions. What is an ear for a program that only “sees” pixels on a photo?Therefore, the most efficient way is to feed a machine learning algorithm with images with cats on them, preferably with cats that have been annotated manually by human beings to make sure the images do contain cats. The more such annotated images we feed the algorithm with, the better it will become at recognizing cats on images. It will not understand what a cat is, but it will certainly recognize what we think are cats in photos like we do with an increasing and ruthless efficiency.No matter what task we aim to solve, we feed the simpler machine learning algorithms with data and constantly iterate how it digests it to become better at solving the task. With more complex algorithms such as neural networks and deep learning, it is possible that the algorithm starts creating its own rules and strategies without human input. From there, not even its developers might understand how it draws a conclusion or the strategy it uses to excel at a task.When it comes to technologies we use to make medical decisions, we like to understand the core of the machine or at least the physical/biological explanations behind it. In the case of advanced A.I.-based algorithms, it seems we will not be able to understand more than the theoretical basics.Real-life examples for the subtypes of machine learningMachine learning has many subtypes and combined methods, but we only feature the three major subtypes besides an advanced method, deep learning (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Visual guide to machine and deep learning subtypes.a In supervised learning, the teacher (developer) knows what he wants to teach to the child (A.I.), defines the expected answer and the child learns to excel at the task. b In unsupervised learning, the teacher does not influence how the child learns to play but observes the conclusions the child can draw from solving the task. c In reinforcement learning, the teacher knows what he wants to teach to the child but does not define step-by-step how the child should learn it. Instead, the teacher only gives feedback after the task is completed and asks the child to find out his own strategy using those outcomes the teacher rewarded. d In deep learning, it is possible to analyze vastly more complex data sets from images and videos to a sort of human reasoning. It is multi-layered and could mimic how neural networks in the brain work.Full size imageSupervised learningIs used when we can precisely define the task we want the algorithm to learn based on data that we already have. Let’s take the following example. We have two sets of medical records of patients, group A and B. In one set, we have family history, lab markers and other details with the diagnosis. In the other set, we have the same kinds of data but without the diagnosis. We would like to build a model that can learn to assign the right diagnosis to patients in group B based on the associations and labels the algorithm learns about in group A. It is like learning with a teacher because we know exactly what the algorithm should learn, and it is by far the most frequently used training mode.Unsupervised learningIs like learning without a teacher. We have a group of patients with different sets of data, but we do not know their individual diagnoses. We build a model, then to try to cluster patients based on similar attributes such as the symptoms they presented with, their lab markers or age and gender. We might learn new associations we have not looked at before. In another example, it can also be useful in clustering tissue samples based on similar gene expression values; or in finding novel drug-drug interactions. In summary, we devise certain rules, let the algorithm learn by itself and we do not modify the algorithm based on the outcome.Reinforcement learningAllows the algorithm to learn how to complete the tasks with a sequence of decisions by itself without being told how to do it. The teacher is only able to give feedback after a series of actions, not for each item as it does with supervised learning. The model starts performing the task only knowing some basic rules, and after failing or succeeding in completing the task, the teacher weighs in to push it to use the winning strategy more. This way, the program can build its own experiences as it performs the task more and more. It is similar to how we train dogs. When the dog performs or tries to perform a task, we only give it a treat if it performed well.The most famous example for this method is how AlphaZero can learn to become the best player in any 2-players game in hours by playing millions of games against itself. It starts playing a game knowing only its basic rules, and the developers let the algorithm know when it won a match to prioritize that strategy while playing the next game7.In an example, authors used this method to determine clinical trial dosing, where the algorithm learnt the appropriate dosing regimen to reduce mean tumor diameters in patients undergoing chemo- and radiation therapy8. The main challenge with applying reinforcement learning to healthcare is that we cannot play out a large number of scenarios as the lives of patients are at stake.Machine learning vs traditional statistical modelsA.I. is a huge domain which includes machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, but also methods that do not even process quantitative data. Therefore, it makes sense to compare machine learning to traditional statistical methods.Traditional statistical models focus on discovering relationships and confidence intervals between data points and outcomes. Compared to this, machine learning methods aim to reach high prediction accuracy with putting less emphasis on whether it is possible to interpret the model. The former often analyses a given dataset for its insights, while the latter is trained on a set of data, evaluated on a second set, and then used on an unseen third.Thus, prediction is key in machine learning to generate otherwise unavailable (e.g., expensive or not yet known) data. Also, machine learning is often better suited for large numbers of input variables (think of images with thousands of pixels), while traditional analysis with statistical models was designed for data with tens of input columns9.Machine vs deep learningMachine learning is a broad set of methods, their majority were used even decades before the current A.I. revolution. Most breakthroughs are achieved nowadays with artificial neural networks, but there are several other models, each with its own advantages.Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and while it has similar functions, its capabilities are different. Deep learning uses a layered structure of artificial neural networks that is inspired by the neural network of the human brain. The internal structure and number of layers within a neural network is a field of active research, but as a rule of thumb we can say that a deeper net with more layers can learn more complex tasks - at the same time requiring more data and longer time to train. Deep models have the capacity to process images, sound and other high dimensionality data with good results, while other machine learning models may perform better with data organized into a spreadsheet.Looking at a medical example, let’s build a model that can cluster patients by diagnosis based on the data in their medical records. If a medical record contains the expression Type 1 Diabetes, a machine learning model will learn to put all such patients in the Type 1 Diabetes cluster. But a deep learning algorithm could learn with time without human input that patients with medical records that only mention T1D should also be assigned to the same group. Programmers of other machine learning algorithms should add these alternatives themselves.Another example might also demonstrate the power and potentials of deep learning. We would like to build a model that turns on the light if we shout the word dark. A deep learning model, by time, would learn that saying “I can’t see” or “it’s dark here” should also turn on the light.How to evaluate news and studies about A.I.?Hardly a day goes by without promising research papers and studies on how to apply machine and deep learning to medical problems. However, as already just mentioning A.I. makes companies’ prospects better on any market, overhyping and overmarketing what an algorithm can do is an everyday phenomenon. There are still ways that help evaluate research papers and news on A.I. There are some general questions we can ask ourselves while reading medical A.I. papers. (Table 1)10,11.Table 1 A summary of some general questions readers of an A.I. medical paper might want to ask themselves to evaluate the quality of the results of a research.Full size tableBesides obvious features such as the quality of the journal the paper was published in (real breakthroughs tend to be able to reach the attention of high-level journals), the most important factor is the source of data. It matters where the data stems from, thus it is worth checking the ‘Methods’ section where authors describe how, where and what kind of data they received. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data.Moreover, the size of the dataset also matters: the more images, text or any other source materials the researchers have, the more precise the algorithms can become. Collaborations with clinicians and healthcare institutions are crucial in getting large amounts of quality data. If not, some research groups do tricks on their dataset to make it bigger (e.g., rotate images to double the database size).The reported performance (e.g., precision, speed) of the algorithm should be compared to previously existing solutions and human abilities. Even a state-of-the-art technical solution may perform so much worse than human professionals in a real-world clinical setting, that it may not be helpful at all. It is crucial for such technologies to be evaluated whether they can easily be implemented in clinical protocols, and whether the results are straightforward for the medical staff to interpret.It is also key to see whether the paper analyzed a real clinical problem. An algorithm might perform very well on a pre-selected dataset, however, it should also be tested on real clinical data. DeepMind claimed in its published study that its model was able to accurately predict that a patient will develop acute kidney failure “within a clinically actionable window” up to 48 h in advance12. While the algorithm did do that, it cannot be clinically validated without testing it prospectively in a clinical setting.Also, when you look at the latest pieces of news on smart algorithms, you should watch out for the following to be able to carefully assess the quality of the given A.I.-related article. The term “artificial intelligence” itself might be misleading as due to the overuse of the expression, its meaning started to get inflated. If an announcement or news article mentions A.I. without describing the exact method under it, it is a good sign to be skeptical and careful. A company or a research group should mention a subtype of machine or deep learning and be able to explain the method in detail with which they are aiming to create A.I.In a relevant example that took place in Thailand, a Google-backed algorithm aimed at improving care. There, normally, nurses took photos of the eyes of patients during check-ups and shared those to be analyzed by a specialist elsewhere. This process could take up to 10 weeks. The A.I. developed by Google Health identified signs of diabetic retinopathy from an eye scan with an accuracy of more than 90% and provide a result in less than 10 min. When Google started putting this system into practice, they ran into real-life issues. Sometimes a bad internet connection stopped the whole system from working as all images had to be uploaded to the cloud through a strong connection. If the quality of the scan did not meet a certain threshold, it simply did not give a result (the deep learning algorithm has to be fed with high quality images to get better). This way, nurses had to spend time editing some of the images the algorithm chose not to analyze. Developers had to travel to the site to help sort out these issues13.As a summary, the medical journal Radiology proposed a guide for authors, reviewers, and readers for assessing radiology research on artificial intelligence10. Other medical associations and journal editorial boards might adopt and customize it too. They also describe a checklist that every author should complete when publishing their A.I. research.Examples for how healthcare could benefit from A.I.In short, tasks that are highly repetitive and involve the analysis of quantifiable data might benefit the most from the use of A.I. We feature a few examples that provide a picture about the whole range of opportunities.Improving in-person and online consultationsBabylon Health launched an application that offers A.I.-driven consultation. It uses the patient’s medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients report their symptoms through the app which checks those in a database of diseases using speech recognition. After that, it offers a course of action14.Health assistance and medication managementThe medical start-up Sense.ly developed Molly, a virtual nurse that was designed to have a smiling face coupled with a pleasant voice. Its goal is to help assist patients with monitoring their health or disease management in-between doctor’s visits using ML. It also provides customized follow-up care, with a focus on chronic diseases15. A similar approach was used by the AiCure app that uses a smartphone’s camera and A.I. to confirm that patients are adhering to their prescriptions16. This could be useful for people with serious medical conditions or participants in clinical trials.A.I.-driven diagnosticsIn 2020, the FDA approved a software programme from the company Caption Health that allows medical professionals to perform cardiac ultrasound imaging without specialized training. It uses A.I. to provide real-time guidance and also the ability to save images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a “co-pilot” for those performing an ultrasound scan as it was designed to emulate the guidance that an expert sonographer would provide to optimize the image. It gives instructions on how to manipulate the transducer, and provides automated feedback on diagnostic image quality17.Mining medical recordsCollecting, storing, normalizing, and tracking medical records is an obvious step for A.I. As an example, Google Deepmind Health is cooperating with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment by analyzing retina scans. The images are analyzed by DeepMind’s algorithms resulting in a detailed diagnosis and a so-called “urgency score” in about 30 s. The prototype system can detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration18.Precision medicineThe company Deep Genomics aims at identifying patterns in genetic data and medical records of patients trying to link mutations to medical conditions. Oncompass Medicine uses A.I.-based algorithms to match genetic mutations found in patients’ tumor samples with ongoing clinical trials worldwide. This way, patients can receive precisely targeted treatments specific to the kind of cancerous tissue they have.Designing treatment plansIBM Watson developed a software that provides evidence-based treatment options for oncologists. It was designed to analyze both structured and unstructured data in medical records that may contribute to decision-making about treatment pathways. The software combines data from the patient’s medical record with clinical expertise, and research papers to suggest promising treatment plans19. There are many similar examples in other specialties. Creating an optimized radiation therapy delivery plan usually takes days. A.I.-based technologies help speed this process, completing the process in a couple of minutes20,21.Drug creationThe way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs through clinical trials can take several years and can cost billions of dollars. Speeding this up while making it more cost-effective would have an enormous effect on healthcare. The company Atomwise uses supercomputers to root out treatments from a database of molecular structures. They also launched a search for a previously unknown combination of safe and existing medicines and in a few days found two drugs predicted by the company’s A.I. technology which may significantly reduce the infectivity of Ebola. Such analysis typically would have taken months or years22.Triage toolsIt is crucial to be able to predict how severe a patient’s medical condition is to support the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk, especially in emergency medical services. In a study, authors developed and validated an A.I.-based algorithm using deep learning that accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores23. In another study, authors analyzed online triage tools from more than 150 000 patient interactions with a chatbot, and they found a decreased level of the urgency of patients’ intended level of care in more than one-quarter of the cases24. Both studies indicate that A.I.-based technologies can facilitate triaging even before patients reach the point-of-care.How can an A.I.-based medical technology become part of an everyday practice?The success of A.I. and its place in medicine and healthcare highly depend on whether it can penetrate the boundaries of evidence-based medicine, the lack of policies and reluctance from medical professionals to use it. There is no reason to believe that its use will be able to become common practice without meeting the standards and requirements of previous technologies.However, as the demand for A.I. to be implemented into everyday medicine is getting higher by patients, policy makers, medical professionals and hospitals, its way from developers to practice will have to become faster25. A typical example of how it has worked so far is related to Kardia, formerly known as AliveCor.They first made an FDA-approved smartphone case that worked as a single lead ECG in 2012. They launched two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app comparing it to a traditional 12-lead device. Later, the evolution of its design resulted in a credit-card sized device and an even smaller version in 2019. The original device could provide a one channel ECG by playing the user’s fingertips on the sensor for 30 s. The results were uploaded to the cloud to make it accessible for physicians. In 2015, Alivecor received clearance by the FDA to use an algorithm for the analysis of the readings to determine issues related to heart rhythm without human help.By the end of 2017, they already used deep learning networks, and the FDA cleared the company’s ECG reader called KardiaBand as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. A study concluded that the device managed to distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with a sensitivity of 93, and a specificity of 94%, respectively. Its sensitivity increased to 99% when a medical professional reviewed the reading26.By 2020, products of Alivecor have been tested in over 40 clinical studies. Despite these accomplishments, the use of the device is still not common practice. And as other companies producing A.I.-based medical technologies are lagging behind, it might depict a long period of adoption.A.I. will only reach the status of an everyday medical technology if medical associations provide clear guidelines about implementing it; if policy makers create policies that favor adoption; and if the medical community does not look at A.I. as a threat, but rather, as the stethoscope of the 21st century.What are the major challenges ahead?Examples for ANI do exist today, but there are major issues the A.I. developer and the medical community have to face and tackle before A.I. can become mainstream in medicine.ExplainabilityMedical professionals tend to make decisions using data that were obtained with technologies they either understand or understand the basics enough to trust it. In the case of A.I., it might not be possible. However, millions of learned parameters (the connection weights within the network) determine the output of a deep neural network, which makes it unintuitive to understand the decision process. Even if we visualize the sensitivity of different parts of a network and browse these thousands of noisy images, we will still not see easy-to-grasp learned rules. Reasoning is not a by-product of the algorithm. Thus, explainable A.I. would be crucial in providing insights into A.I.-based algorithms enough to gain trust in them.Augmented intelligenceThis is a term often promoted by organizations such as the American Medical Association. It focuses on A.I.’s assistive role in healthcare emphasizing that A.I.‘s design enhances human intelligence rather than replaces it. It also refers to the value an A.I. can provide that comes from how we can combine the unique capabilities of human experts with those of A.I. to provide better care for patients. A similar term that is related to augmented intelligence is “human-centered A.I.” which explores the need for the development of A.I.-based systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep and meaningful way.Quality and quantity of dataA.I. feeds on data. The more and better quality data it gets access to, the more it can excel at tasks. Advanced algorithms need annotated data to make sure those can learn the task they were designed for. There are medical professionals who act as data annotators which is a time-consuming and monotonous task. Some medical algorithms can only improve through large amounts of annotated data. Therefore the dedicated contribution of data annotators is of crucial importance for the benefit of implementing A.I. in the healthcare setting. Therefore, we can conclude that data annotators are the unsung heroes of the medical A.I. revolution27.Privacy issuesMedical A.I. needs access to medical records, data from health sensors, medical algorithms, apps and whatever source of information it can learn from. The data can come from healthcare institutions or from individuals. Even if institutions make data anonymized, it was proven in many cases that individual profiles can be traced back.Legal issues and liabilityWhat if a deep learning algorithm misses a diagnosis, the doctor accepts the judgment and the patient suffers from the consequences? What if an autonomous surgical robot injures a patient during a procedure? It is an ongoing debate about who will be held liable in the future when robots and A.I., acting autonomously, harm patients. Current consensus states that the professional is open to liability if he or she used the tool in a situation outside the scope of its regulatory approval, or misused it, or applied it despite significant professional doubts of the validity of the evidence surrounding the tool, or with knowledge of the toolmaker obfuscating negative facts. In any other cases, liability falls back on the creators and the companies behind them.TrustWe will need a lot of time to trust an autonomous car, to see how it reacts in situations we are familiar with or whether it makes similar decisions in an emergency. Consequently, it will take even more time not only for patients but for medical professionals too to trust A.I. with medical diagnoses, supporting medical decision-making or designing new drugs. This should be taken into consideration when we decide to adopt the technology into the healthcare setting.Biased A.I.A study concluded that commercial companies’ facial-recognition systems were more accurate on lighter-skinned individuals by 11–19%. Those produced especially inaccurate results when identifying women of color. In another example, A.I. was implemented in the United States’ criminal justice system in order to predict recidivism. They found that the algorithm predicted disproportionately high probability of black people committing future crimes, no matter how minor their initial offense was. It is not only racial prejudice, but A.I. algorithms also often discriminate against women, minorities, other cultures, or ideologies. For example, Amazon’s HR department had to stop using their A.I.-based machine learning tool which the company developed for sorting out the best job applicants, as it turned out that the smart algorithm favored men. As such algorithms learn from the data they are fed with, A.I. programmers must know about the issue of bias in algorithms and actively fight against it by tailoring them28.Patient designWhen designing algorithms for medical purposes, patients should be involved on the highest level of decision making to make sure their needs are met, and issues and recommendations are built into the technology. An example about its importance is how a start-up developed an algorithm that could detect signs of Alzheimer’s disease in phone calls of patients in Canada. However, it showed different results with patients who had a French accent. By inviting patients at the early stages of development, such issues could be avoided.As there are positive ongoing efforts for solving each of these, it is still an open question whether those algorithms that become a common part of medical practices would be able to address them all29.The future role of A.I. in medicine and healthcare
Every A.I.-based technology that is considered for use in healthcare must be regulated, efficient and backed by evidence30. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been showing an example in achieving a regulatory environment that not only welcomes such innovations but is also able to keep them safe for the public. The FDA launched a branch for digital health in 2019 and has attempted at designing new regulatory standards for A.I.-based technologies.The FDA realized that in the era of A.I., more algorithms will become available than medical devices as there is a shift from hardware to software. As the number of algorithms to be regulated grows exponentially, the current resources of regulatory bodies will not be sufficient for assessing each iteration and update. There have been discussions around a new regulatory framework for modifications to A.I./machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD)31. This could potentially lead to regulations that make it possible for regulators to assess companies while the companies can roll out algorithms and updates without the need to check them all. This is a viable way of letting A.I.-based technologies become widespread while keeping them safe. Our research group has attempted at creating a constantly updated database of FDA-approved A.I.-based medical technologies. After cross-checking and validating every approval we could find, we identified 64 A.I.-based and, at the same time, FDA approved medical technologies. Only 29 of those (45%) mentioned any A.I.-related terms or expressions in the announcement released by the FDA.Such technologies can only be efficient if they are successfully implemented into the medical practice. The American Medical Association (AMA) has addressed the importance of A.I., has advocated for the use of the expression augmented intelligence, and has assumed thought leadership with its reports and guidelines for physicians. In their AI policy, they state that “as a leader in American medicine, our AMA has a unique opportunity to ensure that the evolution of AI in medicine benefits patients, physicians and the health care community”32.To make sure that A.I.-based technologies meet the standards of evidence-based medicine, numerous editorial boards of medical journals and prestigious medical associations such as the WHO or CDC have released their recommendations for the medical community33,34.One of the potential obstacles in adoption can be a common fear among medical professionals that A.I. will replace them. While highly repetitive and data-based professions, or rather tasks under those professions will probably be highly impacted by automation, the core of the medical profession is and still will be the human touch, empathy and compassionate care; attributes that are almost impossible to mimic through a programming language.However, as a general rule of thumb, we might be able to assume that those medical professionals who use A.I. will replace those who do not do so. That is how such a profound role A.I. will have in the future of medicine. The debate early in the 21st century should not be about whether A.I. takes away the human touch or the art of medicine, but what we should do to improve both with it.When an algorithm using reinforcement learning, thus not being restricted by our human cognitive limitations, comes up with a cure which we could never find with our knowledge about biology, medicine and other life science, the real art of medicine will be to find out and to understand how it did that35.With this basic knowledge about the definition, levels, methods, challenges and potentials of A.I., we tried to give an overview about how we can make the medical profession more creative, spending more time with patients than ever.

",https://schema.org,WebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'headline': 'A short guide for medical professionals in the era of artificial intelligence', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is expected to significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare in the near future. While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype and attention around the topic are significant. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful.

For more than 100 years Nobel Prizes have been given out annually to recognize breakthrough achievements in chemistry, literature, medicine, peace and physics. As these disciplines undoubtedly continue to impact society, newer fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have also begun to profoundly reshape the world.
In recognition of this, today the world’s largest AI society – the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) – announced the winner of their new Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity, a brand-new $1 million award given to honor individuals whose work in the field has had a transformative impact on society.
The recipient, professor Regina Barzilay of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), is being recognized for her work developing machine learning models to develop antibiotics and other drugs, and to detect and diagnose breast cancer at early stages.

In February AAAI will officially present Barzilay with the award, which comes with an associated prize of $1 million provided by the online education company Squirrel AI.
“Only world-renowned recognitions such as the Association of Computing Machinery’s A.M. Turing Award, and the Nobel Prize carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” says AAAI’s Past-President and Awards Committee Chair Yolanda Gil. “This award aims to be unique in recognizing the positive impact of artificial intelligence for humanity.”
Barzilay has conducted research on a range of topics in computer science, ranging from explainable machine learning to deciphering dead languages. Since surviving breast cancer in 2014, she has increasingly focused her efforts on healthcare. She created algorithms for early breast cancer diagnosis and risk assessment that have been tested at multiple hospitals around the globe, including in Sweden, Taiwan, and at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital. She is now working with breast cancer organizations  such as Institute Protea in Brazil to make her diagnostic tools available for underprivileged populations around the world. (She realized from doing her work that, if a system like hers had existed at the time, her doctors actually could have detected her cancer two or three years earlier.)
In parallel, she has been working on developing machine learning models for drug discovery: with collaborators she’s created models for selecting molecule candidates for therapeutics that have been able to speed up drug development, and last year helped discover a new antibiotic called Halicin that was shown to be able to kill many species of disease-causing bacteria that are antibiotic-resistant, including Acinetobacter baumannii and clostridium difficile (“c-diff”).
“Through my own life experience, I came to realize that we can create technology that can alleviate human suffering and change our understanding of diseases,“ says Barzilay, the Delta Electronics Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “I feel lucky to have found collaborators who share my passion and who have helped me realize this vision.”
Barzilay also serves as a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and as faculty co-lead for MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. One of the Jameel-Clinic’s most recent efforts is “AI Cures,” a cross-institutional initiative focused on developing affordable COVID-19 antivirals.
“Regina has made truly-changing breakthroughs in imaging breast cancer and predicting the medicinal activity of novel chemicals,” says MIT biology professor Phillip Sharp, a Nobel laureate who has served as director of both the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and what’s now the Koch Institute. “I am honored to have as a colleague someone who is such a pioneer in using deeply creative machine learning methods to transform the fields of healthcare and biological science.”
Barzilay joined the MIT faculty in 2003 after earning her undergraduate at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel and her PhD at Columbia University. She is also the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant”, the National Science Foundation Career Award, a Microsoft Faculty Fellowship, multiple “best paper” awards in her field, and MIT’s Jamieson Award for excellence in teaching.
“We believe AI advances will benefit a great many fields, from healthcare and education to smart cities and the environment,” says Derek Li, founder and chairman of Squirrel AI. “We believe that Dr. Barzilay and other future awardees will inspire the AI community to continue to contribute to and advance AI’s impact on the world.”
AAAI’s Gil says the organization was very excited to partner with Squirrel AI for this new award to recognize the positive impacts of artificial intelligence “to protect, enhance, and improve human life in meaningful ways.” With more than 300 elected fellows and 6,000 members from 50 countries across the globe, AAAI is the world’s largest scientific society devoted to artificial intelligence.  Its officers have included many AI pioneers such as Allen Newell and John McCarthy. AAAI confers several influential AI awards including the Feigenbaum Prize, the Newell Award (jointly with ACM), and the Engelmore Award.
“Regina has been a trailblazer in the field of healthcare AI by asking the important questions about how we can use machine learning to treat and diagnose diseases,” says Daniela Rus, director of CSAIL and the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “She has been both a brilliant researcher and a devoted educator, and all of us at CSAIL are so inspired by her work and proud to have her as a colleague.”

We used artificial intelligence and aided target recognition and machine learning to train algorithms on identification of various types of enemy forces. So, it was prevalent throughout the last six weeks.”RELATEDFlooding the zone: Future aviation capability tightens kill chain at Project ConvergencePromethean FireThe first exercise featured is informative of how the Army stacked together AI capabilities to automate the sensor to shooter pipeline. In that example, the Army used space-based sensors operating in low Earth orbit to take images of the battleground. Those images were downlinked to a TITAN ground station surrogate located at Joint Base Lewis McCord in Washington, where they were processed and fused by a new system called Prometheus.Currently under development, Prometheus is an AI system that takes the sensor data ingested by TITAN, fuses it, and identifies targets. The Army received its first Prometheus capability in 2019, although it’s targeting accuracy is still improving, according to one Army official at Project Convergence. In some engagements, operators were able to send in a drone to confirm potential threats identified by Prometheus.From there, the targeting data was delivered to a Tactical Assault Kit — a software program that gives operators an overhead view of the battlefield populated with both blue and red forces. As new threats are identified by Prometheus or other systems, that data is automatically entered into the program to show users their location. Specific images and live feeds can be pulled up in the environment as needed.All of that takes place in just seconds.Once the Army has its target, it needs to determine the best response. Enter the real star of the show: the FIRES Synchronization to Optimize Responses in Multi-Domain Operations, or FIRESTORM.“What is FIRESTORM? Simply put it’s a computer brain that recommends the best shooter, updates the common operating picture with the current enemy situation, and friendly situation, admissions the effectors that we want to eradicate the enemy on the battlefield,” said Coffman.Army leaders were effusive in praising FIRESTORM throughout Project Convergence. The AI system works within the Tactical Assault Kit. Once new threats are entered into the program, FIRESTORM processes the terrain, available weapons, proximity, number of other threats and more to determine what the best firing system to respond to that given threat. Operators can assess and follow through with the system’s recommendations with just a few clicks of the mouse, sending orders to soldiers or weapons systems within seconds of identifying a threat.Just as important, FIRESTORM provides critical target deconfliction, ensuring that multiple weapons systems aren’t redundantly firing on the same threat. Right now, that sort of deconfliction would have to take place over a phone call between operators. FIRESTORM speeds up that process and eliminates any potential misunderstandings.In that first engagement, FIRESTORM recommended the use of an Extended-Range Cannon Artillery. Operators approved the algorithm’s choice, and promptly the cannon fired a projectile at the target located 40 kilometers away. The process from identifying the target to sending those orders happened faster than it took the projectile to reach the target.Perhaps most surprising is how quickly FIRESTORM was integrated into Project Convergence.“This computer program has been worked on in New Jersey for a couple years. It’s not a program of record. This is something that they brought to my attention in July of last year, but it needed a little bit of work. So we put effort, we put scientists and we put some money against it,” said Coffman. “The way we used it is as enemy targets were identified on the battlefield — FIRESTORM quickly paired those targets with the best shooter in position to put effects on it. This is happening faster than any human could execute. It is absolutely an amazing technology.”The U.S. Army demonstrated the ability to pass control around of a Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system like the one pictured here using a networked system at China Lake on August 26. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army) Dead CenterPrometheus and FIRESTORM weren’t the only AI capabilities on display at Project Convergence.In other scenarios, a MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone was able to identify and target a threat using the on-board Dead Center payload. With Dead Center, the Gray Eagle was able to process the sensor data it was collecting, identifying a threat on its own without having to send the raw data back to a command post for processing and target identification. The drone was also equipped with the Maven Smart System and Algorithmic Inference Platform, a product created by Project Maven, a major Department of Defense effort to use AI for processing full motion video.According to one Army officer, the capabilities of the Maven Smart System and Dead Center overlap, but placing both on the modified Gray Eagle at Project Convergence helped them to see how they compared.With all of the AI engagements, the Army ensured there was a human in the loop to provide oversight of the algorithms' recommendations. When asked how the Army was implementing the Department of Defense’s principles of ethical AI use adopted earlier this year, Coffman pointed to the human barrier between AI systems and lethal decisions.“So obviously the technology exists, to remove the human right the technology exists, but the United States Army, an ethical based organization — that’s not going to remove a human from the loop to make decisions of life or death on the battlefield, right? We understand that,” explained Coffman. “The artificial intelligence identified geo-located enemy targets. A human then said, Yes, we want to shoot at that target.”About  Nathan StroutNathan Strout covers space, unmanned and intelligence systems for C4ISRNET.Share:More In Artificial IntelligenceSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/09/25/the-army-just-conducted-a-massive-test-of-its-battlefield-artificial-intelligence-in-the-desert/,"{'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/resizer/68FXKoxJsrFDVQ0s8gRJYnBd_7k=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/DY2THQ6AJJDOVPAM777M7JUYWE.jpg', '@type': 'ImageObject'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nathan Strout'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'C4ISRNet', 'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png?d=124'}}",Inside the Army’s futuristic test of its battlefield artificial intelligence in the desert,2020-09-25T18:28:55.845Z,2022-08-18T04:37:30.631Z,Artificial Intelligence,C4ISRNet,,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/09/25/the-army-just-conducted-a-massive-test-of-its-battlefield-artificial-intelligence-in-the-desert/'}",https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/09/25/the-army-just-conducted-a-massive-test-of-its-battlefield-artificial-intelligence-in-the-desert/,,,,,,,

Remote work has become a long-term business strategy, but the adjustment has impacted employees in different ways. Stay-at-home employees working longer hours find themselves on the road to burn-out. As more organizations craft remote work policies, they need to tap AI-powered tech to make the ‘new normal’ the best it can possibly be. Ed McGuiggan, General Manager at Nuance Communications discusses how speech recognition technologies can automate routine tasks and redefine employee experiences. 
Remote work, it seems, is here to stay. Recently, some of the big tech firms famouslyOpens a new window  announced “work from home forever” options. Forrester Research reports that companies are ramping up investments Opens a new window in cloud-based tools to facilitate extended periods of working from home. 
Certainly, working from home creates tremendous benefits for employees, from sparing people lengthy commutes to building in more flexibility to manage family and work-life balance. But it’s not without some trade-offs. 
While some people thrive in autonomous environments, others depend on team-based collaboration and human connection. At the same time, having round-the-clock access to your work can create an emotional and mental burden, and some employees have reported working even longer hours than before.
As we transition from short-term arrangements to long-term solutions, one expertOpens a new window  cautions that organizations will need to “go a lot further … to optimize their remote work settings and enhance their business operations.” That is, doing remote work on a permanent or semi-permanent basis is going to require some level of investment to help make employees and their work products as effective as possible. 
This means going far beyond the technologies we now consider to be table-stakes, such as email, chat, video conferencing, and project management solutions. Now it’s time to think differently about how to overcome some of the inherent challenges of remote work and, ultimately, create an ideal employee experience.

Support Employees With AI-powered Technologies
Even when they’re willing to work longer hours, employees who are overextended or dedicating too much time to work can begin to find themselves on the road to burnout. Burnout, left unchecked, can lead to a broad range of health consequences, but tech leaders do have the power to help prevent it.
Start by considering how you can alleviate some of the more mundane tasks that may be valuable to the business but eat up a lot of time in the day: answering emails, creating reports, and filling out forms. Instead of typing and clicking our way through these documents, businesses can instead invest in an AI-powered speech recognition platform that enables employees to use the power of their voice to produce these important documents.
The right speech recognition platform can do more than support accurate transcription. When implemented correctly, you can leverage the AI built into your speech solution and integrated with your critical applications to create voice-powered commands that automate and streamline repetitive tasks. 
For example, your employees can create commands that voice-enable desktop navigation, including searching their documents, email, web, or video; starting and closing programs or windows; controlling the mouse; and even entering oft-used phrases and terminology into documents.
This type of solution works because the average employee’s typing speed fallsOpens a new window  in the 40 words per minute range, but they can speak much fasterOpens a new window  – as much as 150 words per minute (though some are historically and notably much faster). And, speech-to-text entries are about three times fasterOpens a new window  than keyboard entries – and more accurate. 
Likewise, speech recognition technologies can eliminate barriers for employees with disabilities that limit their ability to use a keyboard and mouse. For all employees, eliminating (or reducing) the keyboard can also prevent fatigue and repetitive stress injuries. 
At the end of the day, AI-powered speech recognition can help employees complete their work faster and more accurately. This will ultimately give them more time and space in the day for the things that matter most, whether that’s strategic work priorities, a walk, and fresh air, or dinner with their family.

Improving Business Operations With AI 
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations felt pressure to do more with less, to introduce productivity and efficiency initiatives that could lead to a healthier bottom line. In fact, as Harvard Business ReviewOpens a new window  wrote, knowledge workers are only productive for about three hours every day—even before this pandemic exacerbated the interruptions and multitasking all too common to our days. As the economic implications of our current environment remain uncertain, these pressures carry more weight. 
Operational efficiencies mean something even more for organizations like professional services and legal firms that bill their clients back for time on projects. No client wants to pay their attorney for data entry; the client wants to pay for the high-value, strategic tasks. It’s in these spaces where dictation emerged as a popular solution to documentation and data entry burdens. 
Today, these technologies have evolved many times over, and AI-powered speech recognition does far more than simply capture the spoken word. Speech recognition that harnesses the power of AI provides better, faster, and more accurate record-keeping that introduces greater efficiencies into your operation. 
Efficiencies of time, certainly; but also people’s efficiencies. When you don’t need to dedicate effort toward transcribing and building documents, you can free employees to do the strategic work that not only generates revenue, it also creates meaning and fulfillment for your workforceOpens a new window . 
Creating Ideal Experiences for Employer and Employee Alike
As remote workers continue to adapt to new and often uncertain circumstances, tech leaders know there is plenty of work to do to create the ideal experience for employers and employees alike. The good news is that we are seeing a new era of innovation while the adoption of well-established technologies has accelerated — technologies that can, indeed, make the new normal the best it can possibly be.

Published September 22, 2020




In 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a challenge to American companies: Build an application to match military members' skills to open jobs in the civilian world. Fifty companies answered the challenge. One stood out among the rest, and it wasn't LinkedIn.
Eightfold.ai is a Silicon Valley startup that threw its deep learning artificial intelligence into the fray. The platform has the potential to help transitioning service members and veterans find the career they want and plot a course on how to qualify for it.Advertisement
But there was more at stake than just a $1 million prize and the hope of government contracts; this is a company that cares about veteran employment.
""Veterans are a big talent pool,"" says Eightfold.ai President Kamal Ahluwalia, who hires veterans as part of his team. ""And at the end of the day, simply saying 'thank you for your service' is good, but actually doing something that helps maybe one, maybe 10, maybe a few thousand veterans is a lot more meaningful.""
The threshold for moving ahead in the competition was an 80% success rate. Eightfold's platform achieved a 96% rate.Advertisement
It got that high rating by using its trademarked Talent Intelligence Platform to analyze 1.5 billion anonymous resumes and job profiles (including those of 700,000 transitioned service members) and match military members and spouses to a job that fit them.
It wasn't based solely on their current skills. The program also matched them based on their potential.
 
(Eightfold.ai)Eightfold's mission is to provide the right career for everyone, according to Ahluwalia. To accomplish this, the company uses a global data set to chart the right career course for people. In the case of military personnel, it's helpful to look at resumes and military occupation codes, but it doesn't fully reflect what they're capable of doing.
It also doesn't take into account the aspirations they have for their career or for their personal lives.
""We [Americans] don't give them any guidance,"" Ahluwalia said. ""We actually make it hard to look for opportunities to find alignment between what a company is trying to do and what an employee is trying to do. If we give them more opportunities to acquire new skills, they will be empowered to pursue a career of their choice.""
Eightfold uses the Talent Intelligence Platform to understand the capabilities that military personnel have acquired and takes into account the geographic preferences for separating military personnel to map job opportunities in those areas.
Users can build a profile, add their skills and education, and see right away not only what jobs are available, but what jobs could be available. If the user is missing any skills, the platform can inform them of what they will need to learn to qualify for the job they want in the area they want to live. The platform will also inform the user of why they're a good match for a job.
 
(Eightfold.ai)For service members going through transition assistance, this means they will have the opportunity to continue acquiring skills they need for those jobs while they're still in the military. Most importantly, there are employers linked to the program that are looking to hire veterans with those necessary skills.
""The other side is bringing employers to the veteran talent network,"" Ahluwalia said. ""We can't solve the employment issue without bringing the two together. We already have major employers like Prudential nationwide. We will make it even easier for them to hire more veterans.""
Ahluwalia described Eightfold's progress over the past couple years as ""dramatic."" The company is on four continents, serving customers -- employers -- in 26 countries in 16 languages. It has users -- job seekers -- in 110 countries. American military veterans are a huge talent pool, he said, representing 5%-6% of the total workforce.
""They are amongst the best trained people,"" Ahluwalia said. ""At the same time, their actual skills are in a different domain. There is tremendous opportunity because they have leadership skills. They have their ability to work in ambiguous environments, where the training is all you have.""
In the near future, the Talent Intelligence Platform could be used to help even the newest military member chart their own career course from day one, to choose a career in a place where they want to live and set out to gain the knowledge and experience to get that job by the time they leave the military.
Eightfold has also caught the eyes of the Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Air Force recruiting. With veteran unemployment sitting at 8% nationally and 200,000 military personnel separating every year, Ahluwalia wants to turn transition from an anxiety-prone experience to one veterans can actually look forward to.

  Listen to this article    0:00 / 6:33 1X  BeyondWords For more than 100 years Nobel Prizes have been given out annually to recognize breakthrough achievements in chemistry, literature, medicine, peace and physics. As these disciplines undoubtedly continue to impact society, newer fields like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have also begun to profoundly reshape the world.
In recognition of this, today the world’s largest AI society announced the winner of a brand-new $1 million award given to honor individuals whose work in the field has had a transformative impact on society.
The recipient, professor Regina Barzilay of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), is being recognized for her work developing machine learning models to develop antibiotics and other drugs, and to detect and diagnose breast cancer earlier than existing clinical approaches.
In February the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) will officially present Barzilay with the award, which comes with an associated prize of $1 million provided by the online education company Squirrel AI. That funding puts the award on the same financial level as the Nobel Prize and the Association of Computing Machinery’s A.M. Turing Award, often described as “the Nobel of computing.”
“Only world-renowned recognitions such as the Turing and the Nobel carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” says AAAI President Yolanda Gil. “This award aims to be unique in recognizing the positive impact of artificial intelligence for humanity.”
Barzilay has conducted research on a range of topics in computer science, ranging from explainable machine learning to deciphering dead languages. Since surviving breast cancer in 2014, she has increasingly focused her efforts on healthcare. She created algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis and risk assessment that have been tested at multiple hospitals around the globe, including in Sweden, Taiwan, and at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital.
She is now working with breast cancer organizations  such as Institute Protea in Brazil to make her diagnostic tools available for underprivileged populations around the world. (She realized from doing her work that, if her doctors had used a machine learning model like hers, they actually could have detected her cancer as much as three years earlier.)
In parallel, she has been working on developing machine learning models for drug discovery: with collaborators she’s created models for selecting molecule candidates for therapeutics that have been able to speed up drug development, and last year helped discover a new antibiotic called Halicin that was shown to be able to kill many species of disease-causing bacteria that are antibiotic-resistant, including Acinetobacter baumannii   and clostridium difficile (“c-diff”).
“Through my own life experience, I came to realize that we can create technology that can alleviate human suffering and change our understanding of diseases,“ says Barzilay, the Delta Electronics Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “I feel lucky to have found collaborators who share my passion and who have helped me realize this vision.”
Barzilay also serves as a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and as faculty co-lead for MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. One of the Jameel-Clinic’s most recent efforts is “AI Cures,” a cross-institutional initiative focused on developing affordable COVID-19 antivirals.
“Regina has made truly-changing breakthroughs in imaging breast cancer and predicting the medicinal activity of novel chemicals,” says MIT biology professor Phillip Sharp, a Nobel laureate who has served as director of both the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and what’s now the Koch Institute. “I am honored to have as a colleague someone who is such a pioneer in using deeply creative machine learning methods to transform the fields of healthcare and biological science.”
Barzilay joined the MIT faculty in 2003 after earning her undergraduate at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel and her PhD at Columbia University. She is also the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant”, the National Science Foundation Career Award, a Microsoft Faculty Fellowship, multiple “best paper” awards in her field, and MIT’s Jamieson Award for excellence in teaching.
“Regina has been a trailblazer in the field of healthcare AI by asking the important questions about how we can use machine learning to treat and diagnose diseases,” says Daniela Rus, director of CSAIL and the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “She has been both a brilliant researcher and a devoted educator, and all of us at CSAIL are so inspired by her work and proud to have her as a colleague.”
AAAI president Yolanda Gil says the organization’s new Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence to Benefit Humanity aims to recognize the positive impacts of artificial intelligence “to protect, enhance, and improve human life in meaningful ways.”
With more than 6,000 members from 50 countries across the globe, AAAI is the world’s largest scientific society devoted to artificial intelligence. Its officers have included many AI pioneers such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Allen Newell.
“We want to applaud all the nominees and congratulate Dr. Barzilay for her remarkable contributions to the field,” says Derek Li, founder and chairman of Squirrel AI. “We believe that she and other future awardees will inspire the AI community to continue to contribute to and advance AI’s impact on the world.”

Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are laying the path to achieve lofty productivity and decision-making..'High value' work is the main focus of government agencies. For the purpose, robotic process automation and similar technologies are being embraced in order to decrease errors, improve compliance, and eliminate repetitive administration tasks..Robot process automation (RPA) is an application of technology that partially or fully automates human activities that are manual, rule-based, and repetitive. However, RPA lacks in a part as it can only take simple decisions that allow agencies to eliminate low-value, mundane, and transactional work. The exploitation of RPA could be multiplied by adding AI to the equation. AI elevates RPA and accelerates it to complete multiple tasks. It is very helpful in analyzing large scale data and enabling decision-making..The amalgamation of RPA and AI has unravelled more real and tangible results which could be applied to digital solutions for civilians and defense agencies. Either of the technologies can't do the same job alone..According to the RPA Program Playbook published by the Federal RPA community of practice, the current RPA program system reduces up to five-hours of employees' workload. The RPA features make a massive transformation in government operations through software bots to automate high-volume, repeatable tasks within legacy processes and applications..The Playbook further unfolds that RPA has the ability to reduce working time by 20-hour per employee which will eventually lead to government agencies gaining a net capacity of US$ 3 billion..Deploying RPA in Government Agencies.Major functioning areas in the government including finance, acquisition, IT, human resource, security, and mission assurance are automating tasks with the help of RPA. Data entry, data reconciliation, spreadsheet manipulation, systems integration, automated data reporting, analytics, customer outreach, and communications are some of the features of RPA..For instance, the Food and Drug Administration's Centre for drug evaluation and research reported it had seven RPA projects in development. One of them automates drug intake forms and free up the pharmaceutical and medical staff for the agency's core science mission in 2019. The same year, the Defense Logistics Agency made unattended bots to work full-time. The department saved more than 200,000 labor hours with the launch of 82 RPA bots..If RPA is effectively deployed by government agencies in automation, then machine learning (ML) and intelligent automation will just be a few steps away. RPA establishes the building blocks for AI in terms of IT infrastructure and standardization according to the Playbook note..Accelerating AI and ML in RPA for Financial Management.The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enriches the already existing features of RPA. It can be widely utilized in financial management to acknowledge areas such as transaction matching, fraud prevention, and anomaly detection..Large financial agencies generally stagger to resolve and match hundreds of thousands of their daily transactions. Many of the processes require heavy manual work and take hours to complete. However, RPA can automatically access data from various financial management systems. But it falls short in unmatched transactions when the data tolerance overdoes the matching data and documents. By adding AI and ML to the process, it accelerates the matching financial transactions or identifies fraud through handling and associated actions..Machine learning trains models to rapidly examine the correlation between historical and current transactions. The move helps in minimizing error by identifying potential matching or irregular behavior based on the transaction..People should get ready to accept AI innovations in human society. The misconception of AI taking over the world through its features needs to be buried for a better future. AI technologies are not designed to kill human labor and push us into unemployment. AI defers the working hours and minimizes it to use the human potential on something more important and meaningful. The mission of AI is to set an aligned work on the path..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

You hear it being used as a theme in movies like &quot;The Terminator&quot; and other stories set in a technologically-advanced world, you read it on books and you even see it on the branding of several products such as smartphones. There is what is called &quot;AI photography,&quot; &quot;AI gaming,&quot; and a lot of other things branded as &quot;AI.&quot;.Even in gaming, AI is plastered all over, In the world of online gambling, the top online betting apps such as Betway India make use of &quot;AI&quot; to run their betting apps without the need to be manually controlled by a human. However, are the things that people call AI nowadays really what AI is? Are these things really what makes AI intelligent? What is AI, and how does it work?.Here are the things you need to know about AI, and what makes it the same or different from what the world has right now..What is AI?.AI or artificial intelligence, by its technical definition, is machine intelligence that is artificially created, unlike human intelligence that comes with life itself. In the shortest definition, AI happens when a man-made machine starts to acquire the ability to &quot;think&quot; and act like a human with intelligence..Outside of how fiction depicts AI, what people call &quot;AI&quot; is now being used in several industries such as in the smartphone industry, in robotics, in various tech devices, in cybersecurity, and a lot more..However, scientists and experts believe that what people call &quot;AI&quot; today is not AI. For them, artificial intelligence is not as intelligent as we believe. As they put it, we are still far from realizing the real AI..What do we have, if not AI?.If what we have right now called &quot;AI&quot; is not the real deal, what is it then? Scientists and technology experts all agree that the &quot;AI&quot; that most people know right now is simply a matter of automation..Rather than a self-thinking and self-evolving artificial entity, what we have now are just groups of programmed processes that are set to be executed upon a given trigger, condition, or command. It automates tasks and does the work for humans, but the program cannot learn nor &quot;think&quot; for itself. It still needs to be programmed and coded to respond accordingly..However, the good news is that automation is the foundation of artificial intelligence. This means that although AI is still not within our hands right now, we have something that is the core of AI–all it needs now is a building and improving to eventually become the real thing..Thus, rather than being called &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence, what exists today can be more appropriately called &quot;augmented intelligence.&quot; The question, then, would be….Will real AI be a thing in the future?.The short answer to this question is yes, real AI would be a thing in the future. However, the right question should not be a matter of if it would come but rather, a matter of when it would come. Although all of the developments of science and technology point to the eventual birth of real AI, no one knows for sure when human intelligence can create artificial intelligence..Only time can tell. It can be in a few years, several years, a decade, several decades, or it could be as fast as next year. No matter what, when AI comes–and it will come–it will revolutionize the way modern life is lived and change the way people see technology forever..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

We frequently work with them on ideation workshops, PoC, and solution implementation. Santander Consumer Bank, for example, is running workshops and researching how to use machine learning to boost the sustainability of loan portfolios..Besides credit risk modeling, there is already an impressive range of use cases for AI in banking. It covers everything, from customer service to back-office operations. The most common AI solutions in the banking sector are listed below:.Customer service automation.Chatbots.Applying chatbots to automate customer service helps customers to satisfy. Moreover, simple issues can be solved entirely without human interference. In other words, automation significantly reduces customer service workloads..Biometric identification.It enables detailed or unnoticed identity verification within remote channels. It can include voice identity verification in call centers or typing verification in online banking..Customer insights.Customer 360 view.Using deep learning to customer analytics makes it easier to combine insights from various data sources such as transactions and online banking logs. It helps to understand a bank's customers better and create personalized recommendations and intelligent customer assistants, making the business more responsive and efficient..Churn prediction.Because of accurate AI algorithms, churn probability predictions improve customer retention. This is crucial as customers frequently stir without obvious warning signs. Therefore, it is challenging to run mainly targeted anti-churn campaigns. On the other side, retention activities can be costly, sometimes much more so than the value a potential customer may bring..Customer lifetime value.Customers' lifetime value is often used to analyze how valuable a particular relation is and to optimize other activities, such as by integrating customer lifetime value with a possibility-of-churn function to focus retention activities on the most valuable clients..Stimulating Sales.New client acquisition.Deep learning is focused on improving remarketing. With the 360 customer view, it promotes the use of all possible information about a customer. It includes cookies and how the person has communicated with a website. Understanding customer behavior on the internet enables a bank to focus on marketing activities on potential customers. It also shows them personalized ads, translating into even a 25x increase from advertising activities..X-sell.Machine learning methods can be used to improve the selection of customers targeted for outbound CRM campaigns. They collect and combine the benefits from both the customer 360 view and the advanced probability of purchase predictions. It allows a bank to choose the right customer and the right product to cross-sell. For example, machine learning has been shown to improve credit card x-sell by 12.5%..Credit risk management.Loan application assessment.Machine learning can process unstructured data like transaction descriptions more thoroughly than other techniques and discover non-obvious dependencies. Machine learning methods can also be combined with traditional scoring models to get better results..Fraud Detection.Machine learning thoroughly detects frauds, adapting to individual patterns, and changing behaviors. It can be used in areas where a high volume of events requires to be analyzed in real-time. AI can spot complex correlations; hence the wildest purchase will make sense to AI. Those who cannot wrap their algorithms will drive to the detection of fraud..Debt collection strategies.Algorithms of AI can generate a customized communication strategy for each customer. Recommending script for CC, or purpose a schedule, it will adjust the contact channel..Constant portfolio evaluation.Identifying SME clients enables banks to react rapidly and start the recovery process before other creditors do..Back-office optimization.Workflow documentation.Categorizing incoming emails to visit the appropriate department such as sales, and complaints and customer segmentation like an individual, SME, Corporate reduces the work manually involved with organizing customer service departments..Process automation.It includes cash operations, trade finance, and credit application processing, and accounting processes..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
