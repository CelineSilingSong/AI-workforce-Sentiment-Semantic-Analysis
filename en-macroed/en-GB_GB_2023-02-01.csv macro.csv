Generative AI Explained by AI
After years of research, it appears that artificial intelligence (AI) is reaching a sort of tipping point, capturing the imaginations of everyone from students saving time on their essay writing to leaders at the world’s largest tech companies. Excitement is building around the possibilities that AI tools unlock, but what exactly these tools are capable of and how they work is still not widely understood.
We could write about this in detail, but given how advanced tools like ChatGPT have become, it only seems right to see what generative AI has to say about itself.
Everything in the infographic above – from illustrations and icons to the text descriptions⁠—was created using generative AI tools such as Midjourney. Everything that follows in this article was generated using ChatGPT based on specific prompts.

Without further ado, generative AI as explained by generative AI.
Generative AI: An Introduction
Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, audio, and more.
Generative AI uses a type of deep learning called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create new content. A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator that creates new data and a discriminator that evaluates the data. The generator and discriminator work together, with the generator improving its outputs based on the feedback it receives from the discriminator until it generates content that is indistinguishable from real data.

Generative AI has a wide range of applications, including:

Images: Generative AI can create new images based on existing ones, such as creating a new portrait based on a person’s face or a new landscape based on existing scenery
Text: Generative AI can be used to write news articles, poetry, and even scripts. It can also be used to translate text from one language to another
Audio: Generative AI can generate new music tracks, sound effects, and even voice acting

Disrupting Industries
People have concerns that generative AI and automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment, as machines become capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans. They worry that the increasing use of AI will lead to a shrinking job market, particularly in industries such as manufacturing, customer service, and data entry.
Generative AI has the potential to disrupt several industries, including:


Advertising: Generative AI can create new advertisements based on existing ones, making it easier for companies to reach new audiences
Art and Design: Generative AI can help artists and designers create new works by generating new ideas and concepts
Entertainment: Generative AI can create new video games, movies, and TV shows, making it easier for content creators to reach new audiences

Overall, while there are valid concerns about the impact of AI on the job market, there are also many potential benefits that could positively impact workers and the economy.
In the short term, generative AI tools can have positive impacts on the job market as well. For example, AI can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, and help humans make faster and more informed decisions by processing and analyzing large amounts of data. AI tools can free up time for humans to focus on more creative and value-adding work.
How This Article Was Created
This article was created using a language model AI trained by OpenAI. The AI was trained on a large dataset of text and was able to generate a new article based on the prompt given. In simple terms, the AI was fed information about what to write about and then generated the article based on that information.

In conclusion, generative AI is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize several industries. With its ability to create new content based on existing data, generative AI has the potential to change the way we create and consume content in the future.

Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersSpain This article is more than 1 year oldArtificial intelligence uncovers lost work by titan of Spain’s ‘Golden Age’This article is more than 1 year oldDiscovery of Lope de Vega play could lead to other important finds, researchers saySam Jones in MadridSun 5 Feb 2023 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 5 Feb 2023 16.28 ESTShareLost or misattributed works by some of the finest writers of Spain’s Golden Age could be discovered thanks to pioneering AI technology that has been used to identify a previously unknown play by the wildly prolific dramatist, poet, sailor and priest Lope de Vega.This week Spain’s National Library announced that researchers trawling its massive archive had stumbled upon and verified a play that Lope is believed to have written a few years before his death in 1635.Like many plays of the Spanish Golden Age – the 16th- and 17th-century cultural boom that accompanied Spain’s imperial growth and which birthed masterpieces by Lope, Cervantes, Calderón and Velázquez, among many others – La francesa Laura (The Frenchwoman Laura) is a tale of love, jealousy and social hierarchy in which suspicion demands an innocent woman be sacrificed on the altar of her husband’s honour. But, unlike many similar plays of the period, Laura survives and the third act ends happily.Equally unusual was the manner of the play’s discovery. In 2017, Germán Vega, a Golden Age literature expert at the University of Valladolid, and Álvaro Cuéllar, now at the department of Romance studies at the University of Vienna, embarked on Etso, a project that uses AI analysis to determine the authorship of Golden Age plays, many of which are anonymous or believed misattributed.As part of the project, 1,300 plays – most of them from Spain’s National Library – were digitally transcribed using a platform, Transkribus, trained to identify and understand 3m words.Once transcription was complete, another program, Stylo, compared their language and style with the 2,800 digitised works by 350 authors in the Etso database.Held by the library as an 18th-century manuscript copied from earlier texts, La francesa Laura had long been catalogued as an anonymous work, but Etso’s computer quickly came to its own conclusions.“After it had transcribed the 1,300 texts, the computer noticed that one of them was similar to 100 or so works – almost all of which were by Lope,” says Vega.“That really grabbed our attention – we didn’t think we’d find a Lope … [But] we then found a lot of expressions in La francesa Laura that fitted with those in other Lope plays. There were things in La francesa Laura that people in other Lope plays had said or would later say.”More traditional analysis of the play – focusing on everything from plots and character names to metre, elisions and the pronunciation of diphthongs – corroborated the computer’s theory.Its style fits with that of Lope’s later period, while its flattering treatment of France has led the researchers to believe that it was written at a particular moment in the thirty years’ war – probably between 1628 and 1630 – when Spain and France shelved their mutual distrust in the face of a common enemy in England.“It had never attracted much interest at the National Library,” says Vega. “If it hadn’t been for this new technology, we wouldn’t have known about it unless someone had come across it and thought ‘this reminds me of Lope’.“Plus the title – La francesa Laura – isn’t that attractive and even though I’ve pored over lots of bibliographies, I’d never come across any reference to this play except in the National Library’s catalogue.”This was not the first time Etso had proved its worth. Almost four years ago, Vega used the database and Stylo to conclude that The Nun Lieutenant – a 17th-century play based on the staggering true story of Catalina de Erauso, who escaped a convent to become a cross-dressing soldier in the Americas – was written by a Mexican dramatist called Juan Ruiz de Alarcón.Vega believes AI will turn up more lost treasures as it continues to revolutionise research in his field. When he was preparing his doctoral thesis back in the mid-1980s, “any attempt to try to justify an attribution was a massive amount of work that involved reading a thousand texts, taking notes and hitting various libraries and ordering up old manuscripts”. But today, he says, programs exist that can tell you that a play is written in a style closer to a particular playwright’s than to those of hundreds of his peers.“That’s amazing. Given there’s such an attribution problem with Golden Age theatre – so many anonymous pieces or misattributed pieces, I think this new technology means we’ll see more of this. There are still things that need to be clarified.”While Vega concedes that La francesa Laura is hardly the pinnacle of Lope’s achievements – the so-called Phoenix of Wits is thought to have written more than 1,000 plays – the academic would still be delighted to see it performed on stage one day under the name of its true author.“It’s very entertaining and lively and I think it could do very well in the hands of the right theatre company,” he says. “It’s not a bad play but the thing is that Lope has four or five magnificent plays – and this one just can’t compare.”Explore more on these topicsSpainArtificial intelligence (AI)EuropeTheatrenewsShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could ChatGPT take your job? 











The rise of AI: Could ChatGPT take your job?
05:38

Chatbots and artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT that can almost instantly produce increasingly sophisticated written content are already being used to perform a variety of tasks, from writing high school assignments to generating legal documents and even authoring legislation.As in every major cycle of technological innovation, some workers will be displaced, with artificial intelligence taking over their roles. At the same time, entirely new activities — and potential opportunities for employment — will emerge. Read on to learn what experts say are the kinds of workplace tasks that are most vulnerable to being taken over by ChatGPT and other AI tools in the near term.






Does artificial intelligence help students cheat?
02:07

Computer programmingChatGPT can write computer code to program applications and software. It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language.  






""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""That could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.


""If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said. Basic emailWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer. ""There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'"" he said.Mid-level writingDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.AI ChatGPT is helping CEOs think. Will it also take your job?AI experts on whether you should be ""terrified"" of ChatGPTPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats""Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said. 


Media planning and buying Creative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated ""in a highly effective way"" within five years. ""So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,"" he said.Legal functionsChatGPT's abilities translate well to the legal profession, according to AI experts as well as legal professionals. In fact, ChatGPT's bot recently passed a law school exam and earned a passing grade after writing essays on topics ranging from constitutional law to taxation and torts.""The dynamic that happens to lawyers now is there is way too much work to possibly get done, so they make an artificial distinction between what they will work on and what will be left to the wayside,"" said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad, a legal software company. Common legal forms and documents including home lease agreements, wills and nondisclosure agreements are fairly standard and can be drafted by a an advanced bot.






Artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT raises excitement and concerns
05:51

At the same time, entirely new activities — and potential opportunities for employment — will emerge. Read on to learn what experts say are the kinds of workplace tasks that are most vulnerable to being taken over by ChatGPT and other AI tools in the near term.Computer programmingChatGPT can write computer code to program applications and software. It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language. ""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""That could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.""If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said. Basic emailWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer. ""There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'"" he said.Mid-level writingDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.AI ChatGPT is helping CEOs think. Will it also take your job?AI experts on whether you should be ""terrified"" of ChatGPTPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats""Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said. Media planning and buying Creative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated ""in a highly effective way"" within five years. ""So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,"" he said.Legal functionsChatGPT's abilities translate well to the legal profession, according to AI experts as well as legal professionals. In fact, ChatGPT's bot recently passed a law school exam and earned a passing grade after writing essays on topics ranging from constitutional law to taxation and torts.""The dynamic that happens to lawyers now is there is way too much work to possibly get done, so they make an artificial distinction between what they will work on and what will be left to the wayside,"" said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad, a legal software company. Common legal forms and documents including home lease agreements, wills and nondisclosure agreements are fairly standard and can be drafted by a an advanced bot.""There are parts of a legal document that humans need to adapt to a particular situation, but 90% of the document is copy pasted,"" Netzer of Columbia Business School said. ""There is no reason why we would not have the machine write these kinds of legal documents.

Had I chosen to submit the article that ChatGPT had written, nobody would guess that a computer program spits it out in 15 seconds. (Luckily, some very smart people are already developing technology to distinguish AI-written pieces from human ones; GPTZero is a great example.) In fact, the article it returned to me hit all of the usual highlights: chatbots, personalized marketing, and using AI-powered analytics to cut costs. It also hit on the usual challenges: privacy, security, and job displacement.I could have easily cut and pasted the content. So, ethical and journalistic standards aside (and those are very big asides), why not? Why wouldn’t I rely on this magic-feeling technology to produce my desired outcome? Here’s the thing: While ChatGPT got the basic structure of a thought leadership article right, it lacked creativity, a unique point of view, and insight. That is to say, it lacked the things that make writing and communication feel truly human. There was no spark of life in that article that would have gotten you, the reader, to look past the first paragraph. That’s certainly not the outcome I was looking for.Generative AI should be used for better business outcomesOf course, my experience here was just a simple experiment. Still, there are a few considerations it made me reflect on, especially as we head toward a world that’s going to see a skyrocketing number of AI-driven interactions. (Even before ChatGPT, in mid-2022 Gartner predicted chatbots would become the primary customer service channel for a quarter of organizations by 2027.) First of all, writers aren’t going away overnight. But more generally, consumers are going to seek out experiences with businesses that treat them like human beings, even if they use AI to do so. And businesses will want to turn those human-feeling experiences into better business outcomes. As the guy who invented webchat for brands back in the ’90s, I’ve spent a lot of time talking to brands about how they can create better business outcomes. To be honest, getting them to understand and be comfortable with AI has been a hurdle. The launch and excitement around ChatGPT makes that part of my job easier. Now it’s time to shift the conversation: If you’re excited about generative AI, do you know how and why to use it to drive legitimately better business outcomes? For example, if a customer comes to your digital front door and asks one of the following questions, the AI you’re using to staff that front door should respond in a mutually beneficial way:I’m the kind of person who buys gifts at the last minute. What can you recommend?I’m the traveler whose luggage you lost. How are you getting it back to me?I’m a caregiver helping a loved one with health issues. When can I get this prescription filled?You can’t just answer these questions with “the right words” crowdsourced from the public internet (as ChatGPT does). Instead, you should be thinking deeply about whether your AI-powered experiences are set up to deliver outcomes:Is the AI just writing nice-sounding language? Not good enough. It also needs to be able to surface business insights that inform your strategy.Is it trained on generally available information? If so, you’re just giving your customers the same experience as any other business. Instead, you need to make sure the unique needs and interests of your enterprise are reflected in the data set that your AI uses to drive the conversation.Do you have humans in the loop to ensure your experiences are both accurate and optimized? (OpenAI outsourced this to Kenya for $2 per hour as reported by a TIME investigation, which has raised some concerns).Is the AI producing nonbiased responses? Bias can be dangerous for your customers and lethal to your brand. Consider how you can start working within ethical frameworks like those developed by organizations like EqualAI. With every technological advance, there are wild promises thrown out from all corners that obscure the real work that needs to be done. Today’s “AI influencers” are no different, and it’s time to take a step back to take stock of how business leaders can cut through their hype and generate actual results. That said, there’s one more lesson from my failed article-writing project, one that has me excited about the future: Every experiment we try gets us one step closer to those better outcomes.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

First of all, writers aren’t going away overnight. But more generally, consumers are going to seek out experiences with businesses that treat them like human beings, even if they use AI to do so. And businesses will want to turn those human-feeling experiences into better business outcomes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the guy who invented webchat for brands back in the '90s, I’ve spent a lot of time talking to brands about how they can create better business outcomes. To be honest, getting them to understand and be comfortable with AI has been a hurdle. The launch and excitement around ChatGPT makes that part of my job easier. Now it’s time to shift the conversation: If you’re excited about generative AI, do you know how and why to use it to drive legitimately better business outcomes?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, if a customer comes to your digital front door and asks one of the following questions, the AI you’re using to staff that front door should respond in a mutually beneficial way:\n\n\n\nI’m the kind of person who buys gifts at the last minute. What can you recommend?\n\n\n\nI’m the traveler whose luggage you lost. How are you getting it back to me?\n\n\n\nI’m a caregiver helping a loved one with health issues. When can I get this prescription filled?\n\n\n\nYou can’t just answer these questions with “the right words” crowdsourced from the public internet (as ChatGPT does). Instead, you should be thinking deeply about whether your AI-powered experiences are set up to deliver outcomes:\n\n\n\nIs the AI just writing nice-sounding language? Not good enough. It also needs to be able to surface business insights that inform your strategy.Is it trained on generally available information? If so, you’re just giving your customers the same experience as any other business. Instead, you need to make sure the unique needs and interests of your enterprise are reflected in the data set that your AI uses to drive the conversation.Do you have humans in the loop to ensure your experiences are both accurate and optimized? (OpenAI outsourced this to Kenya for $2 per hour as reported by a TIME investigation, which has raised some concerns).Is the AI producing nonbiased responses? Bias can be dangerous for your customers and lethal to your brand. Consider how you can start working within ethical frameworks like those developed by organizations like EqualAI.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith every technological advance, there are wild promises thrown out from all corners that obscure the real work that needs to be done. Today’s “AI influencers” are no different, and it’s time to take a step back to take stock of how business leaders can cut through their hype and generate actual results. That said, there’s one more lesson from my failed article-writing project, one that has me excited about the future: Every experiment we try gets us one step closer to those better outcomes.""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article', 'name': 'I tried using ChatGPT to write this article - Fast Company', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms/uploads/2023/02/p-1-90844120-i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article.jpg', 'datePublished': '2023-02-04T13:00:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-02-03T22:38:10+00:00', 'description': 'Here’s what I learned from my failed experiment.', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article']}], 'author': [{'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio#/schema/person/f40723ed94042ea9ea36bfb5ad4157b2', 'name': 'Rob LoCascio', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio#/schema/person/image/e5ed61c5e6c499a9a7cf3935e1321177', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae8a69d010fcda518d07e5fb0973bfe8?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae8a69d010fcda518d07e5fb0973bfe8?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'Rob LoCascio'}, 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio', 'description': ''}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms/uploads/2023/02/p-1-90844120-i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms/uploads/2023/02/p-1-90844120-i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article.jpg', 'width': 1920, 'height': 1080, 'caption': '[Photos: Aitor Diago/Getty Images; alengo/Getty Images]'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90844120/i-tried-using-chatgpt-to-write-this-article#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.fastcompany.com'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'I tried using ChatGPT to write this article'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/', 'name': 'Fast Company', 'description': '', 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#organization'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#organization', 'name': 'Fast Company', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#/schema/logo/image/', 'url': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/03/fc_logo.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/03/fc_logo.png', 'width': 696, 'height': 696, 'caption': 'Fast Company'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#/schema/logo/image/'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/FastCompany/', 'https://x.com/FastCompany', 'https://fastcompany.social/@fastcompany', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/fast-company/']}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio#/schema/person/f40723ed94042ea9ea36bfb5ad4157b2', 'name': 'Rob LoCascio', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio#/schema/person/image/e5ed61c5e6c499a9a7cf3935e1321177', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae8a69d010fcda518d07e5fb0973bfe8?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae8a69d010fcda518d07e5fb0973bfe8?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'Rob LoCascio'}, 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/rob-locascio', 'description': ''}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Anuario Lope de Vega. Texto, literatura, cultura edited by the UAB's CER PROLOPE research group, has now published the discovery of a new comedy by Lope de Vega, entitled La francesa Laura, discovered in the manuscript collections of the Biblioteca Nacional de España by researchers from the universities of Valladolid and Vienna. The use of computer tools has been essential for its detection, the results of which have been fully supported by philological analysis. The researchers and PROLOPE will soon publish the critical edition of the work together with Editorial Gredos.




In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a highly valued tool in several research tasks and projects. The more rigurous historical-philological research has also benefited from this new type of resource. And proof of that is the case of the discovery of La francesa Laura, an unknown play by Lope de Vega (1562-1635), after an intense work combining the use of advanced computer tools and traditional philological research. 
The discovery was made possible thanks to the National Library of Spain (BNE) and its collaboration with the ETSO project ""Stylometry and Spanish Golden Age Theatre"", directed by Álvaro Cuéllar (University of Viena) and Germán Vega (University of Valladolid), the researchers responsible for the discovery, and which included some 150 collaborators dedicated to the use of computer analysis of theatre literature from the Golden Age to solve problems of authorship; the UAB PROLOPE group, who do the enormous jon of publishing and studying Lope de Vega's work, who provided the texts; the Transkribus tool, which facilitated the preparation of the materials needed for the tests, and the researchers' universities of Valladolid and Viena.
The new comedy can already be viewed on the BNE's Hispanic Digital Library, while the scientific paper on the discovery can be found in the latest number of the UAB journal Anuario Lope de Vega. Text, literatura, cultura, under the title of ""La francesa Laura. El hallazgo de una nueva comedia del Lope de Vega último"". A revised and annotated edition of the play will be published in the coming months thanks to the Gredos publishing house and the PROLOPE research group.
AI for historical and philological research
The use of AI has been crucial in the discovery of Lope de Vega's relationship with this work. It was preserved anonymously in a manuscript from the end of the 17th century, many years after the writer's death, which is kept at the BNE, along with many other anonymous works, in the institution's very rich collection of theatrical manuscripts. No ancient or modern document, nor any present-day or contemporary Lope de Vega scholar, has so far been able to relate it to who was known at the time as the ""Phoenix of Wits"".
Firstly, the work was automatically transcribed using AI techniques by means of the Transkribus tool, which allows accurate transcription of ancient manuscripts with a high degree of precision. The machine was trained on some three million correctly identified words, and then processed some 1,300 plays from the Golden Age, both printed and handwritten, which were transcribed in just a few hours.
In a second phase, the works were classified by author, by means of automatic learning processes, capable of classifying works as written or not written by Lope de Vega with more than 99% accuracy, as recent studies have shown. Among the 1,300 automatically transcribed comedies, La francesa Laura was classified as written by Lope de Vega in its entirety. The lexical uses of the work were closely aligned with his own and not with those of the other 350 playwrights of the time who were available in the experiment.
Confirmation by traditional philological studies
After the computer classification of the work, researchers began intense work to determine whether this was truly a comedy written by the distinguished dramatist’s, but this time with the traditional resources of philological research. Among these tests were the study of versification (how Lope used common metrics in his works), orthology (how he pronounced words and used diphthongs, hiatus or synalephas), and especially the study of echoes of Lopesko, that is, the coincidence of both ideas, themes and motifs, as well as specific lexical structures between this work and other texts by the playwright around the time it was written. All of the tests confirmed what was noted in the initial experiments with artificial intelligence: the work fits like a glove into Lope de Vega’s theatrical productions.

Comedy at the artistic height of Lope’s last stage
According to researchers, everything indicates that this is a new genuine comedy of the playwright, written five or six years before his death. The presence and flattering treatment of the French, which the title already emphasizes, seem to indicate that it was composed during the brief period when the Spanish and French crowns became allies against the English in the late 1620s, putting an end to the tensions between the nations that had marked the Thirty Years' War.
La francesa Laura is a fine theatre play with the dramatic power expected from a mature Lope de Vega. The story is set in France and revolves around Laura, daughter of the Duke of Brittany and married to Count Arnold. The work, although a product of its time, presents from the beginning a strong defense of women, as can be seen in these verses: ""Fuera de que a las mujeres/les sobran tantas hazañas/que en las armas y las letras/envidia a los hombres causan"".

 What you may not realize is that scammers are using artificial intelligence to create dangerous job scams. The Federal Trade Commission and cybersecurity experts like Dominic Chorafakis with Akouto warn you to watch out for much more dangerous job offer scams than the usual phishing emails.    Crooks are using artificial intelligence programs to scrape personal information from social media, LinkedIn, and other sites, then generate and send the victim highly personalized phishing emails and messages. PREVIOUSLY ON SULLIVAN'S SMART SENSE: Electric cars: What to consider when buying an electric vehicle ""It’s being asked to write a letter to convince that individual to click on a PDF or a link,"" explained Chorafakis. He showed us how it works. Using my bio on FOX 26 Houston, he asked a Python artificial intelligence program to write me a job offer letter. ""It mentions your Emmy Awards, your National Murrow Award, and crafts an email to convince you to try to click on a link or open an attachment,"" he showed us.   ""That’s creepy.

Here are some tips from Chorafakis to protect yourself: If you get a job offer from a Gmail or personal email account, rather than a business account, that's a red flag.Never click a link or attachment from an unsolicited email.Search for the company website online, go to its LinkedIn page, or use a job site such as Glassdoor to look it up. Chorafakis warns that scammers can also use artificial intelligence to take a recording of someone's voice to create a tape of the person saying something else.   ""They will impersonate someone’s boss and ask to transfer money or buy gift cards or something of that nature. There have also been fake kidnapping scams where you’ll get the voice of a loved one saying I've been kidnapped, I’m in danger, you have to transfer money,"" he said. He says scammers have used AI to manipulate photos into compromising images, then threaten to release them unless they receive a ransom payment.

ChatGPT, an interface that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 large-language model. (Screenshot via OpenAI)



 Views expressed in opinion columns are the author’s own.
One of my favorite elementary school memories was competing for the highest typing test score among my classmates during our computer lab classes. But then I reached middle school and the novelty of our computer labs diminished as the use of laptops became more frequent. Up to now, after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our education system has become inevitably interwoven with technology.



As educational technology usage increased, so did debates among educators, parents, students and tech experts about its efficiency. As these arguments against technology usage for education rage on, here I am, walking around this college campus with nothing in my bag aside from my laptop, charger and water bottle. 
Within the last few weeks, the arrival of the artificial intelligence tool, ChatGPT, has prompted many debates reminiscent of the ones I watched happen as a middle schooler. But, we should stray from our previous mistake of getting caught up in the discourse surrounding new technology. To stay on top of educational and technological trends, universities need to be teaching students to work with and around AI tools to help prepare students for a constantly advancing world.
University responses to AI-generating tools are surfacing from an initial fear of students using these platforms to cheat and some universities have announced their plan to crack down on the use of these tools or banning the platforms altogether. However, whether we are prepared for it or not, technology is advancing faster each day. Our education systems — especially higher education — cannot respond to these advancements in fear, rather, they need to be able to adapt and assess how best to prepare students to interact with such technology. 
We should be seeing AI-based technology, such as ChatGPT, as a tool for education.



Many professors have commented on the quality of work ChatGPT produces to be below the standards of a well-written and structured paper. Knowing this, professors should encourage students to use it as a means to do a lot of the “grunt work” of assignments — researching and gathering information — while still encouraging students to subsequently interpret this information critically.
The time saved through ChatGPT’s efficient research methods can then be focused on critical analysis — a paramount skill in higher education. Developing our decision-making, problem-solving skills and creativity is what sets apart from the automated work of artificial intelligence. These skills — which make us inherently human — need to become our educational focus.
A large concern of using information from ChatGPT comes from questions over source attributions and citations of ideas being produced. However, these concerns give rise to another opportunity for students to begin fact-checking the reliability of claims and ideas they use in their assignments. In an era full of misinformation and disinformation, validating the information we consume is becoming increasingly important to how we view the world around us. 
With written work specifically, professors can use AI as tools to generate essay outlines and encourage students to use them as a base-line for further analysis. Assessments may be based upon how students improve upon the original AI-produced draft or how they integrate such AI-generated work into their own analyses. Furthermore, AI tools can be used to generate discussion and debate topics in classrooms, particularly if conversations begin to run dry. Building this emphasis on critical thinking and analytical skills by viewing claims  that are made, working to see how one can counter them and breaking them down is something all students should graduate with. ChatGPT can help facilitate this. 
Now, such integrations will be merely a starting point. Professors and universities must prepare to adapt their teaching to artificial intelligence as it continues to change. Education cannot remain static as the world develops around it. 
With large corporations already beginning to layoff thousands of workers in favor of AI and automation, new technology is not something we can expect students to shy away from: It’s our competition in the workforce. As AI continues to become part of our lives, leaving behind skills that can be automated will allow us to refocus our educational models upon intangible analytical skills that will best prepare us to navigate the world we will face once we graduate.
We may mourn the end of certain educational methods in classrooms — but let’s remember that many still mourn the end of teaching cursive in classrooms. Despite the nostalgia, having such a skill no longer holds the same significance as it once did. 
Since we started using computers in class, we’ve been able to learn and expand on newer skills, better equipping us for the changing times. Let’s repurpose ChatGPT as an indicator of the future we are moving toward — and prepare our students for it.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making headlines in recent years, as advancements in technology are making AI more accessible and powerful than ever before. AI has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and it is rapidly becoming a crucial aspect of modern life. In this blog post, we will explore the rise of AI, its impact on various industries, and the ethical considerations that come with these developments.
One of the most significant areas of AI development is machine learning, which allows AI systems to learn and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. This allows AI systems to develop more sophisticated abilities and perform tasks that would be impossible for humans to achieve. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions, helping businesses make better decisions and improving their bottom line.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.18%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Another area where AI is making an impact is in the field of healthcare. AI algorithms can be used to analyze medical images, diagnose diseases, and help doctors and nurses make informed treatment decisions. This can improve the accuracy of diagnoses, reduce the time and cost of medical procedures, and ultimately save lives.
AI is also transforming the way we interact with technology. Voice-controlled virtual assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, have become popular household devices, and self-driving cars are now a reality on our roads. These developments are changing the way we live, making our lives easier and more convenient.
However, the rise of AI also raises important ethical considerations. For example, the widespread use of AI in the workplace could result in significant job losses, as machines and algorithms take over many tasks previously performed by humans. This could lead to significant social and economic disruption, and we must consider these implications as AI continues to evolve.
There are also privacy concerns, as AI systems collect and store vast amounts of personal data. This data can be used for good, such as improving medical diagnoses, but it can also be used maliciously, such as for targeted advertising or cybercrime. We must develop robust regulations and best practices to protect personal data and ensure that AI is used for the benefit of society as a whole.
In conclusion, the rise of AI is a significant development that has the potential to transform our lives in numerous ways. We must embrace these developments and invest in AI research and development, while also considering the ethical implications of these advancements.
