It is expected that artificial intelligence in U.S. education will grow by 47.5% from 2017-2021 according to the Artificial Intelligence Market in the US Education Sector report. Even though most experts believe the critical presence of teachers is irreplaceable, there will be many changes to a teacher’s job and to educational best practices.

Teacher and AI collaboration
AI has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. As AI educational solutions continue to mature, the hope is that AI can help fill needs gaps in learning and teaching and allow schools and teachers to do more than ever before. AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline admin tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability—uniquely human capabilities where machines would struggle. By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for AI in education is one where they work together for the best outcome for students. Since the students of today will need to work in a future where AI is the reality, it’s important that our educational institutions expose students to and use the technology.
Differentiated and individualized learning
Adjusting learning based on an individual student’s particular needs has been a priority for educators for years, but AI will allow a level of differentiation that’s impossible for teachers who have to manage 30 students in each class. There are several companies such as Content Technologies and Carnegie Learning currently developing intelligent instruction design and digital platforms that use AI to provide learning, testing and feedback to students from pre-K to college level that gives them the challenges they are ready for, identifies gaps in knowledge and redirects to new topics when appropriate. As AI gets more sophisticated, it might be possible for a machine to read the expression that passes on a student's face that indicates they are struggling to grasp a subject and will modify a lesson to respond to that. The idea of customizing curriculum for every student's needs is not viable today, but it will be for AI-powered machines.
PROMOTED
Universal access for all students
Artificial intelligence tools can help make global classrooms available to all including those who speak different languages or who might have visual or hearing impairments. Presentation Translator is a free plug-in for PowerPoint that creates subtitles in real time for what the teacher is saying. This also opens up possibilities for students who might not be able to attend school due to illness or who require learning at a different level or on a particular subject that isn’t available in their own school. AI can help break down silos between schools and between traditional grade levels.

Automate admin tasks
An educator spends a tremendous amount of time grading homework and tests. AI can step in and make quick work out of these tasks while at the same time offering recommendations for how to close the gaps in learning. Although machines can already grade multiple-choice tests, they are very close to being able to assess written responses as well. As AI steps in to automate admin tasks, it opens up more time for teachers to spend with each student. There is much potential for AI to create more efficient enrollment and admissions processes.
Tutoring and support outside the classroom
Ask any parent who has struggled to help their teenager with algebra, and they will be very excited about the potential of AI to support their children when they are struggling at home with homework or test preparations. Tutoring and studying programs are becoming more advanced thanks to artificial intelligence, and soon they will be more available and able to respond to a range of learning styles.

There are many more AI applications for education that are being developed including AI mentors for learners, further development of smart content and a new method of personal development for educators through virtual global conferences. Education might be a bit slower to the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, but the changes are beginning and will continue.

The future of work: How AI and robots might impact our work life 20 years from now

This year has seen, what appears to be, an unusually high level of soothsaying predictions on technological ‘Revolutions’, and how they will affect us all. How the latest technology buzz-word, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, will replace 50% of our jobs. Emerging new business models replacing the old, such as Uber and Airbnb. How the changing work landscape is driven by ‘Millenials’, who not only care for a salary but want access to many other perks believed to be unique to them.
The above may or may not be true, but it overlooks some significant demographic changes, both globally and in our backyards.
Artificial Intelligence
What is Artificial Intelligence? Is AI ready to take over the functions of the human world, implement nuclear armageddon and attempt to wipe out humanity? Can anyone state they have seen a convincing form of humanoid robot?
Most of us have seen some form of robot which can only just stand up. Has anyone had a meaningful conversation with a computer? Try adding a reasonably complex sentence from English into French or German in ‘Google translate’ and see what rubbish gets churned out. It might get the message across, but only just.
When the term, ‘AI’ is used it is usually a loose term with no relation to any form of ‘intelligence’. The reality is the manipulation of massive amounts of data which only a computer can do. The major change from 20 years ago is the speed with which we can process logic arguments. This ‘Big Data’ processing is not new. There are great success stories which have generated business and added employment.
Let’s call this Narrow AI (ANI). We are many years away from the culmination of ANI to become General AI (AGI), with the ability to reason, understand complex ideas, think in the abstract and generally learn from mistakes. As scientists we are a long way from understanding the human brain, never mind developing something to replicate a human mind or teach itself.
The crazy prophesying: We’re expected to believe 50% of jobs within the next 20 years are being taken over by robots, self-driving cars and trucks. Progress isn’t being made, and reasonably rapid, exponential progress due to operating at higher speeds.
Business (and personal) competitiveness has many more influences to compete against. In a world being made smaller by increased computerisation and technological innovation, AI and robotics are far down on the list.
New Business Paradigms
Although we have seen many advances in digital usage, such as Apple’s iTunes and Amazon’s webstore changing the landscape. One great example was the success of the ‘Tesco Clubcard’ and their use of the company ‘Dunnhumby’, a Big Data startup. It made suggestions based on a buyers shopping profiles with money off vouchers for future purchases – A marketers dream in a very ‘bricks-and-mortar’ establishment. A great example of the ‘Big Data’ generation within a very successful startup. It is not ‘AI’.
New business models taking advantage of these latest data-driven advances include Amazon, Google, Apple, Uber, Airbnb and Facebook all offering advantages to customers never seen before.
Many of these groups are collaborating in the field of neural advances and supercomputer technology, such as IBM’s Watson (with Apple), Google’s D-wave (with NASA) and Facebook’s FBLearnerflow. This area of AI is being researched (in the field of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing), which we have yet to see on the high street or in any meaningful mass consumer way.
Global Demographics
The rise of the East: Take the UK as an example, there were approximately 200,000 Graduates in 2016 entering the job market, while there were 7.7 million Chinese graduates alone, more than seven times that of 15 years earlier! In a rapidly globalising market, our graduates have to compete in a much bigger pool of talent.
Keeping with the UK as an example, as one of the World’s top nations for its research and development in many areas, such as Automotive (F1), Aerospace, Metallurgy, Pharma, Medical, Computer Services and High-end Manufacturing, amongst others. However, no nation can rest on its laurels. In this era of government and state austerity, it can quickly be overtaken by overseas competitors, as they increase R&D spend versus the UK’s cutbacks.
Demographic Time Bomb & Changing Work
Millenials (those born between the early 90’s and early 2000’s) are perceived in many circles to be particularly wanting. The reality is every generation, now and before us wanted purpose, feedback and a degree of work-life balance but it appears to be more explicit than before.
I don’t see any difference in the motivations of employees today, except for a rapidly changing work landscape.
There was a demographic explosion post-WWII resulting in the highest birth and mortality rates of a century. Due to increases in medical science, healthcare and prolonged peacetime, we are now experiencing the beginning of an increase in new pensioners. Retirees are increasing as we see Baby-boomers reach state pensionable age, putting pressure on those supporting them, either physically or fiscally. Currently, every pensioner across Europe is supported by four of working age. It is forecast this will reduce by 2060 to one pensioner for every two of working age.
The unwritten contract of Jobs-for-Life our grandparents enjoyed, has disappeared, as we see our parents and colleagues being made redundant. Vast swathes of employees and industries face significant changes due to global industrial changes, such as the ongoing ‘Lower-for-longer’ oil price crisis. The stability contract between employer and employee has eroded, leading to a rise in job-hopping.
100 Year Life
Two-thirds of baby-boomers are now expected to live past 80 years old, while only one quarter expected to at the turn of the 20th century.
It is conceivable that a majority of children born today could live to see 100 years, as we see rapid increases in healthcare, diagnostics and treatment. Thus creating the potential to turn-around the traditional education, work & raising a family, then retirement at 60-plus into considering a working life punctuated by sabbaticals and mid-career breaks.
Against this backdrop, the added costs of supporting society with increases in school-age leaving. Many more students are opting for a degree before entering the workplace, even with the increased cost of tuition, albeit making them more suitable for modern employment. Retirement age is increasing, for the UK it will be 67 in the 2020’s and possibly to 70 by 2060.
It is inevitable working age people start to ask questions on how best to live their lives.
A Learning Life
Lifelong learning will be a necessity. Changes in the education industry offer more opportunities with the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC’s).
Increased numbers of adult students will be more demanding of these institutions and expect more outcome-based results, rather than many of the rote-learning courses criticised in the past or ‘useless’, humanities and arts subjects. Cognitive, task-based, problem solving and interpersonal skills and abilities will be the key to this as will on-the-job learning as a pre-requisite for the future.
We are right to be aware of new technological advancements (such as AI and robotics). The challenges of a rapidly ageing population, increasing global competition and the life we live from the cradle to the grave, as we expect to live for much longer.
New business models: This presents some significant business opportunities for individuals and groups with relevant insights. Many under-served sectors of society could benefit from the application of digital skills, not least for the baby-boomer generation, one of the fastest growing users of the internet (‘Silver Surfers’).
Global demographic changes mean our R&D efforts either at the local Country, State or European level need better coordination and more investment if we are to ensure we remain competitive. Innovation is a tricky subject, but investment has always been key to its success.
As we see changes in the work landscape, re-education becomes a norm throughout life, it will bring other challenges, as we could see many younger graduates competing for work with much older, more experienced workers.
Change is a given and that change highlights itself to be exponential. Over the next few decades, there will be some exciting and quite unusual developments in the field of AI, as it possibly migrates from the Narrow to the General field.
We should be worrying about it less than the societal changes surrounding us. All these changes provide excellent material for budding startups as changes in demographics, social orders and advances in technology interact.

Future of Robotics & Artificial Intelligence

By Alex Jaumann -   07/24/2018      6 Minutes Read 




According to a Forrester report, robots will eliminate 6 percent of all jobs in the U.S. by 2021. McKinsey’s assessment is even more expansive — they believe that by 2030 one-third of American jobs could become automated.
This, however, doesn’t mean that life will soon be like “The Jetsons.” As technological developments have done in the past, the next generation of robots utilizing artificial intelligence and automation to streamline processes currently handled with the assistance of human workers will significantly alter the job market. This idea represents a form of disruptive innovation, a term that refers to when an emerging technology can utilize fewer resources, thus competing better against those without it.
The impact that automation has already had is significant. Despite the fact that more than 5 million factory jobs since 2000 have ceased to exist, U.S. manufacturing output has increased — between 2006 and 2013 it rose by 16.7%! To determine people’s feelings about this, we surveyed over 2,000 people and asked what industries they work in, how they feel disruptions might affect their labor market, what they think they will do if directly affected, how many people understand the concept of disruptive innovation, and how will it potentially impact their jobs in coming years. Continue reading to see what we learned.
Ignorance Is Innovative Bliss
Knowledge Is Innovative Power
Understanding what disruptive innovation is and how it might potentially affect your industry can be the difference between seeing a disruption coming (letting you get ahead of it) and possibly losing your customer base to a newer and younger competitor.
Of the 2,000 professionals polled, fewer than 40 percent were familiar with “disruptive innovation.” Disruptive innovation was coined in a 1995 issue of the Harvard Business Review; it regarded the evolution of technology in each industry. Despite Millennials living in a time where new technology is causing vast disruptions in the modern marketplace due to their purchasing decisions, almost 60 percent of survey respondents of that generation were unaware of the concept.
Gen Xers were the most familiar with the phrase (54 percent), while almost 40 percent of millennials also were in touch with the concept. However, centennials were the least familiar with disruptive innovation.
By industry, publishers were the most familiar with disruptive innovation. Perhaps because it has been facing disruption by digital competitors since the introduction of e-readers in the late ’90s, the publishing industry is one of the best modern examples of disruption. Other industries like manufacturing (41 percent), technology (44 percent) and retail (37 percent) also reported higher levels of understanding when we asked about disruptive innovation.
Looming Disruptive Concerns
Of those who acknowledged they were afraid of possible downsizing in their market, the publishing industry had the highest level of concern, with 50 percent of respondents telling us they were fearful of layoffs. While major layoffs in the publishing sector have already occurred, the continued trend toward digital publishing is a disruptive force that may have yet to fully run its course. Those in the retail industry (almost 49 percent) and construction (43 percent) also expressed fear of possible layoffs, perhaps because of disruptive innovations currently being developed and tested such as clerk-less stores and 3D printers capable of creating homes and commercial buildings.
The least concerned respondents worked in real estate, where less than 22 percent were concerned about layoffs. While real estate may seem like an industry that requires a human touch, certain research suggests artificial intelligence will reduce the number of them and could eventually even replace traditional real estate agents and brokers.
Already, artificial intelligence can automate house hunting processes. Consumers enter specific parameters into a computer (like location, budget, and preferences) and receive hundreds of recommended listings that match their request — largely for free and without having to set up a meeting and time to view!
Respondents who felt layoffs would most impact them were temporary employees (60 percent). Fifty-six percent of consultants and 53 percent of junior managers also admitted concerns about layoffs. Upper management, trained professionals, and administrative staff were the least concerned. Despite their cavalier attitude to being replaced, the 2016 Economic Report of the President to Congress offers a more dire assessment — those in the $40/hour wage range face a 31% chance of job loss due to automation.
Disruptive Innovation: For Better or Worse
When we asked survey respondents how they thought disruption might affect them, over 38 percent said it might cost them their jobs. Considering that almost half of those who understood disruptive innovation were concerned about layoffs, the fear of losing their job may come from a better understanding of the shifting marketplace.
Despite evidence to the contrary, 37 percent of participants didn’t think disruption would affect them at all, while almost 17 percent thought disruption might make their jobs easier. Additionally, around 4 percent were convinced their job would get easier, or they would be let go.
Professionals in publishing, retail and insurance were more likely to believe disruption might cost them their jobs, while respondents in real estate and the government believed disruption and the rising popularity of automated processes might ultimately make their jobs easier in the long run.
Anticipating Disruptive Innovation
The rise of artificial intelligence and other new technologies are already causing disruptions to governments around the world. It’s no surprise, then, that 35 percent of those in the field anticipate that major changes will come because of the internet. Speaking about the private sector, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking believes the advancements within artificial intelligence are a legitimate concern, one that could lead to many middle-class jobs disappearing from the workforce. Every job role, outside of those who are self-employed, generally feels the same way, regardless of industry.
Automation — or tasks being completed without the need for, or with minimal input from, humans — is the next largest concern in most industries. It’s the leading technology concern within the retail field. Malls and shopping areas that have failed to adapt to eCommerce are already seeing this play out with increased vacancies. Experience is one of the differentiators that automation hasn’t cracked — not yet, at least.
Life After Disruptive Innovation
If men and women are displaced due to disruption, their plans vary slightly as to whether they’d seek a new job in the same industry or a different one. Men were more likely to find a job in their current field (44 percent), while women were more likely to find a job in a different industry (45 percent). While some men (14 percent) and women (18 percent) would pursue additional education, it doesn’t seem to be the first choice for either gender.
Age also plays a factor in what respondents would do. Centennials (57 percent) and millennials (nearly 42 percent) would opt to find a new job within their current field — with the former being more likely to hit the books and seek additional education (19 percent). Over 30 percent of baby boomers would consider hanging up the “employed” status for good, choosing to retire instead of looking for another job.
Ahead of the Tech Curve
Artificial intelligence, digitization, and automation have already created a disruption in long-standing industries and societies and will continue to do so. The first and second industrial revolutions were periods of vast societal upheaval due to the way that they transformed the nature of labor. Disruptive innovation in this Third Industrial Revolution — with the ability of computers to reduce communication time, complete tasks and transform an ever-evolving number of data input into systems of pure information that can be reorganized into vast interactive networks that function akin to complex ecosystems — will be equally historic and important.
What the future holds for the professionals who work in fields looking to automate is still uncertain, but those informed about it will be at an advantage in how they respond to new tech developments. For those who understand disruptive innovation, almost half are concerned about downsizing and layoffs. However, even those that aren’t going to be replaced in the immediate future will be impacted by others’ jobs being automated. More unemployed people often translates to a depressionary effect on the wages of those employed. To address this and other effects, The Wall Street Journal has endorsed a guaranteed minimum income in the United States while countries like Switzerland and Finland are considering similar measures.

Sometimes it seems the clouds over climate science just won't lift. Computer models of Earth's climate have multiplied in number, complexity, and computational power, yet they remain unable to answer more precisely some of the questions most on the public's mind: How high must we build sea walls to last until 2100? How bad will heat waves get in the next decade? What will Arctic shipping routes look like in 2030? Climate models all agree that global temperatures will continue to rise in response to humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, but uncertainties stubbornly persist over how quickly that will happen and how high temperatures will go.
Tapio Schneider, a German-born climate dynamicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, believes climate science can do better. And he's not alone. Later this summer, an academic consortium led by Schneider and backed by prominent technology philanthropists, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, will launch an ambitious project to create a new climate model. Taking advantage of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), satellite imaging, and high-resolution simulation, that as-yet-unnamed model—the Earth Machine is one candidate—aims to change how climate models render small-scale phenomena such as sea ice and cloud formation that have long bedeviled efforts to forecast climate. A focus will be on the major source of uncertainty in current models: the decks of stratocumulus clouds that form off coastlines and populate the trade winds. A shift in their extent by just a few percentage points could turn the global thermostat up or down by a couple of degrees or more within this century—and current models can't predict which way they will go.
Within 5 years, the team hopes its AI-fortified model will drive out that uncertainty and others by learning on its own how clouds behave, from both actual observations and purpose-built cloud simulations. It's a lofty goal, Schneider admitted late one May afternoon in sun-soaked Pasadena, sitting outside with his newly assembled team. They had just wrapped up a workshop, the third he had convened in the past year, bringing together leading climate scientists and engineers to discuss the future of their field. ""We're under no illusions,"" Schneider said. ""This is not going to be a cakewalk.""

There are reasons for skepticism. The United States already has many climate models, and some people question why it needs another, further dividing resources. Others question the technology and wonder whether the philanthropists backing the project have given it the scrutiny that an agency such as the National Science Foundation would provide. The team's unorthodox message and means won't make it easy to win people over, says David Randall, a climatologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. ""I think the existing modeling centers will push back. If Tapio is getting funding, that in principle could have gone to someone else.""
Climate modelers have always followed two imperatives. First, they've folded ever more features of Earth into their simulations. Models once contained only the atmosphere and ocean; now, they have subroutines for ice sheets, land use, and the biosphere. Second, they've sought higher and higher resolutions—modeling interactions on smaller and smaller scales—riding the wave of Moore's law on government-owned supercomputers. By one estimate, the computing power those models use has increased by a factor of 100 million since the 1970s. As the models grew increasingly complex, they more fully reflected the vagaries of our planet—unknown unknowns turned to known unknowns. Yet the uncertainties remained.
At their most basic, all the models work the same way: They take the globe and chop it into a mesh, with cells some 25 kilometers to 50 kilometers on a side, and use a set of code called a dynamical core to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere and ocean over years and centuries. But much of what happens on the planet—cloud formation, for example—arises at scales smaller than those grids. Therefore, those phenomena have to be described indirectly—""parameterized"" in the jargon of climate science—with rule-of-thumb equations. The modelers then adjust those various knobs to best represent the world as they know it—a process called tuning. ""It's a mix of intuition and empiricism and some physically observed laws,"" says Isaac Held, Schneider's mentor and a scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a prominent modeling center in Princeton, New Jersey.Advertisement



Tapio Schneider hopes his planned global climate model will reduce uncertainties over how high and how fast temperatures will rise.

Make no mistake: Current models do an admirable job of re-creating the world. But their shortcomings drive scientists bonkers. They struggle to re-create Arctic temperatures and melting sea ice. Their distribution of rainfall is off, biased against the extreme torrents that can cause flooding. ""The rain is falling in the wrong place and at the wrong rate,"" says Paul O'Gorman, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who formerly worked with Schneider. And, especially important, the models often fail to simulate those thick stratocumulus clouds, which typically form off the coasts of the western Americas and help cool the region.
Schneider, 46, has not always been fixated on clouds. Early in his career at Caltech, he focused on large-scale atmospheric flows, such as the Hadley cell. That atmospheric conveyor belt shifts air from the equator to the subtropics—the type of pattern that climate models can simulate using simple laws of physics. But while on an appointment at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, he became increasingly convinced that climate models could do a better job integrating new data on cloud behavior. He returned to Caltech in 2016 to seek a solution, adding a joint appointment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, where he had become a close collaborator with one of JPL's cloud gurus, João Teixeira.
That was the start of what is now a collaboration of about two dozen people. AI, particularly a variant called machine learning, was on the upswing, and Schneider and Teixeira mused that it might help with the cloud problem. Soon they recruited Andrew Stuart, a soft-spoken computational mathematician at Caltech. The team found additional recruits at JPL, which has a vast archive of satellite data on clouds, and across the country at MIT, where researchers had built an ocean model infused with every possible satellite and buoy measurement of the seas.
The MIT group had ambitions to go bigger, and its members welcomed Schneider's overture. ""Always the idea was to go to an Earth system model,"" says MIT physical oceanographer Raffaele Ferrari. ""But the atmospheric community wasn't particularly primed to think the same way.""
At first, the nascent collaboration was not set on creating a new climate model; the United States already has six prominent models. ""It was more a question of how can we build a better model,"" Schneider says. But they wanted to be certain that a full climate model would incorporate their innovations. They decided the best way would be to build a new model, albeit one starting with existing code. Doing so meant they needed a computation whiz who could take their equations and make them run on a next-generation supercomputer.
A U.S. Navy expert reported for duty. Frank Giraldo, an applied mathematician at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, is behind the Navy's new dynamical core, the mathematical engine at the heart of its next-generation weather and climate models. His core, the Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere, is designed from the ground up for modern parallel computing. The core is also flexible and self-contained. It can solve equations to various degrees of accuracy in the same model, which should allow the Earth Machine to give a low-resolution overview of the planet while zooming in on clouds in real time.

Learning the climate
A new data-driven climate model will use satellite observations and high-resolution simulations to learn how best to render its clouds. Similar methods will also be applied to other, small-scale phenomena, such as sea ice and ocean eddies.

Crucial input to the new model will come from simulations that have recently painted a much sharper picture of the low clouds and how they behave. Called large eddy simulations (LESs), those models trade the global scale and centuries-long time horizons of a climate model for narrow scope and high resolution. The models re-create several days in the life of small parcels of the atmosphere, with cells only 10 meters on a side. At such resolutions, key aspects of cloud formation—such as the convection that lofts sun-heated air upward until the water vapor it carries condenses into clouds—arise directly from physical laws. The results sometimes closely resemble reality, says Chris Bretherton, a leading cloud scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Several years back, Bretherton led a project that used LESs to study how a 2°C temperature rise affected low ocean clouds. Two feedbacks emerged, both of which would exacerbate warming. First, higher temperatures appeared to allow more dry air to penetrate thin clouds from above, preventing them from thickening and reflecting more of the sun's energy. Second, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels trap heat near the clouds' tops, preventing their cooling. Because such cooling drives the turbulence that forms clouds, the effect could impede cloud formation, fueling further warming. If CO2 emissions continue unabated, Bretherton says, ""It's possible that most of our low clouds in the tropics would melt away.""
Other evidence, including actual cloud observations, also suggests ""that the low-cloud feedback is positive and that low clouds will amplify climate warming,"" says Stephen Klein, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
Those breakthroughs have not yet made their way into global models because no bridge, or technical way to get them there, has emerged. But Schneider's team is building one: an LES that can simulate cloud behavior over days within a domain of up to 100 kilometers on a side—about the size of one cell in a climate model. Their LES is based on a Caltech-developed model called the Python Cloud Large Eddy Simulation (PyCLES) that focuses on low clouds. ""These simulations may not be perfect,"" Schneider says, ""but they're much, much better than anything else we have."" If all goes according to plan, Giraldo's code will run 1000 PyCLES-type models on the fly as individual cells inside the Earth Machine. The machine will also use AI to study the observed and simulated clouds, extrapolating what it learns to improve the rules of thumb it uses to simulate clouds across the globe. Soon, virtual cloud decks will sprout off the California coast.
Incorporating AI into climate modeling is a work in progress. Several researchers, including Bretherton's group and Michael Pritchard, a climate modeler at the University of California, Irvine, trained one form of AI, neural networks, on high-resolution simulations of the atmosphere. They then used the AI to replace several classic rules of thumb, such as how quickly the temperature and humidity change in rising air. ""All of these are in the feeling-around type of phase,"" Bretherton says.

 

But neural networks and climate are an uneasy fit. The algorithms do best on problems such as classification—for example, learning from millions of labeled photos what a dog looks like. The code builds up an intricate model for what an object looks like that is often wholly inexplicable to human reasoning. The approach works for dogs—but may break down when it encounters something outside its training data—say, a camel. And for climate change, the future is a camel. For that reason, Stuart and Schneider are not banking on neural networks to guide the Earth Machine's AI. Instead, they seek a compromise, something between traditional rules of thumb and pure AI. They hope to develop code that can use hard-won knowledge of clouds and then fill in gaps with its learned intuition, essentially replacing the manual tuning typically done by modelers with a machine.
That learning won't be driven by individual cloud systems, which are imprinted with the atmospheric chaos that begat them. Rather, the AI will learn from seasonal or annual statistics on cloud coverage and other factors, wiping out the noise of weather. As Stuart and Schneider move each rule of thumb over to the AI's hands, they'll wire the model to calculate probabilities, allowing an overall reckoning of uncertainty not yet seen in current climate models. And, partly at the prompting of their engineering-minded funders, they'll develop metrics to gauge how accurately the model renders the world. They're betting on recent insights that, for some aspects of the climate system, short-term accuracy in a model indicates decades-long viability.
Success is far from guaranteed, the team agreed after the May workshop. ""It could be that what we do ends up not improving the numbers, just to be completely scientifically honest,"" Stuart said. But even so, he added, the approach should spark new ideas across climate modeling. ""I'd say that's the worst-case scenario,"" Schneider quickly interjected. ""This is why I say we can't fail entirely. But I do hope we will do more than that.""
As Schneider assembled his team and developed a general plan, he still faced a big question: Who would support their dream? That the U.S. government would finance yet another climate model seemed unlikely. Even before President Donald Trump's White House proposed cuts in climate science, former President Barack Obama's administration had explored whether the country needed to support so many models.
Fortunately for the Caltech team, the tech philanthropists—particularly Allen, who has already invested heavily in oceanography—were looking for something to make a splash. They sought a risky investment with a big potential payoff that could make climate forecasting more concrete. Schneider already had preliminary support for the Earth Machine from Charles Trimble, a Caltech alumnus who miniaturized the GPS receiver, and the Heising-Simons Foundation in Los Altos, California. But to reach their full ambitions, they needed more, some $5 million annually—a goal that now seems in sight, though the exact financing was still being finalized at press time.
The mix of ambition, metrics, and innovation embodied in the Earth Machine was exactly the type of work that Allen wants to fund, says Chris Emura, a Seattle, Washington-based computer engineer leading Allen's engagement with Schneider. Over the past year, Allen's team has been enmeshed in the modeling world, visiting leading centers to gauge what they can and can't do. Schneider's project, Emura says, has some audacity to it, with a high degree of ""responsible risk."" The team also has garnered interest from the Windward Fund, a conservation charity in Washington, D.C., that began an effort last month to support work that improves near-term practical climate predictions. And, this week, Schneider's endeavor confirmed backing from Schmidt Futures in New York City, the science-focused philanthropy of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Wendy Schmidt, president of the Schmidt Family Foundation in Palo Alto, California. ""It's an attractive blend of conservative and bold approaches,"" says Stuart Feldman, the philanthropy's chief scientist.


These simulations may not be perfect … but they're much, much better than anything else we have.


Tapio Schneider, California Institute of Technology


As rumors of the Earth Machine have spread, the project has drawn a mix of support, envy, and skepticism. A new approach like that is desperately needed, says Trude Storelvmo, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Oslo. ""This is a very welcome and innovative idea."" She adds that it could bolster the case for expanded observations of clouds—necessary because NASA's current cloud satellites have worked nearly a decade longer than planned.
In contrast, Amy Clement, a cloud scientist at the University of Miami in Florida, laments the focus on building more complex models. ""As a result, in my opinion, we are losing a lot of our ability to gain fundamental understanding of the climate system."" However, she adds, given Schneider's acumen as a climate scientist, the model might lead to such understanding. Bretherton, meanwhile, likes the group's ambitions but questions whether a new model is needed to realize them. ""We already have too many climate models in the United States,"" he says. ""It divides our resources and makes scientific progress slower.""
Other people think the project is discounting rewards that will come when existing models are pushed to run globally at higher resolutions. Much of the climate science community in Europe, for example, is invested in a proposal called Extreme Earth, which would push models to a resolution of 1 kilometer per cell. Although such code would require a network of supercomputers and wouldn't run as long as traditional models, it would also eliminate many parameters that Schneider is seeking to improve with AI, replacing them with physics. ""I'm so frustrated with the idea of parameterizing these things,"" says Bjorn Stevens, a climate scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. ""What I find more exciting is getting rid of those rules of thumb.""
There's also a big assumption baked into the Earth Machine: that the cloud problem can even be solved, adds Joel Norris, a cloud scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. Perhaps any sort of parameterization, even one tuned by AI, cannot crack clouds to a meaningful degree. ""It may be the case you can't reduce the uncertainty,"" Norris says. Some satellite observations essential to rendering clouds, such as the exact location of water vapor in the lower atmosphere, simply don't exist. And Schneider's team could be shocked when it sees how apparently unconnected parts of the model go awry when clouds are tweaked, Held adds. ""There's just a lot of connections.""
Schneider's team is aware of all those concerns and shares many of them. But the members are ambitious and have grown impatient waiting for a breakthrough. They've lived with human-driven climate change, and its dogged uncertainties, as a reality for their entire adult lives. It's time for the clouds to lift.

Since 1999 when the company was launched in founder Jack Ma's apartment, Alibaba's core business remains to sell goods, but its influence and operations have expanded to make it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.

China’s commitment to AI
One of the reasons Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies such as Tencent and Baidu, collectively known as BAT, are making extraordinary gains in artificial intelligence is the support, investment and commitment of the Chinese government to become the dominant AI player in the world. With plans to build a $1 trillion AI industry by 2030, China is on a path to overtake the United States as the world’s leader in technology. Along with an enormous population that generates critical data to inform AI algorithms and help make them better as well as a society who is keen on technological change and not as pushy on regulation, China is fertile ground to develop AI applications, and Alibaba is moving full throttle ahead.
In fact, Alibaba invested in seven research labs that will focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, network security, natural language processing and more.

Singles’ Day  leverages AI
Singles’ Day, once an anti-Valentine’s Day to celebrate being single has now transformed - thanks to Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma -


       Tmall Smart Selection: This AI-powered algorithm backed by deep learning and natural language processing helps recommend products to shoppers and then communicates to the retailers to increase inventory to keep up with the demand.
       Dian Xiaomi: This AI-powered chatbot can understand more than 90 percent of customer’s queries according to Alibaba and serves more than 3.5 million users a day. The latest version of the chatbot can understand a customer’s emotion and can prioritize and alert human customer service agents to intervene.

       Robots to pack: drones to deliver: More than 200 robots in automated warehouses can process 1 million shipments each day. Once the robots received the orders on Singles' Day, they packaged and shipped the goods, and, in some cases, their efficiency allowed same-day shipment. Alibaba also used drones for some deliveries.

These technological advances that helped power Singles’ Day last year resulted in $25 billion in sales, up from $17.8 billion in sales for Single’s Day 2016 and more than the GDP of Iceland and nearly $20 billion more than Cyber Monday in the U.S.
Turning physical shops into ""smart stores.""
In addition to turning some physical shops into “smart stores” for Singles’ Day, Alibaba is introducing “digitalization in a box” under its Tmall brand to smaller retailers. Alibaba has redone about 1 million mom-and-pop shops and 100 superstores McKinsey Global Institute, 42% of global e-commerce transactions took place in China, more than Japan, France, Germany, the UK and the U.S. combined. Many believe that it will only be those retailers who embrace digitization who will survive, and Alibaba is providing the structure to make it possible.
Investment in SenseTime, DAMO Academy, and research
As China’s largest R&D spender, Alibaba is the largest single investor in SenseTime; an AI start-up known for its facial-recognition technology, that launched an AI lab in Hong Kong. The lab hopes to ""advance the frontier of AI"" by supporting other start-ups as they commercialize their AI tech and develop ideas and products. Researchers and other industry participants can also collaborate with start-ups in the lab.
Alibaba plans to spend $15 billion over three years on DAMO (discovery, adventure, momentum, and outlook) Academy
City Brain: AI control for cities
With its City Brain project, Alibaba hopes to help cities run their operations by artificial intelligence. Already improving traffic issues, City Brain uses a cloud-based system where data about a city and everyone in it is stored and processed through AI algorithms. The project’s success in reducing traffic jams by 15% was achieved by monitoring every vehicle in the city. Already successful in Hangzhou, City Brain is going to Malaysia next.
In addition to these examples, Alibaba uses AI to optimize its supply chain, build products and drive personalized recommendations. Ultimately, Alibaba aspires to be the tech giant to provide cloud-based AI which would make AI available to anyone with a computer and internet connection as well as an AI chip available through the cloud.
With all of these applications, it shouldn’t be a surprise that Alibaba’s Cloud Unit recently signed a contract with a Chinese food and ag conglomerate Tequ Group to deploy facial and voice recognition on its pig farms. From traffic to pigs, what will Alibaba use AI and machine learning for next? We can’t wait to find out.

I’m supposed to interview him, once he can break away.

",,,,,,,,"When he was awarded the Fields Medal—widely regarded as the Nobel Prize for mathematics—in 2010, little did Cedric Villani know that he would embark on a political journey half a decade later.

A staunch proponent of European integration, the celebrated mathematician joined French president Emmanuel Macron’s political movement in 2016, adhering to its progressive voice and pledge to champion multilateralism and curb the populist tides that had swept the continent. Against all odds, Villani, who wears velvet cravats and gives Ted Talks about how sexy math is, ran for office on an ‘En Marche’ (Macron’s party) ticket and unseated a long-standing politician. 

France’s best-known scientist decided to shift to the policy arena to serve decision-makers with the expertise they desperately need and reconcile politics with science, tech and innovation. A few months into his current mandate, he authored a report on French artificial intelligence commissioned by Macron, outlining France’s long-term strategy to become a leader in the field, overhaul digital innovation around AI and make sure labor-market and technological disruptions support inclusivity and diversity. 

Adweek met with Villani to discuss his vision for French AI, his approach to integrating it across Europe and plans to lure foreign players. 

Adweek: It's a rare thing to see scientists get involved in electoral politics. What prompted you?
Cedric Villani: I have always been interested in politics, and I have published countless white papers about a host of policy issues. But indeed, it wasn’t natural to run for office and seek public representation. The previous administration had tried to offer me cabinet positions, but I had declined. This time, I really felt aligned with Macron’s vision for Europe and approach to propel France into the 21st century, finally. 

Also, when I’m looking at the pressing issues facing France, Europe and the planet, I had the feeling that our politicians weren’t up to the task. We needed additional technical expertise. And on the campaign trail, Macron had shown a deep understanding of future environmental, technological and social trends. 

But beyond that, there is this idea that scientists and engineers should be at the service of policy makers to guide their decisions. For example, in the context of my work on AI, I’m now contributing to a new report on hyperloop transport technologies, an area on which many elected officials are poorly informed. Overall, working in politics is fascinating. It’s one of the only fields where you can tackle and have an impact on a series of issues. It’s also a real honor to represent my constituents, their interests and their aspirations.

What’s the main takeaway from your report?
Our priority is research and development. It’s where competition is the fiercest, with Asian countries, notably. We’re also fighting for AI talent, scientists and engineers, which will become tomorrow’s raw commodities. 

France’s AI strategy is now centered around three pillars: experimentation, sharing and sovereignty. And these will underpin policies and investments. To achieve our goals, we’re setting up ethics committees to regulate and monitor AI developments, training programs to build the right workforce around AI and interdisciplinary learning at the university level to breed new talent. It’s an action plan that will be deployed over the next few years. 

Are these investments up to the task ahead?
Our investment plans are between $1 billion and $10 billion, depending on whether you factor in public-private partnerships. At first glance, it’s not much compared to what is being allocated by China or Germany, but there are a few things to consider. Those investments will only target research, development and innovation. These investments will be complemented by further action on education, employment and training, and they will be subject to change as trends in AI evolve. 

What will matter more in the near future is what will be done at the European level to support European champions capable of competing with China and the U.S. But AI is not just a question of investment. It’s a question of political will. And Emmanuel Macron is the first French president who is thoroughly committed to finally breeding a culture of innovation. This strategy will work if we foster synergies between the private sector, policy-makers, higher education institutions and so on. 

How will you measure the success of this program?
We haven’t set tangible KPIs, but we will examine how many jobs we can create, how much job destruction we can avoid through training, how many top tech firms in the field we can elevate on the global stage, how many startups have will have emerged through our support and so on. 

Thanks to this roadmap, how will France’s top tech, media and telecoms firms be involved?
Bringing leading businesses on board is the priority underpinning this roadmap. There is a vast awareness and training challenge ahead of us. We also need to mobilize our research institutes, which will play a key role. Right now, AI research institutes are scattered across the country. That’s where innovation will start. These research institutes will then serve the private and public sector to inform training and policy and bolster national champions. We are remodeling research around the private sector’s AI needs. That’s the revolution. 

France lacks a giant such as Apple or Google. Can this program shape the rise of such a player?
Again, it’s a question of scale. We need European actors using European technology. I don’t know if we can breed giants such as Apple or Google in the near future, but if it ever happens, it will take shape at the European level. We have different economic structures, models and consumption patterns. 

But it is vital to support our won leaders in tech and telecoms such as Orange to equip them with homegrown technology. There is this narrative around the GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) being independent, but they were also supported by public research, public policy and protectionist measures such as the Buy American Act. 

Your report focused on four key sectors: transport and security, health, the environment and defense. Why?
We are emphasizing these sectors in which we have national champions, but also because it is urgent for us to forge the right industrial and tech policies to support them. These are sectors where we need to focus on experimentation because AI is already playing a key role. In trailing industries, we need to invest more. For instance, our financial sector will not complete its AI transition without our help. Of the four sectors you mentioned, the environment is the most interesting. It highlights President Macron’s commitment to curbing climate change, notably by using AI to usher in a new era for sustainable agriculture. 

The FrenchTech label has been gaining resonance worldwide. Are you working closely with that ecosystem?
FrenchTech is a quality label and an extraordinary ecosystem with which we will be working very closely. We have seen the success of French Tech labeled firms in startup and tech fairs around the world. Our role is really to guide and help these French AI and tech firms raise funds and gain international recognition. 

President Macron and his administration have hammered out the message “France is back.” What do you have to say to foreign actors looking at French AI and French innovation?
Yes, we are obsessed with restoring France’s standing in the business and tech communities worldwide. We have a bastion of startups with state of the art technologies and innovation that deserve the attention of foreign investors and risk capital. But they were undermined by previous policies. So we’re gaining momentum. Macron has also signaled to the world that our AI and economic strategies and innovation policies are part of a greater plan for European cooperation. 

AI comes with countless opportunities, but also many threats. How are you trying to address the underlying dangers of AI?
Protecting citizens from the dangers of AI is also a key priority. On the one hand, we need to anticipate employment trends and protect and retrain those who will lose their jobs. On the other hand, we have to address data protection. That’s why we’re establishing Ethics Committees that will be responsible for overseeing and regulating the impact of AI on data privacy. The GDPR is an excellent first step. Finally, we need to develop better expertise on the regulatory side. Regulators are not trained on AI and are ill-equipped to anticipate looming threats, audit algorithms and so on. 

What’s your vision for AI training? How do we retain talent?
My blueprint recommends a three-tiered approach. First, train and support leading talents, engineers and researchers to build an AI elite. For that, we also need more public-private partnerships like those that can be found in the U.S. so that we can have top engineers working on AI innovation in French universities but also supporting startups on tech firms. 

Then, we need to train and develop a technical workforce through apprenticeships, professional degrees and so on. These are the jobs of the future that will assist tomorrow’s most qualified engineers. 

And finally, we need to teach people who don’t have technical backgrounds on how to use AI tools in their professions: lawyers, teachers, PR professionals, consultants, etc. We need European cooperation to retain talent. 

We need a European network for AI to allow students and professionals to train in different countries. We must inspire young talents to develop something fabulous at home. In a sense, we need to breed a form of European solidarity towards AI and a patriotic spirit of innovation and science. 

The Germans, through their research centers, have already carved a path to achieve this objective. Consider leading figures in the field—such as Yann LeCun in France or Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton in Canada—who are icons in deep learning; they decided to support research and innovation at home when the largest multinational firms were trying to hire them. 

Justin Trudeau told me that Bengio aims to stay in Canada to make his country a leader in the field. But for now, these are exceptions. If a French talent wants to develop a homegrown model for autonomous vehicles, we need to provide the resources, databases, public data and support for him to accomplish his goals.",,,,https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/frances-top-mathematician-turned-politician-discusses-artificial-intelligence/,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/logo-black.png'}",,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Q&#038;A: France&#8217;s Top Mathematician-Turned-Politician Discusses Artificial Intelligence', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/frances-top-mathematician-turned-politician-discusses-artificial-intelligence/', 'datePublished': '2018-07-23T13:47:54-04:00', 'articleBody': ""When he was awarded the Fields Medal—widely regarded as the Nobel Prize for mathematics—in 2010, little did Cedric Villani know that he would embark on a political journey half a decade later.\r\n\r\nA staunch proponent of European integration, the celebrated mathematician joined French president Emmanuel Macron’s political movement in 2016, adhering to its progressive voice and pledge to champion multilateralism and curb the populist tides that had swept the continent.

Our role is really to guide and help these French AI and tech firms raise funds and gain international recognition. \r\n\r\nPresident Macron and his administration have hammered out the message “France is back.” What do you have to say to foreign actors looking at French AI and French innovation?\r\nYes, we are obsessed with restoring France’s standing in the business and tech communities worldwide. We have a bastion of startups with state of the art technologies and innovation that deserve the attention of foreign investors and risk capital. But they were undermined by previous policies. So we’re gaining momentum. Macron has also signaled to the world that our AI and economic strategies and innovation policies are part of a greater plan for European cooperation. \r\n\r\nAI comes with countless opportunities, but also many threats. How are you trying to address the underlying dangers of AI?\r\nProtecting citizens from the dangers of AI is also a key priority. On the one hand, we need to anticipate employment trends and protect and retrain those who will lose their jobs. On the other hand, we have to address data protection. That’s why we’re establishing Ethics Committees that will be responsible for overseeing and regulating the impact of AI on data privacy. The GDPR is an excellent first step. Finally, we need to develop better expertise on the regulatory side. Regulators are not trained on AI and are ill-equipped to anticipate looming threats, audit algorithms and so on. \r\n\r\nWhat’s your vision for AI training? How do we retain talent?\r\nMy blueprint recommends a three-tiered approach. First, train and support leading talents, engineers and researchers to build an AI elite. For that, we also need more public-private partnerships like those that can be found in the U.S. so that we can have top engineers working on AI innovation in French universities but also supporting startups on tech firms. \r\n\r\nThen, we need to train and develop a technical workforce through apprenticeships, professional degrees and so on. These are the jobs of the future that will assist tomorrow’s most qualified engineers. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, we need to teach people who don’t have technical backgrounds on how to use AI tools in their professions: lawyers, teachers, PR professionals, consultants, etc. We need European cooperation to retain talent. \r\n\r\nWe need a European network for AI to allow students and professionals to train in different countries. We must inspire young talents to develop something fabulous at home. In a sense, we need to breed a form of European solidarity towards AI and a patriotic spirit of innovation and science. \r\n\r\nThe Germans, through their research centers, have already carved a path to achieve this objective. Consider leading figures in the field—such as Yann LeCun in France or Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton in Canada—who are icons in deep learning; they decided to support research and innovation at home when the largest multinational firms were trying to hire them. \r\n\r\nJustin Trudeau told me that Bengio aims to stay in Canada to make his country a leader in the field. But for now, these are exceptions. If a French talent wants to develop a homegrown model for autonomous vehicles, we need to provide the resources, databases, public data and support for him to accomplish his goals."", 'author': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alexis Chemblette', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/contributor/alexis-chemblette/'}], 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Adweek', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/logo-black.png'}}, 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cedric-Villani-ai-CONTENT-2018.jpg'}, 'description': ""Fields Medal winner Cedric VIllani discusses the three pillars of the nation's AI strategy: experimentation, sharing and sovereignty.""}","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}","['https://www.facebook.com/Adweek/', 'https://twitter.com/Adweek', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/adweek', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKhCJRTHHLuW2iW7XQtcfyQ', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@adweek', 'https://www.instagram.com/adweek/']",,,

Artificial intelligence is moving from buzzword to functional reality in the hotel industry. The technology is making inroads in a variety of ways, from  personalizing experiences and optimizing rate and occupancy to reputation management, and now InterContinental Hotels Group has created smart rooms fueled by artificial intelligence.The company has teamed up with Baidu on the rooms, which go beyond offering voice assistants that require specific instructions. Guests can do things like tell their room they are “going to sleep,” and the room will recognize the phrase and know what to do with the information, such closing the curtains and turning off the lights. A total of 100 AI powered Club InterContinental suites will be available at InterContinental hotels in gateway cities and key destinations across China within the year.Customized for InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, the AI solution is developed by Baidu’s DuerOS Platform. It integrates AI technology with hotel operations, and this is supported by hardware upgrade and cloud service. The AI smart room will use voice-control technology to deliver a more natural human-computer interactive experience. For instance, guests will be able to freely switch settings between work and leisure modes, and enjoy a more convenient and seamless roomservice experience. This solution will also further fine-tune the current backstage-management system, including customizing information and resetting devices, making hotel management a simpler task.“Millennials are particularly sensitive to technology, often seeking new things to try,” Lin Wang, VP of marketing, IHG Greater China, said in a statement.  “The AI Smart Room will undoubtedly be extremely attractive for them, paving the way for a new level of modernization and consumer satisfaction. We will continue to make use of cutting-edge technology in hotel service and facilities in the future, and we hope this will further strengthen customer awareness and appreciation of smart technology. Meanwhile, we will provide more efficient operation and management services to our hotel owners.”IHG and Baidu inked a strategic partnership on AI development last November. The application of AI has gone beyond smart homes and automatic driving, and now marks a new milestone in the hospitality industry. IHG and Baidu will continue the exploration and innovation in intelligent hospitality solutions, creating more smart options and experiences for guests.InterContinental isn’t the only brand rushing to embrace technology in the hopes of wowing business travelers and wooing millennials. Marriott International is piloting a new facial recognition check-in program in China, and IBM Watson Advertising and Best Western have teamed up to create a new interactive ad powered by artificial intelligence. The ad personalizes vacation planning by providing consumers with travel tips and tricks, recommendations for local accommodations, and special offers based on their travel preferences.In addition, Japanese hotelier Fujita Kanko is implementing a multilingual chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to handle guest inquiries on the websites for some of its Japanese-based properties. Website visitors can use the chatbot in Japanese, English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese or Korean to receive 24/7 assistance.

Yet universities are not adequately preparing students for a changing world. To better prepare students for a changing world, AI needs to be increasingly embedded into higher education.

For students, AI will inevitably impact their careers. Those interested in careers in AI could pursue a wide range of exciting new career possibilities focused on data science, machine learning or advanced statistics. And, even students not focused on AI would benefit from a sound education in artificial intelligence and familiarity with working with machines.
The AI era will inevitably create new job types, ranging from machine regulators to emotion engineers. To succeed, all students will need to understand, at least at a high level, how machines perform. In addition, they should better equip themselves to do what machines cannot do.
PROMOTED
Moreover, traditional roles such as business analyst, sales, human resources and others will be augmented by AI, requiring a new degree of proficiency for front-line staff to interact with machines. Executives and managers will need to work with machines in strategic decision-making and problem-solving roles.

McKinsey predicts that AI will replace up to 800 million jobs by 2030. That’s a drastic reshaping of the workforce — and one that universities can and should help students prepare for. While some schools have world-class AI and technology programs, others have ample room for improvement.
Based on my observations as a Stanford University graduate now working for an AI company, Aera Technology, I’d like to share ideas on how universities can improve student readiness through curriculum requirements, projects with corporations and mentorship programs.

Curriculum Requirements
While it’s impossible for universities to keep up with the rate of change in the technology industry, I recommend that universities re-evaluate their core curriculums to ensure that students are prepared for the new age of employment that is approaching. I strongly advise all universities to incorporate computer science, entrepreneurship and social impact classes into curriculums.
By taking computer science classes, students will be able to understand the back-end systems that drive machines. At a minimum, a high-level understanding of machines is necessary to operate in an augmented workforce.

Entrepreneurship is another focus area, as continuous innovation has become the standard across industries. Entrepreneurship no longer solely drives startups, but it also drives large companies. For students to become leaders in the workplace, they should understand the principles of entrepreneurship and how they can innovate in any environment.
And social impact is more important than ever before. If you are going to build, sell or use AI, IoT or other technologies, you have to be able to understand what impact the technology will have on society. Inherently, by working in the world of technology, you are driving change. Technologists have a societal obligation to drive positive change as much as possible.
Projects with Corporations
One thing I am surprised I do not see at more universities are classes driven by projects with corporations. All students should have the opportunity to take classes that enable them to see how their academic curriculum is setting them up for their careers in the new machine-driven world.
With a complete reshaping of the workforce, getting out of the classroom is necessary for students to understand the emerging job opportunities. An increase in university-corporate projects would provide students with the experience required to determine which careers to pursue. These projects would help companies gain new perspectives and reflect positively on universities.
Mentorship Programs
In college, it is important for students to receive guidance from mentors. With the vast amount of opportunities available, students can become overwhelmed. Through the effective matching of mentors, they can gain insights into how to set up their careers, utilize technology and select the best employer.
Additionally, mentors can offer support throughout the ups and downs of choosing a career path in the new AI world. These programs should be fairly easy to set up since many university alumni want to give back to current students.
Of course, it also falls on students to conduct due diligence on which institutions are geared up to help undergraduates excel in a tech-driven future. Universities that embed AI learning and experience into the academic environment will benefit with positive reviews and successful alumni as AI transforms the job market.Stephanie GlassFollowingFollowI am the Director of Product Marketing at Clari.
