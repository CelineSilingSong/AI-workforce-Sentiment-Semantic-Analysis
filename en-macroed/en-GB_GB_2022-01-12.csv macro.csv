  <li>The Alan Turing Institute selected to lead pilot of a new AI Standards Hub supported by the  British Standards Institution and National Physical Laboratory</li>
  <li>Hub is part of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a> and will aim to increase UK contribution to development of global AI technical standards </li>
  <li>Comes as new research finds more than 1.3 million UK businesses will use AI by 2040 and spending on AI is expected to reach more than £200 billion by the same date</li>
</ul>

<p>The new AI Standard Hub will create practical tools for businesses, bring the UK’s AI community together through a new online platform, and develop educational materials to help organisations develop and benefit from global standards. This will help put the UK at the forefront of this rapidly developing area.</p>

<p>The Hub will work to improve the governance of AI, complement pro-innovation regulation and unlock the huge economic potential of these technologies to boost investment and employment now the UK has left the European Union.</p>

<p>BSI, the UK National Standards Body, and NPL, the country’s national metrology institute, will share their world-class expertise in developing standards and research to deliver the pilot with The Alan Turing Institute, the national institute for data science and AI. The hub is backed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Office for AI (OAI). </p>

<p>The move kicks off one part of the UK’s new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>, a ten-year plan to strengthen the country’s position as a global science superpower and “harness AI to transform the economy and society while leading governance and standards to ensure everyone benefits”.</p>

<p>DCMS Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy Chris Philp said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s imperative the UK remains at the forefront of this transformative technology which is already improving our lives and has huge potential to create new jobs and wealth. </p>

  <p>Today I’m confirming that the renowned Alan Turing Institute will lead the trial of a new UK programme with support from the British Standards Institution and National Physical Laboratory to help shape and improve the global standards for artificial intelligence. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It marks the first step in delivering our new National AI Strategy and will develop the tools needed so organisations and consumers can benefit from all the opportunities of AI. We want the UK to lead the world in developing AI standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-activity-in-uk-businesses"" class=""govuk-link"">research</a> published today predicts that the use of AI by businesses will more than double in the next twenty years, with more than 1.3 million UK businesses using artificial intelligence by 2040. </p>

<p>It shows that in 2020, UK businesses spent around £63 billion on AI technology and AI related-labour and this is expected to reach more than £200 billion by 2040. </p>

<p>The UK is already successful in this field. According to <a rel=""external"" href=""https://technation.io/news/talent-key-to-helping-ai-sector-unlock-huge-opportunity/"" class=""govuk-link"">Tech Nation</a>, the UK now has more than 1,300 AI companies – a 600 per cent increase in the number of firms over the last decade. In the same period, venture capital investment rocketed from $120 million to more than $3.4 billion in 2020.
 
The huge potential of AI technologies to power new firms and revolutionise old ones with improved productivity and more flexible ways of working demonstrates the need for tools to govern its development, ethics and use, including through globally developed technical standards. </p>

<p>In its pilot phase, the new hub will focus on: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Growing UK engagement to develop global AI standards by bringing together information about technical standards and development initiatives in an accessible, user-friendly and inclusive way. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bringing the AI community together through workshops, events and a new online platform to encourage more coordinated engagement in the development of standards around the world.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating tools and guidance for education, training and professional development to help businesses and other organisations engage with creating AI technical standards, and collaborate globally to develop these standards. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploring international collaboration with similar initiatives to ensure the development of technical standards are shaped by a wide range of AI experts, in line with shared values. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ahead of the pilot’s launch, there will be a series of roundtables with a wide range of organisations led by The Alan Turing Institute to shape the Hub’s activities. </p>

<p>The move follows the launch of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation’s (CDEI) ‘<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-roadmap-to-an-effective-ai-assurance-ecosystem"" class=""govuk-link"">roadmap to an effective AI assurance ecosystem</a>’, which is also part of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>. The roadmap sets out the steps needed to develop world-leading products and services to verify AI systems and accelerate AI adoption. Technical standards are vital for enabling effective AI assurance because they give organisations a common basis for verifying AI.</p>

<p>George Freeman, BEIS Minister for Science, Research and Innovation said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The transformative impact of AI is quickly becoming central to our economy and society, already playing a key role in everything from climate science and medical diagnostics to factory robotics and climate change mapping.</p>

  <p>The UK is one of the world’s most advanced developers and users of AI.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The key to building on this is maintaining public trust through leading in global regulation and standards. That’s why I am thrilled to see the esteemed Alan Turing Institute selected to lead the pilot of our AI Standards Hub, helping to shape and strengthen the governance of AI globally while reinforcing the UK’s position at the forefront of AI technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adrian Smith, Director and Chief Executive of The Alan Turing Institute said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International standards are set to play an increasingly crucial enabling role in the adoption and effective governance of AI technologies. Given our place at the heart of the UK’s thriving AI ecosystem, I am delighted to see the Turing identified as the home of this important new initiative. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We look forward to working closely with our partners in establishing the AI Standards Hub, leveraging our expertise and networks to build and engage an inclusive, multi-stakeholder community around AI standardisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scott Steedman CBE FREng, Director-General, Standards at BSI said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International standards are a vital tool to help unlock the economic potential of AI, including establishing a common language for all to use. BSI, as the National Standards Body is ideally placed to convene the AI community in the UK to identify and develop good practices for the development, governance and use of AI technologies that will be internationally recognized. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We look forward to working closely with government, industry, academia, consumer interest groups and our international standards network to ensure that UK-led, globally relevant standards, will underpin and foster the future of AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Peter Thompson FREng, CEO, NPL said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted that, following the recommendations made in the National AI Strategy last year, we are now launching the UK’s International AI Standards hub pilot. This coordinated UK effort will strengthen our world leading position and is an important step in supporting research and innovators in this area as well as providing a layer of confidence to those using and interacting with AI. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">As digital technology standards develop at pace it is critical that NPL, as the UK’s National Metrology Institute, applies its expertise to ensure confidence across technologies and the associated data to support a safe and secure digital world. We look forward to working with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Office for AI (OAI), BSI and the Alan Turing Institute, to accomplish this.</p>

<p>AI is playing an increasing role in both technical innovation and artistic creativity. Legislatures are starting to examine how patents and copyright can incentivize AI development and innovation, while continuing to promote human creativity and innovation. As AI adoption continues, this issue is becoming front and center; for example, we recently <a href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2021/10/us-court-rules-artificial-intelligence-systems-are-not-inventors"">wrote</a> about a US court&rsquo;s decision on whether an AI system could be listed as an inventor on a patent. </p>
<p>The UK IPO consultation sought to understand the evidence and views on the intellectual property rights associated with inventions and creative works developed by AI. Specifically, the consultation looked into the following three areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Copyright protection for computer-generated works without a human author. If work is created by AI, should the work be protected, and if so, how? The United Kingdom is one of the few countries that protect works generated by a computer where there is no human creator. Currently, this protection lasts for 50 years from the date the work is made. </li>
    <li>Licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining. Text and data mining is the use of automated computational techniques to analyze large amounts of information to identify patterns, trends, and other information. To data mine, it is often necessary to acquire a copyright license or to rely on a copyright exception, which the United Kingdom introduced in 2014. </li>
    <li>Patent protection for AI-devised inventions. Should the IPO protect inventions made by AI, and if so, how? The IPO has already received two patent applications which name an AI system as the inventor. However, the Court of Appeal has confirmed that UK patent applicants must name a human inventor or inventors. </li>
</ul>
<p>According to the IPO, any measures it implements should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>encourage innovation in AI technology and promote its use for the public good, </li>
    <li>preserve the central role of intellectual property in promoting human creativity and innovation, and</li>
    <li>be based on the best available economic evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some argue that protection for AI-generated works will incentivize investment in AI technology. Others advocate that protecting AI-generated works may promote these works at the expense of human-created works, and such protection could reduce innovation and competition. For example, reduced innovation costs associated with AI-devised inventions could result in a larger volume of patents held by a smaller number of persons or entities.</p>
<p>The UK government is now in the process of assessing responses to the consultation, and the information obtained will inform a government decision on any changes to legislation. We will keep you updated on any announcements. </p>",,N/A,N/A,N/A,Artificial Intelligence and UK Intellectual Property Consultation Copyright and Patents,https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2022/01/artificial-intelligence-and-uk-intellectual-property-consultation-copyright-and-patents,,,,,,,,

Across the country, it’s quitting time. Hiring continues to sputter, with payrolls rising by only 199,000 across the United States. While the December Jobs Report shows that unemployment fell to just 3.9%, a more troubling statistic lurks beneath these results. A record number of people quit their jobs in 2021 - over 40 million, when you factor in the 4.5 million that clocked out in December. For the workers that remain, the nature of work - and the resolution to that restless nature - is transforming the job market.


For many employees - over 50 million, in fact - low hourly wages and scant benefits are the only option. (For perspective, consider that the US labor force is about 162 million in total). The US Private Sector Job Quality Index (JQI) shows that the quality of jobs has significantly declined in quality, as reported by Jack Kelly in Forbes. An increase in lower-level jobs, and a decrease in those willing to apply for them, is creating a powerful (and potentially troubling) decision matrix - tipping the scales in favor of automation, robotics and AI (artificial intelligence). A disinterested labor force, a proliferation of lousy jobs, and improvements in automation: these factors are creating a perfect storm for making smart machines. Is the economy tilted towards building the workforce it needs, because it can’t hire the workforce it wants?

“We’re Not Gonna Take It”
In The Work of the Future: Building Better Jobs in an Age of Intelligent Machines, (Coming soon from MIT Press) there are two faces of technological change: task automation and new work creation. What happens when people don’t want to do the work that’s being created? Authors David Autor, David Mindell and Elizabeth Reynolds offer a sobering assessment: “The US has allowed traditional channels of worker voice to atrophy without fostering new institutions or buttressing existing ones. It has permitted the federal minimum wage to recede to near irrelevance.” With the disappearance of meaningful work, will our sense of identity and fulfillment also suffer? “Work is a way that we can learn, exercise our powers of perception, imagination and judgment, collaborate socially and make constructive social contributions,” writes MIT Advisory Board Member Josh Cohen. “Not simply a source of income.”

PROMOTED
Bullish on Bots
Global X, a $40 billion dollar investment firm with an appetite for automation, says that 2022 is a key turning point for robotics. The disruption in the supply chain - including the supply of labor - is setting up “a huge surge in spending on robotics and artificial intelligence,” says Jay Jacobs, Senior VP for the fund. “We think we’re going to be in the golden era of robotics adoption for the United States,” he tells CNBC. Global X’s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (an exhange-traded fund that focuses on bots in business) is up 140% since its 2016 launch. The 10-year growth forecast for industrial robots has more than doubled, from $16 billion to $37 billion, according to Jacobs.

Even with the prevalence of low-paying jobs, labor costs are rising. The laws of supply and demand are at work: reducing the labor supply increases the price of labor. The pains of the pandemic continue to stress the job market, from front-line healthcare workers to hospitality and beyond. Many workers are out sick, dealing with the onslaught of the Omicron variant - while everyone wonders how long it will be until this new wave subsides.

Economic Factors: Balancing Quality and Quantity
While unemployment may be low, the nature of the work hasn’t changed. Quantity is not the same as quality, and workers are seeking a greater quality of life. “Workers aren’t just quitting; they’re rethinking what they want out of work - and shifting their expectations about professional life,” writes Forbes editor, Jena McGregor.

Seems workers are hungry for other options. And so are employers.
Without a willing and compliant labor market, the trend towards automation is a business necessity. Consider an unmasked robot, with no childcare concerns and no need for rest: that robot has a skillset that’s attractive to many employers. Dataquest predicts the following trends for robotics in 2022, in an article outlining the “robot revolution”:

The Advancement of “Cobots” - according to Dataquest, these robots are designed to work alongside people in a safe and effective manner. Equipped with sensors and software, these robots detect changes in their work environment in real-time - with an emphasis on keeping people safe. No word on how or if these machines will protect your job, however.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) Creating Contact-free Experiences - as the pandemic changes with each new variant, the need for social distancing remains. In retail and B2B environments, making transactions seamless and contactless is the goal here.
Smart Factories - manned by robots, featuring low-cost sensors and an unstoppable immunity to COVID, Dataquest says “previously impossible things may become extremely realistic.”
The Rise of RPA (robot-process-automation): “In the healthcare industry, for example, RPA is utilized to automate many activities like as billing, inventory management, and appointment scheduling. The organization established an RPA technique to improve employee experience by relieving them of tedious work and allowing them to focus on what they do best,” Dataquest says.

It was Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Malcolm) in Jurassic Park who said, “Nature finds a way.” From dinosaurs to the data-driven economy, the rules are the same. If people won’t do certain jobs, those jobs still need to get done. Nature, in this case, is the nature of capitalism. Capitalism finds a way, when certain resources are blocked, indisposed, or unwilling. While the search for personal freedom has led many to rethink what work really means, businesses around the globe are still working to get things done.
With or without human resources, the needs of society (and the demands of the marketplace) will continue to drive investment in automation, robotics and AI. In this golden age of worker defections, are we opening the door to the greater influence of machines? Maybe it’s only nature finding a way, given the state of the labor market - and the ongoing appetite for automated solutions.

Some of the companies working on the newest advances in artificial intelligence are becoming focused on quantifying the progress that they've achieved, and benchmarking some aspects of how artificial intelligence has evolved over time. There are numerous reasons why companies are pursuing these types of analysis. In general, they are trying to figure out how far artificial intelligence has come, how it applies to our lives, and how it will affect markets.
Some companies are brainstorming and monitoring their artificial intelligence progress to figure out how new technologies may affect civil liberties, or how they might create new economic realities. Depending on the company's approach, these types of analysis may take the form of trying to figure out how user data may flow through systems, understanding how interfaces will work, or figuring out what capabilities artificial intelligence entities have and how they might use those capabilities.
When it comes to methods, companies that are trying to benchmark artificial intelligence may focus on breaking down abstract information – for instance, a Wired article cites the AI Index project, where researchers like Ray Perrault, who works at nonprofit lab SRI International, are working on a detailed snapshot of what's going on in the artificial intelligence field.
“This is something that needs to be done, in part because there's so much craziness out there about where AI is going,” Perrault says in the article, commenting on the motivation for taking on this type of project.
In explaining how benchmarking artificial intelligence works, some experts are explaining that engineers or other parties may be trying to pursue “hard testing” for artificial intelligence projects, for instance, trying to “trick” or “defeat” artificial intelligence systems. This kind of description really goes to the heart of how companies can truly monitor and evaluate artificial intelligence. One way to think about this is to apply the same kinds of ideas that programmers used in past times to debug linear code systems.
Debugging linear code systems was all about finding the spots where the system would work well – where a program would crash, where it would freeze, where it would run slow, etc. It was about finding where logical errors would halt or confound a project, where a function wouldn't work correctly, or where there might be some unintended user event.
When you think about it, modern testing of artificial intelligence may be a similar endeavor on a very different plane – because the artificial intelligence technologies are more cognitive than linear, that testing takes a much different form, but humans are still looking for “the bugs” – ways that these programs may have unintended consequences, ways that they might act out and harm human institutions, etc. With that in mind, although there are many different divergent methods of creating a speedometer or benchmark for artificial intelligence progress, the types of hard testing described above will generally give the humans unique insight into how far artificial intelligence has come, and what has to be done to keep it delivering more positives without developing more negatives.

In his article for the Digital Journal, Saratendu Sethi argues that to build a sustainable global supply chain requires the humanization of AI. This technological revolution, he says, includes “truly autonomous and self-correcting supply chains” that will replace the flawed capital-driven decision making of humans. Sethi defines this utilitarian mission of serving the “greater good” through what he calls a “sustainable, ethical and responsible world that puts equity for all at the center.” 
His motive of helping everyone while protecting the environment is commendable, yet the larger question remains, whose ethic will drive the logic used by this AI? When resources are limited, how will this AI decide who gets food and who gets medicine? Based on my own study, Sethi’s proposal for an ethical decision-making AI sounds eerily familiar to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and there is a lesson we can learn here.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
Eric Steinhart considers Pierre Teilhard de Chardin the first transhumanist thinker to give “serious consideration to the future of human evolution” through the use of genetic engineering and technologies to achieve a new cosmic-intelligence that would transcend humanity itself.[1] Teilhard crafted a new theology that was wholly dependent on Darwin’s evolutionary narrative that the cosmos — birthed in chaos — was steadily evolving toward eternal perfection. This perfection could only be achieved by tethering the current state of imperfect anthropology to the future hope of a perfect cosmic singularity. It must not be overlooked, however, that Teilhard’s method of transforming humanity was grounded in his commitment to eugenics. 
The eugenics movement in the early twentieth century employed techniques of population control such as oral contraception, social isolation, forced sterilization, welfare, abortion, and family planning to achieve the goal of genetic fitness for a superior human race. But for Teilhard, “eugenics applied to individuals leads to eugenics applied to society.”[2] Therefore Teilhard, like Sethi, reasoned that the future of human existence must be guided by the reasonable organization of the world’s limited resources.
Teilhard believed that industrialization had forced an overpopulation of the earth. On the brink of famine and suffocation, steps must be taken to ensure that the best of humanity survived. The challenge to build a better mankind, wrote Teilhard, demanded the use of, “individual eugenics (breeding and education designed to produce only the best individual types) and racial eugenics (the grouping or intermixing of different ethnic types being not left to chance but effected as a controlled process in the proportions most beneficial to humanity as a whole).”[3] While these methods involved both technological and psychological challenges, Teilhard believed that science, alongside his theology, would guide human evolution toward a better future. Yet, the moral duty of Teilhard’s transhumanism required a repudiation of the traditional Christian ethic that valued every individual human as created in the image of God. Society, he believed, must be willing to sacrifice the individual for the greater good of humanity and sustainability of nature.
I have no way of knowing if Sethi and Teilhard share the same ethic or anthropology, but without a doubt they share the utilitarian goal of a ‘sustainable’ future. This potential for disagreement on such basic questions about morality and human dignity, however, illustrates the problem with Sethi’s “greater good” AI. 
Whose ethic will drive the AI’s decision-making algorithms?When resources are limited, will atheist technicians decide who gets food and who does not?In the next pandemic when supplies run short, will agnostic philosophers decide who gets vaccinated and who does not? Will the AI control human populations based upon projections of biological survivability, statistical calculations of racial equity, or the nebulous criteria of sustainability?Will the “humanized AI” allow itself to be guided by religious moral codes, and if so, which ones will it choose? Or will religion, and maybe human existence itself, be rendered obsolete by these autonomous and self-correcting algorithms?
In contrast to Sethi’s utopian supply chain AI, I realize these questions sound alarmist. But this brief look at Teilhard’s willingness to sacrifice the weak for the greater good illustrates the importance of addressing these moral concerns. A clearly defined ethic that protects every human, and protects humans above animals, is fundamental to measuring the practicality of any AI tasked with the mission of replacing human intelligence, human morality, and human compassion.

Here are all five short essays in the series by J. R. Miller:
With transhumanism, what happens to human rights? The transhumanist accepts suffering for the individual if suffering can advance the evolution of the species toward immortality and singularity. If humans can redefine what it means to be human, what prevents us from eliminating anyone opposed to this grand vision? (January 1, 2022)
Eugenics, transhumanism, and artificial intelligence If we were to succeed at creating an ethical decision-making AI, whose ethics would it abide by? The utilitarian goal of a “sustainable future” must be guided by a higher ethic in order to avoid grave mistakes of the past. (January 13, 2022)
The deadly dream of Human+ Look at the price tag… Some are prepared to sacrifice actual humans now for the hope of future immortality. Without a fixed and final definition of human personhood, there is no foundation for a fixed and final ethic of “human” rights. (January 20, 2022)
Can Christian ethics save transhumanism? J. R. Miller looks at the idea that the mission to self-evolve through technology is “the definitive Christian commitment.” In Miller’s view, Christian transhumanists do not provide a stable and persistent definition of human personhood, thus cannot ground human rights. (February 27, 2022)
and
Why the imago Dei (Image of God) shuts the door on transhumanism. As the belief that technology promises us a glorious post-human future advances among scholar who profess Christianity, we must ask some hard questions. The mission to self-evolve beyond humanity begs the question, how is humanity “saved” through technological advancement designed to eliminate humanity? (March 20, 2022)

      Bringing HIV Prevention into the Twenty-First Century
  

      U-Test harnesses social media, artificial intelligence, and geo-mapping to connect youth with  HIV information and services
  

UNICEF





 









UNICEF/UN0484580/Diarassouba

















12 January 2022







UNICEF’s U-Test initiative is re-imagining traditional approaches to HIV prevention. It uses the latest technology to provide young people with easy-to-understand information about HIV and AIDS while also linking them with support and care. The goal is to connect at-risk youth with testing and services that prevent the spread of HIV.
So how does it work? The U-Test initiative uses a combination of technology, artificial intelligence, and social media to inform and engage young people. By operating within the digital sphere, U-Test makes quick inroads with adolescents, who are encouraged to get tested for HIV. If needed, U-Test also connects them with support.
Specifically, algorithmic look-alike modelling—a form of artificial intelligence—identifies priority groups based on their characteristics. For example, the platform can group together young people from similar areas, with similar behaviours, or with similar interests. Social media is then used as a mitigation tool—WhatsApp, SMS, and Facebook campaigns deliver HIV prevention ads and messaging to the most at-risk groups. U-Test also gives these young people direct access to HIV information via an online portal.
In addition to sharing information and messaging, U-Test allows users to complete a straightforward, confidential self-screen questionnaire about HIV. This reduces stigma and allows young people to begin this journey in privacy. Those who are at the highest risk for HIV are linked with testing and encouraged to learn their HIV status. When appropriate, geolocalisation technology accurately maps healthcare options around them, connecting youth to the closest services. U-Test’s technology can also connect users with youth-friendly counseling and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP, which has been shown to reduce HIV acquisition by up to 90 percent.
This targeted, technology-backed approach accurately finds and reaches young people at the most risk, improving efficiency when compared with traditional HIV outreach and engagement. The programme then takes these young people through a proven risk-reduction pathway, which follows an evidence-based package of combined prevention techniques. At the same time, U-Test provides UNICEF with custom, actionable insights—a valuable tool for health practitioners. It collects data in real time, enabling health interventions to become more closely tailored to users' specific needs and locations. This gives U-Test a distinct advantage, making it a powerful resource for precise, targeted programming.
U-Test is already creating impact in Côte d'Ivoire, where it has reached more than a million young people online  and  via  health facilitites. UNICEF worked with the government of Côte d’Ivoire to roll out the U-Test platform and, in total, 171 health providers were taught how to use digital technologies to link young people with HIV self-testing kits and PrEP. In just one year, more than 10,000 young Ivorians self-tested for HIV thanks to U-Test. The initiative had high uptake with first-time testers, likely because U-Test gave them confidentiality and flexibility regarding when and where they tested.

A young man is tested for HIV at the Adolescent and Youth School Health Service Center in Odienné, in the Northwest of Côte d’Ivoire.











The government of Cote d’Ivoire is adopting U-Test approaches and integrating this innovation into strategy and policy documents across the country—another sign of the initiative’s success. Côte d'Ivoire, where only 50 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status, was a logical place to pilot the U-Test model. But HIV reaches far beyond Côte d'Ivoire. In fact, more than 2.8 million children and adolescents were living with HIV in 2020. West and Central Africa bear the second highest global burden of HIV infections among adolescents at 25 percent. Many countries in the region—including Nigeria and Cameroon, which have similar statistics as Côte d’Ivoire—would be natural candidates for the U-Test platform. Both countries have the systems in place to quickly replicate the U-Test model and roll out UNICEF’s new approach to HIV prevention.
U-Test’s unique model—combining social media, digital outreach, and traditional HIV prevention methods—has the potential to reach millions. In addition to its youth-friendly approach, U-Test also adds accuracy and precision to HIV programming—targeting those at the highest risk. Through U-Test, UNICEF can help youth around the world learn about HIV and discover their HIV status.
U-test is part of the Maternal and Child Health Portfolio at UNICEF. The Global Innovation Portfolios align technical and financial resources to promising projects that can accelerate results for children in key focus areas, including Learning, Water and Sanitation, Climate Change, Gender Equality, Youth, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, and Immunization. By bringing these proven solutions to more countries, UNICEF’s Office of Innovation strives to strategically and efficiently address some of the biggest challenges facing children.

Artificial intelligence (AI) computer scientist, Timnit Gebru, has just opened her own firm. This is particularly interesting because she made headlines for dramatically getting fired from Google, despite being one of their top researchers. The Verge reported that Google let go of Gebru following her publishing academic papers that denounced their AI work on large language models designed to help retrieve answers to controversial search inquiries. 
The situation became even more controversial due to the sustained campaign of aggressive tweets and emails that were launched her way after the termination. 
Now, her bittersweet story is hitting a high note. 
Her firm, DAIR (Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute), received $3.7 million in funding from the MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, Kapor Center, Open Society Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.


“I’ve been frustrated for a long time about the incentive structures that we have in place and how none of them seem to be appropriate for the kind of work I want to do,” Gebru shared with the Washington Post.
The company’s focus will be recognizing harmful outcomes technology has on marginalized groups who encounter inordinate effects from AI structures but lack the access to governing its development, The Washington Post reported.  
She plans to partner with other independent firms like Data and Society, Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives.
Gebru said she launched DAIR  to aim to “document harms and develop a vision for AI applications that can have a positive impact on the same groups.” The overall goal is to  influence AI policies and practices of Google and the like, while leaning on her expertise to alter AI facial recognition software that has been extremely biased toward BIPOC.

How do Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, YouTube, and other platforms keep up with the millions upon millions of posts, comments, videos, and photos posted to their sites on a daily basis? It takes a partnership between artificial intelligence and human content moderators. 
In recent years, however, content moderators have begun to reveal that their work is often traumatizing. Moderators for Facebook and TikTok have gone so far as to sue for the psychological harm they have experienced at their workplaces, regularly reviewing images and videos that you and I never have to see depicting rape, murder, child trafficking, and other violent and graphic content.
Subjecting workers to violent and graphic imagery is an unsustainable way of keeping the internet free of such material. Will artificial intelligence reach a point where they can completely replace human content moderators?
According to Sarah T. Roberts, Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA and the author of Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media, the answer is No:   
…if you talk to actual industry insiders who will speak candidly and who are actually working directly in this area, they will tell you that there is no time that they can envision taking humans entirely out of this loop. And I believe that to be true. …[W]e need human intelligence to train the machines right.Zachary Mack, “Why AI can’t fix content moderation” at The Verge
Facebook boasted in 2019 that its AI moderation systems successfully spotted 99.9% of spam, 99.3% of terrorist propaganda, 99.2% of child nudity and sexual exploitation, 98.9% of violent and graphic content, and 96.8% of adult nudity and sexual activity.
However, when it came to content involving drugs, firearms, hate speech, and bullying and harassment, Facebook’s AI performed far lower (at 83.3%, 69.9%, 65.4%, and 14.1%, respectively). 
Even with the content AI succeeds at spotting and removing, there are still questions of nuance. AI may be able to spot and remove nudity, but can it distinguish between lewd content to be removed and historical content to be preserved? (There’s a vast difference, for instance, between pornography and a Michelangelo painting).
The Transatlantic Working Group (TWG), a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, published a report in 2020 explaining the limits of artificial intelligence when it comes to content moderation. 
“Automation in content moderation,” they wrote, “…is neither reliable nor effective.”
TWG explained that AI fails to grasp the importance of context, that its system can be biased by the programmers who design it, and that it lacks the ability to comprehend the differences in languages and cultures.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to mistake an inappropriate post for an appropriate one, and vice versa. Humans are still necessary in the content moderation process to parse apart those nuanced and subjective images, videos, and posts that artificial intelligence might miss due to its lack of true human understanding.
Human content moderators are called upon to employ an array of very high level cognitive functions and cultural competencies to make decisions about the appropriateness of such content for a site or platform. So in order to do this, they must:be experts in matters of taste of the site’s presumed audience; have cultural knowledge about the location of origin of the platform and of the audience, both of which may be very far removed geographically and culturally from where the screening is actually taking place;have linguistic competency in the language of the UGC (that may be a learned or second language for the content moderator him or herself);steeped in the relevant laws governing the site’s location of origin and be experts in the user guidelines and other platform-level specifics concerning what is or what is not allowed all while being exposed constantly to the very material that mainstream sites disallow.re:publica 2016 – Sarah T. Roberts: Behind the Screen, May 3, 2016 on YouTube
And Brendan Dixon further points out that, 
Machine Learning-based AI is far, far from ready to successfully moderate content in an age of single point failure risks. As we’ve often discussed here at Mind Matters News, for example, image recognition AI is easily fooled. Language recognition systems get confused by statements that children understand. Systems intended to assist health care personnel don’t grasp or convey the significance of information when, in an emergency room, for example, there may be little time to lose.Brendan Dixon, “AI Is Not Ready to Moderate Content!” at Mind Matters News
Another notable concern is that artificial intelligence is unable to act as a whistleblower. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen alerted the world this past summer that Facebook has been hiding blatant problems with its platforms. These problems include the proliferation of criminal activity on Facebook, declining teenage mental health due to the use of Instagram, and an algorithm that promotes incendiary content. Unethical practices and policies that need to change within Big Tech organizations like Facebook could easily be carried on without interference if humans were replaced by machines. Human workers offer a certain amount of accountability that cannot be found in robotic alternatives.
Artificial intelligence still works best as a tool working alongside humanity rather than as humanity’s replacement. To replace humans with artificial intelligence, especially in this particular sector, is still a long way off.

In case you missed it:
Social Media Content Moderator Sues TikTok for PTSD. Social media moderators protect users from graphic content, but who protects the moderators? Social media platforms hope that one day, AI will take the place of humans removing disturbing content from the internet. (Caitlin Bassett)
AI Is Not Ready to Moderate Content! In the face of COVID-19 quarantines for human moderators, some look to AI to keep the bad stuff off social media. Big social media companies have long wanted to replace human content moderators with AI. COVID-19 quarantines have only intensified that discussion. (Brendan Dixon)

New methods of artificial intelligence science are helping researchers to understand more about how the brain works – and in some cases, these scientists can actually intervene and push the brain to work differently.
If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. A Wired story introducing a University of Pennsylvania research project starts out by pointing out that the human brain is largely an unknown “black box” to scientists, and that there are significant barriers to affecting brain activity.
However, UPenn psychologist Michael Kahana and a team of scientists were able to utilize electrodes going into the brains of 25 epilepsy patients in order to start learning about how the brain works during memory.
It's significant that the team was able to do this by “piggybacking” on already existing infrastructure. (From the wording, it’s assumed that the group was able to use subjects who were already hooked up for more prosaic medical reasons.) As the article points out, it's pretty difficult to get buy-in from research subjects to put invasive technology into the brain.
The researchers started out by simply reading brain activity – specifically, in precise calculation of electrical activity inside the brain while people were in the process of learning and memorizing words.
After doing this for a while, and building up a substantial training set, the researchers were able to predict certain kinds of learning.
After the foundational research, scientists were eventually able to send electrical stimulation to the brain to assist in the process of memory.
When you talk about the use of electrical stimulation to help with memory, it sounds simple – but when you look more closely, everything is predicated on very high-tech methodologies and quite a lot of guesswork.
Without the initial machine learning that identified memory activity, the scientists wouldn't have had as good of an idea of how to electrically stimulate brains to promote good memory function.
Also, it's clear from reading about the study that the team doesn't know how the electrical stimulation is working – they just know that it is. In other words, the scientists are using the results of machine learning to fine-tune the system, without actually understanding the ins and outs of the brain function itself.
This intriguing example is perhaps one of the best examples of “hands-on” machine learning – here, the data is not just put into training sets to model more data. Here, the training set actually acts as a catalyst for specific experiments in bioinformatics, and the results are based on the calculations that machine learning programs made. It's a very interesting look into the synergy between artificial intelligence and our own human biological brains, and how the two are intersecting as we make rapid progress toward the “singularity” of Ray Kurzweil and other future outcomes.
