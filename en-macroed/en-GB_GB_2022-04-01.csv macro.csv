In fact, when it comes to values, then at a fundamental level, machines don't really get much more sophisticated than understanding that 1 is different from 0.
The Dangers Of Not Aligning Artificial Intelligence With Human ValuesAdobe Stock

As a society, we are now at a point where we are starting to allow machines to make decisions for us. So how can we expect them to understand that, for example, they should do this in a way that doesn’t involve prejudice towards people of a certain race, gender, or sexuality? Or that the pursuit of speed, or efficiency, or profit, has to be done in a way that respects the ultimate sanctity of human life?

Theoretically, if you tell a self-driving car to navigate from point A to point B, it could just smash its way to its destination, regardless of the cars, pedestrians, or buildings it destroys on its way.

PROMOTED
Similarly, as Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom outlined, if you tell an intelligent machine to make paperclips, it might eventually destroy the whole world in its quest for raw materials to turn into paperclips. The principle is that it simply has no concept of the value of human life or materials or that some things are too valuable to be turned into paperclips unless it is specifically taught it.

This forms the basis of the latest book by Brian Christian, The Alignment Problem – How AI Learns Human Values. It’s his third book on the subject of AI following his earlier works, The Most Human Human and Algorithms to Live By. I have always found Christian’s writing enjoyable to read but also highly illuminating, as he doesn’t worry about getting bogged down with computer code or mathematics. But that’s certainly not to say it is in any way lightweight or not intellectual.

Rather, his focus is on the societal, philosophical, and psychological implications of our ever-increasing ability to create thinking, learning machines. If anything, this is the aspect of AI where we need our best thinkers to be concentrating their efforts. The technology, after all, is already here – and it’s only going to get better. What’s far less certain is whether society itself is mature enough and has sufficient safeguards in place to make the most of the amazing opportunities it offers - while preventing the serious problems it could bring with it from becoming a reality.

I recently sat down with Christian to discuss some of the topics. Christian’s work is particularly concerned with the encroachment of computer-aided decision-making into fields such as healthcare, criminal justice, and lending, where there is clearly potential for them to cause problems that could end up affecting people’s lives in very real ways.

“There is this fundamental problem … that has a history that goes back to the 1960s, and MIT cyberneticist Norbert Wiener, who likened these systems to the story of the Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” Christian tells me.
Most people reading this will probably be familiar with the Disney cartoon in which Mickey Mouse attempts to save himself the effort of doing his master’s chores by using a magic spell to imbue a broom with intelligence and autonomy. The story serves as a good example of the dangers of these qualities when they aren't accompanied by human values like common sense and judgment.
“Wiener argued that this isn’t the stuff of fairytales. This is the sort of thing that’s waiting for us if we develop these systems that are sufficiently general and powerful … I think we are at a moment in the real world where we are filling the world with these brooms, and this is going to become a real issue.”
One incident that Christian uses to illustrate how this misalignment can play out in the real world is the first recorded killing of a pedestrian in a collision involving an autonomous car. This was the death of Elaine Herzberg in Arizona, US, in 2018.
When the National Transportation Safety Board investigated what had caused the collision between the Uber test vehicle and Herzberg, who was pushing a bicycle across a road, they found that the AI controlling the car had no awareness of the concept of jaywalking. It was totally unprepared to deal with a person being in the middle of the road, where they should not have been.
On top of this, the system was trained to rigidly segment objects in the road into a number of categories – such as other cars, trucks, cyclists, and pedestrians. A human being pushing a bicycle did not fit any of those categories and did not behave in a way that would be expected of any of them.
“That’s a useful way for thinking about how real-world systems can go wrong,” says Christian, “It’s a function of two things – the first is the quality of the training data. Does the data fundamentally represent reality? And it turns out, no – there’s this key concept called jaywalking that was not present.”
The second factor is our own ability to mathematically define what a system such as an autonomous car should do when it encounters a problem that requires a response.
“In the real world, it doesn't matter if something is a cyclist or a pedestrian because you want to avoid them either way. It's an example of how a fairly intuitive system design can go wrong.""
Christian’s book goes on to explore these issues as they relate to many of the different paradigms that are currently popular in the field of machine learning, such as unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning. It turns out that each of them presents its own challenges when it comes to aligning the values and behaviors of machines with the humans who are using them to solve problems.
Sometimes the fact that machine learning attempts to replicate human learning is the cause of problems. This might be the case when errors in data mean the AI is confronted with situations or behaviors that would never be encountered in real life, by a human brain. This means there is no reference point, and the machine is likely to continue making more and more mistakes in a series of ""cascading failures.""
In reinforcement learning – which involves training machines to maximize their chances of achieving rewards for making the right decision – machines can quickly learn to “game” the system, leading to outcomes that are unrelated to those that are desired. Here Christian uses the example of Google X head Astro Teller's attempt to incentivize soccer-playing robots to win matches. He devised a system that rewarded the robots every time they took possession of the ball – on the face of it, an action that seems conducive to match-winning. However, the machines quickly learned to simply approach the ball and repeatedly touch it. As this meant they were effectively taking possession of the ball over and over, they earned multiple rewards – although it did little good when it came to winning the match!
Christian’s book is packed with other examples of this alignment problem – as well as a thorough exploration of where we are when it comes to solving it. It also clearly demonstrates how many of the concerns of the earliest pioneers in the field of AI and ML are still yet to be resolved and touches on fascinating subjects such as attempts to imbue machines with other characteristics of human intelligence such as curiosity.

SmithPublished March 15, 2022Updated April 1, 2022This article is part of a new series on how artificial intelligence has the potential to solve everyday problems.Sean Cusack, a software engineer at Microsoft and beekeeper on the side, wanted to know if anything besides bees was going into his hives. So he built a tiny photo booth (a sort of bee vestibule) that took pictures whenever something appeared around it. But sorting through thousands of insect portraits proved tedious.Colleagues told him about a new product that the company was working on called Lobe.ai, which allows anybody to train a computer-vision system to recognize objects. Mr. Cusack used it to identify his honeybees — but also to keep an eye out for the dreaded Asian murder hornet.“It was just really simple,” Mr. Cusack said, adding that the underlying data science was “over my head,” despite his title. The Lobe platform allowed him to drag and drop sample photos and click a few buttons to make a system that could recognize his beloved bees and spot unwelcome visitors.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Cusack is part of a growing army of “citizen developers,” who use new products that allow anyone to apply artificial intelligence without having to write a line of computer code. Proponents of the “no-code” A.I. revolution believe it will change the world: It used to require a team of engineers to build a piece of software, and now users with a web browser and an idea have the power to bring that idea to life themselves.“We are trying to take A.I. and make it ridiculously easy,” said Craig Wisneski, a no-code evangelist and co-founder of Akkio, a start-up that allows anyone to make predictions using data.A.I. is following a familiar progression. “First, it’s used by a small core of scientists,” Jonathan Reilly, Akkio’s other co-founder, said. “Then the user base expands to engineers who can navigate technical nuance and jargon until, finally, it’s made user-friendly enough that almost anyone can use it.”Just as clickable icons have replaced obscure programming commands on home computers, new no-code platforms replace programming languages with simple and familiar web interfaces. And a wave of start-ups is bringing the power of A.I. to nontechnical people in visual, textual and audio domains.Juji, for example, is a tool designed to make building A.I. chatbots as easy as creating a PowerPoint presentation. It uses machine learning to automatically handle complex conversation flows and infer users’ particular characteristics to personalize each engagement rather than simply serving up preprogrammed interactions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIts co-founder, Michelle Zhou, said the goal was to give Juji chatbots advanced human soft skills such as emotional intelligence so that they could connect with users on a more human level than existing systems have. Using Juji, staff members at the University of Illinois were able to create and manage their custom A.I. chatbot and scale their student recruitment operations.But not all of the existing tools are robust enough to do more than simple tasks. Google’s Teachable Machines is a computer-vision tool similar to Lobe.ai. Steve Saling, a former landscape architect who is now living with A.L.S., worked with the Teachable Machines team for about a year and a half to train a system to turn switches on and off using his facial expressions.“It gets more accurate with more data,” Mr. Saling said in an email. But he said the process of collecting that data — pictures of his face at different angles and in varying light — was labor intensive and the system never reached the level of accuracy required. “Automation needs to be in excess of 99 percent reliable to be dependent on it,” he said. “Teachable Machines will get there but it is not there yet.”ImageCredit...Juan Carlos PaganStill, it’s early days. “No-code A.I. tools are still on the fringes of the larger no-code movement, because not many people understand machine learning enough to dream up what’s possible,” said Josh Tiernan, who runs No Code Founders, a community of nontechnical entrepreneurs who use no-code tools such as WordPress or Bubble. But he expects no-code A.I. to grow as more people understand its potential.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnother force in no-code’s favor: Advances in A.I. itself are making no-code platforms more powerful. OpenAI, the company co-founded by Elon Musk, has a vast A.I. system, GPT-3, that can write code when prompted with simple English. It can even create websites and do other basic programming tasks. In collaboration with OpenAI, partners like GitHub, a software development hosting company, have created tools like GitHub Copilot, which acts as an autocomplete function for coders, speeding up their work. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has gone a step further with an A.I. tool capable of writing complete code to solve complex problems posed to it with normal speech or text.Already, users of Microsoft’s Power Platform, which includes a family of no-code products, can generate simple applications by just describing them.“I could say something like, ‘Look up all the customer records from the last year,’ and it will go do that for you automatically,” said Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business apps and platforms. He estimates that half of all office work could be automated with A.I. if there were enough developers to do the work. “The only way to do this is to empower everybody to be a no-code developer.”Eventually the broader public will be able to create A.I.-enabled software in much the same way that teenagers today can create sophisticated video effects that would have required a professional studio a decade or two ago.For now, though, most no-code-A.I. users are business professionals who want to streamline the way things are done without having to involve a programmer.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle’s AppSheet, for example, is an open platform where people can connect data and, with a single click, create apps that can be opened on a smartphone, tablet or computer. It uses A.I. to understand the intent of users and enables them to build mobile and desktop applications with integrated computer vision and predictive analytics features. It costs nothing to make apps for personal use.“We’re focused on making this consumable by regular people,” said Praveen Seshadri, AppSheet’s co-founder and chief executive. There are many organizations around the world that have teams of people that need to coordinate schedules and tasks, he added. Each one is unique and more suited to building a custom app than trying to use something off the shelf.As an example, he cited New Incentives, an organization that gives small amounts of cash to mothers in some of the poorest parts of Nigeria to encourage them to immunize their children. To track that data, they built an app with AppSheet that their employees now use in the field.Alex Denning, who runs Ellipsis, a small marketing company for businesses that use WordPress, turned to Akkio to build an A.I. system that could predict which keyword and title would get his clients’ blog posts the most visibility on Google and other search engines. He dragged and dropped onto Akkio’s site a spreadsheet of past keywords and blog-post titles along with the number of clicks those posts got on Google. After a few keystrokes, Akkio created an A.I. to do the job.“Results for our clients improved by approximately a third as a result of leveraging Akkio and the A.I.,” Mr. Denning said. Once an A.I. system is created on Akkio, users can integrate with their existing software. Mr. Denning renamed the tool Falcon and uses it to market his company.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I am not a developer,” he said, “but it was easy and intuitive for me to make it happen.”And Mr. Cusack, the bee guy? His A.I. system never spotted a murder hornet, but it did catch plenty of wasps and earwigs sneaking into his hives — a modest but important step for no-code.Craig S. Smith is a former correspondent for The Times and hosts the podcast “Eye on A.I.”A correction was made on April 1, 2022: An earlier version of this article misstated the creators of Github Copilot, a tool that acts as an autocomplete function for coders. It was created by Github, a software development hosting company, in collaboration with OpenAI, an A.I. development company; OpenAI did not create the tool. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

By introducing the technology in the current CASE laboratory, Chalmers makes it easy for students and researchers to experiment with 5G solutions. ""It opens up for research and education in industrial applications where fast data transfer and response times are sometimes as short as 1 millisecond, for example for artificial intelligence (AI) such as autonomous robots, self-driving vehicles and the ""Internet of Things""”, says Erik Ström, Professor of Communication Systems at Chalmers. 


Connectivity is a prerequisite for being able to work with artificial intelligence, but today there are very few universities in Sweden and in the world that have access to their own 5G networks that they can experiment with.

""Commercially, 5G is already here and is available in many countries. However, it can be said that the application of 5G is in its infancy, and we will see a very large development in the coming years. Both with 5G technology as such but also with applications”, says Karl-Johan Killius, Head of Site Gothenburg Ericsson.  

5G consists of more technical advanced solutions than 4G, but at the same time also provides the conditions to use the technology for so much more. Researchers see 5G as a tool for solving major societal challenges.

""5G technology primarily enables applications that are resource-efficient and that promote sustainable use and development in society, such as digitization of unsustainable technology, efficiency and improvement of transport systems, health care, food production and systems for generating and distributing electricity. Our collaboration with Ericsson enables our research to be tested and hopefully be useful more quickly”, says Petter Falkman, Professor of Automation at Chalmers. 

""4G was created to be able to offer a wireless broadband connection e.g., for mobiles or laptops. 5G is created to offer wireless connection to a much wider range of applications which may have completely different requirements. For example, simple sensors in a mine have completely different requirements for availability, response time and capacity, while self-driving cars, trains and industrial robots place very high demands on reliability and response time”, says Magnus Castell, Manager Expericom at Ericsson Gothenburg.
 
To most people, 5G can be considered a new and exciting technology, but the aim of the researchers is now set on 6G.

""6G will give us significantly more of what 5G offers. In addition, 6G will be an important tool for achieving several of the UN's sustainability goals. What makes all this possible are high transmission speeds, low latency, knowledge of the radio environment, position and orientation, integration of sensor network functionality, network of networks and that the computing power is decentralized in the mobile networks. A key to this is that 6G can guarantee energy-efficient, reliable, robust, and secure communication, says Tommy Svensson, Professor of Communication Systems at Chalmers with a focus on wireless communication.

Facts about 5G​


Machine to machine communication – a large increase in the number of connected gadgets that are able to exchange information with each other, also called ‘Internet of Things’.
Considerable growth in data traffic – about 1000 times more than today. 5G can handle a larger amount of data from multiple devices simultaneously.
Higher transmission speed – top speeds up to 10 times higher than 4G, about 10 Gbit / second.
Less latency, shorter response times – about 1 millisecond compared to 25-35 milliseconds today.
Lower energy consumption – the connection via 5G becomes ten times more energy efficient than today's 4G. 
Higher frequencies – in its first stage, 5G uses the frequency band 3.4-3.8 GHz, and in the future also the millimeter wave band (over 24 GHz). To get good coverage, this requires more advanced solutions using many antennas per base station.

We'll continue to see AI jobs' influence permeate deeper into many other industries for the foreseeable future. There's no way around it; work is changing. Work is, in fact, ever-changing, ever-evolving, always progressively, never at once, as we create new problems just as fast as we solve old ones. Which has led to the creation of an entirely new industry of frankly terrible jobs. These are Augmented Reality Storyteller, Ad-Blocking Expert, Worldbuilder, Personal Data Representative, Data Detective, etc..Augmented Reality Storyteller: Virtual and augmented reality allows the reader to stop being passive and offers a window into the story. AR/VR is giving storytellers the ultimate tool to immerse their audiences in their stories. Content creators are pushing the boundaries of storytelling and are adopting AR/VR to tell new stories in a more engaging way and with an unmistakable sense of presence. This job will allow entities to create both immersive training scenarios and hard-to-spot marketing opportunities..World builder: World builder will design single-player or multiplayer game environments, with a specific emphasis on first-person shooter games. This role requires many of the same skills asked of video-game designers, except with a potentially entirely different endgame. Responsible for creating and developing 3-D game levels using popular 3-D modelling tools and packages, expected to be able to design environments with a realistic look and feel..Ad-Blocking Expert: Ad blockers are AI tools designed to remove or hide content identified as advertising during browsing. And they will have to be advanced enough to spot adverts embedded within reality itself. While a webpage is loading, the ad blocker looks at the site's scripts and compares them against a list of sites and scripts it was built to block..Personal Data Representative: A PDR would be a person or company which would legally represent the entirety of someone's data and invest it in the right databases to get its customers better returns. The primary purpose of this position is to enter data from different documents into the computer system for purposes such as storage, processing, and data management..Data Investigator: This becomes even more important as AI artificial intellligence becomes embedded in everyday life, data Investigator is responsible for the lawful acquisition of communications data, and for providing specialist advice to Life at Risk, proactive and reactive investigations, crimes in action, and intelligence operations..Data Detective: Data detective does jobs such as inspecting data, measuring the data defects, analyzing the cause and impact of those defects, and then reporting the results of the analysis to key stakeholders. It filters and organizes the data into information your customer can understand that is relevant to their needs..Man-Machine Collaboration Analyst: Man-machine collaboration just means having humans and automated technology working alongside each other to achieve a shared goal.  This role is to develop an interaction system through which humans and machines mutually communicate their capabilities, goals, and intentions, and to devise a task-planning system for human-machine collaboration..IT Facilitator: This job is centered on developing training modules and workshops that help employees learn essential skills in the workplace. This would be the role of the IT facilitator, which ought to put PMOs out of their misery. Expect the chosen few to lead a highly rewarding financial life..Smart City Analyst: City planners are becoming cool again! Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, etc for people living and working in the city. With the increasing use of smart cars, drones, post-Covid office space optimization their help will be sorely needed..Microgrid analyst: The Microgrid will be responsible for energy &amp; data analytics and energy simulations for solar PV and energy storage systems and microgrids using top technologies..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And although it seems like a term taken from a science fiction movie, the reality is that Artificial Intelligence is already part of our daily lives, you just are not aware of it..Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an extremely powerful digital tool, which has been adopted by many organizations in almost all sectors, markets, and industries because this type of technology allows them to optimize work and profitability..You can see how AI is applied for a wide variety of purposes today, from medicine to the legal online casinos US industry. It is really surprising how this technology operates around us in most areas..Let's see a little more in-depth what Artificial Intelligence is all about..What is Artificial Intelligence?.Roughly we could say that AI is the technology whose main objective is to try to imitate human reasoning and thought. These are systems created to store information, solve calculations and manage to process data to anticipate certain tasks..Artificial Intelligence allows machines to reason, plan, create and learn like human beings (or as close as possible). Through an algorithm, the AI ​​can perceive the environment and relate to it..The machine receives information (provided by man), then it processes it and can respond to it. In this way, the AI ​​manages to adapt its behavior, analyzing the effects of previous situations, and therefore manages itself autonomously..One of its greatest virtues is its speed of response, which makes it an extremely profitable tool for most businesses since it can learn from habits due to its intuitive nature, and it also allows for speeding up mechanical processes..What is the AI ​​for? In which fields can it be applied?.As we have mentioned before, today this type of technology is more used than you think. Surely you will be surprised to find out the scope it has today..Although this type of technology is applied to a wide variety of fields, we could classify it into two large subgroups or areas: information processing and robotics..When it comes to information processing (which actually involves the storage, processing, and analysis of information), there are many machines that have been developed to accomplish almost any task in the most cost-effective and efficient manner..Thus, most platforms are capable of performing the following functions: Manage and control information; Analyze, plan and query data; Diagnose, configure and distribute components and hardware in computer systems; Interpret data; Make conclusions; Anticipate tasks and situations; Monitor tasks..In relation to robotics, it refers to a more dynamic facet, since we are talking about robots that are used to perform various tasks. Nowadays, this type of technology is more than anything used for assembly lines or in tasks related to the manufacture of objects; mostly covering monotonous and repetitive tasks..Some examples of AI applied to everyday life.AI applied in customer service.Today, most of the live chats that offer customer service in different areas work through AI. Chatbots are those that assist people by answering basic help or technical support questions..For example, most legal online casinos and US operators are managed by a chatbot that offers fast and practical solutions 24 hours a day. This type of technology can help customers by handling simple requests such as opening an account, closing an account, and the like..AI applied to voice assistants/home automation.We are not only referring to cell phones and other electronic devices, but also to smart homes that use Google Home or Amazon Echo technology. Through these assistants, which use NLP (natural language processing) technology, which allows them to interpret voice commands and respond to them, families have the possibility of carrying out most household tasks through a simple command by voice..AI applied to maps and navigation directions.AI is fundamental to the existence of the navigation systems we use today, such as Google Maps..Artificial Intelligence applied to these programs is what makes it possible to provide information on the state of traffic in real-time and up to date. It also allows recommending to the user the best route to access the desired site, considering all the necessary factors..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
