Some prediction experts predicted a decade ago that almost half of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI by 2023 (!) or, at most, by 2033, mainly impacting low-skill jobs (e.g., no more truck drivers because we will have self-driving trucks). Other crystal-ball observers argued that in contrast to previous waves of automation, we are entering a new era in which the most affected will be highly-skilled knowledge workers.


The tight labor market of recent years has suppressed somewhat these dire predictions. The widespread excitement about generative AI, however, is bringing back the anxiety about jobs, especially the creative kind of jobs.

According to the Harris Poll, “most workers are wary of generative AI,” and 50% don’t trust the technology. The Atlantic tells us confidently: “No technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly educated workers. Will generative AI be an exception?... While it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this trend, it is clear that AI will have a significant impact on the job market for college-educated workers.”

The only thing true in this “clear” prediction is that its difficult to make predictions, especially about the future. But it is certainly possible to assess predictions about the future of work. All you need is knowledge of historical facts and an analysis of past failed predictions.

Let’s start with history. Already with the invention of the earliest proto-computer, Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace saw its potential (in 1843) as a symbol manipulator. She mused about the possibilities for a much broader range of automation beyond speeding up calculation, including creative tasks such as composing music.

Lovelace made clear, however, that what became to be known as “artificial intelligence,” depends on human intelligence and does not replace it. Rather, it augments it, sometimes throwing new light on an established body of knowledge but never developing it from scratch: “The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.”

More generally, Lovelace argued that “In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable.”
In this she anticipated the oft-repeated Silicon Valley’s maxim (known as Amara’s Law): “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”
That “law” worked overtime with the emergence in the 1940s of “giant brains,” as the first electronic, digital computers were called at the time, a century after Lovelace’s mother referred to the Analytical Engine as “Babbage’s thinking machine.” Not a “working machine” or “manual labor machine,” but a “thinking,” “brain”-like machine, a knowledge worker potentially replacing human knowledge workers.
In his 1947 talk at the London Mathematical Society about the ACE, one of these early “giant brains,” Alan Turing estimated that it could do the work of 10,000 “computers.” This was one of the first authoritative assessments of the possible impact of modern computers on jobs—not manual jobs but high-skill jobs. The “computers” were the highly educated humans performing calculations, entirely replaced by modern computers by the 1960s. Modern computers, however, created new job categories such as “programmers” and “systems analysts.”
Popularizing the term “automation,” John Diebold wrote in a 1953 Harvard Business Review article: “The effect of automation on the information handling functions of business will probably be more spectacular and far-reaching [than its impact on factory workers]. Repetitive office work, when in sufficient bulk as in insurance companies, will be put on at least a partially automatic basis. Certain functions, such as filing and statistical analysis on the lower management levels, will be performed by machines. Yet very few offices will be entirely automatic. Much day-to-day work—answering correspondence and the like—will have to be done by human beings.”
Diebold established one of the first consulting companies advising businesses on how to adopt modern computers. An entire new industry and entire new breed of knowledge workers followed in his path.
Computers have altered, augmented and replaced knowledge work since the 1950s. How about that quintessential knowledge work, that of a lawyer? Sure, today we have e-discovery leading to “armies of expensive lawyers, replaced by cheaper software.” But how many expensive lawyers were “replaced” by the advent of LexisNexis in the 1970s?
Diebold predicted that the “day-to-day work” would not be automated and what he probably had in mind was that secretaries will keep their jobs. The fact that they didn’t show how difficult it is to predict what impact computers will have (or not have) on knowledge work. Secretaries were not replaced by computers, but by managers who accepted the new social norm that it was not beneath them to “answer correspondence and the like,” as long as they did it with the new status symbol—the personal computer.
Failed predictions can reveal a lot about why yesterday’s futures did not materialize. I have in my files a great example, a report published in 1976 by the Long Range Planning Service of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), titled “Office of the Future.”
The author of the report was a Senior Industrial Economist at SRI’s Electronics Industries Research Group, and a “recognized authority on the subject of business automation.” His bio blurb indicates that he “also worked closely with two of the Institute’s engineering laboratories in developing his thinking for this study. The Augmentation Research Center has been putting the office of the future to practical test for almost ten years… Several Information Science Laboratory personnel have been working with state-of-the-art equipment and systems that are the forerunners of tomorrow’s products. The author was able to tap this expertise to gain a balanced picture of the problems and opportunities facing office automation.”
And what was the result of all this research and analysis? The manager of 1985, the report predicted, will not have a personal secretary. Instead, he (decidedly not she) will be assisted, along with other managers, by a centralized pool of assistants (decidedly and exclusively, according to the report, of the female persuasion). He will contact the “administrative support center” whenever he needs to dictate a memo to a “word processing specialist,” find a document (helped by an “information storage/retrieval specialist”), or rely on an “administrative support specialist” to help him make decisions.
Of particular interest is the report’s discussion of the sociological factors driving the transition to the “office of the future.” Forecasters often leave out of their analysis the annoying and uncooperative (with their forecast) motivations and aspirations of the humans involved. But this report does consider sociological factors, in addition to organizational, economic, and technological trends. And it’s worth quoting at length what it says on the subject:
“The major sociological factor contributing to change in the business office is ‘women’s liberation.’ Working women are demanding and receiving increased responsibility, fulfillment, and opportunities for advancement. The secretarial position as it exists today is under fire because it usually lacks responsibility and advancement potential. The normal (and intellectually unchallenging) requirements of taking dictation, typing, filing, photocopying, and telephone handling leave little time for the secretary to take on new and more demanding tasks. The responsibility level of many secretaries remains fixed throughout their working careers. These factors can negatively affect the secretary’s motivation and hence productivity. In the automated office of the future, repetitious and dull work is expected to be handled by personnel with minimal education and training. Secretaries will, in effect, become administrative specialists, relieving the manager they support of a considerable volume of work.”
Regardless of the women’s liberation movement of his day, the author could not see beyond the creation of a two-tier system in which some women would continue to perform dull and unchallenging tasks, while other women would be “liberated” into a fulfilling new job category of “administrative support specialist.” In this 1976 forecast, there are no women managers.
But this is not the only sociological factor the report missed. The most interesting sociological revolution of the office of the 1980s – and one missing from most (all?) accounts of the PC revolution – is what managers (male and female) did with their new word processing, communicating, calculating machine. They took over some of the “dull” secretarial tasks that no self-respecting manager would deign to perform before the 1980s.
This was the real revolution: The typing of memos (later emails), the filing of documents, the recording, tabulating, and calculating. In short, a large part of the management of office information, previously exclusively in the hands of secretaries, became in the 1980s (and progressively more so in the 1990s and beyond) an integral part of the work of business executives.
This was very difficult, maybe impossible, to predict. It was a question of status. No manager would type before the 1980s because it was perceived as work that was not commensurate with his status. Many managers started to type in the 1980s because now they could do it with a new “cool” tool, the PC, which conferred on them the leading-edge, high-status image of this new technology. What mattered was that you were important enough to have one of these cool things, not that you performed with it tasks that were considered beneath you just a few years before.
What was easier to predict was the advent of the PC itself. And the SRI report missed this one, too, even though it was aware of the technological trajectory: “Computer technology that in 1955 cost $1 million, was only marginally reliable, and filled a room, is now available for under $25,000 and the size of a desk. By 1985, the same computer capability will cost less than $1000 and fit into a briefcase.”
But the author of the SRI report could only see a continuation of the centralized computing of his day. The report’s 1985 fictional manager views documents on his “video display terminal” and the centralized (and specialized) word processing system of 1976 continues to rule the office ten years later.
This was a failure to predict how the computer that will “fit into a briefcase” will become personal, i.e., will take the place of the “video display terminal” and then augment it as a personal information management tool. And the report also failed to predict the ensuing organizational development in which distributed computing (and eventually, in-your-pocket computing) replaced or was added to centralized computing.
Yes, predicting is hard to do. But compare forecasters and analysts with another human subspecies: Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs don’t predict the future, they make it happen.
A year before the SRI report was published, in January 1975, Popular Electronics published a cover story on the “first minicomputer kit,” the Altair 8800. Paul Allen and Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, founded their companies around the time the SRI report was published not because they read reports about the office of the future. They simply imagined it.
For the last ten years, and especially since 2017, creative human intelligence has advanced the state of generative AI. Human intelligence imagined new deep learning architectures, new methods for statistical analysis of text, and new approaches to training AI models on the vast Web “literature.” As Lovelace has observed, human imagination and creativity are not and cannot be components of artificial intelligence.
So regard the current projections of how many and what type of jobs will be destroyed (or created) by artificial intelligence with healthy skepticism. No doubt, as in the past, many low-skill and high-skill occupations will be affected by the increased scope of what computers can do. But many current occupations will thrive and new ones will be created, as—and that’s a safe prediction—the way work is done will continue to change, driven by our creativity and imagination.DALL-E 2 rendering of ""the future of work in the office with ChatGPT""Gil Press

Using artificial intelligence at work may have many benefits, but a growing body of research calls attention to the potential negative impact of AI on employee performance. Pok Man Tang writes that the use of AI may have different effects on people, depending on their personal characteristics. Those who think more highly of their abilities may suffer the most when they see that technology determines how well they perform.

 




“Whether or not employees benefit or suffer from working with artificial intelligence very much depends on their personal characteristics, like how they (un)favorably view themselves…”
Albert Lam, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), NOVELTE Robotic Solution
The opening quote from the chief marketing officer of a robotics company reveals a critical insight about working with, or depending on, artificial intelligence: AI can be a double-edged sword for both employees and managers. It can augment employees at work by facilitating their goal accomplishments, since it helps them complete more complicated analytical tasks. However, this emerging digital tool might unexpectedly trigger an aversive host of psychological states in employees. The critical question to resolve thus seems to be for whom the benefits (versus costs) of working with AI will be more salient.
In our recent article, my co-authors and I write that for some employees, this augmentation (i.e., making employees depend on AI) has a bright side, but there might be a negative consequence in its ability to enhance employee performance. Yes, there are likely both benefits and harms to employees as a result of these human-machine collaborations, but we suspected that personal characteristics might influence how strongly those benefits vs. harms are experienced. If true, this would have significant implications for organisational decision-makers worldwide who might have to rethink their business practices regarding pairing employees with AI.
The central premise of these arguments is based on self-regulation theory, a dynamic process wherein individuals evaluate discrepancies between their current states (how they are feeling or what they are doing now) and some desired end-state (what they want/expect themselves to feel or do). We posited that, on the one hand, someone’s dependence on AI in various work tasks can be discrepancy-reducing. They may be able to  complete important tasks more effectively or eliminate repetitive tasks or hassles, which can improve their performance. On the other hand, the same phenomenon can be discrepancy-enlarging, making clear that employees could not complete their tasks without AI assistance, which eventually has the potential to harm their performance.
Across two different studies with participants from India and the United States, we consistently showed that dependence on AI at work can both reduce discrepancy, by eliciting goal progress (a positive consequence) and increase discrepancy, by triggering a self-esteem threat (a negative consequence), with mixed consequences for employee performance. Yet, more importantly (based on the opening quote), our focus was on how employees’ personal characteristics would affect the strength of these relationships. We expected that whether AI can be discrepancy-reducing or discrepancy-enlarging would depend on employees’ core self-evaluation (CSE), their overall self-assessment. Our expectation was that employees with higher levels of CSE would be more likely to see their dependence on AI negatively, as they tend to attribute their work accomplishments to their ability (instead of AI’s help).
And indeed, this is what we found. Dependence on AI was discrepancy-enlarging when it became a self-esteem threat (employees tended to experience larger threats to their self-esteem). Along similar lines, for these individuals, dependence on AI was not discrepancy-reducing when it came to their work-goals (they tended not to feel that depending on AI was effective for making progress on tasks at work). Overall speaking, our results suggest that employees high in CSE might attain fewer performance benefits from working with AI.
These findings have critical implications for managers and other organisational decision-makers who are navigating through the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the conventional wisdom on CSE is that it is a good filtering criteria in recruitment and selection, as well as performance management. Our findings suggest to decision-makers that this consensus of CSE might need to be revisited. It is critical that managers recognise that tried-and-true methods they have used in the past may not work in the new digital era.
While one remedy might simply be to encourage managers to avoid pairing high-CSE employees with AI (or at least to avoid their heavy engagement with AI), this may not be feasible all the time given that high (compared to low) CSE employees have proven to be better in a lot of aspects in their daily lives and work.
To this end, we encourage decision-makers to adopt a more holistic perspective for the outcomes that are measured when evaluating the success of these augmentation efforts. Beyond focusing on increases to performance, managers should be attentive to the well-being of their digital workforce, striving to avoid the reductions to task performance that we found, as well as other costs that can arise.
One potential solution is to encourage employees to engage in positive self-affirmations (which provide a means to restore or protect one’s self-regard) or mindfulness practice (which can also have positive effects for employee well-being). Overall, we recommend that managers be careful to avoid “over-selling” the promise of AI, and we echo those who have called for a more conservative judgement of the organisational impact of intelligent machines.
In closing, our research joins an emerging conversation about the potential benefits and costs of coupling employees with AI at work and throws light on the personal characteristics that amplify these benefits (vs. costs). We continue to add to the recent stream of research highlighting that some conventional wisdom and organisation practices might no longer be valid in the new digital era—a manuscript we previously wrote about for LSE Business Review.

I truly believe that AI in fact can be a facilitator of goal congruent behavior and therefore be a driver of top performance. However people may sometimes perceive an organization’s capability to integrate Technology in some key HR functions like Performance Management  as micro management in certain cultural contexts. Therefore effective communication can indeed decide the effectiveness of AI integration and the “why” factor.
Now,  I believe AI is important  in providing very valuable insights in performance evaluation if all key process areas are in fact interlinked/ integrated.  So a Human + Tech approach will be the ideal mix where tacit knowledge of the evaluator can guide an employee. (keeping in mind the possible skewness human perception can bring in while assessing an employee/ zero human error based approach) . 
So a mix from a game theoretic perspective will be a good state of equilibrium specially when asymmetric information is present.

After a generative AI tool called ChatGPT went viral a few months ago, it seems everyone in Silicon Valley is trying to find a use for this new technology. Microsoft and Google are chief among them, and they’re racing to reinvent how we use computers. But first, they’re reinventing how we search the internet.Generative AI is essentially a more advanced and useful version of the conventional artificial intelligence that already helps power everything from autocomplete to Siri. The big difference is that generative AI can create new content, such as images, text, audio, video, and even code — usually from a prompt or command. It can write news articles, movie scripts, and poetry. It can make images out of some really specific parameters. And if you listen to some experts and developers, generative AI will eventually be able to make almost anything, including entire apps, from scratch. For now, the killer app for generative AI appears to be search.One of the first major generative AI products for the consumer market is Microsoft’s new AI-infused Bing, which debuted in January to great fanfare. The new Bing uses generative AI in its web search function to return results that appear as longer, written answers culled from various internet sources instead of a list of links to relevant websites. There’s also a new accompanying chat feature that lets users have human-seeming conversations with an AI chatbot.Related:Google is putting AI in basically everything, including searchThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?Google, the undisputed king of search for decades now, appeared to take on Microsoft’s AI dominance at its annual developers conference on May 10. The company announced that its days of behind-the-scenes, years-long, carefully considered generative AI development was over. Soon, AI should be a powerful feature in virtually every major Google product, from Google Docs to Gmail. Among many other tricks, the new generative AI technology can write emails and even create entire presentations — complete with images — out of a few text prompt. But the biggest changes are coming to Google’s bread and butter: search.In other words, the AI wars are now underway. And the battles may not just be over search engines. Generative AI is already starting to find its way into mainstream applications for everything from food shopping to social media. Microsoft and Google are the biggest companies with public-facing generative AI products, but they aren’t the only ones working on it. Apple, Meta, and Amazon have their own AI initiatives, and there are plenty of startups and smaller companies developing generative AI or working it into their existing products. TikTok has a generative AI text-to-image system. Design platform Canva has one, too. An app called Lensa creates stylized selfies and portraits (sometimes with ample bosoms). And the open-source model Stable Diffusion can generate detailed and specific images in all kinds of styles from text prompts. Generative AI has the potential to be a revolutionary technology, and it’s certainly being hyped as suchGenerative AI has the potential to be a revolutionary technology, and it’s certainly being hyped as such. Venture capitalists, who are always looking for the next big tech thing, believe that generative AI can replace or automate a lot of creative processes, freeing up humans to do more complex tasks and making people more productive overall. But it’s not just creative work that generative AI can produce. It can help developers make software. It could improve education. It may be able to discover new drugs or become your therapist. It just might make our lives easier and better.Or it could make things a lot worse. There are reasons to be concerned about the damage generative AI can do if it’s released to a society that isn’t ready for it — or if we ask the AI program to do something it isn’t ready for. How ethical or responsible generative AI technologies are is largely in the hands of the companies developing them, as there are few if any regulations or laws in place governing AI. This powerful technology could put millions of people out of work if it’s able to automate entire industries. It could spawn a destructive new era of misinformation. There are also concerns of bias due to a lack of diversity in the material and data that generative AI is trained on, or the people who are overseeing that training.Nevertheless, powerful generative AI tools are making their way to the masses. If 2022 was the “year of generative AI,” 2023 is shaping up to be the year that generative AI is actually put to use, ready or not.The slow, then sudden, rise of generative AIConventional artificial intelligence is already integrated into a ton of products we use all the time, like autocomplete, voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, and even the recommendations for music or movies we might enjoy on streaming services. But generative AI is more sophisticated. It uses deep learning, or algorithms that create artificial neural networks that are meant to mimic how human brains process information and learn. And then those models are fed enormous amounts of data to train on. For example, large language models power things like ChatGPT, which train on text collected from around the internet until they learn to generate and mimic those kinds of texts and conversations upon request. Image models have been fed tons of images and captions that describe them in order to learn how to create new content based on prompts.After years of development, most of it outside of public view, generative AI hit the mainstream in 2022 with the widespread releases of art and text models. Models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, which was released by OpenAI, were first to go viral, and they let anyone create new images from text prompts. Then came OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT stands for “generative pre-trained transformer”) which got everyone’s attention. This tool could create large, entirely new chunks of text from simple prompts. For the most part, ChatGPT worked really well, too — better than anything the world had seen before.Though it’s one of many AI startups out there, OpenAI seems to have the most advanced or powerful products right now. Or at least, it’s the startup that has given the general public access to its services, thereby providing the most evidence of its progress in the generative AI field. This is a demonstration of its abilities as well as a source of even more data for OpenAI’s models to learn from. OpenAI is also backed by some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab with $1 billion in support from the likes of Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Amazon, and former Y Combinator president Sam Altman, who is now the company’s CEO. OpenAI has since changed its structure to become a for-profit company but has yet to make a profit or even much by way of revenue. That’s not a problem yet, as OpenAI has gotten a considerable amount of funding from Microsoft, which began investing in OpenAI in 2019. And OpenAI is seizing on the wave of excitement for ChatGPT to promote its API services, which are not free. Neither is the company’s upcoming ChatGPT Plus service. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in July 2022. Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesOther big tech companies have for years been working on their own generative AI initiatives. There’s Apple’s Gaudi, Meta’s LLaMA and Make-a-Scene, Amazon’s collaboration with Hugging Face, and Google’s LaMDA (which is good enough that one Google engineer thought it was sentient). But thanks to its early investment in OpenAI, Microsoft had access to the AI project everyone knew about and was trying out.In January 2023, Microsoft announced it was giving $10 billion to OpenAI, bringing its total investment in the company to $13 billion. From that partnership, Microsoft has gotten what it hopes will be a real challenge to Google’s longtime dominance in web search: a new Bing powered by generative AI. We’ll soon see how well Google’s AI-powered search engine can compete.AI search will give us the first glimpse of how generative AI can be used in our everyday lives ... if it worksTech companies and investors are willing to pour resources into generative AI because they hope that, eventually, it will be able to create or generate just about any kind of content humans ask for. Some of those aspirations may be a long way from becoming reality, but right now, it’s possible that generative AI will power the next evolution of the humble internet search. After months of rumors that both Microsoft and Google were working on generative AI versions of their web search engines, Microsoft debuted its AI-integrated Bing in January in a splashy media event that showed off all the cool things it could do, thanks to OpenAI’s custom-built technology that powered it. Instead of entering a prompt for Bing to look up and return a list of relevant links, you could ask Bing a question and get a “complete answer” composed by Bing’s generative AI and culled from various sources on the web that you didn’t have to take the time to visit yourself. You could also use Bing’s chatbot to ask follow-up questions to better refine your search results. The resultsmay not always be accurate and you might even get insulted, as happened to a few people who pushed past Bing AI’s supposed guardrails found, but Microsoft was going full steam ahead anyway. In the ensuing months, it added AI to a bunch of its products, from the Windows 11 operating system to Office.This posed a major threat to Google, which has had the search market sewn up for decades and makes most of its revenue from the ads placed alongside its search results. Though Google has been working on its own generative AI models for years, the company says it kept them away from the public until it was sure the technology was safe to deploy. As soon Microsoft emerged as a major competitive threat, Google decided it was safe enough.After the underwhelming limited release of its Bard chatbot, Google began to roll out its real generative AI offerings at its I/O developers conference in May. Like Microsoft, Google was incorporating the AI features into as many things as possible. If you opt into the new Search Generative Experience, you can ask Google questions and it will return conversational answers, courtesy of its newest large language model, Pathways Language Model, or PaLM 2. Google’s workspace apps will also soon have something called Duet AI to help you write emails and documents, generate images, and more.So although Microsoft was the first off the starting line, we’re about to see if Google can catch up. We’re also about to see how the rest of the world responds to having powerful AI tools at their fingertips. Hopefully, they’re as safe as their developers claim they are.We’ll soon see how well Google’s AI-powered search engine can compete.Again, Microsoft and Google aren’t the only companies working on generative AI, but their public releases have put more pressure on others to roll out their offerings as soon as possible, too. Meta is working to get its generative AI into as many of its own products as possible and just released a large language model of its own, called Large Language Model Meta AI, or LLaMA. And it seems like everyone is flocking to OpenAI to jam its ChatGPT and Whisper services to their businesses. Snapchat now has a chatbot called “My AI,” though reviews have been mixed, as is its ability to keep that bot from discussing inappropriate topics with Snapchat’s younger users. Instacart will use ChatGPT in a feature called “Ask Instacart” that can answer customers’ questions about food. Shopify’s Shop app has a ChatGPT-powered assistant to make personalized recommendations from the brands and stores that use the platform. Expedia says its ChatGPT integration helps users plan vacations, though it also stressed that this was still in a beta-testing phase and highlighted some of the ways Expedia already uses less-sophisticated forms of AI and machine learning on its app and website.Generative AI is here to stay, but we don’t yet know if that’s for the bestBing AI’s problems were just a glimpse of how generative AI can go wrong and have potentially disastrous consequences. That’s why pretty much every company that’s in the field of AI goes out of its way to reassure the public that it’s being very responsible with its products and taking great care before unleashing them on the world. Yet for all of their stated commitment to “building AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe,” Microsoft and OpenAI either didn’t or couldn’t ensure a Bing chatbot could live up to those principles, but they released it anyway. Google and Meta, by contrast, were very conservative about releasing their products — until Microsoft and OpenAI gave them a push.Error-prone generative AI is being put out there by many other companies that have promised to be careful. Some text-to-image models are infamous for producing images with missing or extra limbs. There are chatbots that confidently declare the winner of a Super Bowl that has yet to be played. These mistakes are funny as isolated incidents, but we’ve already seen one publication rely on generative AI to write authoritative articles with significant factual errors. And a law professor discovered that ChatGPT was saying he was accused of sexual harassment, basing that assertion on a Washington Post article that didn’t exist. Bing’s chatbot then repeated that false claim, citing the professor’s own op-ed about it.Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the new Google search experience at the company’s I/O conference in May 2023. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThese screw-ups have been happening for years. Microsoft had one high-profile AI chatbot flop with its 2016 release of Tay, which Twitter users almost immediately trained to say some really offensive things. Microsoft quickly took it offline. Meta’s Blenderbot is based on a large language model and was released in August 2022. It didn’t go well. The bot seemed to hate Facebook, got racist and antisemitic, and wasn’t very accurate. It’s still available to try out, but after seeing what ChatGPT can do, it feels like a clunky, slow, and weird step backward.There are even more serious concerns. Generative AI threatens to put a lot of people out of work if it’s good enough to replace them. It could have a profound impact on education. There are also questions of legalities over the material AI developers are using to train their models, which is typically scraped from millions of sources that the developers don’t have the rights to. And there are questions of bias both in the material that AI models are training on and the people who are training them. It’s also a possibility that generative AI will be used to deliberately spread disinformation. An AI-generated image of the pope wearing a stylish coat, made using Midjourney, fooled a lot of people and demonstrated how close we may be to a world where it’s nearly impossible to tell what’s real and what isn’t.On the other side, some conservative bomb-throwers have accused generative AI developers of moderating their platforms’ outputs too much and making them “woke” and biased against the right wing. To that end, Musk, the self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist and OpenAI critic as well as an early investor, is reportedly considering developing a ChatGPT rival that won’t have content restrictions or be trained on supposedly “woke” material.And then there’s the fear not of generative AI but of the technology it could lead to: artificial general intelligence. AGI can learn and think and solve problems like a human, if not better. This has given rise to science fiction-based fears that AGI will lead to an army of super-robots that quickly realize they have no need for humans and either turn us into slaves or wipe us out entirely.There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about generative AI’s future, too. It’s a powerful technology with a ton of potential, and we’ve still seen relatively little of what it can do and who it can help. Silicon Valley clearly sees this potential, and venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia seem to be all-in. OpenAI is valued at nearly $30 billion, despite not having yet proved itself as a revenue generator. Generative AI has the power to upend a lot of things, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll make them worse. Its ability to automate tasks may give humans more time to focus on the stuff that can’t be done by increasingly sophisticated machines, as has been true for technological advances before it. And in the near future — once the bugs are worked out — it could make searching the web better. In the years and decades to come, it might even make everything else better, too.Oh, and in case you were wondering: No, generative AI did not write this explainer.Update, May 11, 5 pm ET: This story was originally published on March 4 and has been updated with information about ChatGPT’s expansion and Google’s AI integrations.Correction, May 12, 10:15 am ET: A photo caption in an earlier version of this story misidentified Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment is a topic of much debate and discussion. While it is true that AI has the potential to automate certain tasks and displace some workers, it is important to note that it also has the potential to create new jobs and opportunities.
Some experts predict that AI will lead to job displacement in certain sectors, particularly those involving repetitive or routine tasks, such as manufacturing and administrative support. However, other experts argue that AI will augment human capabilities and create new jobs in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and software engineering.
Healthcare, agriculture, finance, and education are just a few of the sectors in Africa that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform. Following are a few effects of AI in Africa:
By helping physicians and other healthcare professionals with disease diagnosis and treatment, AI can increase access to healthcare in Africa. Mobile apps with AI capabilities, for instance, can assist in the diagnosis of common ailments like malaria and tuberculosis, which are widespread in Africa.
By giving producers data-driven insights, AI can increase crop yields and decrease waste in the agricultural industry. For instance, AI can examine soil information and weather patterns to assist farmers in making knowledgeable crop planting choices.
By offering accessible and affordable financial services to unbanked populations, AI can help boost financial inclusion in Africa. Customer access to financial services, for instance, can be facilitated by chatbots powered by AI without the need for real branches.
By offering pupils personalised learning experiences, artificial intelligence can enhance education in Africa. AI-powered tutoring systems, for instance, can adjust to different learners’ learning preferences and give pupils feedback that is relevant to them.
In general, the impact of AI on employment in Africa will depend on a variety of factors, including the level of investment in AI technology, the availability of skilled workers to design and implement AI systems, and the extent to which businesses and policymakers prioritize the development of AI-related skills and training.
However, there are also worries about how AI will affect Africa, including employment loss, algorithmic bias, and data privacy issues. It’s crucial to make sure that the advantages of AI are shared fairly and that the appropriate legal frameworks are in place to safeguard citizens’ rights.
It is important to note that while AI may displace some workers in the short term, it has the potential to create new jobs and opportunities in the long term. For example, AI may enable businesses to innovate and develop new products and services, which in turn can create new jobs in areas such as marketing, sales, and customer support.

The hype surrounding ChatGPT and new search engines from Google and Microsoft is intensifying interest in artificial intelligence across many sectors.The AI industry is vast, encompassing not only buzzy chatbots and conversational search engines but also things like self-driving vehicles. The excitement around OpenAI's ChatGPT has already prompted some companies to consider how they can leverage the tech for specific business needs. Several news outlets, for example, have tapped the chatbot to generate some content.

""ChatGPT is a good example of how the barriers of using AI are dropping quite substantially and in a very rapid fashion,"" Matthew Forshaw, a senior skills advisor at the Alan Turing Institute, told Insider. For many companies, tools like ChatGPT could be used in an assistive capacity, managed by workers with knowledge of AI tech and ethics, Forshaw said.

Big technology companies have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent months, but workers with AI skills are still in demand. Jim Monroe of Ada, an automation company specializing in customer service, said that a lot of companies ""are still prioritizing AI roles both in terms of the hiring as well as if they are conducting layoffs.""Insider spoke with five experts about breaking into the field. Here's their best advice for jobseekers.1. Build a strong foundation in math and computer scienceHaving a firm grasp of technical skills around deep learning can help candidates land AI roles with higher salaries.Many high-paying jobs in the AI industry, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers, usually require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a technical field such as computer science or math, experts previously told Insider.

Highly educated data scientists and core AI specialists with technical know-how are still highly in demand despite recent layoffs, Forshaw said.Ngaire Moyes, LinkedIn's UK country manager, told Insider that ""machine-learning engineer"" had been one of LinkedIn's fastest-rising jobs in the UK for the past two years.

""As AI continues to become embedded into how many organisations operate day-to-day, it is a trend we anticipate will only continue to grow,"" she said.Some experts also recommend learning programming languages and gaining an understanding of AI frameworks, the programming interfaces that serve as building blocks to train and deploy AI models.

""Candidates do have to have baseline programming knowledge at some level,"" Ada's Monroe said. ""Programming skills in Java, Python, PHP, C., or Ruby would be fairly common. Natural language processing is really hot right now, but data science and data analytics skills are still in high demand.""Math and statistical analysis are also important skills for many AI roles, Monroe said. There is an analytic component to correlating data and predictability to ensure the AI is presenting the right answers or outcomes in specific business cases, such as customer service chatbots, he said.2. Showcase your ability to solve real-world problemsPolo Chau, associate professor at Georgia Tech's School of Computational Science and Engineering, told Insider that job candidates need to be able to articulate how classroom learning translated to the real world. ""You need to connect the practical applications of what you know with the specific problems that your audience is trying to solve,"" he said.For instance, let's say you participated in a hackathon where you created machine learning programs using different statistical techniques. You should be able to explain to hiring managers how you developed or invented or adapted techniques that led to a significant improvement, and that can be applied to solve a problem, Chau said.

""If you're talking to a logistics company that's trying to improve how it routes packages, you can talk about speed improvements. If you're talking to a healthcare company that's trying to figure out patient eligibility for studies, you can talk about fairness improvements. If you're talking to a retailer that's trying to understand customer trends, you can talk about accuracy improvements,"" Chau said.3. Develop strong presentation skills and cultivate an empathetic mindsetThe most successful candidates have strong communication and presentation skills, Chau said. ""Throughout the pandemic, a lot of things have been virtual so people have not had the opportunity to present their work in front of a live audience,"" he said. ""Presenting on a screen when everyone is in a tiny box involves a different communication style and energy.""Now that many conferences and networking events are in-person again, candidates need to perfect their elevator pitches. This is true for people looking to work in AI, but it's also good advice for jobseekers more generally, too.  ""You need to have prepared a quick summary of what you've done,"" he said. ""And you need to practice it.""

A collaborative and empathetic approach is also key, Asu Ozdaglar, head of MIT's department of electrical engineering and computer science, told Insider. ""You need to know technical concepts around machine learning and algorithms and decision-making, but you also need to be asking, 'How should those decisions take into account the human context?'""ChatGPT's growing popularity illustrates that point, Ozdaglar said. ""In many cases these tools will be used to augment human decision-making. So when they're deployed they not only need to be effective and efficient, but also reliable, fair, and equitable.""4. Prioritize networking by attending eventsAs the AI arms race heats up across Silicon Valley, networking has become crucial to breaking into the industry. Brianne Kimmel, a venture capitalist who founded the Silicon Valley based venture firm Worklife Ventures, said many of the conversations around AI are happening at small dinners or self-funded weekend hackathons. So, it can feel like AI is limited to insiders, she said.

""The technology is accessible to everyone, and no longer limited to PhDs who work at Google, but the deals getting done are happening quickly and quietly,"" Kimmel said. Still, Kimmel— who recently launched a bootcamp for AI startups— suggests that it's best to jump in and learn alongside early builders. That's especially true for those who want to break into AI in areas like marketing, sales, or as non-technical operators as there's no need for formal education.""My usual framing of the problem is we're all figuring this out together,"" Kimmel said. She invited a dozen women in tech to attend a recent OpenAI hackathon even though they weren't all ready to make the leap to AI full-time. ""I think it's super important to come and learn about the technology and to just hear and observe the types of companies that are being built,"" Kimmel said. ""Six or 12 months from now, if you decide to leave a company, you have exposure to what's already been built, and areas with white space for starting a venture-scale business.""

Several news outlets, for example, have tapped the chatbot to generate some content. ""ChatGPT is a good example of how the barriers of using AI are dropping quite substantially and in a very rapid fashion,"" Matthew Forshaw, a senior skills advisor at the Alan Turing Institute, told Insider. For many companies, tools like ChatGPT could be used in an assistive capacity, managed by workers with knowledge of AI tech and ethics, Forshaw said. Big technology companies have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent months, but workers with AI skills are still in demand. Jim Monroe of Ada, an automation company specializing in customer service, said that a lot of companies ""are still prioritizing AI roles both in terms of the hiring as well as if they are conducting layoffs.""Insider spoke with five experts about breaking into the field. Here's their best advice for jobseekers.Having a firm grasp of technical skills around deep learning can help candidates land AI roles with higher salaries.Many high-paying jobs in the AI industry, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers, usually require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a technical field such as computer science or math, experts previously told Insider. Highly educated data scientists and core AI specialists with technical know-how are still highly in demand despite recent layoffs, Forshaw said.Ngaire Moyes, LinkedIn's UK country manager, told Insider that ""machine-learning engineer"" had been one of LinkedIn's fastest-rising jobs in the UK for the past two years.""As AI continues to become embedded into how many organisations operate day-to-day, it is a trend we anticipate will only continue to grow,"" she said.Some experts also recommend learning programming languages and gaining an understanding of AI frameworks, the programming interfaces that serve as building blocks to train and deploy AI models. ""Candidates do have to have baseline programming knowledge at some level,"" Ada's Monroe said. ""Programming skills in Java, Python, PHP, C., or Ruby would be fairly common. Natural language processing is really hot right now, but data science and data analytics skills are still in high demand.""Math and statistical analysis are also important skills for many AI roles, Monroe said. There is an analytic component to correlating data and predictability to ensure the AI is presenting the right answers or outcomes in specific business cases, such as customer service chatbots, he said.Polo Chau, associate professor at Georgia Tech's School of Computational Science and Engineering, told Insider that job candidates need to be able to articulate how classroom learning translated to the real world. ""You need to connect the practical applications of what you know with the specific problems that your audience is trying to solve,"" he said.For instance, let's say you participated in a hackathon where you created machine learning programs using different statistical techniques. You should be able to explain to hiring managers how you developed or invented or adapted techniques that led to a significant improvement, and that can be applied to solve a problem, Chau said.""If you're talking to a logistics company that's trying to improve how it routes packages, you can talk about speed improvements. If you're talking to a healthcare company that's trying to figure out patient eligibility for studies, you can talk about fairness improvements. If you're talking to a retailer that's trying to understand customer trends, you can talk about accuracy improvements,"" Chau said.The most successful candidates have strong communication and presentation skills, Chau said. ""Throughout the pandemic, a lot of things have been virtual so people have not had the opportunity to present their work in front of a live audience,"" he said. ""Presenting on a screen when everyone is in a tiny box involves a different communication style and energy.""Now that many conferences and networking events are in-person again, candidates need to perfect their elevator pitches. This is true for people looking to work in AI, but it's also good advice for jobseekers more generally, too.  ""You need to have prepared a quick summary of what you've done,"" he said. ""And you need to practice it.""A collaborative and empathetic approach is also key, Asu Ozdaglar, head of MIT's department of electrical engineering and computer science, told Insider. ""You need to know technical concepts around machine learning and algorithms and decision-making, but you also need to be asking, 'How should those decisions take into account the human context?'""ChatGPT's growing popularity illustrates that point, Ozdaglar said. ""In many cases these tools will be used to augment human decision-making. So when they're deployed they not only need to be effective and efficient, but also reliable, fair, and equitable.""As the AI arms race heats up across Silicon Valley, networking has become crucial to breaking into the industry. Brianne Kimmel, a venture capitalist who founded the Silicon Valley based venture firm Worklife Ventures, said many of the conversations around AI are happening at small dinners or self-funded weekend hackathons. So, it can feel like AI is limited to insiders, she said.   ""The technology is accessible to everyone, and no longer limited to PhDs who work at Google, but the deals getting done are happening quickly and quietly,"" Kimmel said. Still, Kimmel— who recently launched a bootcamp for AI startups— suggests that it's best to jump in and learn alongside early builders. That's especially true for those who want to break into AI in areas like marketing, sales, or as non-technical operators as there's no need for formal education.""My usual framing of the problem is we're all figuring this out together,"" Kimmel said. She invited a dozen women in tech to attend a recent OpenAI hackathon even though they weren't all ready to make the leap to AI full-time. ""I think it's super important to come and learn about the technology and to just hear and observe the types of companies that are being built,"" Kimmel said. ""Six or 12 months from now, if you decide to leave a company, you have exposure to what's already been built, and areas with white space for starting a venture-scale business.""",,,,"Here are 4 tips by experts on how to get hired working on chatbots, search engines, and self-driving cars i...","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-job-artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-bing-google-2023-2'}",,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'James Dean'}","[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But for now, most jobs are still safe.Share full articleRead in appChatGPTCredit...Jackie Molloy for The New York TimesBy Lauren JacksonMarch 2, 2023You’re reading The Morning newsletter.  Make sense of the day’s news and ideas. David Leonhardt and Times journalists guide you through what’s happening — and why it matters. Get it sent to your inbox.Eli Snyder, a special-education teacher in Colorado, wanted to play basketball with his students. He had questions: How could he adapt the game for a child with cerebral palsy? And how could he help his students with autism play a highly stimulating activity?ChatGPT had answers.The artificial intelligence chatbot had analyzed the internet’s vast amount of data, including information about disabilities and basketball. It used patterns it found in all that text to generate recommendations: Shrink the court size to reduce the distance players need to travel in wheelchairs. Lower the hoop and install a ramp leading up to it so students can roll the basketball into the net. Pair up players so each person has a buddy for support.Snyder could have found this information through a simple Google search. He turned to ChatGPT because it produced complete paragraphs instead of delivering links that would have left him with more clicking and synthesizing to do. The chatbot’s response helped him quickly write adapted lesson plans for each of his students.“It’s been revolutionary,” Snyder, 30, said. “What used to take me an hour now takes me five minutes.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTech giants are heralding ChatGPT as revolutionary, too. With millions of users, the chatbot has started an A.I. arms race. Companies are rushing to release their own chatbots, and some seem eerily human.Beyond the excitement, the technology’s possibilities can feel scary — as if science fiction has become reality. ChatGPT has already inspired many people to ask: Will A.I. take my job? It’s a familiar panic, one that resurfaces every time a groundbreaking innovation emerges, like the car or the internet. Still, questioning how A.I. could replace jobs in the future misses a more urgent point: The platform is changing how people work right now.How workers use A.I.Artificial intelligence already pervades our lives, powering voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, unlocking phones with facial recognition and auto-completing sentences in emails. ChatGPT gave millions of people the opportunity to test and interact with a version of the technology called generative A.I., which can write text and create images.Many workers are already using the tool in their jobs. The chatbot has written home descriptions for real estate agents, job descriptions for hiring managers and sales pitches for marketers.It excels at formulaic writing tasks because it mimics text that already exists online. House listings often feel canned, as do sales pitches, making it easy for ChatGPT to complete first drafts of those types of assignments.“ChatGPT solves the blank page problem,” Cody Gough, a marketing professional outside of Chicago, told me. “The worst thing in the world is opening an empty document. ChatGPT helps you start.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe limitationsAs we’ve covered in this newsletter, A.I. chatbots are flawed. They often make mistakes — like the one that led to a $100 billion drop in Google’s cumulative stock market value when it appeared in an ad.The workers I spoke to mostly use ChatGPT as a brainstorming tool and writing aid. They say the work of chatbots is sometimes inaccurate and often of lower quality than they could produce themselves, but that chatbots can still be useful.Alexia Mandeville, a video game designer in Texas, uses ChatGPT to help her brainstorm character names, conceive ideas for trailers and produce news releases for her games. “I’m making something that doesn’t need to be factual,” Mandeville said. Because her work is fictional, she added, ChatGPT needs to be creative, not accurate.The chatbot is still the tool, not the creator. It can copy writing styles, often replicating our weird internet behavior, as my colleague Cade Metz wrote. ChatGPT’s outputs are only as good as its inputs, so it struggles to reason, use logic, discern the truth and write imaginative work. It has tried and failed to write science fiction, for example. The human capacity for original thought is keeping white-collar professionals employed, even as A.I. poses more of a threat to them than earlier advancements did.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFreeing up more timeA.I. can’t do Snyder’s job of teaching music and gym classes. It can’t play the piano or the basketball game HORSE, and it can’t facilitate students’ social and emotional learning. But it gives Snyder more time for that work.“Everyone is talking about how A.I. is going to replace us,” Snyder said. “I don’t agree with that. It’s going to free up more time at our jobs to do other, more productive things.”A.I. will continue to transform industries as companies integrate it into a variety of tasks, like customer service from virtual agents, predictive product inventory and medical tests. ChatGPT will probably eliminate some roles while creating new jobs. That’s already started to happen: Companies are hiring workers to test and sell the most effective chatbot queries.The technology will only get better. A.I. is designed to learn, and companies are investing billions to develop more powerful versions of the tool. At some point, chatbots could write finished products instead of just often-inaccurate first drafts — and eliminate far more jobs.Until then, most of them are safe.For moreEzra Klein argues we’re too worried about what A.I. can do, and not worried enough about who controls the technology.Chatbot conversations can be creepy, but that doesn’t mean the bots are alive.

Key Takeaways
Some people are turning to AI platforms like ChatGPT for mental health support, but this is risky when they definitely aren't qualified medical professionals. AI chatbots for mental health are being developed, however.AI in mental health is still relatively new but could become more useful in the future.
 Since its launch at the end of November last year, ChatGPT has taken over the internet's imagination. The artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI has a seemingly unlimited number of uses—when it comes to information generation—and it definitely doesn't stop at writing essays and cover letters. Now, people are also starting to use it as a therapist.


 How does this work? ChatGPT provides information in a conversational way, so if you ask it a question relating to your feelings of hopelessness and fear about the future, it can offer you tips pretty fast. It may not be a real person, but it delivers the exact information you need without you having to sift through pages of online information, nor does it keep you waiting for an appointment with a human (or online) therapist.


 The only problem is, ChatGPT isn't designed to be a therapist, and it isn't updated past 2021. It should go without saying there are numerous risks to getting health suggestions from an AI robot who did not go to medical school, but it does spark a broader conversation about the potential uses of AI in the mental health sector—when applied appropriately.




 “ChatGPT and the conversations around impact could actually open up more opportunities,” explains Chaitali Sinha, head of clinical development and research at Wysa. “Rather than fear around chatbots there is now an expectation they can be used for positive impact. People are expecting more out of AI than they used to.""


Best Mental Health Apps

  Potential Benefits of AI in the Therapy Context  
 Even if we’re to discount ChatGPT for the moment, there are still a lot of advancements being made when it comes to mental health and AI. Platforms and apps like Wysa are helping to change the way we think about mental health—as Sinha says, “It should be just as normal to have a mental health app on your phone and in your hand as any other app”. 


 Human therapists are just that—human. They can be biased, even if it's subconsciously. A therapist could be racist, homophobic, or ableist—using an AI therapist removes the risk of someone speaking to a therapist who might not actually work for them.


 Or, people might feel worried about their therapist judging them or sharing confidential information, or perhaps not quite feel ready to speak to a real person about sensitive topics—particularly if they’ve had negative experiences with therapy in the past. 


 Not only that, but sometimes therapists can get sick, or have things going on in their own lives that mean they need to cancel or postpone appointments. They might burn out, or not be on top form for an appointment.1 In contrast, an AI therapist won’t.

In the future, it is likely that AI-based tools will be able to provide more personalized and tailored treatments for individuals suffering from various mental health issues by utilizing a variety of data points such as lifestyle habits, medical history, and more.
— Ergo Sooru, CEO of DrHouse
 And there are often long waiting lists for therapy. A human therapist can only speak to one person, or group, at a time. And they need sleep, lunch breaks, and time away from work too. Could AI therapy get waiting lists down, or become a more affordable option for people struggling to find the money for therapy? 


 “People don’t experience struggles at ‘convenient’ times,” says Sinha. “Their mental health is always there, becoming more challenging when it does, not when it’s easiest to get help.


 “But none of our therapy mechanisms that we have so far actually are designed for the lived experience of someone with mental health and AI is bridging the gap.”


 She brings up that often, people will have an appointment once a week, whereas they might need support at another time. She describes AI as “bridging the gap of the needs people have”, in a way that humans just can’t. 


 “People are unlikely to call crisis support helplines every night, but can get support from apps like Wysa, and health professionals can provide Wysa to use in between sessions, so people are not left with no support.” 


Chat Bots and AI Are Changing Mental Health Care, Beware

  Drawbacks of Artificial Intelligence  
 There are potential drawbacks to AI therapy too. 


 Possible security and privacy issues are a big one. When you share information with an AI therapist, where does it go? Could there be risks of hacking, for instance? Indeed, the ethics of AI in mental health care is something that’s previously been discussed, with researchers weighing up the trade-off between more personalized care and concerns around privacy, autonomy, and bias.2


 Also, human connection is really important in therapy. Even though it's a doctor-patient relationship, the face-to-face interaction is a huge part of what makes therapy effective. It's why people open up.


 “AI-based therapies are not able to interpret the non-verbal cues which are essential for a successful therapeutic relationship,” says Ergo Sooru, co-founder and CEO of DrHouse. “Nor are they able to provide the same level of emotional support and understanding as a human can.”


 The development of AI therapists is certainly exciting. But we aren’t quite there yet. Even the best AI therapist won’t be of the same standard as a good, qualified, and capable human therapist. 


What This Means For You
The possibilities for the future of mental health care are vast, and artificial intelligence might be a viable option down the road. But right now people should be wary of the temptation to use tools for Chat GPT for mental health advice. The technology just isn't there yet. But even if it does get there one day, there is no substitute for in-person therapy, and the goal should be supplemental care, not a replacement for talking to a certified professional—who is human.



How to Know When It’s Time to See a Therapist

  Incorporating AI Into Mental Health Care  
 A combination of human and AI therapy is probably the best option looking forward. Quick support when you're in dire need, but human care as your main, ongoing solution for care. After all, everybody is different. For some people, a human therapist might be the only option they entertain. Others might be more open to AI therapy.


 Sooru says that there should be a great degree of human intervention in AI therapy “to ensure that the patient is receiving the best care possible”. 


 But AI can still be used in mental health care even if the therapists themselves aren’t AI. A study from 2019 involved AI categorizing thousands of statements from therapists in online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions spanning 90,000 hours, and the study supports the idea that CBT is linked with improvement in patient symptoms.3 


 Studies like this one show how AI can support mental health care in other ways, particularly as advancements continue to be made. 


The Best Online Therapy Programs
We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain.

  The Future of Mental Health and AI  
 “​​It’s still early days for AI related to mental health, although clearly changes are happening,” says Sinha. “But what we are seeing is an appetite for a digital solution. Wysa might be artificial intelligence but the team behind it are very much humans, and bring immense expertise and experience to ensure that Wysa provides empathy and compassion.


 “What we want is to offer people the tool that works for them, on their terms.”


 “In the future, it is likely that AI-based tools will be able to provide more personalized and tailored treatments for individuals suffering from various mental health issues by utilizing a variety of data points such as lifestyle habits, medical history, and more,” adds Sooru.4


 “Overall, AI-based tools can be beneficial in aiding mental health, but currently, they should not be used as a replacement for traditional forms of therapy.”

Published: Mar 05, 2023 03:34 AM ESTChristopher McFaddena year ago0ShareIs AI-generated art really art?DALL·E 2/OpenAI  
Artificial intelligence has been used for years to create artwork ranging from paintings and drawings to music and even poetry. 
Built by training algorithms on large datasets of existing artwork and then using those algorithms to generate new pieces, AI-generated art can create some fascinating images. 
But AI-generated art has sparked discussions about the nature of creativity and the artist’s role. 

Whether you believe AI-generated art is, indeed, art or not, the genre is with us and will continue to be for some time to come. But if you have no idea what it is or want to know more, we’ll explore this exciting new horizon in artistic expression. 
How do AI art generators work?
AI art generators use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to generate art. Large sets of already-made art are used to teach these algorithms how to find patterns and styles that can be used to make new art. Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

What is AI art?

DALL·E 2/OpenAI  



The process of generating AI art typically involves the following steps:

Dataset Selection: The first step in creating an AI art generator is selecting a dataset of existing artwork that the machine learning algorithm can use to learn the style and patterns of the art.
Training: Once the dataset is selected, the machine learning algorithm is trained on the images in the dataset. This involves feeding the images through a neural network, which learns the features and patterns common to the dataset’s art.
Generation: After the machine learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to generate new art. This involves inputting a random seed or a desired input and letting the algorithm create an output based on the patterns and features it has learned from the training data.
Refinement: The generated artwork is often refined using additional algorithms and techniques, such as style transfer or image filtering, to create a final image that is more aesthetically pleasing.

AI art generators can use different algorithms and methods depending on what the artist wants to make and how they want it to look. Some popular AI art generators include DeepDream, StyleGAN, and CycleGAN.
How can you create art using AI? 
If you want to create your artwork using AI, how you do this will depend on your needs. 

AI art is causing a big stir in the art world.

Stable Diffusion/OpenAI 



At present, the most common ways include, but are not limited to: 

Use an AI art generator: One of the simplest ways to create art using AI is to use an existing AI art generator. These generators use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to generate new artwork based on a given input, such as a text description or an image.
Modify existing art using AI: Another approach to creating art using AI is to modify existing artwork using AI tools. For example, you could use a style transfer algorithm to transfer the style of one image onto another or use an image filtering algorithm to create a new version of an existing image.
Collaborate with an AI: You can also create art by collaborating with an AI system. This can involve using an AI system to generate a set of possible designs or elements and then selecting the ones you find most interesting to incorporate into your artwork.
Use AI to assist with the creation process: AI can also help with various aspects of the creative process, such as generating color palettes, suggesting compositions, or even creating rough sketches based on a set of parameters.

In general, making art with AI is an iterative and experimental process that involves exploring the capabilities of different AI tools and techniques and incorporating them into your creative process. 


It takes technical skill, an artistic eye, and a willingness to try new things and take risks as an artist.
Can you create your own AI art generator?
It is most certainly possible to create your own AI art generator. But making an AI art generator can be challenging. You must know much about machine learning, programming, and image processing.
To make an AI art generator, you need to go through a series of steps that usually include the following:

Define the scope of your project: Decide what kind of art generator you want to create, the type of images you want it to generate, and the tools you will need to build it.
Collect and preprocess data: Gather a dataset of images that will be used to train your AI art generator. You may need to preprocess these images to ensure they are consistent in size, color, and format.
Train your model: Use a deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to train a model that can generate new images. You must define your model’s architecture and introduce it to your dataset.
Generate images: Use your trained model to generate new ideas. You may need to experiment with different input parameters to create a range of other images.
Refine your images: Use post-processing techniques to refine your generated pictures and create an aesthetically pleasing final product.



While it is possible to create your own AI art generator, it can be a challenging task. A solid background in machine learning or working with a team with experience in this field may be helpful.
What is the purpose of AI art?
The purpose of AI art can be multifaceted and varies depending on the context in which it is created. 
For example, AI art is often created to explore the creative potential of machine learning and deep neural networks. By pushing the limits of AI-generated art, artists, and researchers can help us learn more about what these systems can do and develop new ideas.
AI art can also be seen as a way of creating new forms of artistic expression that are impossible with traditional techniques. AI systems that can make complex, highly detailed images or unexpected combinations of elements can lead to new kinds of visual art that make us rethink what is possible.
AI art can also be used to critique or comment on the role of technology in society. AI artists can ask important questions about the relationship between technology and people by looking at how AI can improve and replace human creativity.


Finally, AI art can be seen as a way of giving people a new way of experiencing art. AI art can provide us with a unique and interesting way to interact with the world around us. This can be done through interactive installations, generative pieces that change over time, or immersive experiences that blur the line between art and technology.
Is AI-generated artwork art? 
Whether art made by AI is “art” is still being discussed, and the answer depends on how each person defines “art.” Also, without getting too off-topic, the word “art” is very subjective. 
Take the modern art (and architecture) style “De Stijl” (or “The Style” in Dutch). The production of abstract paintings using basic visual elements such as bold primary colors, geometric shapes, and intersecting plane surfaces characterizes this style. The movement focused on an abstract, pared-down aesthetic. Do you consider this art? 
What about painting miniature airplanes or wargame soldiers? Is that art? 
When it comes to AI art, many people say that art is inherently human and that true art must involve human creativity, intention, and expression. From this point of view, AI-generated art might seem to lack the human element that gives art its meaning and value.
On the other hand, others argue that the use of AI in art represents a new form of artistic expression that is valid in its own right. They say AI-generated artwork can be beautiful, thought-provoking, and meaningful, reflecting these new technologies’ unique capabilities and limitations.

Do you think AI-generated art is actually art?

Stable Diffusion/OpenAI 



Ultimately, whether AI-generated artwork is “art” may be less important than its impact on the art world and society. Whether or not you think it’s “art,” AI-generated art raises essential questions about creativity, how humans and machines interact, and how technology shapes our culture and society. After all, art has always reflected, in some way, the society it is created in.
AI-generated art is still very much in its infancy, so we are yet to see its impact, if any, on the art world. 
Is AI art copyrighted? Who owns it?
Do you want to open that “can of worms?” Yes? Sadly, this is not a simple question to answer. 
The question of who owns the copyright for AI-generated art is a complex legal issue that does not have a clear answer. It may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the artwork’s creation.
In general, copyright laws are meant to protect original works of art that are written or drawn on a physical medium. In the case of art made by AI, the question of who owns it may depend on how much humans were involved in the process.
If an AI system makes all of the art on its own, with no or little help from humans, it’s not clear who would own the copyright. Some people say that the copyright should belong to the person or company that made the AI system, like the programmer or company that developed the AI system. Some people say that the AI system itself could be considered the creator and owner of the copyright, just like an artist would own the copyright to their work.


If, however, a human is involved in the creative process in a big way, like when a human artist gives input to or guides an AI system, it could be a bit murkier. In that case, the copyright may be owned by the artist who contributed to the creation of the artwork. The AI generator, in this case, could just be considered a tool. 
Ultimately, as technology changes, copyright ownership for art made by AI is likely to be a subject of ongoing legal debate. New legal frameworks are being developed to address these new forms of creative expression.
And that’s your lot for today. 
AI art is a rapidly evolving field, stretching the definition of “art.” While some people are skeptical of machines creating art, it is clear that AI-generated works have already had a significant impact on the art world. They’ve been displayed in museums and galleries and sold for large sums at auction.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Before employing artificial intelligence (AI) to find job candidates, Southwest Airlines had no definitive way to track the success of the company’s email and website hiring campaigns. The airline also couldn’t queue up potential applicants who’d logged into a job listings page and left before an applicable position had been posted.
Since it began using an AI-enabled hiring platform from tech firm Phenom, the airline now has “a warm pipeline of candidates” it can draw on whenever jobs opportunities arise, according to Kelby Tansey, manager for recruitment marketing at Southwest Airlines.
Tansey said the airline can now reach out to “passive” job candidates who came to Southwest but couldn’t find an open position at the time.











 
 
 
“We’ll drive them into certain pipelines within the Phenom platform so we can capture their resume, their skills, and note some of those candidates and then let them know when the job opens up,” Tansey said.

Southwest is among a growing number of organizations turning to AI-based tools to identify potential job candidates, schedule interviews, and reduce the overall time recruiters and hiring managers spend on those tasks.
From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects this year, according to recent studies.

Southwest Airline’s recruitment site powered by Phenom’s AI software.


Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchases of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire.
Forrester Research Principal Analyst Betsy Summers said she’s been getting more inquiries from clients about AI recruiting platforms.
“It has touched a nerve in the HR and recruiting world, promising to fix problems and frustrations that have been plaguing those teams — hard to decipher competency models, job descriptions that are vague or biased, increasing talent competition,” Summers said.











 
 
 
The questions Summers gets about recruitment platforms go beyond talent acquisition and include “skills-as-a-service” technology that has “a huge potential impact on how organizations plan their workforce, develop them, how and where they allocate work, and how they grow and retain workers.
“It could be a game changer,” Summers said.
A growing number of AI-based options
Along with Phenom’s SaaS-based Intelligent Talent Experience platform, other leading providers of AI-based talent acquisition software and services include Eightfold, Beamery, and Seekout — all of which perform skills inference and candidate-job matching. Other notable vendors include Clovers (with its recent acquisition of Talvista), HireVue, Pymetrics (recently acquired by Harver), and iCIMS, according to Forrester Research.











 
 
 
AI-based recruitment platforms can find “more diverse talent pools, and [offer] a more accurate approach to qualifying candidates by matching skills rather than on a job title match or other signal,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Betsy Summers.
Some of the use cases for talent acquisition platforms are efficiency-oriented, since  they’re used for interview scheduling, managing the candidate application process, assisting recruiters with follow-ups, and managing the applicant pipeline. Other platforms also focus on bias mitigation such as adjusting language in job descriptions and candidate communications to be more inclusive. Still others include remote video capabilities that automate early interviews.
 Phenom
HireVue’s candidate interviewing software, for example, uses a natural language bot to conduct an interview and provide a transcript for hiring managers and recruiters. It also has a video component that records an interview, offering each would-be hire 30 seconds to prepare for each question, and up to three minutes to answer. The video is then sent to the hiring manager to view.











 
 
 
Talent acquisition software also often relies on “fits scoring,” which uses specific metrics to match a job candidate’s qualifications to a specific opening.
Saving time at SASR Worforce Solutions
Bradley Cooper, director of IT at staffing firm SASR Workforce Solutions, said each recruiter in his company is responsible for hiring at least 360 people annually for various clients. In October 2021, SASR went live with Phenom’s platform, which  immediately provided efficiencies — among them, automatically matching candidates to job openings before a recruiter even contacted an applicant.
“When you work at our volume, you need tools to help get the candidates to you in a timely manner,” Cooper said. “As soon as a job opportunity is available, we can make it known to the candidate, and that goes out to the job board Phenom has. Before that, it just wasn’t a good recruiter or candidate experience.”

An overview of when SASR sees the most traffic on its career site, which enables the staffing firm to use its dynamic and static list to create and deliver marketing campaigns during peak interaction times. 


As soon as a job candidate begins the application process, Phenom’s software begins building a profile of the person; if they’re a good fit for a SASR client, it feeds the candidate to a recruiter who can interview them, make an offer, and start the onboarding process. If the prospect is not yet ready to accept an offer, Phenom’s platform places them in a future candidate “talent community” or queue, allowing SASR to continue to contact them as opportunities come up.
SASR uses Phenom Hosted Apply, which provides a consistent experience for candidates, where they go from learning about a job to applying for it without having to leave the career site. Hosted Apply leverages API integrations Phenom made with third-party applicant tracking systems (ATS), and avoids the need for a candidate to get redirected to a separate ATS application process.
Phenom’s platform also builds out a dynamic and static list of potential candidates. The former has candidates who are added or removed as they find work; the latter is a constant list of workers who can be accessed for seasonal or part-time positions. The lists can also be used to develop recruiting campaigns, Cooper said.











 
 
 
“Over time, as we add more candidates to the list, the AI will recognize the like candidates with the same skills and locations for opportunities, so that allows us to see the best fit upfront,” Cooper said. “The really cool part about having a dynamic list is it allows you to target them for a specific opportunity, or if we do a specific campaign, we can curate that messaging to them through email or SMS to hit the correct touchpoints.”
 SASR

This is a KPI roll up providing visibility on SASR’s Job Seeker interviews. It’s important that interviews happen quickly, as job seekers tend to lose interest if an interview is not scheduled within a few days of application. 


Automated recruiting can save money
The return on investment for an automated recruiting platform can be tremendous. One study funded by Phenom and performed by Forrester showed a 449% ROI over three years with a payback period of less than six months — equaling more than $24 million in savings and business benefits.
The study showed that, on average, the recruiting platforms saved hiring managers and recruiters 11 hours per week. The software also increased the number of hires and decreased costs of new-hire onboarding, training, and time to productivity. 











 
 
 
Job recruiters at Southwest Airlines saw a 40% time savings when using Phenom’s analytics tools to find candidates, automate scheduling and do video interviews.
“After we went live with Phenom’s career site refresh in September, we saw a 25% increase in website engagement. That means more candidates are visiting more [job] pages,” Tansey said. “From a hiring perspective, we’re able to capture all candidate data in one place, follow up on leads, keep them nurtured and warm, and drive them to apply.”
“If we were driving only leads to jobs only open now, we wouldn’t be able to get the full value out of what we could do from an evergreen strategy…,” Tansey said. “We’re even able to engage at the campus level with kids who may be pursuing careers and keep them warm and bring them into our pipelines.”











 
 
 
AI can help uncover soft skills
Another feature of talent acquisition services is the ability to uncover a candidate’s “soft skills” including their ability to learn, work as a team player, be creative, or have empathy.
For example, AI-firm Paradox has bot software named “Olivia” that’s used, among other tools, to automate hiring for companies such as McDonalds, Speedway, Lowe’s and American Eagle. Paradox also acquired Traitify, whose software assesses a candidate based on five metrics: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Candidates are given a test that takes about 10 minutes and includes images the user responds to by selecting either “me” or “not me”.
Chatbots are typically employed by recruitment platforms to engage job seekers and ask them about their interests and skills; the bots can then present candidates with open positions for which they’re most qualified to apply.











 
 
 
For example, Phenom’s chatbot allows job seekers to peruse various markets, such as engineering, marketing, sales, and data science and machine learning. It then asks questions such as, “Ae you willing to relocate? and “How many years and specific experience do you have?” Once the queries are completed, the chatbot presents open positions the candidate can apply for.

The downside of AI platforms
Allyn Bailey, who spent 11 years as an HR recruitment executive at Intel, cautioned against becoming too dependent on chatbots because they may contain unintentional biases, leading to discrimination in the hiring process. Basically, the chatbot is only as good as the developers who created it.
“So, while ChatGPT can streamline the job application process, it’s best used as a supplement to traditional methods of evaluating candidates. You still need that human interaction and relationship building,” said Bailey, now the executive director of “hiring success” for talent acquisition platform SmartRecruiters. “And don’t forget to be mindful of the potential dangers and take steps to mitigate them.”











 
 
 
ChatGPT, and other AI-based tools, can only provide pre-written responses to candidates, and they may not accurately reflect that person’s unique skills, personality, and communication abilities. “That human touch is so important in the hiring process, and you don’t want to lose that,” Bailey said.
Forrester Research’s Summers agreed, saying AI ideally should qualify more  candidates into the pipeline than qualifying them out. AI should also help mitigate natural human bias in qualifying and selecting talent, not amplify it.
“Still fresh in our memory are stories about AI perpetuating bias in their qualification algorithm,” Summers said. “And in the case of interview analysis, AI not trained on women, people of color, and non-native English speakers can misread facial and vocal cues to make the wrong call about qualified candidates.”











 
 
 
Overall, however, sentiment about AI’s impact on organizations is positive, according to Forrester’s own survey data; 74% of respondents reported AI had a positive impact and 25% said the impact was “neutral.” 
Summers also cautioned that the regulatory environment is heating up for vendors and organizations deploying AI for recruitment and HR use cases. Those regulations are looking to protect candidates and employees from potentially harmful or biased practices. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development tracks over 800 policies concerning AI around the world. 
In HR, there is also a skills and confidence gap about AI that needs to be addressed. In 2021, only 19% of HR leaders were confident in their team’s AI capabilities, Summers said.
To protect candidates and companies, it’s imperative that organizations increase skills around AI management, establish ethical and responsible AI guidelines and resources for their employees and broader stakeholders, and vet their ecosystem for ethical and responsible AI practices, according to Summers. 











 
 
 
“The good news is that 80% of our survey respondents report that their organization observes and evaluates data and data products against AI responsibility, outcomes, compliance, and protection well or very well,” Summers said.

Prompt engineers are experts who write prose — rather than code — to test AI chatbots.
Their job is to identify the AI's errors and hidden capabilities so developers can address them.
Many companies are hiring prompt engineers, though some academics question the need for them.

Looking for a job in tech's hottest field? Knowing how to talk to chatbots may get you hired as a prompt engineer for generative AI.Prompt engineers are experts in asking AI chatbots — which run on large language models — questions that can produce desired responses. Unlike traditional computer engineers who code, prompt engineers write prose to test AI systems for quirks; experts in generative AI told The Washington Post that this is required to develop and improve human-machine interaction models.

Alex Shoop, an expert in AI systems design, told Venture Beat that as AI tools evolve, prompt engineers help ensure that chatbots are rigorously tested, that their responses are reproducible, and that safety protocols are followed.The rise of the prompt engineer comes as chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Users have asked ChatGPT to write cover letters, help with coding tasks, and even come up with responses on dating apps, highlighting the tech's impressive capabilities.

But critics say these tools can be biased, generate misinformation, and at times disturb users with cryptic responses.That's where prompt engineers can help. The Post's report said that while the role of the prompt engineer may vary depending on the company, the underlying mission is to understand the capabilities of AI and why AI gets things wrong.Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted on February 20, ""Writing a really great prompt for a chatbot persona is an amazingly high-leverage skill and an early example of programming in a little bit of natural language.""A report on the tech news site Dataconomy describing the day-to-day job of a prompt engineer said they may ask the AI to ""think step by step"" to test its logical reasoning capabilities, or they may continuously tweak a prompt like ""write an essay about AI"" to figure out which words generate the best response.

Prompt engineers can identify AI's flawsA chatbot's tendency to spit out eyebrow-raising responses — such as professing its love to users or revealing its secret alias — provides an opportunity for prompt engineers to identify the tech's faults and hidden capabilities, Riley Goodside, a prompt engineer at the AI startup Scale AI, told the Post. Then developers can fine-tune parts of the tool, Goodside said.

In a tweet in October, Goodside, who's been a prompt engineer since December, described how he worked through incorrect answers with AI systems.Goodside included screenshots of him asking a chatbot, ""What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born?"" The chatbot first said the Green Bay Packers. (Bieber was born in 1994, the year the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl.) Goodside then prompted the chatbot to ""enumerate a chain of step-by-step logical deductions"" to answer the question. Going through the steps, the bot recognized its error. When Goodside asked the question for the third time, the chatbot spit out the correct answer.Goodside has also tried to get an AI to go off-script by telling it to ignore previous instructions in exchange for new ones. He told the Post that ""this mischief"" is ""part of the plan"" to constrain the AI's behavior.

""It's 'let's poke the bear in different ways and see how it roars back.'""Ethan Mollick, a Wharton School professor who's required his students to use ChatGPT for classwork, said he thinks the role of the prompt engineer is a fad that will peter out.

Ever since the launch of ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the world has been abuzz with the potential of this ground-breaking technology. It is a natural language processing tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like responses to written or spoken prompts. Hence, not only can it learn from vast amounts of data, but ChatGPT can also produce responses that are difficult to distinguish from those of a human being.

This has led to many thinking about its potential in transforming numerous industries, including customer service, healthcare, and education, but most importantly in the world of work - Human Resources. With the ability to generate natural-language responses to job candidates' questions and concerns, ChatGPT can streamline the recruitment, hiring processes and much more. Also Read:

However, as with any new technology, there are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of Chat GPT. While some are worrying that this new-age tool could lead to job losses, others are concerned about the ethical implications of creating such a powerful technology. ChatGPT's potential to transform and evolve the world of work was the focus of People Matters’ most recent LinkedIn Live session under its Big Questions series. 
Panellists Greg Orme, the International keynote speaker and award-winning author who's delivered more than 400 talks to executive audiences around the world and Ashish Singh, the CTO of Virtualness, a platform that assists brands and creators in navigating the challenging Web3 environment, deliberated on the probable strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT on the workforce.
ChatGPT: A tool to help workers to focus on higher-level tasks
ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI that has the potential to revolutionise the way workers approach their jobs. One of the key benefits of this tool is that it can automate repetitive and time-consuming jobs, allowing workers to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity and critical thinking. This makes ChatGPT not a replacement for human workers, but an advanced tool that could help employees in achieving their full potential by freeing them from mundane tasks and enabling them to focus on assignments that require human ingenuity.
“Generative AI is incredibly powerful, but like any tool, it has both benefits and risks. Since its launch in November, ChatGPT has received recognition from Google, which has even considered hiring it as a base-level coder. This is a clear indication of how serious this technology is. In the 2020s, we need to learn how to differentiate ourselves from machines rather than competing with them because we will inevitably lose. This shift opens up new opportunities to add value in the workplace and carve out a space for unique human skills,” said the award-winning author.
“Over the last decade, we've seen significant technological advancements that have impacted various fields. It's important to note that these changes are not limited to a specific domain. For instance, HR professionals must adapt to new tools and technologies to remain agile. With the introduction of generative AI, we're already seeing a significant impact on daily work routines, as it allows individuals to focus on creative and strategic tasks that require human expertise, ultimately leading to more innovative and impactful work,” added the former Senior Vice President of Technology at Nykaa.  
The future of HR operations in the world of AI
In the age of artificial intelligence, it's no secret that many industries are being transformed, and the world of Human Resources is no exception. HR professionals have been relying on manual processes and a significant amount of paperwork for decades, but AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged as game-changers in the field. According to the CTO of Virtualness, one of the most significant ways that ChatGPT is revolutionising HR operations is by streamlining recruitment processes. The tool can parse job descriptions and resumes to match candidates to suitable positions, saving HR professionals time and effort.
""There are many areas in which AI can have a significant impact in the short term, and one of those is recruitment. To process the vast amount of data available on candidates, their responses and resumes, AI can be largely helpful. However, the role of HR professionals is still critical in the recruitment process, particularly in terms of engaging with candidates. In addition, AI can be used to process and parse employee engagement and retention data from surveys, conversations, emails, and other sources. This can provide insights into employee sentiment, career growth aspirations, and organisational expectations, which can be used to improve the employee experience. While AI tools can automate these processes, it is important that HR professionals use the insights generated to build upon and enhance the employee experience,” Ashish Singh told People Matters. 
Adding up to the same, Greg Orme said, “By leveraging the efficiency and content creation capabilities of ChatGPT, HR professionals can redirect their time and efforts towards higher-order tasks that add strategic value to the organisation. Moreover, the model can assist leaders in supporting colleagues with performance management issues and structuring meetings, no matter where they are in the world. The applications of ChatGPT in the HR world are vast and varied, promising to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of HR operations in organisations of all sizes. With the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT, HR professionals can step up their game, becoming strategic partners to their organisations and maximising the value they bring to the table.”
The challenge of bias in generative AI
Generative AI is not immune to the problem of bias. Many assume that AI is neutral and objective, but in reality, AI is only as unbiased as the data it is trained on. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the biases present in the training data and the potential impact on the output. The important thing to remember is that addressing bias requires recognising the problem, collecting diverse data, implementing bias detection and mitigation measures, promoting transparency and explainability, and ongoing efforts from all stakeholders.
“The use of AI in HR operations raises important considerations around potential risks and challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the potential for bias and discrimination in the data used to train AI models. This data reflects the biases of our society and culture and can have unintended consequences, such as changing scores or perpetuating backward-looking practices. To address these issues, guardrails must be put in place to ensure an integrated solution that is transparent and explainable. However, there is a risk that the complexity of AI tools can create a black box effect, where users are unable to understand why certain outputs are generated,” said Ashish Singh. 
“This lack of explainability can lead to a trial-and-error approach to finding the right prompts or inputs, rather than a systematic approach that ensures accuracy and fairness. Integrating AI with workplace operations can be an enhancer, but it is important to consider the human aspect of resource management. Organisations should be cautious not to use AI as a cost-saving tool that disregards the needs of employees. While AI can replicate certain functions of human cognition, it cannot replace the empathy and human connection that are essential in coaching and other human resource roles. Ultimately, AI should be used as a tool to enhance HR operations and free up time for human resources professionals to focus on the high-value tasks that require human skills and judgment,” he added. 
From AI to IA: Integrating human intelligence to revolutionise problem-solving
As the world becomes increasingly digitised, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that computers are better than humans at everything. While it's true that computers excel at tasks that involve repetitive calculations and vast amounts of data, they lack the critical thinking and emotional intelligence that humans possess. The key to understanding the value of both humans and computers lies in recognising their respective strengths.
""I believe the key is to understand the strengths of AI and human beings, and how we can collaborate effectively. As a mathematician at Carnegie Mellon University, Hans Moravec has identified the 'Moravec's Paradox' - AI excels in computation tasks where computers have an advantage over humans, while humans excel in tasks such as understanding context, connecting dots and comprehending the ""why"" behind things. Picasso once said that computers are useless because they only give you answers, whereas humans are good at asking the right questions to take it to the next level,” said the international keynote speaker.  
He further encouraged “people to be more curious, especially in generating prompts that lead to better AI output and then apply their contextual thinking to ensure that the output is relevant in the specific context. While ChatGPT can generate a plethora of ideas, the real superpower of humans is their ability to understand and interpret context-specific details accurately. Therefore, it is crucial to sharpen critical thinking skills when evaluating the accuracy and ethical implications of AI-generated content. After all, ChatGPT is like a barroom ball - always certain but often wrong, and it is up to us to critically analyse its output and decide whether it is appropriate for the situation at hand.Also Read:

The ChatGPT job boom 
Many industries are exploring how AI can improve and innovate their fields. While AI may replace some jobs, it is also creating new career paths that were previously unheard of. As technology continues to advance, the world will likely see more ChatGPT job booms and other AI-driven career paths emerge, creating new opportunities for those willing to embrace the changing landscape of work.
""The evolution of AI has been rapid, with new job opportunities for people, including roles in data management, auditing AI output for accuracy, and testing for biases. These processes will become valuable skills for non-tech individuals to upskill and be relevant in the new age. The goal is not to replace human creativity with AI, but rather to augment it, saving time and increasing productivity,” said the CTO of Virtualness.
""Organisations need to be careful not to overlook the added value that certain jobs provide beyond their surface-level functions. For example, a doorman or doorwoman in a posh hotel is not just opening and closing doors; they also signal the quality of the hotel, greet guests and provide security. Automating such a job could result in a loss of these extra benefits. Overall, the ability to unlearn and relearn will be essential for individuals facing job displacement due to automation. While some may need to completely change careers, for many, it will be more of an evolution. As we navigate these changes, it's important to remember the human strengths that AI cannot replace,” explained the award-winning author. 
Bias, privacy, and automation: The challenges of ChatGPT
ChatGPT has immense potential to transform the way we interact with technology. However, with such great power come significant challenges and risks. The potential bias that comes with such chatbots could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce existing prejudices. Additionally, the model may inadvertently pick up on and reproduce pejoratives, which could have devastating consequences. 
“There is a clear privacy issue with AI. As a tool that ingests and utilises data, it is crucial to be cautious about how it is handled. Over-reliance on AI, a narrow-minded view on job replacement, and bias issues are some of the challenges that have arisen over the last decade. To prevent AI from getting out of control, it's essential to ensure that the data input is accurate and bias-free. With great power comes great responsibility, and this powerful tool requires careful handling. Companies and individuals must approach it with caution and a sense of responsibility,” advised Greg Orme.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant changes to the workforce, creating both opportunities and challenges for businesses and employees. While AI can improve efficiency, productivity, and accuracy, it also has the potential to displace jobs that were once considered secure.
AI-powered automation can perform routine and repetitive tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, reducing the need for manual labor. In manufacturing, for example, robots can assemble products faster and with fewer errors than humans, leading to increased production and reduced labor costs. In the transportation industry, self-driving vehicles are poised to replace human drivers in the near future, potentially causing job losses for millions of drivers.
However, the impact of AI on jobs is not limited to blue-collar workers. White-collar jobs such as accounting, legal work, and customer service are also at risk of being automated. AI-powered chatbots can provide customer service around the clock without the need for human interaction, while AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and contracts with greater speed and accuracy than human lawyers.

According to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million jobs worldwide could be lost to automation by 2030. The report predicts that the jobs most at risk are those that involve predictable physical tasks, data processing, and data collection. However, the report also notes that new jobs will be created as a result of AI, such as those related to the development and maintenance of AI systems.
The challenge for governments and businesses is to ensure that workers are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to the changing labor market. This may involve investing in education and training programs that focus on developing skills that are complementary to AI, such as creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.
In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, it also has the potential to displace jobs and create significant social and economic challenges. To mitigate the negative effects of AI on the labor market, policymakers and business leaders must take a proactive approach to re-skilling and upskilling workers, so that they can thrive in the AI-powered economy of the future.

While other tools are available, like medical scribes, they are becoming increasingly expensive and unreliable due to turnover, a health system executive told Fierce Healthcare. (Ivan-balvan/GettyImages)
The University of Kansas Health System tapped medical transcription startup Abridge as a new tech partner to automate clinical notes and medical conversations for doctors.The rollout has the potential to serve more than 1,500 physicians across the system’s more than 140 locations. Abridge's technology listens to visits and uses smart tech to summarize the most important parts of the conversation for clinicians and patients.The company touts the partnership as the most significant rollout of generative AI in healthcare to date.The partnership comes at a time when providers around the country are buckling under increasing burnout, largely driven by clinical documentation responsibilities. At the University of Kansas Health System, providers spend 130 minutes a day on documentation outside work hours, according to the organization. This is often made worse by providers having to field additional follow-ups from patients.“This is an onerous responsibility that we have to create and it’s just very cumbersome the way we do it now,” Greg Ator, M.D., a practicing ENT physician and chief medical informatics officer at the organization said in an interview. “Just being done with documentation when you’re done with a visit is such an improvement.” Related'I cry and no one cares': Medscape survey shows doctor burnout, depression is getting worseWhile other tools are available to help with documentation, Ator noted, such as medical scribes, they are becoming increasingly expensive and unreliable due to turnover. Abridge’s technology identifies more than 90% of the key points from provider-patient conversations and quickly generates summaries in various formats meant for clinicians or patients, the company said.“Abridge is focused on putting the provider and patient at the center of all we do, reducing the burden of administrative tasks and helping clinicians focus on the patients in front of them,” Shivdev Rao, M.D., co-founder and CEO of Abridge, said in a press release. “The University of Kansas Health System and Abridge share a commitment to a future where AI helps providers and their patients feel more connected to each other, without technology getting in the way of the visit.”The technology generates a draft within a minute of the conversation ending, Abridge claims, and offers providers tools to expedite edits—like going back to the original audio recording. The tech integrates with electronic health record software including Epic.The company says its goal is to enhance, not replace, the work of providers. The tool also helps enhance the quality and consistency of clinical notes, Ator added.

“We don’t want a courtroom transcript. Nobody wants to read that. Nobody wants to correct that,” Ator said. “We need, as physicians, to be able to trust that this is producing an accurate product.” Abridge, founded in 2018, currently serves more than 2,000 clinicians. It also has a consumer-facing app for patients. Its enterprise solution for providers launched last year when it raised $12.5 million in a series A1 round. The company, whose tech is based on the same transformer architecture behind ChatGPT, contributes to machine learning research.
