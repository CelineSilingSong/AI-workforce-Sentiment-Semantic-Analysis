According to UPS’ Chief Technology Officer Juan Perez, “Our business drives technology at UPS.” Here are just a few of the ways UPS uses big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to prepare for the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Technology catapults UPS operations
UPS was founded in 1907 and has a history of embracing change and evolving as new technologies arise. It’s the use of big data and artificial intelligence that allows the company to operate its global logistics network in more than 220 countries and territories. On an average day, there are typically 96,000 UPS vehicles on the road handling 19 million packages. UPS invests $1 billion annually in technology to enhance efficiency, improve customer service and support the ever increasing consumer demand to have as close to immediate delivery of packages as humanly possible.
UPS Bot
UPS developed its chatbot, UPS Bot, in house and released it for use just three months after the idea was born. This AI-enabled tool mimics human conversation and can respond to customer queries such as “Where is the nearest UPS location?” and can track packages and give out shipping rates. Customers can ask the bot questions either through text or voice commands through mobile devices, social media channels and virtual assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant. The UPS Bot is able to recognize these requests and then takes the appropriate steps to complete them. The more “conversations” the bot has, the more learning it experiences to take the appropriate action in the future.
PROMOTED
UPS My Choice
During its peak period, UPS provided more than 137 million UPS My Choice alerts—the free system that lets residential customers decide “how, where and when home deliveries occur.” The chatbot is integrated with the UPS My Choice system, so customers are able to obtain information about their incoming packages and deliveries without providing a tracking number.

ORION, optimizing delivery routes
Another proprietary tool UPS uses to manage its fleet system is ORION (On-road Integrated Optimization and Navigation). Its advanced algorithms create optimal routes for delivery drivers from the data supplied by customers, drivers and the vehicles and can alter the routes on the fly based on changing weather conditions or accidents. Ultimately, it will look at the deliveries that still need to be completed and continue to optimize the routes. The cost and time savings and emission reduction based on this optimization alone is extraordinary—UPS expects to reduce delivery miles by 100 million.
EDGE, optimizing internal operations
What ORION is doing for delivery routes, Enhanced Dynamic Global Execution (EDGE) is doing for UPS internal operations. Technology that’s informed by real-time data helps employees make decisions, reduce costs (expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars in savings once fully deployed in 2020), optimize operations and make the UPS logistics network smarter.

Network Planning Tools
The goal of Network Planning Tools (NPT) is to optimize the flow of packages in the UPS network from loading docks to sorting to the final destination (around 60 million packages in U.S. alone). Fueled by real-time data, artificial intelligence and analytics, NPT helps UPS employees make decisions and improve efficiencies. NPT is expected to be fully deployed by 2020, and the company hopes to realize $100-200 million in savings and cost avoidance with the intel this system will provide.
Autonomous deliveries and drones
UPS execs insist that the UPS driver is a core element to its success and the face of the company, but they have tested the use of drone deliveries for some applications including dropping essential supplies in Rwanda and demonstrating how medicine could be delivered to islands. In rural areas, where drones have open air to execute deliveries and the distance between stops makes it challenging for the drivers to be efficient, drones launched from the roofs of UPS trucks offer a solid solution to cut costs and improve service. Drones could also be deployed in UPS sorting facilities and warehouses to get items on high shelves or in remote areas.
The technology used by UPS generates a cache of data that opens up even more opportunities to become more efficient, improve the customer experience, innovate delivery solutions, and more. From optimizing the UPS network to driving operational improvements, big data and artificial intelligence are at the core of UPS’s business performance.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to change the job market as we know it. But should it be viewed as a threat to workers or an opportunity to seize on? France Stratégie looks at how it will impact the French workforce and what actions can be taken to ensure all workers benefit from it.The field of AI traces its roots to a 1956 summer workshop held at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence brought together a small group of mathematicians and scientists over a two-month period to study how machines can simulate human intelligence.
While the field is relatively new, the idea of mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving has captured the imagination of people in all corners of the globe for millennia.
But underlying this quest to create “thinking machines” has run a longstanding fear of being outdone by them – and today is no different.
This is particularly true when it comes to the workplace. As AI has made progress in leaps and bounds in recent years, there is growing concern about the impact it will have on the working population.
With the aim of informing the debate surrounding AI and work, Muriel Pénicaud, the French minister of labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, the secretary of state for digital affairs, asked France Stratégie to look at its impact on work in France.
Adapting to automata
For the moment, AI has only a limited presence in the workplace. But this is set to change, with the development of techniques such as deep learning, where machines can learn from data representations as opposed to relying on algorithms for specific tasks. This technology can be used for things such as recognizing images or carrying out quality translations of basic texts and is already in use in smartphones.
Low-skilled jobs that require manual and repetitive tasks and can be automated relatively easily by robots are certainly at risk of falling victim to AI. There is a fear this could exacerbate inequality by reinforcing a two-tier society of on the one hand an elite high-skilled group, relatively unscathed by AI, and on the other a low-skilled group at risk of seeing their jobs automated and with limited prospects of improving their skills.
But the report shows this is only part of the picture. The technology has progressed to a point where it is impacting all jobs, skilled and unskilled alike. A recent example of this is a US company that has developed algorithms that detect and classify lung nodules more efficiently than radiologists.
The report’s authors, economists Salima Benhamou and Lionel Janin, stress this transformation is not much different from that which took place with the advent of the internet and the digital revolution. Three sectors the report looks at in detail – retail banking, transport and healthcare – have all adapted to digitisation by changing job descriptions, training workers and developing new businesses.
It points to the German automobile industry, one of the most robotised in the world, as an example of honing worker skills to successfully adapt to automation: in 2016, it employed more than 800 000 workers, 100 000 more than two decades ago.
A matter of time
Even if workers adapting takes some time, for the moment the relative cost and productivity of robots has not yet reached a point where it is evident companies should turn to artificially intelligent machines. Regulatory measures also play a major role in this process. But at a certain point, this will inevitably change as robots become cheaper over the coming decades.
Benhamou and Janin highlight that what is new is that AI has reached a tipping point of sorts: machines can now draw on massive amounts of combed data to learn continuously. This virtuous circle will, at some point down the road, lead to a veritable technological breakthrough.
Self-driving vehicles are exemplary of this trend. Sooner or later, professional drivers will start being made redundant by AI. Examples they detail in banking and healthcare include chatbots that advise bank clients and robotised medical assistants that monitor patient health and well-being, pre-diagnosing and proposing therapeutic care.
But new opportunities are certain to spring up. Whether it’s maintaining and managing fleets and accompanying passengers in transport, for example, new jobs will be created. This has always been the case when the labour market undergoes a profound mutation.
The report lays out three ways France can rise to the challenges that AI poses for the 21st century workplace: carry out research on AI’s potential to provide employees, employers and other stakeholders with the information necessary to anticipate changes; train workers in AI, raising awareness of related technical, legal, economic and ethical issues; and reinforce job security for the sectors at risk of being particularly affected by AI.
Though the impact of AI is likely to spare none in the workforce – be they unqualified or highly qualified – it will almost certainly place a premium on social skills and human creativity, a trend already underway in advanced knowledge-based economies. And it will inevitably lead to productivity gains, which if shared can benefit all workers.
Ultimately, a thinking machine’s value lies in the knowledge we humans provide it with and how we interact with it, not in the machine itself. As long as workers remain agile and trained, AI has the potential to be a boon for the job market. But governments, business and academia must all work to prepare the current and future workforce for the massive changes in store.

Imperial academics will look ahead to 2038 to see how technological breakthroughs could change the very fundamentals of how we engage with the world.
At this year’s Tech Foresight conference researchers will be discussing how we can adapt to the shifting realities brought on by new technologies and discover how others are responding to radical technological change.
More than 150 scientists, engineers and executives from industry will come together to talk about technologies that are likely to hit home in the next 20 years.
Professor David Gann, Imperial’s Vice-President (Innovation), said: “Everyone has a particular view of the future and it’s extremely difficult to decommission that mental map. By bringing people together we can challenge each other’s mental maps, and that helps shake up people’s thinking, guided by some expertise about where the current science is.”
Imperial’s Tech Foresight team has also produced the Table of Disruptive Technologies. Modelled on the periodic table, this sets out 100 technologies capable of producing significant social, economic or political upheaval, from low-cost space travel, invisibility shields and smart nappies to a digital footprint eraser and male pregnancy.
Talks will include:
Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, Lecturer in Precision and Systems Medicine, and Dr Weston Baxter, a lecturer at the Dyson School of Engineering, will be looking at what our dinner plates could look like in 2038 as food becomes smarter, more precise and more adapted to our bodies. 
To address the persistent problem of the difference between what people say they eat and what they really eat, Dr Garcia-Perez is developing a system that can tell what someone has been eating based on chemicals in their urine.
Some of these markers relate to metabolism, some to microbial interactions in the gut, and others indicate specific foods or food groups in the diet. Dr Garcia-Perez said: “I want to empower clinicians, dieticians and policy makers by giving them the objective information they need to access the full potential of precision medicine.”
Dr Mark Kennedy, Associate Professor in the Imperial College Business School, will be looking at just how disruptive technologies can be. He has been working on a model to help organisations assess the impact of artificial intelligence on their workforce.
Using company data such as job descriptions, Dr Kennedy and his team link the tasks involved with existing jobs to tools based on different forms of artificial intelligence. “Rather than predicting jobs that will be lost to robots, we take a tools-for-tasks approach to anticipating workforce changes,” he explains.
Professor Mark Girolami, chair in statistics and Director of the Alan Turing Institute, will be exploring the current hype around data and discussing how we might unlock the power of data through the use of computational statistics.

The latter might be a tall order. But AI, it appears, just took one small step for robotkind.New research published June 14 in Science reports that for the first time scientists have developed a machine-learning system that can observe a particular scene from multiple angles and predict what it will look like from a new, never-before-observed angle. With further development the technology could lead to more autonomous robots in industrial and manufacturing settings.Much in the way we can scan a friend’s apartment from one side of the living room and have a pretty good sense of what it looks like from the other, the new technology can do just that for a scene within a three-dimensional computer image.Devised by researchers at artificial intelligence company DeepMind—acquired by Google in 2014—the new system can “learn” the three-dimensional layout of a space without any human supervision. This Generative Query Network, or GQN—as its developers call it, is first trained by observing simple computer-generated scenes containing different lighting and object arrangements. It can then be exposed to multiple images of a new environment and accurately predict what it looks like from any angle within it. Unlike the hyperconnected perceptual regions of the human brain, the system learns and processes properties like shape, size and color separately and then assimilates the data into a cohesive “view” of a space. “Humans and other animals have a rich understanding of the visual world in terms of objects, geometry, lighting, etcetera,” says Ali Eslami, lead author on the new paper and a research scientist at DeepMind. “This capability is developed through a combination of innate knowledge and unsupervised learning. Our motivation behind this research is to understand how we can build computer systems that learn to interpret the visual world in a similar manner.”Machine learning as a field has barreled forward in recent years. And GQN technology builds on many past systems, including the numerous “deep-learning” models based on neural networks inspired by the human brain. Deep learning is a form of machine learning in which a computer “learns” from exposure to an image or other data to, say, detect the various features that make an object a cat or a spoon. It does so after observing many images of scenes labeled to identify these objects. GQN utilizes deep learning to build a form of computerized “vision” that enables navigation through complex scenes. What’s unique about it compared with many other systems is its ability to learn on its own purely from observation and without human supervision. It analyzes unlabeled objects and the space in which they fit in a scene and then apply its learnings to another image. “This gives GQN increased flexibility and frees us from having to create a large collection of models for every object in the world,” Eslami says. In other words it can recognize a novel object based on prior exposure to a different object using characteristics like shape and color.For now the new system has only been designed to work with computer-generated scenes, not to control a robot’s actions in the real world. But Eslami and his colleagues plan to continue developing the GQN with more complex geometry and situations, hoping that one day the fully autonomous robotic understanding of a scene could lend itself to any number of industrial applications. Robots could theoretically be trained on one task and redeployed on another without extensive reprogramming. GQN could bring down manufacturing costs, increase production speed and streamline assembly of just about anything cobbled together by robots. “This work is interesting and exciting,” says Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of cognitive science and computation, Joshua Tenenbaum, who also says the technology has a way to go before it sees any practical uses. “In my view, this research is still rather far from direct applications,” he notes. “From a strictly practical engineering point of view, the problems it solves can currently be solved as well or better by other means, which are less dependent on pure learning-based methods.”Tenenbaum, who was not involved with the project, adds, “In the long term this work could help advance the state of robotic perception and control, leading to systems that are more adaptive and autonomous than today's AI technologies.”As AI advances to the point where machines take on qualities previously exclusive to humans, there are of course dystopian concerns: namely that we will cultivate our own demise at the hands of a smarter, more powerful population of cyber beings, whatever form they may take. And as German philosopher Thomas Metzinger has cautioned for years, creating certain mental states in machines could result in those machines experiencing pain and suffering.Tenenbaum is not worried. “Any fear of developing computers that are ‘smarter’ than us, in the practically accessible future, are unfounded,” he says. “The system presented here is a noteworthy advance over previous inverse-graphics systems, but it is far from capturing the perception abilities that even young children possess. It also requires vast quantities of training data, which children do not, suggesting that its learning abilities are not nearly as powerful as those of human beings.”Computer science founding father Alan Turing once said a computer could only be called intelligent if it could deceive a person into believing it was human. Any true success on Turing’s test would require a machine that exhibits general intelligence—one that can do calculus, tie shoes and cook supper, all the things that humans do—a goal that is still nothing more than a futurist fantasy for now.Rights & PermissionsBret Stetka was a writer based in New York City and editorial director of Medscape Neurology (a subsidiary of WebMD).

A new voice was created for him by Scottish technology company CereProc.CereProc trained a neural network to predict how Mr Dupree would talk, using samples from his old voice recordings.""This has saved my job and saved my family from a terrible financial unknown,"" Mr Dupree told the BBC. ""There is not much of a market for radio reporters who can't talk.""AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTTypically, in order to create a voice for someone, the individual needs to read out a script for 30 hours in order to gather enough data.Then artificial intelligence is applied to either chop up words from the audio file and stick them back together on demand, or the technology is used to predict and imitate the person's speech patterns.Both of these methods can cost tens of thousands of pounds, and take a month to produce just one voice.Neural networks To speed up the process and make it more affordable, CereProc started developing its own neural networks in 2006.Today, its artificial intelligence system can generate a voice in just a few days for £500, once a user has recorded themselves reading the script on its website. CereProcUsers record themselves reading out a sequence of sentences, which can be then turned into a voiceThe neural networks, which contain between six to 10 layers each, work by slicing audio recordings of words down to phonetics.The artificial intelligence system slices each word read out by an individual into 100 tiny pieces, and does this with lots of common words until eventually it understands how basic phonetics work in that person's voice and has an ordered sequence for all the pieces in each word.Then, the neural network can create its own sounds and predict what the person would sound like if they were to say a series of words in conversation.Many computer scientists around the world are trying to replicate the human brain by training neural networks to perform image recognition, but CereProc says that it is much easier to apply artificial intelligence to sound.""AI techniques work quite well on small constrained problems, and learning to model speech is something deep neural nets can do really well,"" Chris Pidcock, CereProc's chief technical officer and co-founder, told the BBC.""It's a much more solvable problem than machine intelligence.""Silenced by illnessMr Dupree has been covering political news from Congress in Washington DC for the past 35 years. And as a journalist producing content for six radio stations, his voice is essential to his work. He began losing his voice in 2016, but there was nothing wrong with his vocal cords, throat or larynx. After baffling doctors from several large US university hospitals, eventually Mr Dupree was diagnosed with tongue protrusion dystonia - a rare neurological condition where the tongue pushes forward out of his mouth and his throat tightens whenever he wants to speak, making it impossible for him to say more than two or three words at a time.Rather than give up his work, Mr Dupree continued to do interviews with policymakers in Congress using an eWriter tablet to scribble questions during one-to-one interviews, or by recording the answers given to groups of journalists in the Senate building's hallways between hearings.Jamie DupreeJamie Dupree at work in a radio studioAlthough he was still writing and producing stories, he had essentially gone off the air completely, because he could not present the stories he had written.Then, in December, a member of the US Congress spoke out on his behalf on the floor of the House of Representatives.The resulting media attention spurred his employer to try to find a way for Mr Dupree to return to the air, since it had almost 30 years' worth of his radio broadcasts on file. A new voice Thanks to the computer-generated voice produced by CereProc, from Monday, 25 June, onwards Mr Dupree will once again be heard by WSB Atlanta listeners, as well as audiences of Cox Media-owned stations in Orlando, Jacksonville, Dayton and Tulsa. With his new voice, Mr Dupree can now write a script and then use a free text-to-speech software program called Balabolka on his laptop to turn it into an audio recording. If a word or turn of phrase doesn't sound quite right in the recording, he can slow certain consonants or vowels down, or swap a word to one that does work, or change the pitch, and he can have a full radio story ready to go live in just seven minutes. ""It is me, there is no doubt about that,"" said Mr Dupree.""Yes, it is slightly robotic, but no-one was promising me that it was going to be perfect.""In person, when talking to family and colleagues, Mr Dupree still has to rely on the eWriter tablet, or saying a couple of words slowly, but the new voice has made a big difference to his life.""This is awesome,"" he said. ""Writing for my blog, sending out tweets and doing Facebook is great - but there is nothing like cranking out a 20-second story jammed with a couple of sound bites to make the top of the hour newscast.""JFK's lost speech brought to life'Siri, will talking ever top typing?'",ReportageNewsArticle,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44481510,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10C40/production/_102027686_lost-voice2.jpg'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Mary-Ann Russon'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",AI gives silenced radio journalist his voice back,2018-06-14T23:09:31.000Z,2018-06-14T23:09:31.000Z,,,,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44481510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10C40/production/_102027686_lost-voice2.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The robot’s inventor is a native of the town and hopes that with more people shopping online, such robots will take off, reducing traffic and pollution.Credit...Natalie Behring/Getty ImagesLots of smart technologists and futurists are convinced that we are on the cusp of a world in which artificial intelligence, robotics and other technologies will make a large portion of today’s jobs obsolete.They might be wrong, of course, but the consequences if they’re right would be huge — potentially a defining challenge of the decades ahead, and one that would demand political attention.Some of the potential answers are big, bold ideas that have gained traction in particular ideological circles. A universal basic income — the idea that the government simply give each citizen enough money every month to support basic needs — has fans among both free-market libertarians and socialists.But other ideas starting to percolate in economic policy circles may have advantages in terms of cost and political viability.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne interesting entry in this discussion is a paper published Tuesday by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, called “Don’t Fear the Robots.” The economist Mark Paul writes that a series of policy steps that are, in isolation, not all that radical would go a long way toward ensuring that the benefits of technological advancement would be widely enjoyed.As an example, he says the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should commit more energetically to pursuing a “maximum employment” goal set in federal law, even if it means being willing to tolerate a bit more risk of inflation.Mr. Paul argues for overhauling intellectual property law so that the companies that develop valuable patents and trademarks don’t have such a lengthy monopoly on their innovations. Over time this would probably mean that more of the benefits of technology would accrue to labor rather than capital. And he sees promise in work-sharing programs like those that have been used to help keep unemployment low in Germany even during economic downturns. The idea is that if a company needs to cut 20 percent of its work force because of new innovations, it is better for society if it cuts each worker’s hours by 20 percent rather than laying off 20 percent of its staff.Mr. Paul argues that rapid shifts in the skills and technologies demanded by the modern economy strengthen the case for publicly funded higher education and training to help workers adapt.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis set of proposals is based on the idea that the emerging wave of digital disruption won’t result in a permanent loss of demand for workers, but rather shifts in what types of work the economy needs. It’s not unlike early 20th-century America’s shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one, or its shift from an industrial to an information economy over the last half-century.In this context, the goal is not to stymie that evolution, but to try to tilt the balance toward workers as the transition takes place. “We want a growing, robust economy,” Mr. Paul said. “We just need proper policies in place to ensure that workers don’t bear the burden of that transition.”While these ideas are coming from a decidedly left-of-center place, it’s striking how some of them overlap with the goals of centrist business interests and even some conservative thinkers.The McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting giant that has produced extensive analysis suggesting that advances in information technology and robotics will endanger millions of jobs in the coming decade, often emphasizes the role of subsidized education and training.Susan Lund, a partner in the firm, says it is increasingly crucial that people continually upgrade their skills to keep up with changing technology, whether through community colleges, traditional universities or narrowly targeted online training.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Lifelong learning accounts would be interesting,” Ms. Lund said, “and they could be federally funded or they could be funded by employers, but what you want is for people to be able to avail themselves of a two-month leave to take courses so that they can keep up with change.”Ms. Lund and her McKinsey colleagues also recommend new approaches to making job benefits like health insurance and retirement funds more “portable,” so that people who work as independent contractors or who change jobs frequently can have more stability.To the degree that many of these ideas imply a more activist government role, conservatives tend to be more leery. But Michael Strain, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the risks of disruption are high enough that some flexibility may be needed.In particular, we could be headed toward a bifurcated labor market, where people with advanced skills earn higher wages but where workers without those skills see technology drive down demand for their services, depressing their pay.“I tend to think that conservatives should be open to new policies for a new economic reality,” Mr. Strain said. “So if we end up in a world where the market wages for large groups of workers really are well below the wages they would be willing to work for, one way to combat that if you’re serious about the importance of work would be significantly larger earnings subsidies than conservatives have been comfortable with.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBy expanding the earned-income tax credit or creating similar programs, for example, the government could increase the effective pay of jobs that otherwise would pay so little that Americans might choose to sit at home rather than take them.(Mr. Strain says liberals have blind spots on these issues as well: Raising the minimum wage, as many on the left have advocated, could well be counterproductive if technology causes market wages to fall for certain workers, for example.)The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in 18 years, and the bigger challenge for the economy now is that productivity is too low, not that technology is causing productivity to be so high as to drive people out of jobs.So this discussion over potential policy responses to a future that may or may not arrive remains speculative — all the more so in an era of congressional dysfunction.But there’s a recent lesson worth learning from. Globalization and automation caused upheaval in the manufacturing industry from the 1980s through the early 2000s, and millions of factory workers lost their jobs. The disruption to communities is still being felt, and is arguably at the root of a lot of the biggest social and economic problems of this era. If a similar technological wave is about to wash over millions of service workers, we would all do well to try to keep history from repeating itself.Neil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

This is the first article in a weeklong series about artificial intelligence.
We are at the brink of fundamental technological breakthroughs that have been predicted for decades. The most striking innovations—such as autonomous driving, fully automated manufacturing, and home care delivered by robots—combine robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. These technologies are not separable anymore, but integrated. AI, for example, has a role as a standalone technology, but it is more often just a piece of a more complex digital strategy. 
Significant changes in design and implementation will be needed if technology is to realize its full potential. My recent research, in collaboration with Oliver Wyman and Mercer, has identified how to better manage the digital-transformation process. In the past, a sequential approach has dominated: Vendors develop products, sell them to CTOs or CIOs through what are often prolonged negotiations (neither side fully understanding the other), and then managers struggle to integrate the new technology with their workforce to achieve business objectives. 
Now, we propose a new integrated model that links the design of a digital strategy with the design of new workforce practices right from the beginning. We feel this new model gives companies a better shot at successful transformation and improving productivity. 
In the new integrative model, collaborative design—engaging vendors, workers, and managers—merges technical and business knowledge and applies it directly to business operations. Design considerations include how technology can augment human inputs or fully replace it to allow for higher-order human inputs.
Figure 1. Two Models for Digital Transformation

Where Does AI Work?
Consider the use cases in which artificial intelligence can substitute for human decisions. AI serves as a successful substitute in domains with frequent, structured, and specific tasks. Because using AI requires training, it works better in areas where there are a greater number of events or data points. Events with more structure and specificity also provide for an easier learning process.
Figure 2. Where Does AI Work?
Within the realm of insurance, for example, AI is suitable for evaluating health claims in countries with standard codes, because those claims are both frequent and structured. Conversely, AI is less suitable for making decisions on claims for serious bodily injuries, which require more human judgment. In these situations, however, AI might help provide data and information to support human judgment and thereby augment work.
In banking operations, there are a number of repetitive tasks involving data entry and re-entry, particularly for compliance, reconciliation, and accounting purposes. Robotic process automation (RPA), a form of AI, uses software bots for repetitive, rote tasks. The bots function like humans, as virtual users interacting with screens and applications. They primarily perform repetitive, manual, and simple cognitive tasks.
As data volumes increase, it can become prohibitively time-consuming for humans to process it. Thus, RPA is increasingly deployed to free up human capacity from standard tasks and processes and direct it toward more complex and analytical tasks. And, of course, humans can manage the technology to mitigate the risk of error and intervene in the event of an RPA system breakdown.
Cautionary Tales: GM and Tesla

As vendors and internal IT developers recognize the importance of using collaborative design to create complementary technologies, they will produce more targeted, useful solutions. Consider the use of AI as a piece of a more integrated process with machine learning and robotics. Too often, firms have sought to automate their way out of productivity and labor problems. In the 1980s, for example, General Motors spent more than $50 billion on robotics in an effort to catch up with more efficient Japanese producers. At the end of the decade, GM remained the high-cost producer because it failed to upgrade its workforce and change its work practices in ways needed to make the new technologies pay off. Toyota, by contrast, achieved world-class levels of productivity by taking an integrated approach—introducing new technologies gradually, while simultaneously investing in team-based work systems and high levels of workforce training. 
Ironically, in the same plant in Fremont, California, where Toyota achieved high levels of productivity, Tesla is now following a total automation strategy but failing to meet its production goals, falling prey to the same mistake GM made 30-plus years ago. Not surprisingly, workers at the Tesla factory are trying to organize a union in protest of what they see as persistent safety problems, overwork, and low wages. Investors are worried the company’s cash reserves are running low.

Collaborative Technology Design
Conversely, when technology developers and designers proactively consider and engage the workforce as part of a collaborative-design process, the resultant solution is more likely to fit the needs of the business and the specifications of the user.
Cisco, for example, applied the principles of user-led design in a 24-hour “breakathon” intended to break down and rebuild its HR program. Over 800 employees, 65 percent from HR and the rest from services and engineering, took part in the event, with offices around the globe participating in a “follow-the-sun” manner. Taking inspiration from hackathons, employees split up into small teams to identify problems they had experienced while doing their job and pitch ideas for solutions.
The hackathon resulted in several solutions across talent acquisition, onboarding, development, and leadership. One such idea resulted in the creation of YouBelong@Cisco, a mobile app that guides new employees and their managers during their initial weeks of work.
Unilever also applied the technology-integration mindset to its recruiting and onboarding process. Unilever posts targeted job advertisements on social-media sites. Potential applicants who click the job description are brought to a site where they can apply for the job with information sourced from their LinkedIn profile. From there, skill assessment is conducted through a series of online games. Applicants who pass that stage submit prerecorded video interviews through a website or app. At each phase, AI algorithms screen the applicants and narrow down the pool of potential hires who qualify for an in-person interview. Once hired, candidates can sign their offers digitally, access Unilever’s onboarding system, and connect digitally with other recent hires.
From start to finish, Unilever uses digital tools and advanced analytics for recruitment and onboarding. Unilever’s digital approach has streamlined the recruiting process from four months to two weeks and reduced recruiter screening time by 75 percent. Candidates benefit from a quicker process and also less human bias, as AI has proven to be more objective.
The guiding principle is not to throw technology at a problem. That’s highly likely to create even larger, unforeseen problems. The guiding principle should be to look for elegant solutions to problems and ask how technology can help workers achieve the end goal faster and cheaper. It’s a mistake to perceive technology as unmalleable. It is malleable, and, when shaped collaboratively to augment human inputs, it is much more effective—as are the humans who are relieved of tedious, repetitive work.
General-purpose vendors often lack knowledge of industry-specific work processes. This gap in understanding can create resistance and bottlenecks when developing technology solutions. The solution lies in partnerships: between technology vendors and business managers, between humans and machines, and between developers and the frontline workers, who will be the ultimate end users.

Police searching for a long-lost person or fugitive sometimes have little more to go on than an old photograph. Artists or computer programs can attempt to predict what these individuals look like today, but both approaches have flaws. Now, scientists have harnessed advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to render artificial aging that's more realistic (and depressing) than ever. The system uses a two-part AI algorithm called a generative adversarial network (GAN). The first part takes a face and produces another face of the same individual at a target age. During training, a second part compares this image with a real image of someone at that age and with the original image and provides feedback, encouraging the first part to improve its abilities. Other artificial aging systems have used GANs, but this one differs by focusing not just on getting the age right, but also on maintaining the individual's identity. Unlike others, it also renders foreheads and (lack of) hair, as seen in the photos of Justin Timberlake and Kirsten Dunst above. The researchers trained their AI on more than 100,000 images from two databases, including mugshots and celebrities at different ages. A separate computer program then judged how the AI performed on a novel set of images. When the AI aged photos of people more than 20 years, so that people under 30 were meant to look between 50 and 60, for example, the computer program saw them (on average) as a 60-year-old (for mugshots) or a 52-year-old (for celebs). This analysis was not performed on prior work, but human participants deciding whether the new results or images from prior attempts to age people looked most like a younger source image chose the new images 70% to 9%, the researchers report in a paper to be presented this month at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Salt Lake City.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are already prompting calls for teaching to be automated, learner-driven and ‘teacher-proof’. While these technologies might still require non-specialised&amp;nbsp;classroom&amp;nbsp;facilitators and&amp;nbsp;technicians, the&amp;nbsp;role&amp;nbsp;of the highly trained expert teacher is coming under increasing threat.&amp;nbsp;There&#039;s&amp;nbsp;a growing sense that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-deconstruction-of-the-k-12-teacher/388631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we don’t really need teachers in the same way any more&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put bluntly, the entire premise of ‘the teaching profession’ faces an impending challenge. In a future where&amp;nbsp;education&amp;nbsp;can be reliably provided by machines, why&amp;nbsp;continue to&amp;nbsp;invest millions of dollars in&amp;nbsp;training human experts&amp;nbsp;to do the job?&amp;nbsp;Given the likely trajectory of technological developments over the next few decades, is there anything&amp;nbsp;that an expert teacher does&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;machines&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be able to do?&amp;nbsp;As an education researcher and teacher, I&#039;d like to think that there is!&amp;nbsp;Here, then, are&amp;nbsp;six&amp;nbsp;aspects of expert human teaching that are getting overlooked in the current rush toward automating the classroom:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers have learned&amp;nbsp;what they know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is clear benefit from being with someone who can pass on knowledge, especially someone who&#039;s&amp;nbsp;previously&amp;nbsp;been in the&amp;nbsp;position of having to learn&amp;nbsp;that knowledge.&amp;nbsp;This latter qualification is a uniquely human characteristic. When a learner learns with an expert teacher, they&#039;re not simply gaining access to the teachers’ knowledge, but also benefiting from the teachers’ memories of&amp;nbsp;learning it themselves. Technology can be pre-loaded with content of what is to be learned. Yet, no AI technology is going to ‘learn’ something exactly the way a human learns it, and then help another human learn accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make cognitive connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A human is uniquely placed to sense&amp;nbsp;what another human is cognitively&amp;nbsp;experiencing&amp;nbsp;at any moment, and respond accordingly.&amp;nbsp;In this sense, face-to-face&amp;nbsp;contact with a teacher offers learners a valuable opportunity to engage in the process of thinking&amp;nbsp;with another human brain. On one hand, there is something thrilling about witnessing&amp;nbsp;an expert&amp;nbsp;who&#039;s modelling the process of&amp;nbsp;thinking things through. Conversely, a human teacher is also able to make a personal ‘cognitive connection’ with another individual who is attempting to learn.&amp;nbsp;As David Cohen&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674051102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, teachers are uniquely able to “put themselves into learners’ mental shoes”. Despite the best efforts of computer science, many aspects of&amp;nbsp;thinking cannot be detected and modelled by machines in this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-guid=&quot;159fb126-a4c7-4364-9a39-87b26363fe15&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/v1529022213/zbemnz0tb8gyblleqr16.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make social connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teaching is a mutual obligation between teachers and learners. No teacher can stimulate the learning process without the cooperation of those who are learning.&amp;nbsp;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time. Before attempting to intellectually engage with a group,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leseprobe.buch.de/images-adb/65/5b/655b3cd2-0fa7-4600-8948-276ca758c857.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will&amp;nbsp;“take a mental pulse of students’ demeanours”&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers work hard to establish this&amp;nbsp;mutual commitment to learning, as well as sustaining engagement through motivating, cajoling and enthusing individuals. All of these are interpersonal skills that come naturally to people rather than machines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;talk out loud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something transformative about being in the presence of an expert teacher talking about their subject of expertise. Listening to an expert talk can provide a real-time, unfolding connection with knowledge. A good speaker doesn&#039;t stick rigidly to a written text, but refines, augments and alters their argument according to the audience&amp;nbsp;reactions.&amp;nbsp;A teacher speaking to a group&amp;nbsp;of learners therefore engages&amp;nbsp;in a form of spontaneous revelation. Key to this is the teacher’s role in leading and supporting learners to engage in active listening. As&amp;nbsp;Gert&amp;nbsp;Biesta&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00131857.2015.1041442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;, being addressed by another person interrupts&amp;nbsp;one’s&amp;nbsp;ego-centricism&amp;nbsp;– drawing&amp;nbsp;an individual out of themselves&amp;nbsp;and forcing them into sense-making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers perform with their bodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bodies of human teachers are an invaluable resource when engaging learners in abstract thought.&amp;nbsp;Teachers use their bodies to energise, orchestrate and anchor the performance of teaching.&amp;nbsp;Many subtleties of teaching take place through movement – pacing around a room, pointing and gesturing.&amp;nbsp;Teachers make use of their ‘expressive body’&amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;lowering&amp;nbsp;their voice, raising an eyebrow or directing their gaze. Crucially, a human will respond to the&amp;nbsp;living biological&amp;nbsp;body of another human in a completely different&amp;nbsp;way to even the most realistic simulation. Being&amp;nbsp;looked in the eye&amp;nbsp;by another person is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;qualitatively different&amp;nbsp;experience&amp;nbsp;than being&amp;nbsp;looked&amp;nbsp;at by&amp;nbsp;a 3D humanoid robot,&amp;nbsp;let alone a 2D cartoon agent on a screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;improvise and ‘make do’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key part of good teaching is the human capacity to improvise. Rather than sticking tightly to a pre-planned script,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;will adjust what they do according to the circumstances. Like most&amp;nbsp;performative&amp;nbsp;events, teachers approach a session with a rough plan or structure. However, thereafter they improvise their way around these aims and objectives. Teaching requires acts of creativity, innovation and spontaneity – akin&amp;nbsp;to dancing or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may07/vol64/num08/Teaching-as-Jazz.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;playing jazz&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers and learners feel each other out, find common ground and build upon it.&amp;nbsp;Teaching also demands a tolerance for imprecision, messiness and not knowing. Most human actions involve a degree of guesswork, bluff and willingness to ‘make do’.&amp;nbsp;These are processes of which computer systems are largely incapable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As these examples illustrate, an&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves. Many educators consider teaching to be an&amp;nbsp;‘unconscious’ act that is&amp;nbsp;difficult to pin down and articulate. Yet such coyness does little to dispel the technology-driven arguments currently being made&amp;nbsp;against&amp;nbsp;the teaching profession. Teachers need to speak up&amp;nbsp;and make an irrefutable case for the continued presence of expert professionals at the forefront of classrooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how can we&amp;nbsp;rehabilitate&amp;nbsp;human teachers in the minds of their detractors?&amp;nbsp;The uphill battle in countries such as Australia is to revitalise schools and classrooms to allow teachers to work in the ways just outlined. These are all characteristics that a good teacher&amp;nbsp;should&amp;nbsp;have, but are considerably restricted in an era of ‘teaching out-of-field’,&amp;nbsp;templated&amp;nbsp;lesson plans and rigid standardised testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A first step in this direction might be to alter the ways that people think and talk about teaching. Teachers need to&amp;nbsp;speak&amp;nbsp;forcibly&amp;nbsp;about these qualities – among&amp;nbsp;themselves, within their professional associations, with parents, politicians, pundits&amp;nbsp;and anyone else with&amp;nbsp;influence.&amp;nbsp;Teachers also need to&amp;nbsp;argue directly against the tech industry and&amp;nbsp;corporate reformers looking to replace them with machines. There is obvious value in the human expert teacher. Yet unless teachers are able to make a convincing case, they may well lose the argument before they even realise that there was one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on EduResearch Matters.

Elizabeth Holm, a professor of materials science and engineering at the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and a computational materials scientist at Sandia National Laboratories says we're in the midst of an artificial intelligence (AI) culture shift.

She also says that machines won't replace human experts.
""Machines are great at handling things, like large amounts of data, but machines still need an expert, a human, to analyze the data, set parameters and guide decisions,” said Holm.
""Engineering and science decisions are based on understanding how things work. How does a bridge support its load? How does an engine convert fuel into motion? In contrast, AI transforms data into decisions without understanding any underlying principles,"" said Holm. ""Applying AI to engineering and science will require a culture shift: either we will learn to trust decisions that we do not understand, or AIs will evolve to base their decisions on principles that humans can interpret and control.""
PROMOTED
Holm says that currently, society is exploring how to balance those alternatives.
""AI software that drives autonomous vehicles is based on data, not pre-programmed principals of driving,"" said Holm. ""Because we trust the AI to have learned the right things from the data, we give it access to our roads. However, when a pedestrian is struck and killed by a self-driving car, we pull the cars off the roads and ask the AI to explain itself – to formulate its decisions in terms of rules we can control.""

Holm says the AI culture shift is a work in progress, but that there are four primary reasons why machines and humans will continue to work together.
Intelligent machines are great at handling lots of data.
Holm believes that processes like manufacturing that collect a lot of data, like 3D printing, will benefit from the principles of AI like computer vision, which can sort through all that data.

“AI is an important area for additive manufacturing,"" adds Holm. ""It’s different from most manufacturing processes in that it really can collect the data on the fly, so there’s a lot of room for data science.”
Holm points out that AI applications being used at Facebook and Amazon, like facial recognition and targeted advertising, have made all of us aware of the power of integrating vast amounts of social data. 
""3D printing generates copious visual, audio, and instrument data at every individual step of the process. Our goal is to use the same AI concepts to optimize the additive manufacturing process concerning quality and cost,"" said Holm.
Machines augment human capabilities.
""When we use computers to find flaws, it's very much like when we use computers to read radiographs, x-rays, and CAT scans in medical imaging,"" said Holm. ""The idea is that the computer does the first look to find the areas of interest, but we're in no way replacing the expert who looks at that flaw and says, ‘No, it's nothing to worry about,’ or, ‘Oh yeah, that's what happens when the oil gets old, and it’s problematic.’”
Holm says we're already becoming aware of this from the medical imaging we're exposed to.
""These days, for many routine radiological tests like mammograms, the first entity to examine the results is a computer. AI software locates normal and abnormal areas and passes the results to a human radiologist for further examination and recommendations,"" said Holm.
Machines save humans time by performing tedious tasks in much less time.
 
Tedious and repetitive tasks could be a thing of the past.
""The first thing a graduate student wants to do is stop having to outline segmentation drawings, which can take multiple hours and cause a lot of angst; they vow when they graduate, they're never going to do that again, and it's going to be some other graduate student's problem,"" said Holm. ""The computer doesn't have that; the computer might do it forever without getting bored because there’s no boredom in a computer.”
""One example of this is a company [..] that performs quality control by microscopically scanning samples of each batch of its product. The vast majority of each sample is entirely normal and uninteresting, only the rare anomalies are important,"" added Holm. ""So this process makes the human expert spend a lot of time not using his or her expertise and an AI system can patiently scan samples and weed out normal results so that the human expert can focus more time and attention on the relevant and challenging findings.""
Intelligent machines are human-made.
 
“Each step of a convolutional neural network is just signal processing that we learned as undergraduates in engineering school,"" said Holm. ""Of course, there's a feedback loop, a learning loop of how you develop the filters and the architecture of your signal processor. But it's not magic, it's just a set of simple things that all engineers already know.”
""I think it’s important not to attribute special powers to deep learning algorithms – at least no more special power than the human brain,"" added Holm.
Carnegie Mellon University has been a pioneer in AI since the 1950s. Herbert Simon and Alan Newell created the Logic Theorist in 1955 which is considered the first AI program while they were both on the faculty at the University.  Simon went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, and he and Newell won the Turing Award in 1975.
In May 2018, the University’s School of Computer Science (SCS) added an undergraduate degree in AI in Fall 2018, which is considered the first degree of its kind offered by a US University.
Reid Simmons, research professor of robotics and computer science, at CMU SCS says courses like these will have an impact on developing the technology of the future.
""With the proliferation of data in society, it is becoming increasingly necessary to find ways to analyze and make sense of all that data, that is where AI can help,"" said Simmons. ""Whether it's by better understanding the financial markets, by improving the safety and efficiency of transportation, or by making our lives more productive and enjoyable..""
""Students graduating with an AI major will not only understand how to employ AI to improve society, but they will have the skills and insight to help develop the next, more powerful, generation of AI tools,"" added Simmons.Follow me on Twitter. Jennifer Kite-PowellFollowingFollowI'm a writer who looks at innovation and how technology and science intersect with industry, environment, arts, agriculture, mobility, health.

And the way we use them in job adverts can dictate whether or not people bother to apply. This is a big problem if you're a business trying to recruit more women and ethnic minorities into your workforce. So can tech help remove these unconscious biases?A job description that uses the phrase ""We're looking for someone to manage a team"" may seem innocuous enough.But research, based on an analysis of hundreds of millions of job ads, has shown that the word ""manage"" encourages more men than women to apply for the role.Changing the word to ""develop"" would make it more female-friendly, says Kieran Snyder, chief executive of Seattle-based Textio, an ""augmented writing software"" company.Textio uses artificial intelligence to pore over job descriptions in real time, highlighting any terms that could come across as particularly masculine or feminine. The software then suggests alternatives. ""We don't explain why this or that phrase excludes women,"" says Ms Snyder. ""We just provide the data and the company in question can come up with their own theory on why that sentence doesn't work.""TextioTextio's Kieran Snyder (right) with co-founder Jensen HarrisWhen Australian software giant Atlassian used Textio's software for its job-ad copy, the results were striking. It saw an 80% increase in the hiring of women in technical roles globally over a two-year period.""We wanted to create a work culture where diverse ideas get shared,"" says Aubrey Blanche, Atlassian's global head of diversity and belonging. She says Textio taught her company to avoid terms such as ""coding ninja"" - a common phrase in Silicon Valley job ads. ""These words send a message to women that these are hostile work environments for female staffers,"" says Ms Blanche.Getty ImagesJob ads that use the phrase ""coding ninja"" are not female friendly, says Aubrey BlancheAnd the word stakeholder apparently ""serves as a signal to people of colour that their contributions may not be valued"", adds Ms Blanche. ""We don't know why, but this is what the data shows.""Back in 2011, researchers from Canada and the US found that job posts using more masculine wording ""led women to have a lower sense that they would belong in the position or company than the same ads using more feminine wording,"" the report stated. The researchers also found that gender preferences can be conveyed subtly through words such as ""competitive,"" or ""leader"", usually associated with male stereotypes, while words such as ""support"" and ""interpersonal"" are associated with female stereotypes.Building on this kind of research, another recruitment tech company, TalVista, assesses job descriptions and highlights ""discouraging"" terms in red and ""inviting"" terms in green, assigning an overall thumb up or thumb down score to the text.TalVistaTalVista boss Elaine Orler says recruitment is prone to ""unconscious bias""For example, replacing a word such as ""build"" with ""create"" achieves a better overall score, the company says.   ""Diversity and inclusion are always critical for talent acquisition,"" TalVista chief executive Elaine Orler says. ""But when a job post uses words like 'strong' or 'dynamic' many candidates are repelled but they don't know why; it's in their unconscious bias but they can't pinpoint why.""Tech firm Applied also offers gender-balancing advice for job ads and a tool that scores the overall reading age of the ad.""It's remarkable the number of job descriptions that are written with the same density and complexity as a Harvard Law Review article when you definitely don't need a PhD to do the job itself,"" says Applied chief executive and co-founder Kate Glazebrook.APpiedApplied boss Kate Glazebrook wants to rid job ads of dense management speakApplied numbers the UK government, Transport for London, Hilton Hotels and Penguin Random House among clients who've benefited from more inclusionary language in their job ads.Even the format of a job ad can make a difference. Textio's analysis reveals that ads with lengthy bullet points detailing the role's responsibilities will face a drop-off in women applying for the job. All this matters because a more diverse workforce has been shown to foster a wider variety of ideas and improve a company's profitability, recent research has shown.Companies boasting the most ethnically diverse executive teams are 33% more likely to outperform their peers, according to McKinsey & Company. More Technology of BusinessMagnum Photos'It feels like the hand of God thrusting you up the road'Could a text message save thousands of fishermen's lives?'I bought my mum a flat just by renting out my camera kit'Why are so many firms so bad at handling social media?Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?And those with the most gender-diverse boardrooms are 15% more likely to enjoy above-average profitability than companies with a more homogenous make-up, it found.One report by US economists found that moving from an all-male or all-female office to one split evenly along gender lines could boost revenue by roughly 41%.Dr Wendy Hirsh, principal associate at the Institute for Employment Studies in Sussex, remarks: ""There is a growing awareness in the UK to be inclusive. Employers realise, with the rise of a skill shortage here, that if you skew a job ad to only one group of applicants, you could be missing out on some very talented workers.""Data analytics and machine learning have certainly enabled far greater scrutiny of the language we use in recruitment, with decisions based on hard evidence rather than hunches.But as helpful as these writing services may be, some human resources (HR) experts caution against their overuse.Heather BussingWilliam Tincup worries that an over-reliance on software analysis could make job ads boringWilliam Tincup, an HR tech consultant and president of recruitment news outlet RecruitingDaily.com, says editing these job ads so thoroughly ""could water them down and make them so vanilla no one feels emotionally attached to them.""You don't want applicants to get bored by the text.""Dr Hirsh points out that where a job post is listed can also make a big difference to who applies. For example, if the post is announced on social media, those who aren't on those networks, most likely older candidates, may not even see it, she says.

How an Artificial Intelligence enabled workspace to be like? 
June 15, 2018 by H2S Media Team 





Article to be attributed to Akshita Gupta, Co-Founder, ABL Workspaces
Co-Working Space is emerging as the core of Indian Startup’s economy where new ideas and innovation are taking concrete shape. Role of modern technology in shaping the office space ecosystem has been established beyond any doubt whether it is about simply taking the print command or analyzing humongous data for a Law firm with the help of Big Data Analysis or sorting and managing files for a chartered accountant firm.

Now the emergence of Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize the office space especially the co-working spaces where the most ignited and most tech-savvy brain works. Let’s imagine a Co-Working Space with the artificial intelligence facility where Saina (Imaginary Name) works for her own startup.













When Saina reached the office, the necessity of entering her details at the reception desk is being replaced by one click just after entering her log-in details.  She liked flexible office timing thereby she also not like to feel intimidated by the eye of any lady at the reception desk when she reached office little date. The moment she reached to her desk the lights get switched on as the switches are enabled with artificial intelligence simulation for effective use of the energy and to reduce unnecessary wastage. She was all set to start her work just after switching on her laptop because the work schedule has already been planned according to the client priority by the Software in her laptop which means there is no need of wasting time in scooping into the dairy pages and planning the day. Her AI enabled computer connected her with the other team members who were working from other cities because here work requires a lot of communication among the team members.
Now she needs a printout but she doesn’t want to move as it could break her continuity then suddenly She thought about TODO. Todo is the robot which makes a life of people working in the office easy by doing the office work without getting tired. She passed smiled to TODO when he brought her printouts but when TODO doesn’t react, she realized that TODO is a machine. Thank God, it’s not like the office boy in her previous workspace who use to give her irritated look when she asked for printout twice or thrice in a day. Works in offices are on the peak at around 2 pm and workers started getting stressed and same goes with Saina but she is in the workspace where artificially intelligent stress meter keep a check on her stress level and order coffee and juices regularly for her which is then Served by TODO. Thank god there is someone who understands and concern for you without even saying a single word. Now its 6.30 PM and the moment she clicked done on the last item in to-do list her laptop send her cheering smileys and suggested to stop the work and reminded her about the Stand-Up Comedy Event that is scheduled for the late evening.
As soon as she wrapped her things and moved from her desk all the lights, ACs were automatically switched off. But when she moved towards the exit gate she realized that light of corridor is malfunctioning, so she thought to raise the problem but Geny of other team has told her not to worry because there is an artificially intelligent mechanism which checks on all the devices and raise the issue as soon as any malfunctioning occurs and then there is technically equipped Robot which fixes all these problems. Saina was about to leave when she saw TODO is still working tirelessly because unlike the nagging office guy in her last office TODO is never in hurry to close the office.
Now let’s come out from this imaginary office of Saina to understand the real-life scenario of Artificial Intelligence applicability and application in the co-working space. The application of artificial intelligence is still at a nascent stage not because that co-working spaces are reluctant to the application of this sophisticated technology but since the potential of AI is humongous its application at the current level is way below its potential. But according to Mckinsey report the Artificial Intelligence and IOT are going to occupy numerous position in the workplace to make the working condition further smooth and enable for more effective use of human resources.
Akshita Gupta_Cofounder, ABL Workspaces
Here in ABL Workspaces we always eager to adopt the modern technology to achieve the greater efficiency and effective use of the resources. We are now looking forward to integrating the AI, Virtual /Augmented Reality in our co-working space to provide a better office ecosystem to the budding entrepreneurs working in our co-working space because who knows a new Facebook or Microsoft might be taking shape to lead the world in coming future in these co-working spaces.
