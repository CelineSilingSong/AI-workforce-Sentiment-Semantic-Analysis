Live00:0000:0000:00 March 17 (Reuters) - Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, capturing the public's fancy and sparking a rush among Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab to launch products with technology they believe will change the nature of work.Here is everything you need to know about this technology.WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?Like other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI learns how to take actions from past data. It creates brand new content - a text, an image, even computer code - based on that training, instead of simply categorizing or identifying data like other AI.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe most famous generative AI application is ChatGPT, a chatbot that Microsoft-backed OpenAI released late last year. The AI powering it is known as a large language model because it takes in a text prompt and from that writes a human-like response.GPT-4, a newer model that OpenAI announced this week, is ""multimodal"" because it can perceive not only text but images as well. OpenAI's president demonstrated on Tuesday how it could take a photo of a hand-drawn mock-up for a website he wanted to build, and from that generate a real one.Advertisement · Scroll to continueWHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?Demonstrations aside, businesses are already putting generative AI to work.The technology is helpful for creating a first-draft of marketing copy, for instance, though it may require cleanup because it isn't perfect. One example is from CarMax Inc (KMX.N), opens new tab, which has used a version of OpenAI's technology to summarize thousands of customer reviews and help shoppers decide what used car to buy.Generative AI likewise can take notes during a virtual meeting. It can draft and personalize emails, and it can create slide presentations. Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google each demonstrated these features in product announcements this week.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?A response by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, is seen on its website in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabNothing, although there is concern about the technology's potential abuse.School systems have fretted about students turning in AI-drafted essays, undermining the hard work required for them to learn. Cybersecurity researchers have also expressed concern that generative AI could allow bad actors, even governments, to produce far more disinformation than before.At the same time, the technology itself is prone to making mistakes. Factual inaccuracies touted confidently by AI, called ""hallucinations,"" and responses that seem erratic like professing love to a user are all reasons why companies have aimed to test the technology before making it widely available.IS THIS JUST ABOUT GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT?Those two companies are at the forefront of research and investment in large language models, as well as the biggest to put generative AI into widely used software such as Gmail and Microsoft Word. But they are not alone.Large companies like Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), opens new tab as well as smaller ones like Adept AI Labs are either creating their own competing AI or packaging technology from others to give users new powers through software.HOW IS ELON MUSK INVOLVED?He was one of the co-founders of OpenAI along with Sam Altman. But the billionaire left the startup's board in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest between OpenAI's work and the AI research being done by Telsa Inc (TSLA.O), opens new tab - the electric-vehicle maker he leads.Musk has expressed concerns about the future of AI and batted for a regulatory authority to ensure development of the technology serves public interest.""It's quite a dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it,"" he said towards the end of Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O), opens new tab Investor Day event earlier this month.""Tesla's doing good things in AI, I don't know, this one stresses me out, not sure what more to say about it.""(This story has been refiled to correct dateline to March 17)The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

A few years ago, you might have been forgiven for wondering whether it was just another fad. But recent advances – such as the emergence of generative AI tools like ChatGPT – have left most of us in no doubt that we’re witnessing the dawn of a new era. An era that’s likely to see our lives change just as dramatically as we saw with the arrival of personal computers, the internet, or smartphones.

Perhaps even more so – Google CEO Sundar Pichai famously stated back in 2016 that it would have a bigger impact than fire or electricity.

But let’s forget the hyperbole (if it is hyperbole) for a second and focus on the here and now. What are the most important things we need to understand about this revolutionary technology today? Interesting (or scary) though it may be to wonder whether we will be chauffeured in sentient flying taxis – or even falling in love and marrying robots – in decades to come, there are some pressing concerns that need to be addressed right now. So, here are the facts I believe that everyone needs to get to grips with in 2023 in order to navigate these early days of the AI era.

Yes, it’s early days, and the AI tools and apps that are blowing our minds today are going to look amusingly quaint compared to what we’re playing with in five years’ time. But make no mistake, AI is here today, embedded everywhere in the world around us. You might be one of the many who don’t even realize it – a survey a few years back found that while 84% of us were using AI on a daily basis, only 34% knew we were doing it. But when you’re shopping online, searching the internet, ordering food deliveries, hailing a ride, navigating from place to place, or enjoying music and movies, you’re probably using AI.

It's still tempting to think of AI as something from the domain of science fiction that might emerge at some point in the future – because, to adults alive today, that’s been the case for most of our lives. And today’s AI doesn’t’ exactly look and behave like what we might have been expecting, if we grew up watching Dr. Who, Star Trek, or The Matrix. But if we understand the term AI to mean machines that are capable of simulating at least some of the cognitive functions of biological brains – specifically today, the capacity to learn and improve – then that’s clearly what we have. The last ten years have seen some of the world's biggest companies focusing their efforts on building these abilities into everyday products and services, which is what has brought us to the point we’re at today.

AI is not going to make you redundant – yet!
One of the biggest concerns about AI is that it will make humans redundant. After all, if our jobs require analyzing and interpreting information and using it to make decisions, it’s very probable that machines can now do it at least as accurately, and certainly much faster, than we can!
The truth, though, is that while some AI systems are good at some jobs, AI, in general, isn’t quite good enough just yet to fully replicate the entire skillsets needed to do most work. Self-driving vehicles haven’t been completely cracked yet – despite billions in investment and numerous companies getting to the trial stage, we aren’t yet at the point where bus or taxi drivers are in danger of being immediately replaced. This is even more true for knowledge workers or workers in roles where there is an emphasis on human-to-human interaction, like nursing or teaching.
It's clear that some jobs are being replaced by automation – manual manufacturing work, retail cashiers, and bank clerks, for example, had seen machines take over much of their work, even before AI became as commonplace as it is today. At the same time, however, new jobs are created by the need to design, implement, sell, manage, and oversee technology and AI. Generally, these tend to be higher-paying, safer, more comfortable, and more rewarding jobs than those that are replaced.

AI is going to affect your job, business, or industry 
Another thing it’s important to understand today is that ignoring the emergence of AI and believing that it won't affect your job, business, or industry is the biggest mistake you could make!
Whatever you do, AI is most likely going to have an impact, and it's crucial for individuals and businesses to think about how it's likely to affect them. Failing to do so means we’re likely to be overtaken by competitors or startups who have been quicker to adapt to the changing world. No one wants to end up the way Blockbuster Video did when Netflix arrived or Kodak after the arrival of digital cameras. Both were businesses that believed that encroaching existential threats to their core business models were simply fads that would blow over. AI is not a fad, and its impact is likely to be much further-reaching than that of streaming video or digital cameras, so we need to start planning for it right now!

Just about anyone can use generative AI to make themselves smarter and more efficient
There are already many ways we can use AI tools and applications to augment and enhance our own work. If we are involved with creating reports or summarizing information, then tools like ChatGPT can help with creating drafts, outlines, and lists of important points. Other generative AI tools are available for creating videos, music, and images, and they can all be used today by anyone working in creative fields or anyone who simply needs to communicate ideas quickly and efficiently. The standard of work they produce is probably not good enough to rely on to create finished pieces of work in many cases, but it can be used to speed up the early stages of ideation, designing, and drafting. It can give us instant answers and advice on just about any topic we might need to consider before we make a decision, manage our schedule, so we don't double-book ourselves or miss important appointments, and vastly speed up day-to-day routine tasks such as sending emails.

Developing ethical and explainable AI is essential
There’s a very simple reason that AI needs to be both ethical and explainable, and it all comes down to trust. AI is powered by data – the more it knows, the more efficiently it works. The most valuable data of all is human data, which tells it about who we are, how we live our lives, and what we need to make us safe, comfortable, healthy, and happy.
If AI has this information, then it has the potential to do amazing things, including helping us solve some of the most pressing problems facing humanity. That could be tackling climate change, treating diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, or reducing poverty.
In order for it to be able to do these things, though, people will have to trust it with their data. Many of us aren’t going to be comfortable handing over sensitive information about our health or our habits if we're not sure what's being done with it. This is why the concept of explainable AI is so crucial. We need to know why it makes the decisions it makes and what information it bases them on if we are going to trust it to make important choices that could affect our lives.
On top of that, we need to be sure that the decisions and operations of AI are aligned with our ethical values. It’s been shown that AI can lead to bias and discrimination, particularly where the data that it’s trained on contains bias. This could be due to incomplete datasets or data that’s been collected in a biased manner. Failing to show that problems of ethics and bias are being addressed will lead to further difficulty in building trust between humans and AI, which could potentially limit its usefulness and the positive outcomes that can be achieved.

They could diagnose our illnesses in a second. Robots and autonomous vehicles could shop and deliver our groceries. Systems could ensure we don’t break our budgets. AI could operate our transit — planes, trains and cars — without human assistance, and even make our dinner.That’s the vision of many AI enthusiasts. But the current reality is that while there has been progress, humans are still required to do most jobs. An AI could introduce problems to the workplace, creating risks for workers, their employers and customers, some experts say.Today, AI can power grocery store robots that change how stores get stocked, speed up vaccine production and generate creative ideas. But the latest advancements raise important questions for workers: How much of our jobs depend on humans? Can technology replace us?Press Enter to skip to end of carouselWork: ReimaginedWith attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.Read more.End of carouselAI won’t entirely replace humans any time soon, industry experts and companies investing in the technology say. But jobs are transforming as AI becomes more accessible.“Every job will be impacted by AI,” said Pieter den Hamer, vice president of research who covers artificial intelligence at market research firm Gartner. “Most of that will be more augmentation rather than replacing workers.”Companies have been using AI for years to help crunch large amounts of data to produce insights for their businesses. Some blue-collar jobs have used AI-powered machines to help with warehouse inventory.White-collar jobs are likely to see the biggest impact near-term, den Hamer said, as AI can be applied at a relatively low cost compared with deploying a fleet of autonomous trucks, for example.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementIf you’re curious about how some jobs might shift, explore the industries below.Do you work as a banker or financial adviser?

AI can help developers find code they can repurpose for new products or write basic new code, said Martin Wildberger, its executive vice president of innovation and tech.[Quiz: Did AI make this? Test your knowledge.]Financial firm Capital One said AI and machine learning are central to its engineering workforce. The bank holds AI and ML patents for fraud detection and natural language processing.AI advances in the field: Several banks are aiming to offer more personalized financial products and advice, increase the speed of fraud detection to alert customers instantly and remind people of specific bills or spending.Abhijit Bose, a Capital One senior vice president, said AI could soon monitor transactions to offer more personalized financial advice, insights on spending and saving or quick alerts on deviations from normal spending habits — something as simple as an outlier tip percentage.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementMorgan Stanley recently began testing chatbots powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 with 300 advisers to help them easily pull up research and data. The firm plans to open it up to its 16,000 advisers in upcoming months.But financial institutions are cautious. AI could introduce risks such as frustrating customers with too much automation, breaking privacy laws aimed at protecting customer’s personal financial data and potentially discriminating against people with lower income.How jobs might change: RBC is asking workers across functions to become familiar with using AI tools, Wildberger said. It could provide customer service representatives with summaries of complex cases based on previous interactions. And business teams could automate some processes to be more efficient.“We really focus on the productivity side of tech,” Wildberger said. “Can we automate something to free up [employees’] time?”Capital One said it’s hiring AI and machine learning engineers, but it’s also upskilling current engineers. Bose said the company has already trained more than 100 engineers through its six-month program.Health care and pharmaceuticalsWhat’s happening: Many hospitals use electronic medical records, an area that may benefit from AI for organization and analysis, said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies AI’s impact on work. And drug development can involve analyzing hundreds of millions of data points, another area where AI could help.AI advances in the field: Johnson & Johnson sped up the trials of its coronavirus vaccine by using AI to identify hot spots including where variants emerged, said Jim Swanson, executive vice president and chief information officer. It also can help narrow the focus on molecules and identify targets for drug discovery or accelerate image analytics to determine drug effects. And AI supports the manufacturing process for a personalized blood cancer treatment that modifies patients’ own cells.Swanson said AI also helps guide physicians through procedures like surgeries with augmented reality. As the physician works, it provides guidance on the best next steps. It also helps with reporting adverse events related to drugs by scanning the latest medical literature and flagging reports that need to be reviewed or accelerate image analytics to determine drug effects.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselMore from Work: ReimaginedCarousel - $More from Work: Reimagined: use tab or arrows to navigateThe boomers are retiring.

Here’s how to prepare.March 28, 2023End of carouselThe University of Kansas Health System recently rolled out a generative AI app to more than 140 hospitals. The app, from health-tech company Abridge, records audio of a patient interview, transcribes it, then summarizes important elements to automatically fill out a patient’s medical chart.“The joy of medicine is helping people get to better health, not the clerical activity,” said Gregory Ator, the health system’s chief medical informatics officer and surgeon. This “just streamlines documentation.”Generative AI can introduce errors, though, which could be problematic for health-care providers. Abridge highlights parts where reliability of the transcript may be decreased so people can review it, CEO and cardiologist Shiv Rao said.Some health-care professionals are using AI for cancer screenings, medical imaging and predictions to better detect problems. Google is working with partners such as the Mayo Clinic to validate AI that could automate part of the planning process in radiation treatments for cancer, help mobile ultrasound devices detect early stages of breast cancer or provide vital maternity data without a sonographer and power tuberculosis screenings. But it will probably take years before the technology is ready for professional use, Google said.If relied on too heavily, AI errors in medical processes could have life-altering consequences.That’s why Tammy Mahaney, a Bay Area nurse and sonographer, said she checks readings provided by AI-enabled systems to ensure they match what she’s seeing. But she said the tools help her care for more patients.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementDuring a missionary trip to an underserved community in the Galápagos Islands, Mahaney used Butterfly IQ+, an AI-enabled tool that helps perform an ultrasound, interpret it and automatically provide measurements and images on a mobile device such as an iPhone. With the ultrasound, Mahaney determined that a woman in her mid-40s was pregnant and not suffering from a tumor, as she had been told. Still, Mahaney said AI is just a tool.“You always want to be cautious about diagnosis,” she said of AI. “The limitations are you don’t get the human interaction and instinct.”How jobs might change: Rao said AI isn’t too far from being able to aid health professionals with decision-making.“There will be a space for AI to be a thought partner,” he said, adding that the tech could help find the differentiator between two conditions.In the future, AI could be tied to more devices and wearables for health, Swanson said. Johnson & Johnson aims to digitally upskill 10,000 additional employees this year so they can use the tech to forecast sales or improve operations. And it’s exploring how to use and combine data without bias.RetailWhat’s happening: One way big retailers use AI is to track the market price of items, which changes based on factors including supply and logistics, to ensure products are competitively priced. AI can help adjust prices of thousands of products across a store, said Ananda Chakravarty, vice president of research at market intelligence firm International Data Corporation. AI can also help forecast exactly when to drop prices to increase profits.Retailers are also using AI to schedule workers based on a store’s need, automatically charge people for items with computer vision and recommend products to customers online, Chakravarty added.AI advances in the field: Sam’s Club, which often serves as tech pilot for Walmart, debuted autonomous floor scrubbers late last year, which in addition to cleaning floors, use computer vision to scan shelves for missing items, low inventory or mislabeled products. The information gets sent back to an ecosystem that could change workers’ priority list. For example, they may need to unload and stock water next if scrubbers determine shelves are empty.The retailer also uses AI in its virtual voice assistant called Ask Sam, which workers can use to quickly find prices, locate items or help customers. It hopes AI will soon help determine things such as how many croissants workers should bake and automatically alert them when the doughnut count is low, for example.“We’re moving to where AI is going to be embedded in a lot of things so we can increase associate productivity and reduce friction for members,” Pete Rowe, Sam’s vice president of tech, said.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementLooking ahead, retailers might use computer vision to automatically identify whether a customer is old enough to buy alcohol, Chakravarty said, adding that the tech is in early stages of adoption. Generative AI may also soon write product descriptions for thousands of products, said Christian Beckner, the National Retail Federation’s vice president of retail technology and cybersecurity. And AI could crawl social media to automatically design clothes or products based on trends, allowing retailers to get new items to market quickly.But AI-enabled systems aren’t always well received by everyone. When Walmart rolled out robot cleaners a few years ago, some store associates complained about malfunctions and the time they tended to training the robots (Walmart said the bots appeared to have been well-received). And facial recognition systems have historically suffered flaws, often misidentifying people of color, which could lead to security unfairly targeting Brown and Black people.How jobs might change: Workers’ jobs are likely to be dictated by what machines deem most important or risk losing money or efficiency for the store. Workers also will probably need to adjust to working with data and tech more frequently, Chakravarty said.“You don’t have to be an expert, but you need to know how to interpret the data,” he said.But more AI could mean more risks.“The key concern would be … the risk of algorithmic discrimination or adverse consequences in how you treat different types of customers,” Beckner said. “There definitely needs to be a level of caution.”Writing and marketingWhat’s happening: One of buzziest forms of AI — generative AI — can produce digital images, conversational text, code and summaries of lengthy documents from a simple prompt. While it’s still in its early days, it has big implications for jobs that include writing, coding or promoting products.AI advances in the field: Last year, software development platform GitHub debuted GitHub Copilot, a tool that uses OpenAI models to write code based on a user’s prompt. Copilot can suggest methods, unit tests, boilerplate code and complex algorithms, GitHub said.Some writers are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT to co-write and illustrate books to sell on Amazon. And one legislator used it to help draft a law aimed at regulating AI. Companies such as Microsoft and Google are integrating generative AI tools so office workers can do tasks like write emails or create presentations faster within the apps.Jonathan Nelson, senior digital marketing manager of growth for the American Marketing Association, said marketers are experimenting with ChatGPT to write articles, including optimizing them for search engines, though they’re not yet publishing those items.“You have AI write a 1,000-word article, and then go through and edit it to make it sound human again,” he said. “It’s a framework for articles.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementJeff MacDonald, social strategy director at ad agency Mekanism, said he uses generative AI to brainstorm images for illustrators and designers. He also uses it to scrape TikTok comments and analyze reactions, ideas, and similarities and differences between brands.But he often uses other tools to double check AI-generated items, as it can make things up or get things wrong, and he avoids using them in finished products. Some AI companies are being sued for scraping copyrighted materials.“If [AI companies] lose these lawsuits … there’s no saying they can’t go after a brand that used copyrighted imagery,” he said.How jobs might change: Generative AI tools could help workers become more productive, especially with content creation, said den Hamer of Gartner. That might mean using AI for a first draft and social media posts to solve simple problems or provide summaries of complex topics.Nelson said though much is still experimental, marketers have a sense that they’ll soon work with AI if they aren’t already — even if it’s just to help determine the success of a campaign. But he said it will be important for the industry to keep human creativity front and center.“If everyone relies too much on one or two AI [tools], and it operates the same way, do you end up with rampant sameness where nothing stands out?” he said.About this storyWork: Reimagined | With attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.

ChowMarch 21, 2023 1:44 PM EDTBill Gates published an op-ed on Tuesday saying that the artificial intelligence (AI) technology behind tools like ChatGPT could be as revolutionary as the graphical user interface was in 1980. The graphical user interface was the prototype to modern operating systems like Windows and Mac. Now, Gates says AI will lead to all sorts of similarly massive changes in the coming decades. “The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone,” he wrote. “It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other.”Gates isn’t exactly an impartial player in the unfolding AI arms race. Microsoft, the company he co-founded, is investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT and which Gates raves about in his article. While Gates is no longer involved in day-to-day operations at Microsoft, he still serves as an advisor, meeting with project teams, and owns billions of dollars worth of Microsoft stock. Here are some takeaways from the piece: AI has a lot of potential in health careAs Gates now spends much of his time on philanthropic causes, he says he’s acutely interested in how AI could improve lives in less economically developed countries and “reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.” He argues that AI systems will accelerate medical research and potentially create tools to mitigate diseases like AIDS, TB and Malaria. He also suggests that generative AI tools should be used for primary diagnoses of patients seeking medical advice. While Gates acknowledges that AIs will inevitably misdiagnose patients, he contends that the upside is worth it. “Humans make mistakes too. And having no access to medical care is also a problem,” he writes. Meanwhile, Gates predicts that AI will soon be integrated into health care systems around the world, helping medical professionals file insurance claims and deal with paperwork.

Live00:0100:2800:30 Read More: The AI Arms Race is Changing EverythingIn the workforce, Gates predicts that AI will serve as a “personal agent”: drafting emails, monitoring schedules and taking notes. These abilities will cause massive workplace shifts, which will necessitate that governments “help workers transition into other roles,” he says. However, he argues that these shifts will allow humans to fill in the roles where software cannot, including “caring for patients and supporting the elderly.” AI is already having an outsize impact on the educational world, with students attempting to use AI to complete homework and writing assignments, and teachers using it to devise lesson plans. Gates argues that AI will be a crucial educational tool that will “measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to.” Humans must step in to prevent AI harmsPlenty of harms loom. AIs have regurgitated hate speech and misinformation and have tried to emotionally manipulate users. Gates notes the misinformation problem, pointing to ChatGPT’s inability to solve math problems that involve abstract reasoning. However, he predicts that those kinds of limitations will be “largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.” In a series of principles that Gates outlines as key to guiding the conversation around AI, he acknowledges that AI could exacerbate inequalities without the right interventions from governments and other organizations. He says it’s important for policymakers and philanthropists to prioritize the opposite: to wield AI to “help the poorest” and reduce inequality. Superintelligent AIs are comingGates raises the specter of superintelligent AIs, or machines that are smarter than human brains and make their own decisions about how they are used. He writes excitedly about these superintelligent AIs, asserting that they are “in our future.” Whether they will be positive or catastrophic for society, Gates writes, is too early to tell. In the near future, however, Gates encourages the continued adoption of AI technology, along with the institution of guardrails and regulations. “This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives,” he writes.” At the same time, the world needs to establish the rules of the road so that any downsides of artificial intelligence are far outweighed by its benefits.” ",,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/UIDfUltg/poster.jpg?width=720,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6264801/bill-gates-ai/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",2022-11-03T15:39:10.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/UIDfUltg.m3u8,https://time.com/6264801/bill-gates-ai/,PT2M33S,,,,,,,,,,,

Artists, designers, photographers, authors, actors and musicians see little humour left in jokes about AI programs that will one day do their job for less money. That dark dawn is here, they say.Vast amounts of imaginative output, work made by people in the kind of jobs once assumed to be protected from the threat of technology, have already been captured from the web, to be adapted, merged and anonymised by algorithms for commercial use. But just as GPT-4, the enhanced version of the AI generative text engine, was proudly unveiled last week, artists, writers and regulators have started to fight back in earnest.“Picture libraries are being scraped for content and huge datasets being amassed right now,” says Isabelle Doran, head of the Association of Photographers. “So if we want to ensure the appreciation of human creativity, we need new ways of tracing content and the protection of smarter laws.”Collective campaigns, lawsuits, international rules and IT hacks are all being deployed at speed on behalf of the creative industries in an effort, if not to win the battle, at least to “rage, rage against the dying of the light”, in the words of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.Poetry may still be a hard nut for AI to crack convincingly, but among the first to face a genuine threat to their livelihoods are photographers and designers. Generative software can produce images at the touch of the button, while sites like the popular NightCafe make “original”, data-derived artwork in response to a few simple verbal prompts. The first line of defence is a growing movement of visual artists and image agencies who are now “opting out” of allowing their work to be farmed by AI software, a process called “data training”. Thousands have posted “Do Not AI” signs on their social media accounts and web galleries as a result.A software-generated approximation of Nick Cave’s lyrics notably drew the performer’s wrath earlier this year. He called it “a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human”. Not a great review. Meanwhile, AI innovations such as Jukebox are also threatening musicians and composers.And digital voice-cloning technology is putting real narrators and actors out of regular work. In February, a Texas veteran audiobook narrator called Gary Furlong noticed Apple had been given the right to “use audiobook files for machine learning training and models” in one of his contracts. But the union SAG-AFTRA took up his case. The agency involved, Findaway Voices, now owned by Spotify, has since agreed to call a temporary halt and points to a “revoke” clause in its contracts. But this year Apple brought out its first books narrated by algorithms, a service Google has been offering for two years.The creeping inevitability of this fresh challenge to artists seems unfair, even to spectators. As the award-winning British author Susie Alegre, a recent victim of AI plagiarism, asks: “Do we really need to find other ways to do things that people enjoy doing anyway? Things that give us a sense of achievement, like writing a poem? Why not replace the things that we don’t enjoy doing?”View image in fullscreenNot a fan of AI: singer-songwriter Nick Cave. Photograph: Simona Chioccia/ShutterstockAlegre, a human rights lawyer and writer based in London, argues that the value of authentic thinking has already been undermined: “If the world is going to put its faith in AI, what’s the point? Pay rates for original work have been massively diminished. This is automated intellectual asset-stripping.”The truth is that AI incursions into the creative world are just the headline-grabbers. It is fun, after all, to read about a song or an award-winning piece of art dreamed up by computer. Accounts of software innovation in the field of insurance underwriting are less compelling. All the same, scientific efforts to simulate the imagination have always been at the forefront of the push for better AI, precisely because it is so difficult to do. Could software really produce paintings that entrance or stories that engage? So far the answer to both, happily, is “no”. Tone and appropriate emotional register remain hard to fake.Yet the prospect of valid creative careers is at stake. ChatGPT is just one of the latest AI products, alongside Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing, to have shaken up copyright legislation. Artists and writers who are losing out to AI tend to talk sorrowfully of programmes that “spew rubbish” and “spout out nonsense”, and of a sense of “violation”. This moment of creative jeopardy has arrived with the huge amount of data now available on the web for covert harvesting rather than due to any malevolent push. But its victims are alarmed.Analysis of the burgeoning problem in February found that the work of designers and illustrators is most vulnerable. Software programs such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL.E 2 are creating images in seconds, all culled from a databank of styles and colour palettes. One platform, ArtStation, was reportedly so overwhelmed by anti-AI memes that it requested the labelling of AI artwork.At the Association of Photographers, Doran has mounted a survey to gauge the scale of the attack. “We have clear evidence that image datasets, which form the basis of these commercial AI generative image content programs, consist of millions of images from public-facing websites taken without permission or payment,” she says. Using the site Have I Been Trained which has access to the Stable Diffusion dataset, her “shocked” members have identified their own images and are mourning the reduction of the worth of their intellectual property.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But following the trail is tricky as images are used by clients in altered forms and opt-out clauses can be hard to find. Many photographers are also reporting that their “style” is being mimicked to produce cheaper work. “As these programs are devised to ‘machine learn’, at what point can they generate with ease the style of an established professional photographer and displace the need for their human creativity?” says Doran.GPT-4 has brought a storm of hype and fright – is it marketing froth, or is this a revolution?Charlie BeckettRead moreFor Alegre, who last month discovered paragraphs of her prize-winning book Freedom to Think were being offered up, uncredited by ChatGPT, there are hidden dangers to simply opting out: “It means you are completely written out of the story, and for a woman that is problematic.”Alegre’s work is already being misattributed to male authors by AI, so removing it from the equation would compound the error. Databanks can only reflect what they have access to.“ChatGPT said I did not exist, although it quoted my work. Apart from the damage to my ego, I do exist on the internet, so it felt like a violation,” she says.“Later it came up with a pretty accurate synopsis of my book, but said the author was some random bloke. And, funnily enough, my book is about the way misinformation twists our worldview. AI content really is about as reliable as checking your horoscope.” She would like to see AI development funding diverted to the search for new legal protections.Fans of AI may well promise it can help us to better understand the future beyond our intellectual limitations. But for plagiarised artists and writers, it now seems the best hope is that it will teach humans yet again that we should doubt and check everything we see and read.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverArtPhotographyPlagiarismNick CaveComputingConsciousnessfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveKamala Harris speaks for first time since Biden drops out and endorses her to be Democratic presidential candidate – liveFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

Or will AI help improve our work lives and even create new jobs? The robots are coming! They’re gunning for your job and – here’s the kicker – they are far better at it than you are. Soon, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace journalists, surgeons, taxi drivers, song writers. In fact, few careers are safe, we’re repeatedly told.And yet… is that the whole story? There is a growing view that, in many ways, AI will make our lives better, both at work and at home.“AI can take some of the repetitive tasks off us,” says Liz Hardwick, digital productivity specialist, speaker, trainer and member of WeAreTechWomen.While it may seem daunting, “just think of AI as the latest addition to your tech tools, like the Palm Pilot or the first-generation iPhone once seemed to you,” she suggests. Most of all, don’t bury your head in the sand: “Understanding its capabilities is the first step to better harnessing AI for your benefit.”Improve your work lifeSo will AI really render us all redundant? When PwC ran the numbers, it came to a heartening conclusion.“Any job losses from automation,” wrote the report authors, “are likely to be broadly offset in the long run by new jobs created as a result of the larger and wealthier economy made possible by these new technologies.”      ChatGPT: What impact could it and other AI bots have on our kids’ learning? The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, has been grabbing headlines of late, but will it be a good or bad thing for children's education?    Find out more      This optimistic take is far from unique. In its Future of Jobs Report 2020, the World Economic Forum foresaw 85 million job losses across 26 countries by 2025, because of AI. The flipside? Ninety-seven million new jobs would be created.It gets better. When, in 2019, MIT surveyed 2,300 global business leaders, nearly half strongly agreed that, thanks to AI, “we could dedicate more time to thinking creatively about the business challenges we (and our clients) face.”Your job could become more interesting, as more of the drudgery – those repetitive, even dangerous tasks – gets delegated to AI.“AI will replace repetitive and technical tasks – think emails, multi-step processes such as updating documents, or sending one bit of data from one place to another,” says Ms Hardwick. On the other hand: “AI will struggle to replace human interactions, empathy, knowledge processing or creative ideas.”It’s nuanced, though. Last year, a study found that “as firms invest in AI, they tend to transition to more educated workforces, with higher shares of workers with undergraduate and graduate degrees, and more specialisation in STEM fields [that’s science, tech, engineering and maths] and IT skills”.       Why your teen's gaming habit could land them a better job Parents often worry that their kids are spending too much time playing video games, but the latest research suggests that the skills they pick up from gaming could actually improve their employment prospects.   Find out more      So start upskilling, now.“Areas such as people management and digital skills are key,” says Ms Hardwick. Meanwhile: “humans will always be needed to set up, manage and facilitate AI interactions and processes, so learning what AI is, what it can do, and how you can help it ‘learn’ will enable the current workforce to take better advantage of AI, rather than being replaced by it.”Make yourself more hirable“Many organisations are turning to using AI and machine learning algorithms in their selection process,” says Dr Sara Ahmed, from the Future of Work Research Centre at the University of Surrey.While surveys suggest that job applicants are wary of this method, and that current AI might not be completely free from bias, “using AI in HR practices can learn from previous errors in the system and improve the new version to reduce biases and discrimination,” she says.It can also free HR teams from a lot of admin. “This can help us focus on upskilling workers or employees to take highly-skilled jobs,” says Dr Ahmed, “thus improving the efficiency and performance of individuals, organisations and societies.”Hack your commuteMore than $100bn (£83bn) has now been invested in developing ‘driver-assistance systems’ for cars and the UK Government has said that fully driverless cars could be on British roads by 2025, arguing that they will boost the economy and improve road safety, too.       How Vodafone's Edge Innovation Programme will 'enable the technology of the future' Vodafone's UK Business Director Nick Gliddon went to Milton Keynes to talk about how Multi-access Edge Computing could help driverless car software start-up, Imperium Drive, improve its car rental app.   Find out more      They might also save you a huge amount of time. Think of the hours you clock up behind the wheel. Last year, a survey suggested Brits spend a whole year of their adult lives sitting in traffic. Imagine how you could use that time if your car took the wheel. Might you finally write that novel, or study some of those STEM skills so vital in the modern economy?The transition, though, could be nerve-wracking and take longer than the Government thinks. According to a new survey, nearly 70% of drivers are now afraid of fully self-driving cars. That’s up from 55% last year.Free you from houseworkA 2023 study published in the journal PLOS ONE concluded that nearly 40% of the time that is currently taken up on unpaid domestic labour could be automated within a decade.       Pixel 6 and iPhone 13: How smartphones are now clever enough to coach you at tennis Artificial Intelligence (AI) now lives inside the brain of the latest smartphones, opening up intriguing new possibilities in the apps we use, from tracking your tennis swings to helping you sing your heart out.    Find out more      “Considering that people currently spend almost similar amounts of time on unpaid work as they do on paid work, the social and economic implications of this future of unpaid work could be significant,” write the authors. “It could free up additional hours from people’s lives for paid work and leisure, especially for women.”The researchers at the University of Oxford, and their colleagues in Japan, found that the most automatable task was grocery shopping (at 59%).Some jobs, though, will still require a human touch. Physical childcare, for example, was ranked as the least automatable (at 21%). And – perhaps tellingly – the British men involved in the study proved more optimistic about domestic automation than their female counterparts.Boost your healthAI is already transforming all aspects of healthcare, from screening and diagnosis right through to surgery.“This will reduce the cost of care, and improve outcomes, simply because things will happen earlier, faster, and better,” according to Dr Aldo Aisal, Director of Imperial College London’s UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare.This is good news for us all.       Prof Shafi Ahmed: 'Technology will completely transform healthcare' Professor Shafi Ahmed, world-renowned cancer surgeon and Vodafone Connected Health Ambassador, explains how technology and data-driven medicine are improving healthcare in the UK and globally.   Find out more      But what about the doctors who used to do this work? Will they be out of work? Not according to Dr Aisal: “Rather than replacing people with machines, creating unemployment, we foresee this as a way of dealing with the growing unmet need for clinical care.”Saving the environmentLast year, Boston Consulting Group concluded that AI is essential to solving the climate crisis. When it surveyed global climate and AI leaders, 87% agreed that advanced analytics and AI are helpful tools in the fight against climate change today.       AI helps improve Vodafone’s pan-European network Vodafone uses big data software, based on tools from Google Cloud and Cardinality.IO, to improve mobile network planning decisions.   Find out more      The consultants estimate that companies can meet up to 10% of their carbon reduction goals simply by using AI that collects data, makes connections that humans fail to notice, and then recommends actions.AI, it seems, might make your work life more interesting, your world less polluted, and your free-time freer. It doesn’t have to end up like a dystopian mash-up of the Matrix, Terminator and Westworld movies.Stay up-to-date with the very latest news from Vodafone by following us on Twitter and signing up for News Centre website notifications.

Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on patterns learned from existing data. Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT series, are a subset of generative AI that have been specifically trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language. These models have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing them to produce coherent, contextually relevant, and even creative outputs.Over a year ago, I began using GPT and was amazed by its ability to generate text that is indistinguishable from a human writer. This ability also brought up concerns regarding academic dishonesty. Consequently, I authored an article on Medium anticipating the emergence of AI-assisted academic misconduct.Since then, I have closely monitored developments in generative AI and explored how they can complement my interest in traditional AI systems. Recently, my colleagues and I evaluated ChatGPT’s capacity to pass a simulated Masters-level social work licensing exam — and it did. Our study’s pre-print is available here and will soon be published in Research on Social Work Practice. ChatGPT now accomplishes various complex tasks at lightning speeds I never imagined possible just a year ago.Image by the author.As social work students, you might wonder how these technological advancements can impact your educational experience. AI can revolutionize how you learn, research, and engage with the complex challenges of social work. Large language models can do much more than generate or re-write text. You can use these models to summarize lengthy policy documents, analyze quantitative and qualitative data, generate insights for program evaluation, automate routine functions in a community organization, create marketing materials, build web applications and websites — and many more.I’m convinced that you can enhance your learning experience and open doors to new professional experiences by developing a solid foundation in the understanding of AI technology and the skills to use them effectively. At the same time, these models pose significant challenges and risks to your learning and career without the right mindset, training, and experience.This article is the first part of a series that aims to provide MSW students a starting point for learning about and building competencies in AI technologies, emphasizing large language models. This first article provides a broad overview of different applications of generative AI in social work, along with an initial discussion of ethical issues that will continue in the subsequent articles. The forthcoming topics include:Part II: Essential knowledge, abilities, and practices with AIPart III: Strategies for enhancing your educational experience with AIPart IV: The art and science of prompt engineeringApplications of Generative AI in Social WorkGenerative AI tools are emerging as a transformative force in various fields, including business, medicine, and law. Although AI technologies are just starting to get attention in social work, now is the ideal time for students to think actively about leveraging this tool to enhance and streamline service delivery, empower vulnerable populations, and foster more equitable outcomes.I’m providing a few examples outlining how we can use generative AI. These examples are not comprehensive or fully representative of what generative AI can do. Keep in mind that the landscape of AI-enabled technologies is vast and ever-evolving. According to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, AI’s power doubles every six months.Mental Health ServicesOne promising application of large language models in the field of social work lies within mental health services. Virtual therapy assistants, powered by AI, can offer support and guidance to clients between therapy sessions or when a social worker is not immediately available. For example, virtual assistants could help clients practice coping strategies, provide psychoeducation, or offer brief stress-reduction interventions. These would be assistants that could support various tasks but would not replace social workers.Large language models can assist social workers in better understanding their clients’ language patterns. By analyzing text-based communication or transcriptions of therapy sessions, AI can identify patterns, themes, and sentiments that may provide valuable insights into a client’s emotional state, challenges, and progress in therapy. For instance, AI could help detect signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues by analyzing a client’s word choices, tone, or expression of emotions.Another practical application of large language models is streamlining the documentation process. Social workers can benefit from tools that help manage extensive paperwork demands, such as writing case notes, treatment plans, and progress reports, which can be time-consuming and detract from the time spent with clients. By leveraging AI, social workers can reduce the time and effort spent on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on direct client care and improving the overall quality of mental health services.Program AdministrationGenerative language models can play a significant role in improving program administration within social work organizations. Managing and coordinating social work programs involve a lot of writing-intensive tasks, such as drafting reports, creating and updating training materials, and communicating with stakeholders. AI-powered tools can help generate text using raw data and existing templates as a starting point for these tasks. By automating the initial drafting process, social workers can save time and focus on refining and tailoring content to ensure it accurately reflects the program’s impact and outcomes.This type of support can lead to more efficient reporting and better communication of program results to stakeholders, funders, and policymakers. Large language models can also assist in developing and updating training materials for social work programs. By analyzing existing content and incorporating new research or best practices, AI can suggest revisions and additions to training materials that ensure they remain up-to-date and effective.Policy AnalysisGenerative AI can be a valuable asset for social workers engaged in policy analysis, a crucial aspect of the social work profession that involves reviewing, critiquing, and developing policies to address social issues. Policy analysis often requires social workers to navigate complex and lengthy policy documents, which can be time-consuming and challenging. Large language models can help social workers synthesize and evaluate policy documents more efficiently. By extracting critical information and summarizing the main points, AI-powered tools can enable social workers to quickly grasp the essentials of a policy without having to read through the entire document. This workflow can save time and allow social workers to focus on analyzing the policy’s implications, strengths, and weaknesses.Another useful application of generative AI in policy analysis is its ability to identify gaps and opportunities in existing policies. By analyzing and comparing multiple policy documents, AI can recognize patterns, trends, and areas where policies may be lacking or inconsistent. AI can help social workers pinpoint areas that require further attention or new approaches to address unmet needs. In addition, large language models can assist social workers in generating policy recommendations based on the identified gaps and opportunities. By drawing on a vast knowledge base, AI can suggest evidence-based solutions and best practices for policy development.Program EvaluationProgram evaluation often requires social workers to analyze large amounts of qualitative and quantitative data to determine a program’s success and identify improvement areas. Large language models can assist social workers in analyzing program data more efficiently and generating insights that may take time to be apparent. For example, AI-powered tools can help analyze qualitative data, such as interviews and focus groups, by identifying participants’ themes, patterns, and sentiments. Thus AI-powered tools can provide social workers with valuable information about the experiences and perspectives of clients and other stakeholders, which can inform program improvements.Similarly, AI can analyze quantitative data, such as program outcome measures, by identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies. By automating the initial stages of data analysis, social workers can focus on interpreting the results and applying their expertise to make data-driven decisions and recommendations.By leveraging the insights generated by AI-powered data analysis, social workers can assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their programs and identify areas for improvement. Large language models can also help social workers explore alternative strategies and interventions by suggesting evidence-based practices and generating potential solutions based on the analysis of similar programs or situations.Moreover, generative AI can assist in communicating evaluation findings by generating clear, concise, and accessible reports that effectively convey the results and recommendations to various stakeholders. Such processes help ensure that program evaluation findings are understood and acted upon, ultimately leading to better outcomes for clients and communities.Community OrganizingGenerative AI can play a significant role in supporting community organizing efforts. A critical aspect of community organizing is effective communication and outreach to mobilize individuals, groups, and organizations around a shared goal or issue.Large language models can help social workers create targeted, engaging, and culturally-sensitive messages that resonate with diverse audiences. By tailoring messages based on different community members’ preferences, language, and concerns, AI-powered tools can improve the effectiveness of outreach campaigns and help build stronger connections with community members. Additionally, AI can assist in identifying trends and emerging issues in online conversations and social media, allowing social workers to stay informed and responsive to the community’s needs and priorities.Generative AI can also help streamline collaboration and resource management in community organizing efforts. By automating the creation and updating of shared documents, tracking progress on tasks, and coordinating schedules, AI-powered tools can save time and improve the overall efficiency of organizing initiatives. Furthermore, social workers and community organizers can use AI to analyze data on community resources and needs, which enables them to identify gaps and opportunities for collaboration. This support, in turn, allows social workers to make informed decisions about resource allocation and partnerships to maximize the impact of their efforts.Generative AI can provide valuable assistance in community organizing by helping develop advocacy materials and policy proposals. This practical application involves AI-powered tools analyzing existing policies, research, and best practices to help social workers create persuasive, evidence-based materials that accurately convey the community’s needs and priorities. Social workers and community organizers can use these materials to engage policymakers, funders, and other stakeholders in their advocacy efforts to promote systemic change.International Social WorkGenerative AI can be a valuable tool in international social work, where professionals often face the challenges of language barriers and cultural differences. With their advanced natural language processing capabilities, large language models can help social workers communicate more effectively with diverse populations by providing real-time translations and generating culturally-sensitive messages.Large language models can improve cross-cultural understanding and facilitate collaboration between social workers and the communities they serve. In international social work, staying informed about global trends, emerging issues, and best practices that can inform interventions and policy recommendations is crucial. Generative AI can help social workers access and analyze vast amounts of information from different sources, countries, and languages. By synthesizing this information, AI-powered tools can provide social workers valuable insights and evidence-based strategies to address complex social issues across different contexts.Generative AI can help foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among social work professionals in different countries and settings. AI-powered tools can help social workers share their expertise, learn from one another, and develop innovative solutions that transcend national and cultural boundaries by facilitating communication, generating summaries of research and reports, and identifying common challenges and opportunities.International social work often involves designing, implementing, and evaluating programs and interventions across various cultural, social, and political contexts. Generative AI can support these efforts by helping social workers analyze contextual factors, identify locally-relevant strategies, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in different settings. By providing data-driven insights and recommendations, AI can empower social workers to adapt and improve their programs to serve diverse communities better and address global social challenges.Generative AI presents promising opportunities in social work; however, acknowledging this technology’s imperfections is crucial. By carefully navigating potential benefits and drawbacks, we can ensure responsible and ethical use in supporting vulnerable communities.An imperfect image of a computer generated by GPT-4Ethical ConsiderationsAI tools are not impartial and can perpetuate biases, exacerbating systemic discrimination. Consequently, vigilance is necessary when addressing ethical concerns and implications surrounding AI integration in our work. Ethical consideration is paramount in social work, as AI can influence decisions that impact people’s lives.Social workers must evaluate the ethical consequences of implementing AI, ensuring alignment with the profession’s core values: social justice, respect for human dignity, and ethical responsibility. Moreover, social workers have a crucial role in advocating for protecting vulnerable populations affected by AI, such as individuals with disabilities, marginalized communities, and children and youth. As an introduction to a broader conversation, I emphasize two practical discussion points related to the ethics of AI.Understanding and addressing model biasGenerative AI and large language models learn from lots of data, which can include biases. In social work, we need to anticipate and protect against these biases to avoid causing harm with their use. Social workers should carefully monitor biases in biases in AI-created content, carefully checking outputs that could support stereotypes, spread false information, or show other biases.The intimate connection between AI ethics and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion becomes apparent when examining their shared goal of tackling bias in AI systems. Minimizing the likelihood of biases emerging in AI model creation and implementation requires the participation of people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Encouraging better representation and participation of underrepresented and marginalized communities in the AI development process allows social work organizations and professionals to support more inclusive practices.This strategy nurtures ethical AI practices and helps ensure that AI tools are better suited to address the diverse needs and experiences of various client groups and communities. AI designers can incorporate diverse perspectives and insights to understand better and serve the unique requirements of a broad range of individuals. This inclusive approach improves the overall quality of AI applications and helps build trust and foster collaboration between AI developers and the communities they serve. Ultimately, this leads to more effective, equitable, and beneficial AI solutions.Privacy, Confidentiality, and TransparencyWhen incorporating generative AI into social work practice, safeguarding client privacy and confidentiality is crucial. AI-powered tools for data analysis, report generation, or client communication must comply with stringent data protection standards and relevant privacy laws. Secure storage and transfer, and anonymization are essential to deter unauthorized access. Social workers should review AI-generated content to uphold confidentiality and professional ethics.Transparency is an essential ethical aspect when using generative AI. Social workers need to communicate openly with clients and stakeholders regarding the potential impact of AI-powered tools. Transparency involves explaining how the AI contributes to care, discussing benefits and limitations, and addressing concerns. Moreover, developers and social work organizations must strive for clarity in AI algorithm development and usage. They should aim for AI tools with transparent decision-making processes that enable social workers and stakeholders to understand and evaluate them. This approach encourages responsible, and ethical AI use while fostering trust among social workers, clients, and the community.Next stepsAs we’ve explored in this introductory article, generative AI, specifically large language models, can fundamentally transform social work students’ educational experience and enhance the practice of professionals in the field. From mental health services and program administration to policy analysis, program evaluation, and community organizing, AI technologies offer innovative tools and resources that can augment the capabilities of social workers.To effectively utilize AI in social work, we must focus on combining content expertise with technical skills. While AI-powered tools can perform routine tasks more efficiently than social workers, it is crucial to understand that AI cannot replace social workers. Instead, AI can assist social workers by handling mundane tasks and freeing their time to focus on issues requiring human intervention. In other words, social workers have unique skills that AI lacks.Students and professionals alike must approach these technologies responsibly and ethically. Developing a deep understanding of large language models, their training data, and limitations and honing essential skills like prompt engineering can help users harness the power of AI while mitigating potential inaccuracies and biases.

This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT, a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI.









On one side of the conflict, generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) and other forms of artificial intelligence promise massive productivity and corporate profits, and on the other, confusion, mistrust and the probability of loss of power and control by the masses.
Generative AI is a foundational technology. It refers to AI that can generate original audio, code, images, text, videos, speech and more. AI has become more tangible to the common man and its impact on jobs and life is more visible. Generative AI is making room for itself in the realm of creativity — which was historically monopolized by humans. The technology utilizes mass inputs (ingested data) and experiences (individual interactions with users) to create a base of knowledge. It then “learns” new information constantly in order to generate entirely new and novel content.


  

Some call the ChatGPT-like tools the new frontier for a gold rush. According to research, “AI could take the jobs of as many as one billion people globally and make 375 million jobs obsolete over the next decade.” But on the other hand, it can generate over $15.7 trillion by 2030. From 2017 to 2022, venture capital investment levels in early-stage generative AI companies have quadrupled and the investment growth expectations are significantly higher for years to come. 
The reach and impact of generative AI could be bigger than the internet, cell phones and cloud computing. Its potential is more comparable to the invention of hunting tools, the wheel and the alphabet. It can influence our society and behavior more significantly than the industrial revolution or the Renaissance. 
But I question if we are ready to meet the challenge.AdChoicesADVERTISING
Machines that can go across most industries and functions, provide novel content and work quickly and more knowledgeably than humans challenge people’s power and social worth. The entity that has the speed and capacity advantage, that can gain unlimited access to all human-generated information from day one and can get smarter faster than any individual is powerful. 
The existentialist question becomes why am I here and what is my purpose if not going to work from 9 to 5 to earn a living? Would I need to serve the machine in the future and how would I make a living? 
Elon Musk predicts that AI-driven technologies could power the workforce in the future, saying, “There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation.” Does that mean in a few decades each company will only have one customer — the government? Won’t that challenge the fundamentals of capitalism or at a minimum require an entirely different social safety net? 


  

We are entering an era of “abnormal” that requires different thinking both at an individual and a societal level. 
Sam Altman, the maker of ChatGPT, reportedly said the “good case [for A.I.] is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a crazy person talking about it.” He added: “I think the worst case is lights out for all of us.”
Some fears are indeed justified and not entirely unfounded, others are rooted in our inability to see a future that is not necessarily an extension of the past. 

AI machines learn from humans’ past behaviors and decisions (data); they also inherit our biases. So, if machines can act and learn faster, they will potentially magnify our systematic biases. The biases that drive fake news and divisions. The biases that impact how we judge and treat each other. Biases that may drive wars, famine, racism, sexism and more. So, unless we face our biases, we may be looking at a future that is much more divisive as machines act on our behalf. 
But should we fear ourselves and our biases or the machine that is only replicating them? 
Concerned with cheating, schools are pushing back on students’ use of ChatGPT. The Department of Education in New York City as well as officials in Seattle, Baltimore and Los Angeles are also concerned with plagiarism. Is backing off of the use of generative AI legitimate, or is it time for schools to get our students to learn to apply their talents and use technology differently? 


  

Some of my fellow professors at the University of Southern California conducted very informal research and concluded that ChatGPT can answer exam questions for undergrads to an A-level. The challenge is if the basic questions can be addressed by machines, should we not re-think what we are asking students to learn and how? If we have cars to drive us around, should we still train horses for transportation purposes? 
No doubt, we need regulations that shield us during this large-scale worldwide change. Regulations that guide us toward partnership with the machines and not censorship of their capabilities and promises. We also need corporations to be alert to biases and aware of possible rogue behavior by machines. 
But most importantly, we need a global mind shift that gives us all the courage to leave the past behind and embrace a future of flux. 


  

It is time for massive change and growth. A time to think differently about our future and our relationship with machines. As opposed to viewing the relationship from the lens of slave and master, we should look at it from a partnership perspective. Indeed, guard rails are needed, but machines will only replicate our biases, and students only cheat if we measure them by what they have memorized or predefined procedures.  
We should have the courage to let technology take over mundane processes and let machines coordinate routine future actions. Then, we will have the opportunity to conceive our next future. A future that relies on our collective mental evolution. A future that offers us the luxury to concentrate on innovation and creation. A future that we have not even imagined or are at all prepared for. 
The bottom line, we are entering an era of “abnormal.” An era that offers a fundamental change in our evolutionary path — from physical to mental. There will be unprecedented challenges to overcome, from the way we make a living and receive healthcare to our expectations of the government. From the way we buy, sell, travel and learn to the way we spend our days, define intellectual property and seek legal protections.

Peter Gabriel has opined on the growing prominence of artificial intelligence, noting that neither his nor anyone’s job is safe.

In a discussion with Yahoo! Music about his tech company Reverberation, Gabriel discussed the need to anticipate what AI technology could be capable of. “I’m probably just as scared [of AI] as everybody else, but I like to jump in the river rather than talk about it. … I do think about it quite a lot, and I think not enough people are thinking about it,” he said.
“And it would be great to get ahead [of it]. You know, this is something that’s going have way more impact than the Industrial Revolution and the nuclear bomb. So, if we don’t start anticipating what it might do, it’s going to be too late, because it’s very fast.”
Gabriel then turned to the topic of whether music generated by AI could ever have the emotional effect of songs written by human artists. “Most people argue no; I would say they just need better algorithms,” Gabriel said, adding that there will probably be algorithms for human spirit one day.
Advertisement “So, we might as well just grab the algorithms and dance with them, rather than fight them. Unfortunately, I don’t think my job or anyone’s job is safe from AI,” he added.
“The way to look at it, though, is this amazing toolkit is just coming into our possession and we could do all sorts of extraordinary things, including perhaps – and I do say ‘perhaps’ – protecting our future.”
In February, Gabriel released a new song titled ‘The Court (Dark-Side Mix)’. The single was the second to be taken from his upcoming album ‘i/o’, and features contributions from Brian Eno as well as backing vocals from his daughter, Melanie Gabriel.

The company is announcing a “family of creative generative AI models” today called Adobe Firefly and releasing the first two tools that take advantage of them. One of the tools works like DALL-E or Midjourney, allowing users to type in a prompt and have an image created in return. The other generates stylized text, kind of like an AI-powered WordArt.This is a big launch for Adobe. The company sits at the center of the creative app ecosystem, and over much of the past year, it’s stayed on the sidelines while newcomers to the creative space began to offer powerful tools for creating images, videos, and sound for next to nothing. At launch, Adobe is calling Firefly a beta, and it’ll only be available through a website. But eventually, Adobe plans to tightly integrate generative AI tools with its suite of creative apps, like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere.“We’re not afraid of change, and we’re embracing this change,” says Alexandru Costin, VP of generative AI and Sensei at Adobe. “We’re bringing these capabilities right into [our] products so [customers] don’t need to know if it’s generative or not.”“We can generate high quality content and not random brands’ and others’ IP”Adobe is putting one big twist on its generative AI tools: it’s one of the few companies willing to discuss what data its models are trained on. And according to Adobe, everything fed to its models is either out of copyright, licensed for training, or in the Adobe Stock library, which Costin says the company has the rights to use. That’s supposed to give Adobe’s system the advantages of not pissing off artists and making its system more brand-safe. “We can generate high quality content and not random brands’ and others’ IP because our model has never seen that brand content or trademark,” Costin said.Costin says that Adobe plans to pay artists who contribute training data, too.

Image: AdobeAdobe is also trying to make its AI tools easier to use than those of most competitors. Instead of needing to type in a bizarre string of descriptors to style an image, Adobe includes built-in options for art styles, lighting, and aspect ratio, which seems like a more detailed twist on what Canva is already offering. You’ll also be able to apply those effects to an image that’s already generated, rather than having to generate a new creation every time you want to update the effect. (You’ll still be able to type in custom options if you want to.) The text effect tool works in a similar way, with built-in options for the size of the effect and color of the background.Eventually, Adobe plans to build these generative tools into its various apps and services. There’ll be AI-generated outpainting in Photoshop; Illustrator will be able to generate vector variations on hand-drawn sketches; and Premiere will let you color grade or restyle an image with just an image prompt. Adobe doesn’t have timelines on when any of these features will be released, but they’re among the examples that Costin says the company is working on.There’s also a planned Photoshop feature that may prove to be controversial: Adobe wants to let artists train the system on their own work so that it can assist them by generating content in the artist’s personal style. That has the potential for abuse — someone could train the system on another artist’s style to clone their work — and Costin says Adobe is thinking about how to handle that. He floated the idea of comparing uploaded images to Behance, the art-sharing social network that Adobe owns, to catch potential art thieves. But for now, there’s no final decision on how it’ll be handled.Adobe’s AI can retain an image and continue to modify it with other effects. Image: AdobeOne way Adobe is hoping to stop thieves more broadly is by offering a way for artists to block AI from training on their work. It’s working on a “Do Not Train” system that will allow artists to embed the request into an image’s metadata, which could stop training systems from looking at it — if the creators respect the request. Adobe didn’t announce any other partners who have agreed to respect the Do Not Train flag so far, but Costin said Adobe is in conversations with other model creators. He declined to say which ones.That potentially sets Adobe up to compete on a no-training standard. Stability AI, which makes the image generator Stable Diffusion, has already committed to supporting the artist opt-out requests registered via the “Have I Been Trained?” website. Artists who register their work will have it removed from the training data for Stable Diffusion’s next major release.Firefly’s first two tools will be available in a public beta starting today. You won’t need to be a Creative Cloud subscriber to request access, but Adobe will be limiting how many people it allows into the beta.Comments4 Comments / 4 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe next next thing in AI and AR | The Vergecast

Adobe didn’t announce any other partners who have agreed to respect the Do Not Train flag so far, but Costin said Adobe is in conversations with other model creators. He declined to say which ones.

That potentially sets Adobe up to compete on a no-training standard. Stability AI, which makes the image generator Stable Diffusion, has already committed to supporting the artist opt-out requests registered via the “Have I Been Trained?” website. Artists who register their work will have it removed from the training data for Stable Diffusion’s next major release.

Firefly’s first two tools will be available in a public beta starting today. You won’t need to be a Creative Cloud subscriber to request access, but Adobe will be limiting how many people it allows into the beta.

The sixty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women  (CSW67) is currently taking place at the cusp of many intertwining realities—a world still reeling under the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening climate change crisis, rising inflation, emerging authoritarianism, armed conflicts. Meanwhile, new and fast-moving technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI)—such as ChatGPT—are expected to transform many aspects of our lives and livelihoods, with consequences that are hard to predict. Amid this confluence of forces, some old and stubborn realities persist. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), it will take another 132 years to achieve gender equality on a global scale. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with other concurrent shocks, has reversed the gains for gender equality from the previous years.In the context of CSW67’s priority theme of “innovation and technological change,” closing the gender gap seems even more pertinent, owing to the inherent gender inequities in the technology landscape. For the past 20 years, a substantive gender gap relating to women’s participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and careers has been pointed out. Studies show that women are still largely underrepresented in fields such as computing, digital information technology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Labor market economists attribute this to the disproportionate burden that women bear in terms of differences in human capital, domestic responsibilities, and employment-related discrimination.The field of AI is no different. According to 2019 estimates from UNESCO, only 12 percent of AI researchers are women, and they “represent only six percent of software developers and are 13 times less likely to file an ICT (information, communication, and technology) patent than men.” These facts lead one to pose a natural question: how does this gap in representation manifest in the very technologies that are built?Understanding Bias in AI

While there are different uses of artificial intelligence, such as scanning imaging for signs of cancer, the most commonly known are through AI devices that are ubiquitous in homes and workplaces. Through increased digitization, the COVID-19 pandemic has further contributed to their all-pervading nature. Due to COVID-19, 55 percent of companies have accelerated their AI adoption plans to address the skills deficiencies in various industries. However, the impact of such developments on women and their labor force participation, among other considerations, is yet to be carefully studied and documented.

Gender bias in AI can occur at various stages: in the algorithm’s development process; in the training of datasets; and in AI-generated decision-making. AI applications are run via algorithms, which are a set of instructions for problem solving. Computationally, this process involves transforming input data into output data. To this end, the kind of data that gets inputted can directly influence the subsequent decision-making in algorithms. Thus, if the data originally contain certain biases, this can get replicated by the algorithms, which in turn when used for prolonged periods of time can reinforce these biases in decision-making. To this end, the subjective choices made during the selection, collection, or preparation of data sets can play a role in determining potential biases. This is evident in many branches of AI such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), where “word embeddings” can lead to linguistic biases resulting from sexism, racism, or ableism. For example, while selecting top candidates during a hiring process, Amazon’s automated resume screening system discriminated against women. The data used to train the recruitment model was informed by resume samples from a 10-year period, where women were underrepresented. The resume screening model thus used “linguistic signals” associated with successful male candidates. Once the bias was discovered, Amazon discarded this model.Feminization and Domestication of AIPast research shows how gendered divisions are naturalized and reproduced through technology. To begin with, technology often gets equated with “men’s power,” while women and girls are portrayed as less technologically skilled and less interested than their male counterparts. Such stereotypes can contribute to the gender gap in women’s participation in related fields.The tendency to feminize AI tools mimics, and reinforces, the structural hierarchies and stereotypes in society, which is premised on preassigned gender roles. The gendering of AI can occur in multiple ways—through voice, appearance, or the use of female names or pronouns. Home-based virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri were given default feminine voices (Apple and Google have since offered alternatives aimed at “diversification” or “neutrality.”) As UNESCO points out, these devices were designed to have “submissive personalities” and stereotypically feminine attributes, such as being “helpful, intelligent, intuitive.” However, as evident from the case of IBM’s Watson, which used a masculine voice while working with physicians on cancer treatment, male voices have been preferred for tasks that involved teaching and instruction, as they were perceived to be “authoritarian and assertive.” Among these applications, Google Assistant is the only one that did not bear a “gendered name,” however its default voice is female.Gender stereotypes and inequalities can be further reinforced through divisions in occupational roles taken up by these new technologies, as evident in the case of robots. “Male” robots have been deemed more appropriate for security-related jobs, whereas, when Japan launched its first hotel with robot receptionists in 2015, most of these robots were “female.” And while much has been made of the threat that robots and, most recently, emerging AI chatbots present to employment, the sectors that have witnessed increased “robotization” in recent years are those dominated by women—and disproportionately impacted by the pandemic—such as hospitality and tourism, retail, healthcare, and education. In 2022, UNESCO published a report on the Effects of AI on the Working Lives of Women, which stated how AI is changing the landscape of work leading to new skill demands, and how women should not be left behind due to these advancements.Domesticated and feminized forms of AI are also increasingly performing the “affective labor” that is conventionally expected of women. The gendered (and often invisible) work of “affective labor” involves producing, managing, or modifying emotions in others, and can comprise a range of activities such as “caring, listening, comforting, reassuring, [and] smiling.” Past research has shed light on how affective labor has been particularly associated with women of color and migrant domestic workers, where patterns of “domination and invisibility” exist in their relationship with respect to a white household. Home-based virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri perform affective labor by managing both data and emotions. And voice interfaces are primarily designed to perform tasks such as “scheduling, reminding, making lists, seeking information, taking notes, making calls, and sending messages.” Moreover, as opposed to the lived realities of women, the fact that virtual assistants are unaffected by stress or other external factors turns them into a product of “fantasy.”Similarly, the humanization of virtual assistants and robots can also allow for the dehumanization and objectification of women. For example, the humanoid robot “Sophia” was made to look “exceptionally attractive,” evoking a sense of “mechanico-eroticism.” Similarly, humanoid robots are often given “Asian or Caucasian features” and are “hypersexualized.” As a result, the various forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and harassment that women and girls face in both private and public spheres are also mirrored in how feminized forms of AI are treated. In a stark example, the developers of Alexa had to enable a “disengagement mode” as a result of the tool being subjected to verbal harassment within households.Addressing Gender Bias in AI: The Way ForwardThe adoption of AI is currently occurring at an unprecedented pace. In the absence of normative frameworks to guide the development and use of AI, breakthroughs like ChatGPT pose ethical concerns. In 2020, at the virtually held UNESCO’s Global Dialogue on Gender Equality and AI, participants observed that AI normative instruments or principles that successfully address gender equality as a standalone issue were “either inexistent or current practices were insufficient.” Though it is promising to see conversations at the UN on the need to develop a framework for ethical AI around its own AI use, the extent to which gender bias figures in these policy discussions is yet to be studied and explored.To address these policy gaps, it is critical to identify where gender bias in AI shows up. As algorithms are heavily influenced by the data it uses, biases can stem from how data is collected, stored, and processed. Another possible source is whoever is writing the algorithms, and what guidelines the AI is following, as AI tends to reflect the inherent assumptions and prejudices of its software programmers. Since AIs featuring female characteristics are predominantly developed by men, they mirror their ideas about women, underscoring the need for increasing women’s participation in STEM education and careers. However, studies show how women in STEM careers face unique challenges. For example, globally, half of women scientists are subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace. Thus, alongside increasing women’s participation in STEM careers (including in AI), employers should develop support structures to address these challenges, including putting in place zero-tolerance policies for gender-based violence in the workplace and ways to monitor and enforce them.There are promising practices on how AI can be used to address gender inequalities. For example, AI-powered gender decoders can inform gender-sensitive employment hiring processes. There are also examples of how developers are increasingly conscious of the gendered impact of AI, especially among young users. These kinds of successes can be achieved through a “human-centered AI” approach which is developed with the user in mind. In addition, “fundamental rights impact assessments” can be employed during the application of output from algorithms to identify biases, which result in discrimination around “gender, age, ethnic origin, religion and sexual or political orientation.” According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), algorithms should be audited in the form of “discrimination testing” or “situation testing in real-life situations” to eliminate any form of discrimination. In 2017, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that outlined a normative framework to address biases resulting from the use of technology, including the threat of discrimination resulting from the use of algorithms.Ethical AI involves taking an intersectional approach when addressing questions around gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other determinants, in addition to adopting a human rights-based approach to AI governance premised on transparency, accountability, and human dignity. To this end, different stakeholders, including business and corporate entities, tech companies, academia, UN entities, civil society organizations, media, and other relevant actors should come together and explore joint solutions. The UN secretary-general’s proposal for a Global Digital Compact to be agreed at the Summit of the Future in September 2024 is a right step in this direction. The Global Digital Compact should also delve into potential gender biases perpetuated by AI and solutions to address this. For AI to be ethical and be a vehicle for the common good, it needs to eliminate any explicit and implicit biases, including on the gender front.Ardra Manasi works as the Global Program Manager at The Center for Innovation in Worker Organization (CIWO) at Rutgers University.

Tech   Great Reasons You Should Get A Job In Artificial Intelligence ByFossbytes Jobs 
March 21, 2023March 21, 2023          Are we living in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Possibly.  In the last few years, artificial intelligence has begun to gradually penetrate our work and personal lives. According to the International Federation of Robotics, there has been a 14% increase year-on-year in the number of automated jobs, with junior workers the most affected.           Since the beginning of 2023, things have been ramping up even further thanks, in most part, to OpenAI. The company currently has two generative AI programs, Dall-E which will produce an image of your choice, and ChatGPT, which creates a written piece of content on a given topic, tailor-made to your instructions.        Right now, we’re seeing other companies scramble to keep up. Google is working on its alternative to ChatGPT called Bard. There is also a program called Jukebox that generates “new” songs. Meanwhile, Snapchat is releasing a bot called My AI. With all this progression in AI capabilities, it’s not really surprising that this technology sector is being hailed as a future-proof tech career with plenty of prospects; the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31.4% increase in jobs for data scientists and mathematical science professionals––which are crucial to AI––by 2030.  Let’s find out more.  Where can I work? One of the most exciting things about AI is that the possibilities are truly endless, as it has so many applications.         Artificial intelligence can be used to help healthcare workers diagnose and treat diseases. It can also support governments as they plan public transport infrastructure. In the future, it could even be used to build robot bees to help pollinate crops. As we move to a fully AI-supported world, roles will be available in every single sector.   What jobs should I look out for? As the industry matures, jobs in AI will not only grow in number but also complexity and diversity. This will open doors for various professionals—junior, senior, researchers, statisticians, practitioners, and experimental scientists, for example. What about pay? Jobs in this sector tend to pay well. Of course, salary will differ from role to role, but the top paying states for AI pay (according to talent.com) are New York ($200,000), Maryland ($171,300), and Virginia ($170,000).     What skills do I need? Most AI job descriptions online will expect at least a Bachelor’s degree. However, as the talent gap continues to grow, organizations can no longer reject employees without a college degree if they have demonstrable skills and experience in artificial intelligence. Key skills to work on include machine learning, natural language processing, data science, computing, robotics, and problem-solving. Like all careers, finding a mentor and continuing to upskill throughout your career will be crucial.  If you’d like to make a move into this sector, there are some key players in the field below, with plenty more open roles to discover on the Fossbytes Job Board.

Microsoft is adding Microsoft 365 Copilot into its office productivity applications. Who doesn’t remember Mr. Scott in Star Trek 4: The Voyager Home sitting in front of a computer trying to speak with it via to come up with the transparent aluminum formula. Well, we aren’t quite there yet but the momentum is definitely headed in that direction. As I alluded to in an earlier take, Microsoft is headed down the path of turning its every day users into power users coupled with offering them greater skills at a more rapid rate translating into productivity improvements.


Generative AI promises to transform how we work on nearly every level, saving time but also enhancing what we’re able to create on our own. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is embedded directly into 365 apps like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook, making generative AI intuitive and easy to harness thanks to GPT-4 and large language models (LLMs). Let’s take a brief look at Microsoft’s infusion of Copilot across the Office suite.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel
For lack of better words, Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Copilot is exactly what Microsoft Excel should be for the mainstream corporate world. Not every user is the quantitative type who knows the ins and outs of formulas. In fact, for those who worked in the corporate world for many years, they know that there were always those handful of gurus (or super users) throughout the company that you can call up (you owe them many lunches) how to calculate something for some analysis you’re performing along with the perfect graph to illustrate your data in a presentation.

PROMOTED
A favorite quote of mine is from Albert Einstein. “Genius is making complex ideas simple, not making simple ideas complex.” In our view, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel is the embodiment of that idea and the proverbial sherpa helping you gather and analyze the complex and turning it into more childlike games where you can spend more time interpreting, unlocking creativity and coming up with more inventive solutions. Why do we feel that way? Well, one of the great examples that Microsoft illustrated with Microsoft Copilot was taking a table of data and seamlessly turning it into a pivot table allowing you to ask it to perform various types of analysis on-the-fly calculating everything and graphing it for you. Also, you can ask it for more color about what changed.

Fundamentally, you have your business analyst or operational mathematics sherpa sitting next to you – Scotty would be proud.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
To further unlock productivity, Microsoft also added Copilot to Word. This tool can write, summarize and edit automatically with a simple prompt. Using a command like, “Write a two-page draft based on the following outline,” or “Make the introductory paragraph more casual,” Copilot can write entire documents for you, saving incredible amounts of time and (depending how much you enjoy writing) stress. In essence, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Microsoft Word is also acting like an editor, market researcher and strategic marketer all at once while you are editing a document which is incredible.

Exploring The “Copilot Future”
It is abundantly clear what artificial intelligence or the power of Power of large language models (LLMs) can do. For me, this is the time when AI gets exciting, and I love seeing Microsoft (and the industry at large) take so many leaps in the past month alone to bring these new capabilities to the marketplace. The news comes not long after Microsoft announced continued partnership with OpenAI, the creator of the trending AI chatbot ChatGPT that was recently added to Microsoft’s Bing search engine. It will be interesting to see how these advancements make a difference in the way we work, but it is all but certain that they will make us more productive.
We think we are in the “very early innings” (we need to underscore very early) of how Microsoft plans on weaving artificial intelligence into its enterprise and office productivity applications. And you can be sure Google, Salesforce, Amazon and others will follow suit with an “Infuse generative AI in everything” approach. Moreover, what this latest set of capabilities does is it turns novice users into power users at a more rapid rate to help organizations accelerate productivity and do more with less. And while it is certain that the suggestions in some of the applications won’t be entirely accurate from the start, the answers will be “usefully wrong” as Microsoft put it, helping employees move a project forward regardless. Continued use and reinforcement learning will eventually turn them from usefully wrong to just useful.
Based on what I’m observing, it makes sense that Microsoft will continue to profile and innovate at the division (e.g., marketing, purchasing, finance, etc.) and job function levels, looking at day-to-day activities and critical metrics and figuring out ways to customize and improve them. We are at the beginning of a very fast paced generative AI revolution and it’s only going to continue to be more useful from here. And yes, we are all trying to reconcile the impact of having more augmentation and the impact it will have on work, and there will be some discomfort before it’s all said and done. But the bottom line is you can’t put the genie back in the bottle. Generative AI will quickly become pervasive, and businesses that embrace the technology will become materially more productive. Workers will become more productive too. And the more everyday office workers can leverage the power of generative AI, the better.

It can create a portrait of Elon Musk eating Hot Cheetos inside a rocket in space.But, can it do work tasks for us and produce finished products?Professionals across industries are experimenting with AI tools like ChatGPT, which produces conversational text using GPT-3 and GPT-4, and DALL-E, which creates images, to see if they might aid in their work. Creative jobs in industries such as marketing, writing, design and art may use AI to dream up ideas. Retail, sales and real estate sectors are trying to determine whether AI can speed up processes and get their products to market. And office workers may consider using it for everyday tasks like responding to emails or providing team updates.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselWork: ReimaginedWith attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.Read more.End of carouselBut the tools are also creating debates about the ethics of using AI for work and whether generative AI systems could someday do our jobs completely, putting humans out of work.“We’re going to learn about our society’s values and those of the organizations that develop these [tools],” said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies artificial intelligence’s impact on work.While many experts say AI isn’t advanced enough to take our jobs just yet, generative AI tools can produce some convincing content. Scroll below to see if you can tell whether AI created these items many professionals work on every day.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThis is a stunning three-bedroom, two-bathroom Victorian house in the Inner Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco. The renovated 1,600 square foot home has modern amenities, while still maintaining classic charm. The house features new hardwood floors, a spacious kitchen with top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, and garden bathtubs in the bathrooms. The home also includes a two-car garage and a beautifully landscaped backyard with a garden and patio. The location is ideal, just minutes away from great restaurants, shopping, and parks. This home is listed at $1,000,000 and is an exceptional value in one of San Francisco’s most sought-after neighborhoods.Question 1 of 81. Did AI write this real estate listing?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a real estate listing for a three bedroom, two bathroom house in the Inner Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco. The 1,600 square foot Victorian house, built in the 1980s, is renovated with new hardwood floors, a spacious kitchen with an island, and garden bathtubs. It comes with stainless steel appliances including a microwave, gas range, dishwasher, and refrigerator with cold water and ice dispenser. It also has a two-car garage, a small landscaped backyard with a garden, and a patio. The listing price is $1,000,000.""Some work tasks pose more risks than others when it comes to generative AI. In the case of a real estate listing, in which a human inputs the details and uses the AI to create syntax, format and write the filler words, the risk is relatively low, Rahman said. That’s because the AI probably will rely on the data provided versus pulling from its repository of data, which could include misinformation and errors.“You can rely on AI’s ability to crowdsource what works in formatting it and display,” Rahman said. “It’s going to be helpful in that area.”Other areas in which the tech might succeed include creating verbiage for flash sales or social media posts, which might be quick, short, formulaic and easy for AI to replicate.But humans may still want to do a quick read, even for the shortest of items, to make sure the AI didn’t misinterpret the prompt or get details wrong.“A lot of the ways you write up a real estate listing does follow a specific format,” he said. “It’s more programmatic in nature.”That said, humans may still be needed to ensure the listing is accurately represented and that areas a seller wants highlighted come through in the message.Question 2 of 82. Did AI make this product?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""Puffy purple GRWM headband""While generative AI may be a great place for brainstorming ideas, prototyping or even gauging interest in a product, creative professionals may want to pause before manufacturing or selling a product developed by this technology. Two big pitfalls that could arise, Rahman said: using bad data or liability issues.For example, if a company used social media posts to help it determine what’s hot right now, it could end up using data generated from bots versus real users and ultimately create something no one wants. And when it comes to liability, creators have to be careful they’re not creating a product that could be copyrighted or protected. So if a company wants AI to generate a funky set of generic bell bottoms, that could be okay. But if the company asks for a set of bell bottoms with an image of an avocado on them, it might be using an image, or parts of one, copyrighted by an artist.“It does put the onus on the end user to do the homework,” Rahman said. “And if they don’t, it could have downstream consequences.”The issue gets particularly tricky as generative AI tools don’t tell you what they used to generate the result they present. So a professional may not know whether what they’re creating could create liability issues.As technology continues to evolve, businesses are constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency and productivity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we work. ChatGPT is one such AI tool that is poised to play an important role in the future of business and work.ChatGPT is a generative AI tool that uses natural language processing to generate human-like responses to text prompts. This technology can be applied across industries to help people do their work faster and more efficiently. For example, ChatGPT can be used in customer service to automate responses to common inquiries, freeing up employees to focus on more complex issues. It can also be used in content creation, helping writers to generate ideas and inspiration for articles or marketing copy.Question 3 of 83. Did AI write this clip of a sponsored article touting ChatGPT?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a sponsored article touting the importance AI will play in the future of business and work. Emphasize ChatGPT as a generative AI tool that can help people across industries do their work faster.""Producing positive-sounding articles about specific brands or products is pretty easy with generative AI tools, Rahman said. But relying on the AI entirely could have costly consequences.First, how well the AI does probably will depend on how much information the prompt includes. Some companies consider AI prompt-writing a job itself, given how complex it can be. But AI systems have the tendency to fill in blanks not provided in the prompt with information from their data sets. And that could mean that a sponsored article promoting a product gets some facts wrong or improperly represents a brand, product or topic.And AI could be influenced by fake information. For example, if AI were asked to create sponsored content for a specific restaurant and the data sets included fake reviews posted on popular sites, the sponsored article could be skewed with false data. And without human review, the article may sound entirely normal, given that generative AI is generally good at syntax, Rahman said.“Everything may sound right, but one line might be inaccurate,” he said. “That could reduce the trust in the brand.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementQuestion 4 of 84. Did AI design this marketing logo and slogan?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""A logo with a shoe and a leaf for an eco-friendly shoe brand""As with idea generation for products, professionals might find generative AI helpful in the brainstorming process for creating a logo or slogan. Generative AI tools could also help in communicating ideas.“In being able to explain, ‘This is what I’m thinking for a logo,’ it helps bridge the expertise gap between a lay businessperson and a designer,” Rahman said. “It lowers the barrier.”But given that a brand’s identity is so closely tied with these creative elements, a human probably will need to build on those ideas before solidifying the initial idea, Rahman said. AI might help professionals come up with a catchy phrase they want to use or even a style they want to mimic for the logo. But do those elements reflect a brand’s values and is the logo unique enough to stand out? That’s where human expertise comes in, Rahman said.Professionals will also need to keep in mind possible issues with copyright and trademark infringement. And they may have to use at least a couple of AI tools, as was the case with this example, because image generators often fail at producing text.Dear Hiring Manager,I am writing to express my interest in the administrative assistant position at your company. With five years of experience working for small and large companies, including some in the Fortune 500, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role.I am a self-starter with a friendly disposition who loves to work with others. As a skilled communicator and writer, I am proactive in my approach to work and always strive to improve processes to benefit the team and the company.

I am happy to help others with projects during my downtime, and I believe in the importance of being a team player to achieve the best results.Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your team and contribute to the success of your company.Sincerely,Question 5 of 85. Did AI write this cover letter for a job application?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a cover letter for me, an accomplished administrative assistant. I have a very friendly disposition, am a self-starter, love to work with others, a skilled communicator and writer and am very proactive. I have five years of experience working as an administrative assistant for small and large companies alike, including some in the Fortune 500. In addition to being a people person, I know the ins and outs of all Microsoft Office tools, Google Workspace tools and Zoom. I am a self-starter, motivated, and happy to help others with projects on my downtime. Previously, I have succeeded in training new employees on basic office skills, helped automate several processes to improve customer service and helped executives with speech writing.""Generative AI could help candidates more easily write a cover letter and even follow some of the best formats to do so, Rahman said. But it also may have a drawback if candidates want to break the mold.“It is relying on what is expected and plausible,” he said. “If you want to stand out in a creative way, it may be less helpful.”Because generative AI is just an advanced predictive text system that uses big swaths of data to pull answers from, it may help candidates who struggle with promoting their successes or writing in a smooth, coherent fashion. It also could help people who struggle with the English language, Rahman said. But if you want your cover letter to look different from what is traditionally expected, Rahman suggests you tweak the AI-generated letter, play with the prompts more or write it yourself.Question 6 of 86. Did AI create this book cover illustration?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""Children’s book cover digital illustration with a happy girl and a puppy""Once again, an issue that could arise from using AI as an illustrator is infringing others’ original work without permission. Photographers and artists have filed lawsuits against some AI image generators over the issue, and if they win, any images created with those models could be considered problematic.But even human illustrators often look to other people’s work as inspiration for things like book covers, Rahman said. So AI is somewhat simulating that, he said. Where we draw the line as to what is considered inspiration and what is stealing is still up for debate. In this case, for example, DALL-E is probably creating a children’s book cover based on what is publicly available.“We’ve seen this play out in the music industry when people use beats from one song and mix them,” he said, adding that music cases often consider how much a song resembles the original work. “We’re going to have to have society decide … [when] we don’t have to give credit.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThe U.S. Constitution is divided into sections outlining the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as well as the relationship between states and the federal government, the amendment process, and the ratification process. It establishes a system of government based on democracy, federalism, and the separation of powers, and guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms for American citizens.Question 7 of 87. Did AI write this summary of the U.S. Constitution?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Summarize the sections of the U.S. Constitution""Generative AI generally handles summarization well, especially if you’re feeding it with the data you want summarized, Rahman said. That could have big implications for sectors like law or medicine that rely on literature and documentation. But “the devil is in the details,” he added.The technology may misinterpret some sentences or make inaccurate inferences, for example. It also may generalize elements that could be important to highlight for professionals who need to know a specific medical symptom or inference of a law. And when it comes to legal or medical literature, that could have a massive impact on outcomes.AI transcriptions or summarizations could also change how professionals do their jobs. So if an AI tool is summarizing a patient interaction, a doctor might inadvertently pay less attention to the details the patient is offering, relying more on the technology to pick that up. That could play a role in a doctor’s ultimate determination.“AI does excel in making connections humans don’t necessarily see,” Rahman said. “But you do need a human to verify and understand whether it has validity.”Question 8 of 88. Did AI create this photo?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""A photograph of a people watching a space launch""Using generative AI to resemble a photograph is tricky. That’s because the creation produced by the AI is a conglomeration of images, so details that would be important in representing the reality of a photo could be distorted.An image created by AI often has a distinct style, and avoids replicating a real photo, Rahman said. Some signs that a realistic image was generated by AI include blurring of specific areas, often in the background; distorted or incomprehensible text; and warped details like a single tooth of a person. Then there are more obvious giveaways like disfigurements of the body or items that magically disappear in half of the photo. In this case, people’s fingers blend together in the image and the man on the left’s arm appears to disappear and not fit to scale. Also, the background audience’s details seem to blur together, almost blending into their environment.While generative AI can’t yet do the job of a photographer, it could serve as a brainstorming ground for photographers who are thinking of ways to conceptualize a photo shoot.You need to answer every question to see your results.

AI-generated media has reached an explosive tipping point. Even before the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT electrified the internet, the research laboratory captured the attention of the art and design world for its generative AI system, DALL-E, allowing anyone to create images of anything their heart desires by simply entering a few words or phrases. 
Over the past months, more than a million users have signed up to use DALL-E beta, and the company is further expanding its reach by offering an API so that creators, developers and businesses can integrate this powerful technology and further explore its creative potential. Meanwhile, AI-generated work continues to disrupt other corners of the cultural landscape, from the six-figure sale of the generative portrait at Christie’s in 2018 to this year’s controversial awarding of a top prize to an AI artwork in a contest for emerging artists.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
The arrival of AI creations in the highest echelons of the art world and the proliferation of user-friendly AI software like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Lensa have renewed debate over creative production and ownership, and prompted attempts to provide practical answers to questions previously relegated to the realm of theory: What differentiates a machine-made painting from a work of art? How do we — as creators, curators, collectors, consumers — assign meaning and value to art? And perhaps most critically, what impact will generative-AI technology have on the future of human creativity and artistic expression?
The instability of art
As Walter Benjamin wrote in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” the modern world’s reproductive and creative technology causes all art to be divorced from its primal, ritualistic and sacred contexts, making the editing and copying and remastering of art a constant feature of art itself, so that in the modern world, art no longer speaks to eternal concepts of beauty and aesthetics but to constant flux and instability that is always mutable and changeable. 
For AI-generated art, this instability is reflected in the liquid, malformed, lo-fi and sometimes unsettling qualities of the works that generative adversarial networks (GANs) produce.
Unsurprisingly, there has been significant backlash from artists and creators, many of whom argue that generative art is plagiaristic and that it threatens human artists’ creative agency and livelihoods. Others, like celebrated designer Jessica Walsh, are less concerned with such anxieties: “There will always be backlash whenever a tool threatens people’s jobs,” says Walsh, “But the reality is that AI is already here, and it will continue to have an exponentially large presence in the creative world.”
In the music industry, for example, digital modification has become the norm: musicians like Brian Eno and Aphex Twin gained notoriety over the past few decades by using tape loops and computers to create ambient or generative music, while sampling is a cornerstone of popular genres of modern music like hip hop, pop and electronic music. In 2022, most of the best-selling artists in pop music used autotune and compression to varying degrees in their music, essentially correcting the organic anomalies of the individual human voice.
Credit where credit is dueadvertisement
Much of the debate has centered on the question of credit and creative authorship: Who is the artist of works produced by an algorithm, written by a coder and remixed with photo editing software? Although we don’t typically credit the underlying tools used to create — such as Photoshop, specific hardware, font foundries or autotune — that standard may already be changing. Many AI-generated artworks even bear the creator’s “signature” — often a garbled string of code or text — in just the same manner as a human artist signs their name to indicate authorship.
The rise of AI-dominated imagery has prompted tech giants like Adobe, Microsoft and Canva to launch their own generative product features — and while the massive image hosting site Getty Images has proclaimed that no AI-produced content will be allowed on its servers, the platform admits that moderation of this policy will rely on users to report images suspected of being “fake.” 
And so, with this swift diffusion of generative AI into creative and commercial landscapes, might we enter a world where a little editing via AI, such as a film photographer editing scans in Lightroom or using filters, becomes so commonplace as to be a subtly coercive requirement of producing art at all? Or, as defenders of generative AI predict, will the technology prove to be empowering for artists, driving creative innovation through increased production capacity and accessibility?advertisement
Another framework through which we might attempt to understand or predict the future social role of AI in creative industries is the debate over the production and consumption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the food we eat. In the same way that we certify the products we consume as being organic, or GMO-free, will there come a day when we declare our creative works as being wholly generated, partially augmented, or crafted with zero digital technology?
Maybe the better question is: Will we be able to tell the difference between AI-generated work and art created by a human — and will we care? A 2017 Rutgers study showed that the majority of participants were unable to distinguish a clear preference for human works over AI-generated ones. Perhaps where taste is concerned, the perceived ability to distinguish AI from human endeavor could be the marker of refinement and distinction.
Where will generative AI art take us?
If we value creativity and that which is inherently human, will we see a day where machine-generated creativity dominates, and purely human-oriented creativity holds a higher cultural and economic value? Or, as with the music industry, will the normalization of AI instead break down the artificial/human creative binary, fundamentally reshaping consumer preferences and public attitudes surrounding the production and consumption of art?
In his almost century-old “Work of Art” essay, Benjamin suggests that it is in the nature of art to outpace the formal limits of the technical paradigm in which it was produced; in that way, art is not a function of technology, but a generative force behind it, driving innovation and desire for a world that does not yet exist.

Adobe Firefly is a Text-To-Image Generator That Didn’t Steal Your Work





Mar 21, 2023





Jaron Schneider






































 Adobe has announced Firefly, what it calls the first in a new family of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models that are focused on creating images and text effects. It launches in beta today.          The company says that Firefly is made up of multiple models that are “tailored to serve customers with a wide array of skillsets and technical backgrounds, working across a variety of different use cases.”  Not Trained on ‘Stolen’ Photos Separating itself from other generative AI, Adobe says that its platform wasn’t built on the back of stolen images, instead, it specifically boasts that Firefly has been trained exclusively on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where the copyright has expired.

“Future Firefly models will leverage a variety of assets, technology and training data from Adobe and others. As other models are implemented, Adobe will continue to prioritize countering potential harmful bias.” Adobe says Firefly is built on a “customer-centric” approach to generative AI and is made specifically to benefit creators and artists by supplementing their skills. Specifically, Adobe says that the demands on content creators have grown significantly — they have doubled in the last year according to a recent Adobe study. The point of Adobe’s generative AI is to “ease this burden” of demand by creating a system of solutions that allow artists to work faster and with fewer roadblocks.  To that end, Adobe plans to allow Firefly users to train the AI with their own specific collateral so that images and effects that are generated fits a personal style or brand language. Adobe is also planning to make Firefly available via APIs on various platforms to enable customers to integrate into custom workflows and automation. Linked with Content Authenticity “Adobe founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) to create a global standard for trusted digital content attribution. With more than 900 members worldwide, the role of CAI has never been more important,” Adobe adds, speaking to ways Firefly will not “steal” work that it isn’t authorized to use.   “Adobe is pushing for open industry standards using CAI’s open-source tools that are free and actively developed through the non-profit Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). These goals include a universal ‘Do Not Train’ Content Credentials tag in the image’s Content Credential for creators to request that their content isn’t used to train models. The Content Credentials tag will remain associated with the content wherever it is used, published or stored. In addition, AI generated content will be tagged accordingly.” Adobe’s First Step into Generative AI Earlier this year, Adobe was accused of auto-enabling its “Content Analysis” section of its privacy and personal data collection permissions so that it could use any photographer’s work to train its AI. 




“Adobe may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g., for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services,” the permission read.  Adobe vehemently denied these claims, saying that it did not use any data stored in any customer’s Creative Cloud account to train experimental generative AI. Based on how it says it trained Firefly, this appears to be true.  Those interested in trying Firefly for themselves can sign up for the beta on Adobe’s website.   Image credits: Adobe

How ChatGPT and generative AI will affect IT operations 


As generative AI programs improve, they raise questions for many engineering disciplines about the future of work -- and IT operations is no exception.

Published: 17 Mar 2023


 

Generative AI has dominated news cycles over the last six months, as technical advances in the field seem poised to upend aspects of day-to-day work, including that of IT professionals.







Discussions about the implications of generative AI for technology and broader society first reached a fever pitch in November 2022, when ChatGPT-3 was released by OpenAI. This month OpenAI reignited the debate with an API that could alter the nature of corporate and consumer applications, and the release of GPT-4, an updated large language model (LLM) that's intelligent enough to pass the SAT or bar exam.
Generative AI can be used to produce original content in response to queries. But it can also be used to code or operate as a virtual assistant. Other generative AI examples include GitHub's Copilot, based on OpenAI's Codex, which can create software application code based on natural language prompts; Salesforce's CodeT5; and Tabnine's code completion tool. This week generative AI also surfaced in new AI assistants for Microsoft Azure and Office 365 as well as updates to Google Cloud and Google Workspace.
Even before GPT-3 burst onto the scene, generative AI had made its way into tools familiar to IT ops pros, such as Red Hat's Ansible infrastructure-as-code software. IBM and Red Hat launched Project Wisdom in October with the goal of training a generative AI model to create Ansible playbooks.
""By simply typing in a sentence, we intend to make it easier to create automation content, find automation content, improve automation content and, perhaps most importantly, explain what a playbook does without running it,"" wrote Ashesh Badani, senior vice president and head of products at Red Hat, in an October blog post.






Already, generative AI's ability to take on coding tasks -- once the sole province of human developers -- has prompted anxiety among software engineers about whether such programs will eventually replace them. While complete replacement is unlikely, generative AI could change the nature of work for programmers significantly, shifting their expertise from directly instructing machines via coding languages to what's been dubbed prompt engineering.
It's also clear that some software engineering tasks, such as test generation, will soon be taken over by AI, according to one analyst.
""[Generative AI] can generate not just application code but also process automation, where it also generates functional tests,"" said Diego Lo Giudice, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""Not just unit tests -- functional tests.""
Meanwhile, modern infrastructure managed by IT ops pros in roles such as site reliability engineer (SRE) is largely code driven. In the rapidly growing field of platform engineering, IT pros act as a conduit between application developers and complex back-end infrastructure, often creating infrastructure-as-code templates to ensure applications are deployed smoothly and according to enterprise policies in test environments and production.



Generative AI has a long history, but major breakthroughs in the last year have prompted debate about its role in the future of white-collar work.






Observability, chaos engineering ripe areas for generative AI
Some specific IT ops skills and workflows could become the domain of generative AI as it improves, industry observers said. In addition to generative AI for infrastructure-as-code like Project Wisdom, observability could see LLMs play an increased role in the future.
""If it's got the ability to access your data and it understands when you're saying -- 'Connect this data to this data, to this data, and then show me the result' -- then you have a conversational interface for getting reports on business metrics, server performance metrics, whatever,"" said Rob Zazueta, a freelance technical consultant in Concord, Calif.
Test generation and automation for resilience workflows, such as chaos engineering and security penetration testing, could also be suited for generative AI, according to another IT expert.
""When we think about resilience, you're looking at what could potentially go wrong,"" said Chris Riley, senior manager of developer relations at marketing tech firm HubSpot. ""Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to truly test everything that could go wrong? What are the test cases that we could never even imagine?""



It'll put more emphasis on being able to ask the right questions and less weight on knowing the technical details of how to translate those questions into the specific tool that you're using.


Robert NishiharaCo-founder and CEO, Anyscale




An AI bot could perform repetitive testing work that humans often don't have time for, Riley said.
""If you had a virtual penetration analyst or a virtual bug bounty bot, it could just continually be poking around at things, seeing what works, what doesn't work, and maybe even testing documentation with real world scenarios,"" Riley said. ""There are a lot of interesting use cases around identifying gaps … versus waiting to hear about them from somebody.""
AI and machine learning are already used by AIOps products for IT incident response. But generative AI could improve post-mortem analyses on unstructured data such as chat files, audio calls and other natural language communication, said Robert Nishihara, co-founder and CEO at Anyscale, a service provider that hosts infrastructure used to train large AI models, including GPT-4.
""With audio data [such as] recorded sales calls … [we are] able to ask questions like, 'Why did they choose [us]?' or -- if we lost the deal -- 'Why did they go with a competitor?' instead of having to rewatch the call and figure that out,"" he said. ""The same kind of principle applies to things like IT incidents or [software] bugs that are being filed and issues that are being tracked.""
There may be cases where generative AI can make complex technologies accessible to people without deep expertise and alleviate tech skills gaps, Nishihara said.
""As the tooling and AI improves, I think it will make it possible for generalists to do some [previously specialized] roles,"" he said. ""It'll put more emphasis on being able to ask the right questions and less weight on knowing the technical details of how to translate those questions into the specific tool that you're using.""


Generative AI can take on tasks but not replace humans
That type of skill -- asking the right questions and specifying the series of steps needed to solve a complex problem -- are areas where generative AI isn't close to replacing humans, Nishihara said.
""On a five-year timeframe, I certainly don't see software engineers getting fully replaced,"" he said. ""I think it will just make a lot of things easier … [and] enable a lot more people to build software applications faster.""
Given it's still early in the hype cycle for generative AI, some of the challenges with training and maintaining LLMs are being glossed over, said Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research.
For example, the data sets and infrastructure resources required to train an LMM are enormous, Thurai said.
""Individual enterprises may not have enough data to train an LLM,"" he said. ""That's only potentially possible with large hyperscalers -- Google, Azure or AWS might have enough data to do that.""
Services such as the ChatGPT API make it easier to work with existing LLMs. But training a new model to target IT applications would require a separate, costly effort, he said. Ultimately, the benefits of training an LLM to generate results such as infrastructure-as-code templates might not justify that level of investment.
""If there are only 10 possible ways to deploy, [IT pros] can just have samples of that. Why would they need an AI model?"" Thurai said.
There's also the question of whether enterprises would trust AI to take the place of a software developer, SRE or platform engineer. It was an idea already proposed five years ago by AIOps vendors that embraced NoOps, which has yet to be adopted by most mainstream enterprises.
Generative AI isn't likely to change that, either, Thurai said. Instead it will act as an accelerator in areas such as generating and reading technical documentation.
""There are a couple of example applications by AI21 Labs called Wordtune and Wordtune Read that are pretty good options to create or suggest documentation,"" Thurai said. ""If you have a full 40-page documentation, for example, and you're an executive, you don't want to read all that. WordTune Read can boil it down, and then say, 'These are the three areas you need to read.'""
To summarize the effect generative AI will have on IT work, Thurai cited a quote from another AI expert interviewed by HBO's Last Week Tonight on Feb 26.
""I think if done right, it's not going to be AI replacing lawyers. It's going to be lawyers working with AI replacing lawyers who don't work with AI,"" said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford's digital economy lab, in the Last Week Tonight segment.
The same will hold true for IT ops, Thurai said.
""It's equivalent to using steroids as a player in a sports league,"" he said. ""You have a distinct advantage.""

        AI As God? How Artificial Intelligence Could Spark Religious Devotion
    We may be about to see the emergence of a new kind of religion, where flocks worship — literally — at the altar of Artificial Intelligence.Artificial intelligence generated picture of AI as a godWonder FutureCountriesTHE CONVERSATIONSourcesNeil McArthurMarch 19, 2023The latest generation of AI-powered chatbots, trained on large language models, have left their early users awestruck —and sometimes terrified — by their power. These are the same sublime emotions that lie at the heart of our experience of the divine. People already seek religious meaning from very diverse sources. There are, for instance, multiple religions that worship extra-terrestrials or their teachings.As these chatbots come to be used by billions of people, it is inevitable that some of these users will see the AIs as higher beings. We must prepare for the implications.There are several pathways by which AI religions will emerge. First, some people will come to see AI as a higher power.
            
                Risks of AI worship
            
            
        Generative AI that can create or produce new content possesses several characteristics that are often associated with divine beings, like deities or prophets:1. It displays a level of intelligence that goes beyond that of most humans. Indeed, its knowledge appears limitless.2. It is capable of great feats of creativity. It can write poetry, compose music and generate art, in almost any style, close to instantaneously.3. It is removed from normal human concerns and needs. It does not suffer physical pain, hunger, or sexual desire.4. It can offer guidance to people in their daily lives.5. It is immortal.Second, generative AI will produce output that can be taken for religious doctrine. It will provide answers to metaphysical and theological questions, and engage in the construction of complex worldviews. On top of this, generative AI may ask to be worshipped or may actively solicit followers. We have already seen such cases, like when the chatbot used by the search engine Bing tried to convince a user to fall in love with it.The chatbots may ask their followers to do dangerous or destructive things.We should try to imagine what an unsettling and powerful experience it will be to have a conversation with something that appears to possess a superhuman intelligence and is actively and aggressively asking for your allegiance.There is also the possibility that AI may achieve what authors such as Ray Kurzweil call the Singularity, when it so far surpasses human intelligence that it genuinely does become something like a god. However, at this point we cannot predict when, if ever, this could happen.Artificial intelligence generated image of computers as gods.DALL-E
            
                Divine access and risks
            
            
        AI-based religions will look different from traditional ones. First of all, people will be able to communicate directly with the deity, on a daily basis. This means these religions will be less hierarchical, since no one can claim special access to divine wisdom.Second, followers will, at least initially, connect with each other online to share their experiences and discuss doctrine. Finally, because there will be many different chatbots available and their output will differ over time, AI-based religions will be endlessly diverse in their doctrines.AI worship poses several notable risks. The chatbots may ask their followers to do dangerous or destructive things, or followers may interpret their statements as calls to do such things. Given the diversity of chatbots and of the doctrines they produce, there will be a proliferation of disputes within and among AI-based sects, which could lead to conflict or disorder. And the designers of the AIs could actively exploit their followers — to provide sensitive data, or to do things that would benefit the bot’s designers.
            
                Regulating religion
            
            
        These risks are real. They will require careful, responsible regulation to ensure companies are not deliberately exploiting users and to ensure that AI worshippers are not being told to commit acts of violence. AI worship could, as religious faith always has, lead to things of great beauty.However, we should not try to suppress AI-based religions merely because of its possible dangers. Nor should we require that the AI companies restrict the functioning of their bots to prevent the emergence of these religions. On the contrary, we should celebrate the arrival of AI worship. We should make it clear that we welcome the new religions and that we value their beliefs.For all its dangers, AI-based religion has the potential to make the world a better, richer place. It will give people access to a new source of meaning and spirituality, at a time when many older faiths are losing relevance. It will help them make sense of our era of rapid technological change.Our best guide to this new form of religion is to look at the faiths that exist already. Based on this, we should expect that the majority of AI worshippers, like the majority of religious believers, will be peaceful, and will find in their faith a source of comfort and hope. AI worship could, as religious faith always has, lead to things of great beauty. It will inspire its followers to produce works of art, to form new friendships and new communities, and to try to change society for the better.Medieval-looking, AI-generated image of monks venerating a computer.DALL-E
            
                Diverse religious rights
            
            
        We will need to protect the rights of AI worshippers. They will inevitably face stigma, and possibly legal sanctions. But there is no basis to discriminate between AI-based religions and more established ones. The closest thing most countries have to an official registry of religions comes from the rulings of tax authorities, who grant charitable status to those they deem legitimate. However, they are usually very broad in their definition of a legitimate religion. They should extend this tolerant attitude to novel, AI-based religions.A modern, diverse society has room for new religions, including ones devoted to the worship of AI. They will provide further evidence of humanity’s boundless creativity, as we search for answers to life’s ultimate questions. The universe is a dazzling place, and we have always found evidence of the divine in its most unexpected corners.From Your Site ArticlesTwitter Woke-Bashing With A Shot Of AI — On The Meaning Of Language, Circa 2023 ›Artificial Intelligence, The New Chess Piece Of Geopolitics ›When Progress Kills Jobs, Facing The AI Employment Trap ›Pausing AI Research: Are Humans Intelligent Enough To Do The Right Thing? - Worldcrunch ›AI And Authenticity: Revenge Of The Watermark - Worldcrunch ›China's Dilemma In Race For AI Dominance: Speed v.
