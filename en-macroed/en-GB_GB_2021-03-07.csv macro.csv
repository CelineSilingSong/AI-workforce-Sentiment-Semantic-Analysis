AI, or artificial intelligence, seems to be on the tip of everyone’s tongue these days. While I’ve been aware of this major trend in tech development for a while, I’ve noticed AI appearing more and more as one of the most in-demand areas of expertise for job seekers.


I’m sure that for many of us, the term “AI” conjures up sci-fi fantasies or fear about robots taking over the world. The depictions of AI in the media have run the gamut, and while no one can predict exactly how it will evolve in the future, the current trends and developments paint a much different picture of how AI will become part of our lives. 

In reality, AI is already at work all around us, impacting everything from our search results, to our online dating prospects, to the way we shop. Data shows that the use of AI in many sectors of business has grown by 270% over the last four years.

PROMOTED
But what will AI mean for the future of work? As computers and technology have evolved, this has been one of the most pressing questions. As with many technological developments throughout history, the advancement of artificial intelligence has created fears that human workers will become obsolete. 

The reality is probably a lot less dire, but maybe even more complicated. 
What is AI?

Before we do a deep dive on the ways in which AI will impact the future of work, it’s important to start simple: what is AI? A straightforward definition from Britannica states that artificial intelligence is “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.”

“AI” has become a catchall term to describe any advancements in computing, systems and technology in which computer programs can perform tasks or solve problems that require the kind of reason we associate with human intelligence, even learning from past processes.

This ability to learn is a key component of AI. Algorithms, like the dreaded Facebook algorithm that replaced all our friends with sponsored content, are often associated with AI. But there is a key distinction.
As software journalist Kaya Ismail writes, an algorithm is simply a “set of instructions,” a formula for processing data. AI takes this to another level, and can be made up of a set of algorithms that have the capacity to change and rewrite themselves in response to the data inputted, hence displaying “intelligence.”
AI will probably not make human workers obsolete, at least not for a long time 
To put some of your fears to bed: the robots are probably not coming for your jobs, at least not yet. 
Given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, in particular in some of our favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that AI will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce. After all, as technology has advanced, many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated. It’s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it. 
But, I don’t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic. A recent paper published by the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence And The Future of Work,” looked closely at developments in AI and their relation to the world of work. The paper paints a more optimistic picture. 
Rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor, the paper predicts that AI will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs.
While AI has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks, there are still major limitations. In particular, AI programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence, meaning they can solve only one problem, and execute only one task at a time. Often, they can be rigid, and unable to respond to any changes in input, or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming. 
Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” with the kind of problem solving, abstract thinking and critical judgement that will continue to be important in business. Human judgement will be relevant, if not in every task, then certainly throughout every level across all sectors. 
There are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in AI. AI often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data, calling into question the availability of the right kind of data, and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data. There is also the limitation of computation and processing power. The cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model AI was estimated at $4.6 million. 
Another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias, and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data. If there is bias in the data that is inputted into an AI, this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the AI. 
There has even been a bill introduced into Congress entitled the Algorithmic Accountability Act with the goal of forcing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the use of any new AI technology for the potential to perpetuate bias. 
Based on these factors and many others, the MIT CCI paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which AI is comparable to human intelligence, and could theoretically replace human workers entirely.  
Provided there is investment at all levels, from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—AI has the potential to ultimately create more jobs, not less. The question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity. 
This paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into AI and the many potential directions in which it may lead.
AI Is becoming standard in all businesses, not just in the world of tech
A couple times recently, AI has come up in conversation with a client or an associate, and I’m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it. There seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world.
In case you hadn’t noticed, the tech world is the world these days. Don’t ever forget when economist Paul Krugman said in 1998 that “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” You definitely don’t want to be behind the curve when it comes to AI. 
In fact, 90% of leading businesses already have ongoing investment in AI technologies. More than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of AI-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity.
AI is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular:
Medical:
The potential benefits of utilizing AI in the field of medicine are already being explored. The medical industry has a robust amount of data, which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare. Additionally, AI has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts. 
Automotive:
We’re already seeing how AI is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation. AI will also have a major impact on manufacturing, including within the automotive sector. 
Cybersecurity:
Cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders, especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020. Attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home, on less secure technological systems and Wi-Fi networks. AI and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. AI will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance, given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud. 
E-Commerce:
AI will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future, in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution. We can expect that moving forward, AI will continue to drive e-commerce, including through the use of chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation.
AI can have a big impact on the job search
If you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application, you might be in for a rude awakening. AI already plays a major role in the hiring process, so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system, or ATS, before they even reach a human being.  
In the past, recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates. Data from LinkedIn shows that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one successful hire. 
Increasingly, however, resume scanning is being done by AI-powered programs. In 2018, 67% of hiring managers stated that AI was making their jobs easier.
Despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, many have been critical of the use of certain types of AI by hiring managers, based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring. 
One particular example is illustrated by HireVue, a startup whose initial services included technology which aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice. HireVue discontinued use of facial recognition software in early 2021, and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing.
It’s clear that the use of certain types of AI in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops. However, if potential employers are using AI to process your application, there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage. 


Jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager. By comparing your resume to a job description, Jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position, with the goal of “beating” an application tracking system (ATS). 
Jobseer is a browser add-on, and another great AI-based tool for those on the job market. Based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs, Jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience. For each listing, you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting, as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience.
Rezi: Now, as a disclaimer, I would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot. But Rezi is an awesome AI-based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems. This is a great jumping off point to kickstart a new resume.  Another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume, and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up, and identify some areas for improvement. 


AI is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career, or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market, especially when you consider that AI will have such far-reaching impacts across many industries.
AI and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today's job market. Jobs requesting AI or machine-learning skills are expected to increase by 71% in the next five years. If you’d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena, consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on AI skills. 
If you are tech savvy, it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the AI space. If your skills lie elsewhere, it is important to recognize that AI will have a big impact, and to the extent of your abilities, you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors. 
AI is definitely here to stay, whether we like it or not. Personally, I don’t think we have anything to be afraid of. The best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us, AI included.

SmithPublished Feb. 23, 2021Updated March 9, 2021This article is part of our new series, Currents, which examines how rapid advances in technology are transforming our lives.I wake up in the middle of the night. It’s cold.“Hey, Google, what’s the temperature in Zone 2,” I say into the darkness. A disembodied voice responds: “The temperature in Zone 2 is 52 degrees.” “Set the heat to 68,” I say, and then I ask the gods of artificial intelligence to turn on the light.Many of us already live with A.I., an array of unseen algorithms that control our Internet-connected devices, from smartphones to security cameras and cars that heat the seats before you’ve even stepped out of the house on a frigid morning.But, while we’ve seen the A.I. sun, we have yet to see it truly shine.Researchers liken the current state of the technology to cellphones of the 1990s: useful, but crude and cumbersome. They are working on distilling the largest, most powerful machine-learning models into lightweight software that can run on “the edge,” meaning small devices such as kitchen appliances or wearables. Our lives will gradually be interwoven with brilliant threads of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOur interactions with the technology will become increasingly personalized. Chatbots, for example, can be clumsy and frustrating today, but they will eventually become truly conversational, learning our habits and personalities and even develop personalities of their own. But don’t worry, the fever dreams of superintelligent machines taking over, like HAL in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” will remain science fiction for a long time to come; consciousness, self-awareness and free will in machines are far beyond the capabilities of science today.Privacy remains an issue, because artificial intelligence requires data to learn patterns and make decisions. But researchers are developing methods to use our data without actually seeing it — so-called federated learning, for example — or encrypt it in ways that currently can’t be hacked.Our homes and our cars will increasingly be watched over with A.I.-integrated sensors. Some security cameras today use A.I.-enabled facial recognition software to identify frequent visitors and detect strangers. But soon, networks of overlapping cameras and sensors will create a mesh of “ambient intelligence,” that will be available to monitor us all the time, if we want it. Ambient intelligence could recognize changes in behavior and prove a boon to older adults and their families.“Intelligent systems will be able to understand the daily activity patterns of seniors living alone, and catch early patterns of medically relevant information,” said Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University computer science professor and a co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence who was instrumental in sparking the current A.I. revolution. While she says much work remains to be done to address privacy concerns, such systems could detect signs of dementia, sleep disorders, social isolation, falls and poor nutrition, and notify caretakers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStreaming services such as Netflix or Spotify already use A.I. to learn your preferences and feed you a steady diet of enticing entertainment. Google Play uses A.I. to recommend mood music that matches the time and weather. A.I. is being used to bring old films into focus and bring black-and-white into color and even add sound to silent movies. It’s also improving streaming speed and consistency. Those spinning animations that indicate a computer is stuck on something may soon be a relic of the past that people will recall with fondness, the way many of us do with TV “snow” today.Increasingly, more of the media we consume will actually be generated by A.I. Google’s open-source Magenta project has created an array of applications that make music indistinguishable from human composers and performers.The research institute OpenAI has created MuseNet, which uses artificial intelligence to blend different styles of music into new compositions. The institute also has Jukebox, which creates new songs when given a genre, artist and lyrics, which in some cases are co-written by A.I.These are early efforts, achieved by feeding millions of songs into networks of artificial neurons, made from strings of computer code, until they internalize patterns of melody and harmony, and can recreate the sound of instruments and voices.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMusicians are experimenting with these tools today and a few start-ups are already offering A.I.-generated background music for podcasts and video games.Artificial intelligence is as abstract as thought, written in computer code, but people imagine A.I. embodied in humanoid form. Robotic hardware has a lot of catching up to do, however. Realistic, A.I.-generated avatars will have A.I.-generated conversations and sing A.I.-generated songs, and even teach our children. Deepfakes also exist, where the face and voice of one person, for example, is transposed onto a video of another. We’ve also seen realistic A.I.-generated faces of people who don’t exist.Researchers are working on combining the technologies to create realistic 2D avatars of people who can interact in real time, showing emotion and making context-relevant gestures. A Samsung-associated company called Neon has introduced an early version of such avatars, though the technology has a long way to go before it is practical to use.Such avatars could help revolutionize education. Artificial intelligence researchers are already developing A.I. tutoring systems that can track student behavior, predict their performance and deliver content and strategies to both improve that performance and prevent students from losing interest. A.I. tutors hold the promise of truly personalized education available to anyone in the world with an Internet-connected device — provided they are willing to surrender some privacy.“Having a visual interaction with a face that expresses emotions, that expresses support, is very important for teachers,” said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and the founder of Mila, an artificial intelligence research institute. Korbit, a company founded by one of his students, Iulian Serban, and Riiid, based in South Korea, are already using this technology in education, though Mr. Bengio says it may be a decade or more before such tutors have natural language fluidity and semantic understanding.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are seemingly endless ways in which artificial intelligence is beginning to touch our lives, from discovering new materials to new drugs — A.I. has already played a role in the development of Covid-19 vaccines by narrowing the field of possibilities for scientists to search — to picking the fruit we eat and sorting the garbage we throw way. Self-driving cars work, they’re just waiting for laws and regulations to catch up with them.Artificial intelligence is even starting to write software and may eventually write more complex A.I. Diffblue, a start-up out of Oxford University, has an A.I. system that automates the writing of software tests, a task that takes up as much as a third of expensive developers’ time. Justin Gottschlich, who runs the machine programming research group at Intel Labs, envisions a day when anyone can create software simply by telling an A.I. system clearly what they want the software to do.“I can imagine people like my mom creating software,” he said, “even though she can’t write a line of code.”Craig S.

How do you manage ever-growing amounts of human rights guidance, including almost 180,000 individual observations and recommendations from UN human rights mechanisms, and ensure easy access to everyone, including the general public, governments, NGOs and UN agencies? At the same time, how do you ensure this guidance has a real and positive impact on human rights worldwide?
One of the solutions, for UN Human Rights, lay in an innovative partnership with the Danish Institute of Human Rights and a Danish social enterprise called Specialisterne (“The Specialists”), an organisation which works with consultants on the autism spectrum who are skilled in solving challenging data puzzles.
When the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015, one of UN Human Rights’ aims was to make human rights guidance available to inform the national policies needed to implement them.
The result is that today, the Universal Human Rights Index (UHRI), the world’s largest and most comprehensive human rights database of guidance from the human rights mechanisms, is being powered by artificial intelligence, showing the links between this guidance and the SDGs.
Prior to this, the tens of thousands of observations and recommendations the Universal Periodic Review, Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures were being manually tagged, with OHCHR staff spending hours, days, weeks and months analysing and inputting information.
While this work is gradually being replaced by artificial intelligence, Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, Director of Human Rights Council and Treaty Mechanisms Division at UN Human Rights, explains that “While we are expecting to save thousands of hours in manual work, human rights experts will continue to undertake quality checks at every stage, which in turn further refines the precision of the algorithm.”
A common goal to make human rights more accessible 
The partnership between UN Human Rights, the Danish Institute of Human Rights and Specialisterne began in 2017. It brought together a great diversity of skills, knowledge and approaches.
“We are talking about a level of information that no one human being can possibly digest,” says Birgitte Feiring, Director of Human Rights and Sustainable Development at the Danish Institute for Human Rights. “In pulling together these three very different organisations, at the end of the day, our common goal is to make human rights more accessible to rights holders, and to help them bring governments to account.”
For Feiring, the new algorithm makes human rights analysis, programming and planning much easier for governments. “When governments have to design a plan for sustainable development, for example, or for sustainable recovery from COVID-19, in a few clicks, they can find out what are the human rights problems facing older persons, or what the issues are related to access to healthcare and vaccines. They are also directed to the solutions, as advised by the various human rights mechanisms.”
The brain behind the algorithm
The individual who developed the algorithm – called ‘TextClassify’ – is physicist Niels Jørgen Kjær. Previously employed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the capacity of High Energy Physicist, he now uses his expertise working for Specialisterne.
“The most challenging part of the algorithm was to make it scalable to very large data sets,” explains Kjær.
He says the central ingredient was the development of a fast multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, called ‘Mahjong.’ Mahjong evaluates an optimisation step in about 10 microseconds, and makes tests on millions of word combinations feasible.
The result is an algorithm that Kjær says can “handle millions of text snippets and thousands of categories, and still run everything in seconds on a PC.”
A key contribution from people on the autism spectrum
Specialisterne is a self-described ‘socially innovative company’ where the majority of staff have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. The company was founded in 2003 with the objective of providing better jobs and working conditions for neurodiverse talent.
According to CEO Carsten Lassen, autistic individuals are often known to find creative solutions and unusual perspectives in problem-solving when in the right work environment.
“I often hear autistic persons say that their brain works like an algorithm, in that it tends to work in a more binary way than the neurotypical brain: if it’s not absolutely right, then it’s wrong. That’s exactly how algorithms are built and that’s the foundation for all programming,” Lassen says.
What does the algorithm do?
Because of the new algorithm, it is now possible to easily explore how human rights guidance can boost implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by country, theme, or group of affected persons.
The UHRI now shows the concrete linkages between individual recommendations issued by UN human rights mechanisms and the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda.
“For us it has been of great support to benefit from the innovations developed by our partners,” says Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, UN Human Rights. “Machine learning can dramatically improve efficiency and enable us to analyse and present the human rights work of the mechanisms in more accessible and visual ways.”
A high degree of transparency

“We are proud to be part of a project where we can show the potential of this technology to promote human rights work,” says Cissé-Gouro. “We are particularly happy that the algorithm we are using has been developed in a way that provides a high degree of transparency and enables meaningful human oversight.”
For the future? UN Human Rights will continue to expand its work using the algorithm.

Since the beginning of large-scale industrialization, automation has led to massive, widespread job losses. Whole cities like Detroit fell victim to this when the car industry replaced large numbers of humans with robots. Today, many of the hardest-hit places are barely a shadow of their bustling and blossoming past selves.
Adding robots to the economy displaces workers. A study from the University of Chicago found that adding just one machine per 1,000 workers to the economy causes the employment rate to decrease by at least 0.18 percent. This may not sound like much, but in a country the size of the United States, it corresponds to about half a million layoffs. That’s the equivalent of a medium-sized city of workers without a job.
Those workers face an immediate, direct crisis as they have to find new jobs or maybe even new fields entirely. Their unemployment also has downstream effects on the broader economy as they cut down on spending for the duration of their time out of the workforce. Unemployment affects everyone who participates in the economy.
With the fourth industrial revolution in full blast, the fear is palpable yet again. Artificial intelligence has the potential to automate even very complex tasks, to say nothing of the simple and repetitive ones. That labor-saving potential only sounds great before you think about the social consequences. No city wants to end up muddled in bankruptcy and decline. No workers want to lose their livelihood, boring and repetitive though some parts of their jobs may be.
But the news isn’t all bad. Without robots in the automotive industry, the innovative products made by companies like General Motors or Tesla wouldn’t even exist in our wildest dreams. Without the robots in tech factories, the device that you’re reading this article on wouldn’t exist either. And without an AI-based recommendation algorithm, you might never have stumbled upon this article.
Stories like the decline of Detroit are gut-wrenching. But there’s reason to believe that history won’t repeat itself when it comes to the AI-fueled revolution.

Companies That Adopt Robots Hire More Workers
On a macroeconomic level, the logic seems simple: If AI makes workers obsolete, then adopting it will make unemployment rise. At first sight, a study from France confirms that suspicion. The authors found that a 20 percent increase in robots in a given industry leads to a 1.6 percent decline in employment there. Of course, robots are a way more general term than AI, but we can assume AI would lead to similar results.
The reality is different, though, when shifting perspective from the national economy to individual corporations. Somewhat counterintuitively, companies that adopt robots hire more workers. Admittedly, this data might be a bit misleading because companies with stronger growth can afford more robots sooner, which makes them scale even faster.
There are, however, a couple of compelling reasons to believe that robots help companies expand their human workforce. The French study suggests that, if workers and robots share the workload, then the value added per worker goes up.
For example, consider a company that employs five workers to manufacture a product worth $100. On average, every worker contributes $20 to the final product. After experiencing some growth, this company buys some robots and now only needs two workers per product because the robots are doing the rest. As a result, the remaining two workers contribute $50 each to the final product. Since this is a dramatic increase in efficiency, the company might expand its activities and hire additional workers, who can also now contribute $50 each thanks to the improved efficiency — compared to $20 in the pre-robot stage. This mechanism increases a company’s labor demand, so it might decide to hire more workers to expand its palette of products and services.
Robot-adopting businesses also grow their headcount because providing products and services usually becomes cheaper when they’re not handmade. Sure, buying machines is an upfront investment and some maintenance work is necessary. Robots don’t get tired, sick or need to go on vacation, however. In the long run, this efficiency pays off. The reduced cost makes it easier for these companies to snap up more market share in their industry because they can offer higher quality products at the same price or keep the same quality but offer lower prices than the competition.
Research from Canada, Denmark and Spain comes to similar conclusions. Although no such study has been undertaken in the U.S. as yet, companies need to invest in robots if they want to stay competitive, even if employment in their sector goes down as a result.
We should keep in mind, however, that every AI-system can be viewed as a robot, but not every robot contains AI. Investing in AI might lead to more corporate growth just like general robotics. Fortunately, though, unlike other robots, AI might not lead to an industry-wide decline in employment.
A Dutch study comes to a similar conclusion as the French, Canadian, Danish and Spanish ones, namely that more automation — meaning more robots — leads to more unemployment. Despite this, computerization, under which we can safely count AI, doesn’t have an effect on unemployment.
In other words, although physical robots do eliminate jobs to some extent, computers and AI don’t have the same effect. What this study doesn’t show, though, is the link between AI and economic growth. But other studies have.
 
AI Is Poised to Fuel Explosive Growth
Those readers who are old enough to have witnessed the rise of the internet (the author was too small back then) might remember how it raised similar concerns about unemployment. Even though it became widespread a mere 20 years ago, it has already created millions of jobs since and comprises 10 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Perhaps more importantly, the internet hasn’t been responsible for the decline of cities like automation in the car industry has.
Currently, 63 percent of CEOs believe that AI will have an even larger impact than the internet, according to PwC. In their global AI study, PwC estimates that by 2030, the global GDP will have increased by 26 percent due to AI alone. That’s more than the current GDP of China and India combined.
PwC isn’t the only optimist in the room. The World Economic Forum estimates that 97 million new jobs will be created through AI by 2025. They also estimate that some 85 million jobs will be lost in the same period, but that’s still a net surplus of 12 million jobs.
That being said, the distribution of these jobs might be unequal. In Sweden and the U.S., productivity is projected to increase by more than 35 percent by 2035 due to AI. For France and Spain, however, the gains might be less than 20 percent.
This effect might not be as enormous as it sounds, though. The World Economic Forum estimates that only 40 percent of the AI-related economic growth by 2030 will come from an increase in productivity; the other 60 percent will come from consumption. In other words, a little less than half of the growth will come because workers get more efficient or get replaced by AI. The rest of the growth will come from the fact that people will be using products with AI, such as social networks or streaming services. One caveat to this point is that we’re comparing two different time spans here, as one projection was for 10 years and another 15. Nevertheless, it’s clear that productivity is only a part of the equation that contributes to overall economic growth.
Despite legitimate fears, it seems as if the adoption of AI will lead to sustained economic growth, which in turn spurs employment rates. The important part will be to make this growth fair and equitable to as many citizens as possible both within and across nations. Within a nation, this means making sure that marginalized communities such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, overweight people, people with disabilities and people of color get access to training and education in AI. We must also strive to eradicate currently existing algorithmic biases. On an international level, this means enabling access to computing resources for low-income countries and fostering collaborations and research across different countries.

AI-Based Management Might Be Unhealthy
Before you get overly enthusiastic about the findings by the World Economic Forum, though, consider that economic growth doesn’t mean more riches for everybody. At the risk of sounding overly socialistic and European (it’s OK, that’s where I’m from) let me say that workers’ rights are routinely squeezed to death by AI.
The Verge reports this clearly: It’s OK to use AI to take over boring and repetitive tasks. But what if you promote an algorithm to a middle manager? The algorithmic manager is fixated on KPIs and has no mercy or humanity. The machine’s only goal is to achieve desired results as efficiently as possible. The result is that it cuts breaks, raises objectives and might end up laying off workers.
We’ve already seen negative results from AI management. Workers routinely burn out under AI managers. Some even get severe physical injuries. AI-managed productivity metrics also don’t seem to be effective. For instance, algorithms are used to measure the productivity of software developers. Paradoxically, that measurement doesn’t seem to increase productivity, but rather destroy it.
If we’re employing algorithms not as lowest-level workers but rather as managers, we should at least teach them some human decency. For example, include some hard borders in an algorithm that specify how many breaks an employee is eligible for. Also, even without AI, it’s common practice to animate workers to outperform the best in the team. But how about animating them to just be slightly above average and implementing that goal algorithmically?
These kinds of approaches may sound like a waste of resources in the short term, but my intuition is that they will pay off eventually. In fact, if we don’t adopt a more moderate approach toward productivity, we’ll likely end up with swathes of job-, income- and futureless workers, not because they’ve been laid off but because they’ve been drilled beyond their breaking points.
It’s incredibly important to emphasize the capabilities of AI in creating new jobs. These, however, must be humane, or it’s a moot point.
 
How to Prevent an AI Apocalypse
I’m not raising the point of social equality because I’m a guardian angel. I’m just a regular, egotistical human. But I believe that, as humans, we profit if others around us are doing well. When unemployment goes down, that saves the government a ton of money and opens up new opportunities in the future. After all, maybe one or two of these low-level workers whose job is saved will one day be the Steve Jobs or Elon Musk of the decades to come.
And there’s another issue: If, like the World Economic Forum suggests, 97 million jobs get created through AI and only 85 million jobs get destroyed, there’s no guarantee that the 85 million laid-off workers will be in the pool of the 97 million lucky ones. Populations grow, people migrate, and so the 97 million jobs may be quite a scarce resource after all.
In order to give the 85 million laid-off workers a perspective, it’s imperative to re- and upskill them, ideally long before they lose their old jobs. AI can be part of the solution here since a learning bot could automate this curriculum of continued education. AI algorithms should also be created to match workers to new opportunities and to equip brand-new workers with the necessary skills, ideally even before they’ve left college.
AI will create more jobs than it will destroy. But we’ll need AI to ensure a fair distribution of these new jobs.
 
Invest in Your Workers
Luckily enough, governments are starting to understand what’s going on. France, for example, takes the AI-led world of tomorrow very seriously. In a report from 2019, France Stratégie proposes to train more AI experts and workers that really understand what AI means for tech, law, economy and society as a whole.
In addition, France Stratégie proposes “improving schemes for safeguarding career paths in the sectors and subsectors that are set to be heavily impacted by the risk of automation.” In other words, some smart decision-makers in business and government need to get together and map out plans for workers in a rapidly shifting landscape, sector by sector. I applaud this approach.
This requires a lot of foresight and nobody has a crystal ball. We’ll make mistakes. But if we, as a society, want to move forward, we need to address the fundamental fear of decline, of not keeping pace with shifting technologies. AI will bring prosperity to many and doom to few, but we need to act now to curb the doom and spread prosperity to every single worker.

Sifting through job applications, analyzing X-ray images, suggesting a new track list—interaction between humans and machines has become an integral part of modern life. The basis for these artificial intelligence (AI) processes is algorithmic decision-making. However, as these are generally difficult to understand, they often prove less useful than anticipated. Researchers at Paderborn and Bielefeld University are hoping to change this, and are discussing how the explainability of artificial intelligence can be improved and adapted to the needs of human users. Their work has recently been published in the respected journal IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems. The researchers describe explanation as a social practice, in which both parties co-construct the process of understanding.





Explainability research
""Artificial systems have become complex. This is a serious problem—particularly when humans are held accountable for computer-based decisions,"" says Professor Philipp Cimiano, a computer scientist at Bielefeld University. Particularly in the area of medical prognosis or legal contexts, we need to understand how machine-driven decisions are made, continues Cimiano. He points out that while there are already some approaches that address the explainability of such systems, they do not go far enough. Professor Katharina Rohlfing at Paderborn University agrees that further action is urgently needed: ""Citizens have the right for algorithmic decisions to be made transparent. There are good reasons why this issue is specifically mentioned in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation."" The goal of making algorithms accessible is central to what is known as ""eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)"": ""In explainability research, the focus is currently on the desired outcomes of transparency and interpretability,"" says Rohlfing, describing the latest research.
Understanding how decisions are made
The team involved in this research study go one step further and are investigating computer-based explanations from various different perspectives. They start from the assumption that explanations are only understandable to the users if they are not just presented to them, but if the users are involved in formulating them: ""As we know from many everyday situations, good explanations are worth nothing if they do not take account of the other person's knowledge and experience. Anyone who wonders why their application was rejected by an algorithm is not generally interested in finding out about the technology of machine learning, but asks instead about how the data was processed with regard to their own qualifications,"" explains Rohlfing.
""When people interact with one another, the dialogue between them ensures that an explanation is tailored to the understanding of the other person. The dialogue partner asks questions for further explanation or can express incomprehension which is then resolved. In the case of artificial intelligence there are limitations to this because of the limited scope for interaction,"" continues Rohlfing. To address this, linguists, psychologists, media researchers, sociologists, economists and computer scientists are working closely together in an interdisciplinary team. These experts are investigating computer models and complex AI systems as well as roles in communicative interaction.






Explanation as a social practice
The Paderborn and Bielefeld researchers have developed a conceptual framework for the design of explainable AI systems. Rohlfing says: ""Our approach enables AI systems to answer selected questions in such a way that the process can be configured interactively. In this way an explanation can be tailored to the dialogue partner, and social aspects can be included in decision-making."" The research team regards explanations as a sequence of actions brought together by both parties in a form of social practice.
The aim is for this to be guided by 'scaffolding' and 'monitoring.' These terms come originally from the field of developmental studies. ""To put it simply, scaffolding describes a method in which learning processes are supported by prompts and guidance, and are broken down into partial steps. Monitoring means observing and evaluating the reactions of the other party,"" explains Rohlfing. The researchers' objective is to apply these principles to AI systems.
New forms of assistance
This approach aims to expand on current research and provide new answers to societal challenges in connection with artificial intelligence. The underlying assumption is that the only successful way to derive understanding and further action from an explanation is to involve the dialogue partner in the process of explanation. At its core, this is about human participation in socio-technical systems. ""Our objective is to create new forms of communication with genuinely explainable and understandable AI systems, and in this way to facilitate new forms of assistance,"" says Rohlfing in summary.

Despite years of hype, virtual reality headsets have yet to topple TV or computer screens as the go-to devices for video viewing. One reason: VR can make users feel sick. Nausea and eye strain can result because VR creates an illusion of 3D viewing although the user is in fact staring at a fixed-distance 2D display. The solution for better 3D visualization could lie in a 60-year-old technology remade for the digital world: holograms.
Holograms deliver an exceptional representation of 3D world around us. Plus, they’re beautiful. (Go ahead — check out the holographic dove on your Visa card.) Holograms offer a shifting perspective based on the viewer’s position, and they allow the eye to adjust focal depth to alternately focus on foreground and background.
Researchers have long sought to make computer-generated holograms, but the process has traditionally required a supercomputer to churn through physics simulations, which is time-consuming and can yield less-than-photorealistic results. Now, MIT researchers have developed a new way to produce holograms almost instantly — and the deep learning-based method is so efficient that it can run on a laptop in the blink of an eye, the researchers say.
“People previously thought that with existing consumer-grade hardware, it was impossible to do real-time 3D holography computations,” says Liang Shi, the study’s lead author and a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). “It’s often been said that commercially available holographic displays will be around in 10 years, yet this statement has been around for decades.”
Shi believes the new approach, which the team calls “tensor holography,” will finally bring that elusive 10-year goal within reach. The advance could fuel a spillover of holography into fields like VR and 3D printing.
Shi worked on the study, published today in Nature, with his advisor and co-author Wojciech Matusik. Other co-authors include Beichen Li of EECS and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, as well as former MIT researchers Changil Kim (now at Facebook) and Petr Kellnhofer (now at Stanford University).
The quest for better 3D
A typical lens-based photograph encodes the brightness of each light wave — a photo can faithfully reproduce a scene’s colors, but it ultimately yields a flat image.
In contrast, a hologram encodes both the brightness and phase of each light wave. That combination delivers a truer depiction of a scene’s parallax and depth. So, while a photograph of Monet’s “Water Lilies” can highlight the paintings’ color palate, a hologram can bring the work to life, rendering the unique 3D texture of each brush stroke. But despite their realism, holograms are a challenge to make and share.
First developed in the mid-1900s, early holograms were recorded optically. That required splitting a laser beam, with half the beam used to illuminate the subject and the other half used as a reference for the light waves’ phase. This reference generates a hologram’s unique sense of depth.  The resulting images were static, so they couldn’t capture motion. And they were hard copy only, making them difficult to reproduce and share.
Computer-generated holography sidesteps these challenges by simulating the optical setup. But the process can be a computational slog. “Because each point in the scene has a different depth, you can’t apply the same operations for all of them,” says Shi. “That increases the complexity significantly.” Directing a clustered supercomputer to run these physics-based simulations could take seconds or minutes for a single holographic image. Plus, existing algorithms don’t model occlusion with photorealistic precision. So Shi’s team took a different approach: letting the computer teach physics to itself.
They used deep learning to accelerate computer-generated holography, allowing for real-time hologram generation. The team designed a convolutional neural network — a processing technique that uses a chain of trainable tensors to roughly mimic how humans process visual information. Training a neural network typically requires a large, high-quality dataset, which didn’t previously exist for 3D holograms.
The team built a custom database of 4,000 pairs of computer-generated images. Each pair matched a picture — including color and depth information for each pixel — with its corresponding hologram. To create the holograms in the new database, the researchers used scenes with complex and variable shapes and colors, with the depth of pixels distributed evenly from the background to the foreground, and with a new set of physics-based calculations to handle occlusion. That approach resulted in photorealistic training data. Next, the algorithm got to work.
By learning from each image pair, the tensor network tweaked the parameters of its own calculations, successively enhancing its ability to create holograms. The fully optimized network operated orders of magnitude faster than physics-based calculations. That efficiency surprised the team themselves.
“We are amazed at how well it performs,” says Matusik. In mere milliseconds, tensor holography can craft holograms from images with depth information — which is provided by typical computer-generated images and can be calculated from a multicamera setup or LiDAR sensor (both are standard on some new smartphones). This advance paves the way for real-time 3D holography. What’s more, the compact tensor network requires less than 1 MB of memory. “It’s negligible, considering the tens and hundreds of gigabytes available on the latest cell phone,” he says.
The research “shows that true 3D holographic displays are practical with only moderate computational requirements,” says Joel Kollin, a principal optical architect at Microsoft who was not involved with the research. He adds that “this paper shows marked improvement in image quality over previous work,” which will “add realism and comfort for the viewer.” Kollin also hints at the possibility that holographic displays like this could even be customized to a viewer’s ophthalmic prescription. “Holographic displays can correct for aberrations in the eye. This makes it possible for a display image sharper than what the user could see with contacts or glasses, which only correct for low order aberrations like focus and astigmatism.”
“A considerable leap”
Real-time 3D holography would enhance a slew of systems, from VR to 3D printing. The team says the new system could help immerse VR viewers in more realistic scenery, while eliminating eye strain and other side effects of long-term VR use. The technology could be easily deployed on displays that modulate the phase of light waves. Currently, most affordable consumer-grade displays modulate only brightness, though the cost of phase-modulating displays would fall if widely adopted.
Three-dimensional holography could also boost the development of volumetric 3D printing, the researchers say. This technology could prove faster and more precise than traditional layer-by-layer 3D printing, since volumetric 3D printing allows for the simultaneous projection of the entire 3D pattern. Other applications include microscopy, visualization of medical data, and the design of surfaces with unique optical properties.
“It’s a considerable leap that could completely change people’s attitudes toward holography,” says Matusik. “We feel like neural networks were born for this task.”
The work was supported, in part, by Sony.

Last Updated: March 11, 2021




 





Will 2021 finally be the year when AI-powered technologies find widespread acceptance in the world of work? Our six-part series on AI in HR is going to deep dive into every facet of AI in HR. 
While HR is not known for pioneering nascent technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a terrific opportunity. The consumerization of HR technologies has brought AI to the forefront of innovation in HR. From recruitment to employee experience, and talent management, AI has the potential to transform HR.
This issue of Succeeding with AI in HR will provide you with a basic understanding of what AI is, its applications in HR, and how it works. This issue is split into three parts: 1) AI basics, 2) the business case for AI in HR, and 3) five critical HR areas that AI is transforming.
PART 1: AI BASICS IN THE HR CONTEXT
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence. In other words, AI enables machines to “think like humans,” and perform tasks such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and language processing. Today, AI is being driven by two fundamental technologies – machine learning and deep learning.(Click here to read: The complete history of AIOpens a new window )
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from and make predictions based on data. The roots of machine learning are embedded in pattern recognition and the concept that algorithms can learn from recorded data without being programmed to do so. For instance, an algorithm that needs to identify cars will rely on images of other cars to teach itself what looks like a car. In this case, the end objective of the algorithm has been defined – which is to identify a car, but the steps to arrive at the objective is learned by the machine itself by training on data.

Key use cases of Machine Learning in the HR context:



Anomaly detection: Identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.
Background verification: Machine learning-powered predictive models can extract meaning and raise red flags based on structured and unstructured data points from applicants’ resumes.
Employee Attrition: Find employees who are at high risk of attrition, enabling HR to proactively engage with them and retain them.
Content personalization: Provide a more personalized employee experience by using predictive analytics to recommend career paths, professional development programs or optimize a career site based on prior applicant actions.



What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that trains a computer to learn from large amounts of data through neural network architecture. It is a more advanced form of machine learning that breaks down data into layers of abstraction. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using multiple neural network layers for processing (like neurons in the brain).
Considering the same car analogy from above, a deep learning algorithm can distinguish between a car and a truck by identifying the relationships between core elements of a car and a truck (car – 4 wheels, no loading bed; truck – 4 or more wheels, has a loading bed, etc.).
After sufficient training, deep learning algorithms can begin to make predictions or interpretations of very complex data.
Key use cases of Deep Learning in the HR Context:



Image and video recognition: Deep learning algorithms outperform humans in object classification. Given videos and photos of thousands of applicants, deep learning systems can identify and classify candidates based on objective data.
Speech recognition: While understanding human voice and myriad accents is difficult for most machines, deep learning algorithms can be designed to recognize and respond to human voice inputs. Virtual assistants use speech recognition algorithms to process human voice and respond accordingly.
Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) trains chatbots and similar systems to understand human language, tone, and context. NLP will emerge as a crucial capability for AI systems as organizations continue to automate HR service delivery with chatbots.
Recommendation engines: Digital learning experiences often involve personalized learning recommendations related to skill levels and professional interests. Using Big Data and Deep Learning, learning experience platforms can identify learning pathways that might interest individual employees.



PART 2: The Business Case for Artificial Intelligence in HR
Until recently, the primary benefits of HR technology were to improve efficiency and drive cost-savings by automating repetitive tasks. Today, smarter technologies are enabling HR teams to solve critical business challenges, drive exponential performance improvements and even impact larger business outcomes and profitability. AI is fueling HR’s transition from administrative to strategic to mission critical.



Fig. 1
Sandy Michelet, Director of People Strategy at SparkhoundOpens a new window  says, “AI will make HR more effective. End of story. It will not solve all problems but will allow HR to transfer their time currently spent on repetitive and administrative tasks to a more strategic approach. Many believe that AI will reduce human contact in HR but I believe it will do the exact opposite. Instead of an HR Generalist answering the same questions again and again, s/he can use that time discussing an employee’s development or internal process improvement.”
The top three business reasons for deploying AI in HR:
1. Employee experience
A recent surveyOpens a new window  by Deloitte revealed that while nearly 80 percent of executives rate employee experience as important, only 22 percent believe their organization excels at providing a differentiated employee experience. The next competitive frontier for businesses is employee experience and the future of HR will be centered on the employee experience and personalizing engagement. In a time when employees have smart assistants at home and recommendation engines for when they shop, they expect a personalized experience when they come to work.
Speaking about how consumer technologies are shaping employee expectations at work, Jennifer Stroud, HR Evangelist & Transformation Leader at ServiceNowOpens a new window , says, “We have seen the need for chatbots, AI and machine learning in the workplace to drive more productivity as well as modern, consumerized employee experiences. These consumer technology solutions are exactly what employees want in the workplace.” 
A recent survey by ServiceNowOpens a new window  revealed that 30 percent of employees want a “Google-like” option to easily get the help and information they need at work. “Voice technology in the workplace is also a key consideration. Our survey found that 16 percent of employees want Siri, but to help answer work questions.  Beyond these considerations, an effective solution must be mobile, personal and provide the employee with options in terms of how they wish to engage and be supported,” adds Jennifer.
AI can be effectively woven into the entire employee lifecycle, starting with recruitment and onboarding, to HR service delivery and career pathing, to provide bespoke employee experiences.
2. Data-driven decision making
HR agility has emerged as a critical theme for organizations in the war for talent. And HR agility is determined by the pace at which HR leaders can make sound business decisions. Unfortunately, for many organizations, the data-to-decision workflow looks like the figure below:



Fig. 2
While HR technology has made real-time data available to businesses, many still rely on manual methods to draw insights from data. This task is often left to end users or data analysts. This creates a bottleneck when trying to draw insights – causing delays. Decisions also continue to be made with outdated information.
AI helps HR teams extract insights from data and deliver recommendations in real time. Natural Language Generation (NLG) software has the ability to transform data into data-driven text automatically, which makes it a valuable asset for HR teams across industries. AI also has the potential to remove many of the common human biases and inconsistencies in a function as sensitive to such factors as Human Capital Management. Thus, decisions powered by AI have the potential to be faster at scale and more data-informed, as well as more consistent, and unbiased.
3. Intelligent automation

Intelligent automation combines AI with automation to enable machines to sense, understand, learn and act – either independently or with human assistance. Intelligent automation can perform not only manual tasks but also make intelligent decisions as a human would. Intelligent automation capabilities can enable machines to understand processes and their variations. Intelligent automation can be deployed across all repetitive manual processes to boost efficiency, productivity, and drive innovation.
AI in HR opens the door to limitless opportunities – imagine if an employee could learn new skills to match the pace of technological advances; they would be in complete control of their career! Now that’s an employee experience anyone would appreciate. As business performance becomes the focal point of all long-term HR strategies, AI has emerged as the most valuable ally for HR professionals.
PART 3: AI Is Transforming 5 Crucial Areas of HR
Increased investment in smarter HR technologies has led to some interesting innovations in the AI ‒ HR space. Here’s a quick overview of the most significant ways AI is transforming HR for the better:

AI in Recruitment:Opens a new window  AI has made candidate sourcing, screening, and matching easier for organizations. In addition to improving efficiency, AI is also helping HR leaders overcome human-bias in decision making.Tammy Cohen, Founder and Chief Visionary Office of InfoMartOpens a new window , believes, “Language within job descriptions steers diverse, qualified candidates away from a position. Gender-coded language, which is language that lends itself towards the ideas and stereotypes surrounding different genders, can subconsciously deter qualified talent. For example, a man is less likely to apply for a job ad that describes the ideal candidate as ‘feisty,’ while a woman is less likely to apply for a job ad that seeks a ‘domineering’ candidate. When writing job descriptions, the employer may not mean to make these mistakes; everyone, in some ways, uses gender-coded language. That’s where artificial intelligence comes into play.”“AI systems are being used to create inclusive job descriptions and review them for gender-coded language. With several large corporations embracing this on a company-wide level, it stands to reason that AI-augmented job descriptions will become more common,” she says.Here are some of the key use cases of AI in recruiting:




Candidate sourcing
Lead nurturing
Candidate screening
Interviewing
Onboarding




AI in HCMOpens a new window : AI is enabling organizations to meet increasing employee expectations by helping HR teams reimagine people and talent processes to build stronger teams, reduce employee turnover, and enhance the employee experience. A few major impact areas for AI in HCM include:




Performance management
Workforce planning
People analytics
Virtual assistants for self-service/HR service delivery
Career pathing
Leadership and coaching




AI in Employee Engagement: AI has been a catalyst for how businesses interact with their employees. Key uses cases include:

Rewards and recognition
Personalized messaging and communication




AI in Employee Benefits: AI and automation can ease the administration, implementation as well as management of employee benefits. Sparkhound deployed a chatbot to help demystify benefits for employees. Sandy says she’s already seeing positive outcomes from the deployment. She says, “We recently launched an HR BOT to answer the top 30 benefits questions we’ve received over the last four years. Part of the launch included a feedback button so we can continuously improve. Although it was a soft launch, I am already hearing positive comments about the ease of use and the immediate responsiveness. Right now, many employees (and HR people) believe that HR’s role is to provide human involvement every time the manager or employee needs assistance. I understand why….that has been the culture of companies since HR was called a ‘personnel department’. That was before everyone had a cell phone in their hand, shopped online and chatted with customer service.” 

Key use cases of AI in benefits administration include:



Benefits personalization
Benefits automation
Benefits communication
Benefits compliance




AI in Learning and Development (L&D): In the current talent landscape, where skills have a shorter shelf life than ever before, AI could prove to be the game changer. AI is enabling learning platforms to replicate the qualities of successful consumer content platforms like YouTube and Netflix to improve learning outcomes. Some of the key impact areas of AI in L&D include:




Personalized learning pathways
eLearning analytics
Conversational interfaces

Releases 2021 guide on AI use cases and best practices distilled from publishers, agencies, and ad tech
NEW YORK (March 9, 2021) – The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the national trade association for the digital media and marketing industries, is focusing its AI Standards Working Group to develop artificial intelligence (AI) standards, best practices, use cases, and terminologies in an effort to scale AI and enable the industry on its full potential. The group is newly co-chaired by IBM Watson Advertising and Nielsen.
The first release of 2021, “Artificial Intelligence Use Cases and Best Practices for Marketing,” will help executive leaders, marketers, and technologists get the most from AI, and do it responsibly.
Created for those already working with AI or looking to leverage it in their business, this guide draws directly from the real-world experience of co-chairs IBM Watson Advertising and Nielsen as well as top publishers, agencies, and ad tech companies in the industry. It’s not an ivory tower overview of AI: it’s a specific guide for what to do for executives that are in the thick of it.
The marketing industry has a compelling need for a set of agreed-upon standards that will set the course for leveraging AI across the open web. With the industry facing transformation on every front, setting the right foundation for AI is critical.
“AI is the only technology that can keep up with the petabytes of data that are the hallmark of successful digital marketing playbooks today,” said Angelina Eng, Vice President, Measurement & Attribution, Programmatic+Data Center, IAB. “But AI should not be blindly trusted. The IAB AI Standards Working Group is helping define the groundwork and best practices the industry needs to ensure privacy, measurement, and addressability. Ultimately, this will lead to creating agreed-upon standards.”
The guide includes nine use cases spanning internal robotic process automation and data migration for agencies to AI use cases for creative, contextual, video, and beyond.
As just one example, AI is critical in the journey to stitch together the fractured media ecosystem. It’s no longer the case that all media come through a single TV at home. Every household is now full of individuals with multiple devices, applications, and accounts that are shared, used independently, or all together.
“We’ve created similar playbooks that leverage AI for industries facing significant disruption. We are excited about today’s announcement and the contributions we know AI can offer digital media as it navigates unprecedented disruption,” said David Olesnevich, Head of Product, IBM Watson Advertising, and IAB AI Standards Working Group Co-Chair. “The work of the IAB AI Standards Working Group and the greater AI Standards’ Guide ensures that industry collaboration will be at the forefront of innovation when scaling this advanced technology across the open web.”
The unique insights in the guide are driven by conversations about real-world challenges faced daily by the industry’s biggest brands. It provides a practical understanding of what works and what doesn’t, helping to illuminate what’s possible now.
“With the increasing fragmentation of media and the proliferation of devices, measuring audience reach is harder than ever, “said Mainak Mazumdar, Chief Data & Research Officer, Nielsen, and IAB AI Standards Working Group Co-Chair. “But with high-quality training data such as panels and device signals, AI can be used to develop identity to better understand and measure who is using the device, app, or account as well as correct for biases due to co-viewing and device sharing.”
The guide is the result of a unique collaboration that brings together AI and machine learning (ML) thought leaders and expert practitioners from the industry’s top publishers, agencies, and ad tech companies and is aimed at technologically sophisticated executives already racing ahead with AI.
The AI Use Cases and Best Practices for Marketing guide, which can be downloaded at iab.com/ai-use-cases, will help executives separate AI hype from reality, identify the keys to success, and build future-ready brands, agencies, and ad tech organizations.

Intelligent machines toil in place of office workers and serve as dutiful companions, or “Artificial Friends.” Some children have themselves become another form of AI, having had their intelligence upgraded via genetic engineering. These enhanced, or “lifted,” humans create a social schism, dividing people into an elite ruling order and an underclass of the unmodified and grudgingly idle.Klara and the Sun, Ishiguro’s first book since he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017, builds upon themes that recur in his previous work—loss and regret, sacrifice and longing, a sense of reality unmoored. But technology takes a more central role, and Ishiguro uses artificial intelligence, both biological and mechanized, to reflect on what it is to be human.Trending NowCrispr Is Already Changing the Food We Eat | WIRED BizConThis vision of the future also speaks to Ishiguro’s feelings about the present. As he tells WIRED, the novel was inspired by recent technological advances, and a desire to understand where these advances could lead humanity.Ishiguro spoke to WIRED from his home in London via Zoom. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.AdvertisementWIRED: Klara and the Sun looks at what happens when some people can be enhanced genetically—something that may soon be possible thanks to the Crispr technology. How did you become interested in that?Kazuo Ishiguro: I first heard about it when my New York literary agent sent me a clipping. This was when the first real breakthrough had been made by Jennifer Doudna, and I immediately thought, wow, this is going to do interesting things to our society.If you’re of my generation—I'm 66—a lot of what's happened in the world has, in one way or the other, been to do with struggles against unjust hierarchies, class systems, colonial systems, castes according to skin color. When I heard about this, I thought, well, actually, it's going to make a meritocracy something quite savage.But I was excited by it as well. I was lucky enough to meet Doudna, in 2017, at a conference in London, and I got very interested in the whole thing.Crispr is an absolute breakthrough because it's so accurate, it's relatively cheap, and it's relatively easy to do. This means that its benefits can be with us very, very quickly.Already, I understand, there are people who have been cured of sickle cell and other blood related illnesses. The possibilities, in terms of medicines and also in terms of producing food, are enormous.But by the very fact that it’s relatively cheap and relatively easy to do, it’s going to be very hard to regulate. And I can see that a lot of the energy behind Crispr is in the private sector. It’s not under the traditional government or university auspices, so oversight is going to be difficult.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDMy question is, how do you build the platforms for debate and discussion in our society so that everyone can participate in the discussion? I think it's kind of odd that people are not more aware of it. People seem to be much more aware of AI, and people like to talk about that.I was about to ask about AI actually, since Klara and the Sun is set in a time of intelligent machines. Are you similarly excited—and also troubled—by recent progress in artificial intelligence, things like AlphaGo?Well, AlphaGo has been superseded several times. But what was interesting about AlphaGo’s success against Lee Sedol, the Korean Go champion, a few years ago, was the manner in which it won. It played in a completely different style. It made moves that made people fall about laughing, but the really hilarious, idiotic move proved to be the sensational one. And I think that opened the possibility of all kinds of things.I remember raising the question with a very leading AI expert about whether there could be a program that could write novels. Not just novels that would pass some sort of Turing test, but novels that would really move people or make people cry. I thought that was interesting.What did the expert say?Well, OK, I was talking to Demis Hassabis [cofounder of DeepMind], and he was quite interested in this idea. We talked about it over a number of conversations, and I think the key question here is: Can AI actually get to that empathy, by understanding human emotions, controlling them through something like a work of art?Once it gets to the point where an AI program, AlphaTolstoy or whatever, can actually make me laugh and cry, and see the world in a different way, I think we've reached an interesting point, if not quite a dangerous point. Nevermind Cambridge Analytica. If it can do that to me, then it understands human emotions well enough to be able to run a political campaign. It can identify the frustrations and angers and emotions in the nation, or in the world at large, and know what to do with that.Courtesy of Penguin Random HouseBuy this book at:AmazonBookshop.orgBooks-A-MillionApple BooksIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.The novel also considers how a person’s personality might be captured and re-created algorithmically. Why are you interested in that?Klara and the Sun just accepts a world in which big data, algorithms, these things have become so much part of our lives. And in that world, human beings are starting to look at each other in a different way. Our assumption about what a human individual is and what's inside each unique human individual—what makes them unique—these things are a little bit different because we live in a world where we see all these possibilities of being able to excavate and map out people's personalities.Is that going to change our feelings toward each other, particularly when we’re under pressure? When you actually face the prospect of losing somebody you love, I think then you really, really start to ask that question, not just intellectually but emotionally. What does this person mean? What is this loss? What kind of strategies can I put up to defend myself from the pain?I think the question becomes something very very real then. It's not just an abstract philosophical question about, you know, the ghost in the machine, whether you have some sort of traditional religious idea of a soul or a more modern idea of a set of things that can be reduced to algorithms, albeit vast and complicated one.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDSo it becomes a very human and very emotional question. What the hell is a human being, what's inside their mind and how irreplaceable is any one human? Those are the questions that, as a novelist, I'm interested in.Artificial intelligence isn’t yet close to this. Should we still worry about what it can do?In general, that question, about human oversight, is one that we need to be thinking about right now. In the popular discourse, the thing seems to revolve around whether the robots are going to kind of take us over, a kind of crazy zombie vampire kind of scenario, except featuring kind of sophisticated AI robots. That might be a serious concern, I don't know, but it's not one of the things that I'm particularly worried about. I think there are other things that are much more on our doorstep that we have to worry about.The nature of this generation of machine learning, which I understand is called reinforcement learning, is quite different to the old forms [of AI], never mind just programming a computer. It's just about giving an AI program a goal, and then we kind of lose control of what it does thereafter. And so I think there is this issue about how we could really hardwire the prejudices and biases of our age into black boxes, and won't be able to unpack them. What seemed like perfectly decent normal ideas a few years ago, now we object to as grossly unjust or worse. But we can go back on them because we can actually see how they're made. What about when we become very dependent on recommendations, advice, and decisions made by AI?A lot of people who know far, far more than I do about these things have expressed skepticism about the whole idea of having a human in the loop—allowing a human being to kind of supervise that process. It's just completely fanciful because we're just gonna be so way, way behind, there's no way that we're gonna be able to keep up.There’s been a lot of talk about AI ethics recently. Do you think big tech companies should lead that discussion?Maybe you can tell me—what is the consensus as far as you can see about the wish to open up the discussion? I can't quite figure out whether the people who are our most heavily invested in developing AI, whether their real position is one of secrecy? That they don't want oversight and they don't really want people talking about it very much. Or is it the reverse, that they're saying, “We're doing all this but it's up to you to think very carefully?”I think there are people who have those motives, but the momentum of these big companies tends to drive toward controlling the discussion, making sure that it doesn't go in directions that affect the business.I have noticed that even in the last three or four years AI companies do seem to be much more cautious about publicity. But I don't know if it's just some sort of PR exercise, this idea that it could be a partnership between human beings and machines, in the way that we've always had partnerships between human beings and machines. I don't know if that's a sincere belief, or whether it's just a way of trying to head off alarm in the general public.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDI guess I'm asking fundamentally if the ultimate goal is to always have this partnership between human beings and machines, or is the ultimate goal that, well, we just come to rely on the machines because the human mind is just going to be contaminating, it’s going to be so, so behind that it is absurd. It is going to be a nominal, token presence, like one night watchman in a stadium full of machines.The AI researchers that I talk to are trying to build things that are, in every way, as smart as us. It’s unclear what happens after that.This will be a major challenge for us, I think. If it is the case that this isn't like the traditional rounds of automation where you know one set of jobs disappear but new sets of jobs appear—and a lot of people think it isn't—we will have to rethink the way we've run our societies for centuries. That old system where each of us contributes to a larger enterprise, and we get paid, and then we use that money to fund our private lives and feed our families and so on, that system is going to have to be rethought.And not just in terms of the material way we distribute money and stuff but also in terms of prestige and a sense of self-respect.I think one of the things that we do seem to have very hardwired into us as human beings is this need to contribute to the larger community around us. If I don't do it, I feel bad in some kind of way and I'm also inclined to think badly of people who don't.The big question I would have about all of this is how do we build forums in which one can have this discussion in a meaningful way.Do you have any ideas for how to do that?Ha, no, I don’t. Because, you know, out of necessity we're talking about something that is global and international. It's not a good time for international institutions at the moment. Also, to what extent are the people who really know willing to encourage meaningful discussion, or to give out information so we can have a meaningful discussion?I don't think the people in Silicon Valley, or wherever they are, are a monolithic group that would all hold the same view on this. Different people have different views and possibly they have different interests, but what I would ask is what do they want from the rest of us?Returning to the book, Klara is quite a likable character, for an AI. Should technologists try to make sure their creations are as nice?One of the things is that it may be difficult to predict whether the AI program or the robot is going to be what we would define as nice or not. As you know, reinforcement learning just relies on that central reward function, and I understand there is this term called overfitting, which is that it behaves in a way that we wouldn't quite predict. It goes about trying to fulfill its goal in a way that actually is very destructive to us.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDMaybe you can give AI these kinds of Isaac Asimov type rules, maybe you could do something like that, but I can't see it. I mean, and we can't decide amongst ourselves, without robots, what is desirable, what is nice and what isn't. In the country you're living in, even the question of what freedom, or what democracy, means [isn’t clear]. A lot of people think freedom means that you riot in the Capitol building to reinstate democracy.The big thing I'm trying to say is, how do we get the conversation going? Different parts of our culture have roles to play. I think people who write books, people who make these blockbuster television series, have quite a big role to play. And I think there have been some very interesting TV series, like Westworld, that kind of raise these questions. But you know we need the conversation to get more urgent and more serious.The past year has, of course, been incredibly difficult and different. Has it been an inspiration to you as a novelist?One thing I have to say about the pandemic is that a staggering number of people have died, and this is something that I don't think we've quite kind of woken up to. We're talking about a scale of death that is just extraordinary. Right now there are millions of people around the world kind of shocked and bereaved having lost somebody close to them. And I think the emotional damage of this is going to be colossal.But we’re focusing, and it's understandable, on how the high street might change and Zoom and working from home. But the big, big thing about this is this level of death. In Britain, you know over 130,000 people died in the past year, which is more than twice the civilian death toll of the Second World War. I heard one commentator say recently that the half a million dead mark in the United States means that it’s more dead than the combination of the two world wars and Vietnam.I don't think we can go through a situation like this where so many people have died, and so many people are bereaved, and there is a sense that things were not done correctly, without something. Without actually there being a major consequence of that. And I'm not quite sure what that is.The other thing, I wouldn't say it's an inspiration, it's just what I've observed, is that there is this kind of strange contradictory thing happening—these two different versions of the truth or how you look for the truth seem to come to the fore with a vengeance in the last few months.On the one hand, we've come to rely desperately on the scientific method where people say, show me the evidence, peer review the evidence. And at the same time we have a situation where half of the people in the United States believe that Donald Trump won the election but had it stolen from him because they wish to believe it. The idea is that the truth is what you wish to believe. Feel it emotionally strongly enough in your heart.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPeople like me have placed so much emphasis on the importance of emotional truth; I create things like novels that are supposed to kind of move people. And it has made me kind of pause a moment. Looking at these two completely opposed attitudes to coexisting in a massive way in our lives at the moment, I kind of wonder if I actually contributed to this idea of what you feel is the truth.I'm conscious that we've gone a bit dark in this interview.Yes! Klara and the Sun is supposed to be a cheerful, optimistic book!Well, finally then, let me ask how optimistic you are about the future.Well, I think these areas [of science and technology] that we've talked about can bring us enormous benefits. It could happen. If we can rise to the challenge of using these incredible tools in a positive way, I think we’ve got a lot to look forward to.In terms of liberal democracy and how it's been shown to be very fragile, I don’t know, I do feel rather shaken about that. I think there are very strong competitive models now to liberal democracy that weren't around 30 years ago. And I'm not saying that, you know, things like artificial intelligence will actually help regimes that are not liberal democratic regimes but, I mean, that's not inconceivable.It might take away the advantage that liberal democratic societies had over authoritarian ones or centrally planned ones. With sophisticated artificial intelligence perhaps the Soviet Union would have thrived, perhaps they would have produced more luxury goods than the West, and we would be envying their supermarket choices.But if I have cause for optimism, it’s the optimism I tried to put into Klara and the Sun. I think there are positive aspects of human beings, and some of that I think is hardwired into us, almost in the way that things are programmed into a creature like Klara. She is kind of a reflection of human nature, and she mirrors back human society that she learns from. I picked up the parental thing—nurture and protect—but there are many things about human beings that do seem to be hardwired into us, and I think that continues to give us hope.All these breakthroughs in science, I think they could be great. But, you know, we've got to be ready for them.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!If you transplant a head, does its consciousness follow?A trippy visualization charts the internet's growth since 1997Who is R.

And I think that opened the possibility of all kinds of things.
I remember raising the question with a very leading AI expert about whether there could be a program that could write novels. Not just novels that would pass some sort of Turing test, but novels that would really move people or make people cry. I thought that was interesting.
What did the expert say?
Well, OK, I was talking to Demis Hassabis [cofounder of DeepMind], and he was quite interested in this idea. We talked about it over a number of conversations, and I think the key question here is: Can AI actually get to that empathy, by understanding human emotions, controlling them through something like a work of art?
Once it gets to the point where an AI program, AlphaTolstoy or whatever, can actually make me laugh and cry, and see the world in a different way, I think we've reached an interesting point, if not quite a dangerous point. Nevermind Cambridge Analytica. If it can do that to me, then it understands human emotions well enough to be able to run a political campaign. It can identify the frustrations and angers and emotions in the nation, or in the world at large, and know what to do with that.
The novel also considers how a person’s personality might be captured and re-created algorithmically. Why are you interested in that?
Klara and the Sun just accepts a world in which big data, algorithms, these things have become so much part of our lives. And in that world, human beings are starting to look at each other in a different way. Our assumption about what a human individual is and what's inside each unique human individual—what makes them unique—these things are a little bit different because we live in a world where we see all these possibilities of being able to excavate and map out people's personalities.
Is that going to change our feelings toward each other, particularly when we’re under pressure? When you actually face the prospect of losing somebody you love, I think then you really, really start to ask that question, not just intellectually but emotionally. What does this person mean? What is this loss? What kind of strategies can I put up to defend myself from the pain?
I think the question becomes something very very real then. It's not just an abstract philosophical question about, you know, the ghost in the machine, whether you have some sort of traditional religious idea of a soul or a more modern idea of a set of things that can be reduced to algorithms, albeit vast and complicated one.
So it becomes a very human and very emotional question. What the hell is a human being, what's inside their mind and how irreplaceable is any one human? Those are the questions that, as a novelist, I'm interested in.
Artificial intelligence isn’t yet close to this. Should we still worry about what it can do?
In general, that question, about human oversight, is one that we need to be thinking about right now. In the popular discourse, the thing seems to revolve around whether the robots are going to kind of take us over, a kind of crazy zombie vampire kind of scenario, except featuring kind of sophisticated AI robots. That might be a serious concern, I don't know, but it's not one of the things that I'm particularly worried about. I think there are other things that are much more on our doorstep that we have to worry about.
The nature of this generation of machine learning, which I understand is called reinforcement learning, is quite different to the old forms [of AI], never mind just programming a computer. It's just about giving an AI program a goal, and then we kind of lose control of what it does thereafter. And so I think there is this issue about how we could really hardwire the prejudices and biases of our age into black boxes, and won't be able to unpack them. What seemed like perfectly decent normal ideas a few years ago, now we object to as grossly unjust or worse. But we can go back on them because we can actually see how they're made. What about when we become very dependent on recommendations, advice, and decisions made by AI?
A lot of people who know far, far more than I do about these things have expressed skepticism about the whole idea of having a human in the loop—allowing a human being to kind of supervise that process. It's just completely fanciful because we're just gonna be so way, way behind, there's no way that we're gonna be able to keep up.
There’s been a lot of talk about AI ethics recently. Do you think big tech companies should lead that discussion?
Maybe you can tell me—what is the consensus as far as you can see about the wish to open up the discussion? I can't quite figure out whether the people who are our most heavily invested in developing AI, whether their real position is one of secrecy? That they don't want oversight and they don't really want people talking about it very much. Or is it the reverse, that they're saying, “We're doing all this but it's up to you to think very carefully?”
I think there are people who have those motives, but the momentum of these big companies tends to drive toward controlling the discussion, making sure that it doesn't go in directions that affect the business.
I have noticed that even in the last three or four years AI companies do seem to be much more cautious about publicity. But I don't know if it's just some sort of PR exercise, this idea that it could be a partnership between human beings and machines, in the way that we've always had partnerships between human beings and machines. I don't know if that's a sincere belief, or whether it's just a way of trying to head off alarm in the general public.
I guess I'm asking fundamentally if the ultimate goal is to always have this partnership between human beings and machines, or is the ultimate goal that, well, we just come to rely on the machines because the human mind is just going to be contaminating, it’s going to be so, so behind that it is absurd. It is going to be a nominal, token presence, like one night watchman in a stadium full of machines.
The AI researchers that I talk to are trying to build things that are, in every way, as smart as us. It’s unclear what happens after that.
This will be a major challenge for us, I think. If it is the case that this isn't like the traditional rounds of automation where you know one set of jobs disappear but new sets of jobs appear—and a lot of people think it isn't—we will have to rethink the way we've run our societies for centuries. That old system where each of us contributes to a larger enterprise, and we get paid, and then we use that money to fund our private lives and feed our families and so on, that system is going to have to be rethought.
And not just in terms of the material way we distribute money and stuff but also in terms of prestige and a sense of self-respect.
I think one of the things that we do seem to have very hardwired into us as human beings is this need to contribute to the larger community around us. If I don't do it, I feel bad in some kind of way and I'm also inclined to think badly of people who don't.
The big question I would have about all of this is how do we build forums in which one can have this discussion in a meaningful way.
Do you have any ideas for how to do that?
Ha, no, I don’t. Because, you know, out of necessity we're talking about something that is global and international. It's not a good time for international institutions at the moment. Also, to what extent are the people who really know willing to encourage meaningful discussion, or to give out information so we can have a meaningful discussion?
I don't think the people in Silicon Valley, or wherever they are, are a monolithic group that would all hold the same view on this. Different people have different views and possibly they have different interests, but what I would ask is what do they want from the rest of us?
Returning to the book, Klara is quite a likable character, for an AI. Should technologists try to make sure their creations are as nice?
One of the things is that it may be difficult to predict whether the AI program or the robot is going to be what we would define as nice or not. As you know, reinforcement learning just relies on that central reward function, and I understand there is this term called overfitting, which is that it behaves in a way that we wouldn't quite predict. It goes about trying to fulfill its goal in a way that actually is very destructive to us.
Maybe you can give AI these kinds of Isaac Asimov type rules, maybe you could do something like that, but I can't see it. I mean, and we can't decide amongst ourselves, without robots, what is desirable, what is nice and what isn't. In the country you're living in, even the question of what freedom, or what democracy, means [isn’t clear]. A lot of people think freedom means that you riot in the Capitol building to reinstate democracy.
The big thing I'm trying to say is, how do we get the conversation going? Different parts of our culture have roles to play. I think people who write books, people who make these blockbuster television series, have quite a big role to play. And I think there have been some very interesting TV series, like Westworld, that kind of raise these questions. But you know we need the conversation to get more urgent and more serious.
The past year has, of course, been incredibly difficult and different. Has it been an inspiration to you as a novelist?
One thing I have to say about the pandemic is that a staggering number of people have died, and this is something that I don't think we've quite kind of woken up to. We're talking about a scale of death that is just extraordinary. Right now there are millions of people around the world kind of shocked and bereaved having lost somebody close to them. And I think the emotional damage of this is going to be colossal.
But we’re focusing, and it's understandable, on how the high street might change and Zoom and working from home. But the big, big thing about this is this level of death. In Britain, you know over 130,000 people died in the past year, which is more than twice the civilian death toll of the Second World War. I heard one commentator say recently that the half a million dead mark in the United States means that it’s more dead than the combination of the two world wars and Vietnam.
I don't think we can go through a situation like this where so many people have died, and so many people are bereaved, and there is a sense that things were not done correctly, without something. Without actually there being a major consequence of that. And I'm not quite sure what that is.
The other thing, I wouldn't say it's an inspiration, it's just what I've observed, is that there is this kind of strange contradictory thing happening—these two different versions of the truth or how you look for the truth seem to come to the fore with a vengeance in the last few months.
On the one hand, we've come to rely desperately on the scientific method where people say, show me the evidence, peer review the evidence. And at the same time we have a situation where half of the people in the United States believe that Donald Trump won the election but had it stolen from him because they wish to believe it. The idea is that the truth is what you wish to believe. Feel it emotionally strongly enough in your heart.
People like me have placed so much emphasis on the importance of emotional truth; I create things like novels that are supposed to kind of move people. And it has made me kind of pause a moment. Looking at these two completely opposed attitudes to coexisting in a massive way in our lives at the moment, I kind of wonder if I actually contributed to this idea of what you feel is the truth.
I'm conscious that we've gone a bit dark in this interview.
Yes! Klara and the Sun is supposed to be a cheerful, optimistic book!
Well, finally then, let me ask how optimistic you are about the future.
Well, I think these areas [of science and technology] that we've talked about can bring us enormous benefits. It could happen. If we can rise to the challenge of using these incredible tools in a positive way, I think we’ve got a lot to look forward to.
In terms of liberal democracy and how it's been shown to be very fragile, I don’t know, I do feel rather shaken about that. I think there are very strong competitive models now to liberal democracy that weren't around 30 years ago. And I'm not saying that, you know, things like artificial intelligence will actually help regimes that are not liberal democratic regimes but, I mean, that's not inconceivable.
It might take away the advantage that liberal democratic societies had over authoritarian ones or centrally planned ones. With sophisticated artificial intelligence perhaps the Soviet Union would have thrived, perhaps they would have produced more luxury goods than the West, and we would be envying their supermarket choices.
But if I have cause for optimism, it’s the optimism I tried to put into Klara and the Sun. I think there are positive aspects of human beings, and some of that I think is hardwired into us, almost in the way that things are programmed into a creature like Klara. She is kind of a reflection of human nature, and she mirrors back human society that she learns from. I picked up the parental thing—nurture and protect—but there are many things about human beings that do seem to be hardwired into us, and I think that continues to give us hope.
All these breakthroughs in science, I think they could be great. But, you know, we've got to be ready for them.

Google in collaboration with the Oxford Internet Institute launched ‘The A to Z of AI’ in Arabic, with an objective to make information on Artificial Intelligence more universally accessible. It’s a series of simple, bite-sized explainers to help everyone understand what AI is, how it works and how it’s changing the world.

Search interest for ‘artificial intelligence’ related queries on Google Search has grown due to the growing number of jobs requiring AI skills across the Middle East and North Africa in the last few months. While there’s plenty of information out there on AI, it’s not always easy to distinguish fact from fiction nor find simple explanations. Here are a few things everyone can learn through the new interactive guide:
1. AI is powering practical tools that exist all around us
You’ve probably interacted with AI without even realizing it. Artificial intelligence is the name given to any computer system taught to mimic intelligent human behaviours. These technologies show up in everyday life, whether by helping organize photos on our smartphones or planning a commute to work. They use computer programming to do tasks that have historically required considerable human intellect and work, helping make our lives more efficient. We’ve all seen major progress over the past decade, sparked by faster computers and the introduction of techniques such as machine learning.
2. AI learns from examples in the real world
Just as a child learns through many life examples, the same is true of machine learning algorithms. Datasets are large collections of “examples”, like weather data, photos or music, that we can use to train or “teach” AI. Due to their scale and complexity (think of a dataset made up of extensive maps covering the whole of the known solar system), datasets can be very challenging to build and refine. This is why AI design teams often share datasets for the benefit of the wider scientific community, making it easier to collaborate and build on each other’s research.
3. Incomplete data can lead to bias in AI
AI could form a bias when the data it’s learning from isn’t fully comprehensive and therefore starts leading it toward certain outcomes. Because data is an AI system’s only means of learning, it could end up reproducing imbalances or biases found within the original information. For example, if you were teaching AI to recognise shoes and only showed it imagery of trainers, it wouldn’t learn to recognise high heels, sandals or boots as shoes. To ensure that AI systems are ethical and reduce the risk of bias, programmers design their systems and curate their data vigilantly.
4. AI can help our efforts to spot deepfakes
“Deepfakes” are AI-generated images, speech, music or videos that look real. They work by studying existing real-world imagery or audio, mapping them in detail, then manipulating them to create works of fiction that are disconcertingly true to life. However, there are often some telltale signs that distinguish them from reality; in a deep fake video, voices might sound a bit robotic, or characters may blink less or repeat their hand gestures. AI can help us spot these inconsistencies.
5. It’s impossible to teach AI what it means to be human
As smart as AI is (and will be), it won’t be able to understand everything that humans can. In fact, you could give an AI system all the data in the world and it still wouldn’t reflect or understand, every human being on the planet. That’s because we’re complex, multidimensional characters that sit outside the data that machines use to make sense of things. AI systems are trained and guided by humans. And it’s up to each person to choose how they interact with AI systems and what information they feel comfortable sharing. You decide how much AI gets to learn about you.
‘The A-Z of AI’ guide is also available in English and in many different languages.

Artificial intelligence already recommends movies to viewers, filters spam out of inboxes and suggests friends on social media. Now the technology and some of its creators are going to work to help teachers and students in South Carolina’s K-12 education system.
Two recent projects have given researchers in Clemson University’s School of Computing  a chance to use their knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence to improve K-12 education in the state and eventually the nation. They are collaborating with researchers from the College of Education.
Nathan McNeese
Nathan McNeese and Bart Knijnenburg and their students are helping create a “recommender system” similar to the one Netflix uses to suggest movies, except theirs will help teachers choose a path for professional development.
In a separate project, Knijnenburg and Kelly Caine and their students are helping develop AI-focused education modules for middle school students. The modules will teach math while also showing how AI’s invisible but powerful algorithms track them online.
McNeese and Knijnenburg are assistant professors of human-centered computing, and Caine is Dean’s Associate Professor of human-centered computing. 
Both projects underscore how artificial intelligence is continuing to evolve to meet a growing number of needs and becoming more deeply ingrained in everyday lives.
Clemson University’s researchers are helping take the technology to the next level with projects that vary from inspecting vehicles as they travel an assembly line to detecting malware in cameras and other devices too small for anti-virus software.
Intersection of disciplines
To Clemson officials, the research is further evidence that the most interesting work happens at the intersection of disciplines.
Bart Knijnenburg
“The College of Education and the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences are coming together for interdisciplinary research that addresses some of the most critical needs in the state,” said George J. Petersen, founding dean of the College of Education. “Innovation is key to tackling education issues, and collaborations like these provide a perfect opportunity to put best-in-class innovation into action for the benefit of students, teachers, schools and communities.”
Principal investigators on both projects are faculty members in the College of Education. Jeff Marshall, associate dean of research and graduate programs in the college, is principal investigator on the recommender system research, and Nicole Bannister, associate professor of education, is principal investigator on the module research.
“This partnership brings together some of Clemson University’s best minds,” they said in a joint statement. “The knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence that Drs. McNeese, Knijnenburg and Caine and their students bring to these projects are crucial to making this research succeed. Our goal is for South Carolina’s students and teachers to ultimately benefit most. A better K-12 education system results in a healthier, happier and more prosperous society overall.”
Kelly Caine
‘Human-centered computing at its finest’
McNeese said that when the recommender system is ready for use, teachers will fill out a survey detailing their preferences and needs in professional development. Algorithms will process the data and provide the teachers with feedback.
Recommendations could include pursuing a master’s degree, a credential or an endorsement, all three of which are available through Clemson programs. 
“It’s human-centered computing at its finest,” McNeese said. “We’re going into the context, we’re talking to the user and we’re letting the user guide us with what they want and what they need. And then we’re taking that and doing the behind-the-scenes work to let them know their options. This has never been done for K-12 professional development to my knowledge.”
Knijnenburg said that he is helping create education modules for middle-school students who are online more than previous generations. Those students are leaving digital fingerprints about their interests, behavior and lives. 
“What I’m really hoping to convey is that these algorithms are making these inferences about their lives and their preferences,” he said. “You have to be careful in how you go about online, not just because other people can see it but because these algorithms are making predictions and inferences.”
Nicole Bannister
Some insurers, for example, have explored using social media data to help determine premiums, Knijnenburg said.
Also as part of the project, researchers will use the core principles students learn in their math classes to explain how algorithms work and their consequences
 The modules will be offered online, allowing researchers to capture data, but will be used by students in the physical school classroom. Students will be able to access the modules through their school-issued electronic devices.
Addressing real-world challenges
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said the recommender system and the middle-school modules underscore how the school’s researchers are using AI to address real-world challenges.
“Researchers in the School of Computing are working across disciplines to apply artificial intelligence to a broad range of applications aimed at strengthening education, industry and individual well-being,” she said. “The research we do provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work on the cutting edge of technology in a fast-growing field. Their experiences prepare them for the AI workforce of the future.”
Among those students are Christopher Flathmann and Reza Ghaiumy Anaraky, both Ph.D. students working on the recommender system.
Jeff Marshall 
Flathmann, the son of a special education teacher at Southside Christian School in Greenville, said he wants the recommender system to help get teachers the resources they need. He will have the opportunity to apply his expertise to the task.
“I am fairly good at looking at data and understanding patterns within data and seeing what we want and translating that into something that’s more understandable to people,” he said. “How do we make high-level, complicated computing things understandable to actual people? That’s what I do.”
Artificial intelligence generates a set of options, but it is equally important to communicate those options to individuals, Anaraky said.
Among the questions he is asking are: “How can we give individuals a sense of autonomy? How can we keep them in the loop and empower them to select an option that suits them best?”
Opportunities for undergraduates
The AI experience is also extending to undergraduates outside the School of Computing.
Kyra Derrick, a sophomore middle-level education major, said she recently transferred from Anderson University to Clemson University because she wanted the opportunity to study with Bannister.
Derrick, who is from Summerville, said she plans to interview middle school students about their feelings about math for the module research. 
“It’s going to be a great opportunity to just hear them,” she said. “Middle school students have a lot of thoughts, emotions and opinions. It’s going to be an amazing opportunity to let them feel heard and to be seen and for their opinion to be valued.”
Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, said the two research projects highlight how working across disciplines yields maximum impact.
“These two projects are using artificial intelligence to advance personalized learning in the K-12 education system,” he said. “Both projects serve as examples of how Clemson University research at the intersection of disciplines  is helping solve the present and future challenges that society faces in our education system, while providing world-class educational experiences for students on campus and beyond.”

The prestige that technologies enjoy among global businesses and consumers tends to obscure the mundane efforts and processes required to bring products to market. That is especially true for mass-produced hardware, including PCs and smartphones, whose success depends on watchful vendors overseeing massive, extraordinarily complex manufacturing processes.
Effective planning, scheduling and performance are vital to hitting or missing production goals and satisfying paying customers and shareholders. That is what makes Lenovo’s new Smart Production Planning System particularly intriguing. Lenovo’s solution was recently named a finalist by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) for its Franz Edelman award for operational achievement. Let’s consider it further.
Manufacturing challenges
To begin, what makes planning the manufacture of common products, such as laptop PCs, so difficult? Consider first what might be called “customer variables.” As demand and markets for tech products have evolved, vendors differentiate themselves by offering clients a wide variety of features and options to choose from.
In the case of laptops, those typically include separate brands and product families for specific use cases, such as 2-in-1s, consumer/student laptops, business solutions, gaming laptops and mobile workstations. Then there are optional choices, such as upgrades for CPU/GPU, memory, storage, displays, networking, operating systems and productivity apps. Plus, there are security and other services, warranties, accessories and peripherals.
This is all great for customers, including organizations that can effectively customize orders so that new laptops address their specific business requirements and use cases, as well as the preferences of individual users. But ensuring that those products are assembled correctly and shipped on time poses significant planning challenges.
Fulfilling customer orders typically involves dividing manufacturing processes into tasks that are assigned to specific production lines. Planning and scheduling individual tasks involve other issues, including staff availability, equipment and process status and the availability of tens of thousands of components and raw materials. Effectively managing those scenarios while avoiding known and unknowable pitfalls is what keeps factory planners up at night.
Lenovo’s AI-enabled solution for complex processes
What has Lenovo done to address these challenges? Developed by Lenovo Research, the Smart Production Planning System combines AI technologies and mathematical algorithms, including emerging sequential planning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning, into an easy-to-use optimization decision-making engine for manufacturing. The system also supports autonomous learning: The longer it runs, the smarter it gets.
The Smart Production Planning System has been deployed at Lenovo’s LCFC (HeFei) Electronics Technology facility, the company’s largest global research and manufacturing base. The LCFC’s thousands of employees fulfilled 690,000 customer orders last year, utilizing unique production processes and more than 300,000 different materials to produce over 500 specific PC products.
So how did the Smart Production Planning System do? According to Lenovo, manufacturing planning processes at the LCFC have been reduced from six hours to 90 seconds. Additionally, key performance indicators have also improved significantly. The LCFC facility’s order fulfillment rate has increased by 20 percent and productivity has increased by 18 percent.
The System also supports large-scale collaboration and multi-objective tasks, such as real-time adjustment and configuration according to users’ specific production objectives. LCFC workers can also set hyper-parameters on the System, such as prioritizing individual manufacturing segments’ production goals to keep them aligned with shifts in demand and the manufacturing environment.
Final analysis
According to Lenovo, the Smart Production Planning System at the LCFC is the first time in the industry that AI technology has been deployed to enhance large-scale production scheduling operations. The results are clearly positive, and it will be fascinating to see how the System’s autonomous learning capabilities impact production over time.
The solution reflects well on Lenovo Research and should continue to positively impact the company’s production efficiency and bottom line. Just as importantly, as the System evolves, it should open new commercial opportunities for the company’s service and solution-led efforts in vertical industries. In fact, it seems highly likely that other large-scale manufacturers will want to capture the same kinds of efficiency and performance benefits that the Smart Production Planning System is already providing to Lenovo.

In a perfect world, what you see is what you get. If this were the case, the job of artificial intelligence systems would be refreshingly straightforward.
Take collision avoidance systems in self-driving cars. If visual input to on-board cameras could be trusted entirely, an AI system could directly map that input to an appropriate action — steer right, steer left, or continue straight — to avoid hitting a pedestrian that its cameras see in the road.
But what if there’s a glitch in the cameras that slightly shifts an image by a few pixels? If the car blindly trusted so-called “adversarial inputs,” it might take unnecessary and potentially dangerous action.
A new deep-learning algorithm developed by MIT researchers is designed to help machines navigate in the real, imperfect world, by building a healthy “skepticism” of the measurements and inputs they receive.
The team combined a reinforcement-learning algorithm with a deep neural network, both used separately to train computers in playing video games like Go and chess, to build an approach they call CARRL, for Certified Adversarial Robustness for Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The researchers tested the approach in several scenarios, including a simulated collision-avoidance test and the video game Pong, and found that CARRL performed better — avoiding collisions and winning more Pong games — over standard machine-learning techniques, even in the face of uncertain, adversarial inputs.
“You often think of an adversary being someone who’s hacking your computer, but it could also just be that your sensors are not great, or your measurements aren’t perfect, which is often the case,” says Michael Everett, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro). “Our approach helps to account for that imperfection and make a safe decision. In any safety-critical domain, this is an important approach to be thinking about.”
Everett is the lead author of a study outlining the new approach, which appears in IEEE’s Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. The study originated from MIT PhD student Björn Lütjens’ master’s thesis and was advised by MIT AeroAstro Professor Jonathan How.
Possible realities
To make AI systems robust against adversarial inputs, researchers have tried implementing defenses for supervised learning. Traditionally, a neural network is trained to associate specific labels or actions with given inputs. For instance, a neural network that is fed thousands of images labeled as cats, along with images labeled as houses and hot dogs, should correctly label a new image as a cat.
In robust AI systems, the same supervised-learning techniques could be tested with many slightly altered versions of the image. If the network lands on the same label — cat — for every image, there’s a good chance that, altered or not, the image is indeed of a cat, and the network is robust to any adversarial influence.
But running through every possible image alteration is computationally exhaustive and difficult to apply successfully to time-sensitive tasks such as collision avoidance. Furthermore, existing methods also don’t identify what label to use, or what action to take, if the network is less robust and labels some altered cat images as a house or a hotdog.
“In order to use neural networks in safety-critical scenarios, we had to find out how to take real-time decisions based on worst-case assumptions on these possible realities,” Lütjens says.
The best reward
The team instead looked to build on reinforcement learning, another form of machine learning that does not require associating labeled inputs with outputs, but rather aims to reinforce certain actions in response to certain inputs, based on a resulting reward. This approach is typically used to train computers to play and win games such as chess and Go.
Reinforcement learning has mostly been applied to situations where inputs are assumed to be true. Everett and his colleagues say they are the first to bring “certifiable robustness” to uncertain, adversarial inputs in reinforcement learning.
Their approach, CARRL, uses an existing deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm to train a deep Q-network, or DQN — a neural network with multiple layers that ultimately associates an input with a Q value, or level of reward.
The approach takes an input, such as an image with a single dot, and considers an adversarial influence, or a region around the dot where it actually might be instead. Every possible position of the dot within this region is fed through a DQN to find an associated action that would result in the most optimal worst-case reward, based on a technique developed by recent MIT graduate student Tsui-Wei “Lily” Weng PhD ’20.
An adversarial world
In tests with the video game Pong, in which two players operate paddles on either side of a screen to pass a ball back and forth, the researchers introduced an “adversary” that pulled the ball slightly further down than it actually was. They found that CARRL won more games than standard techniques, as the adversary’s influence grew.
“If we know that a measurement shouldn’t be trusted exactly, and the ball could be anywhere within a certain region, then our approach tells the computer that it should put the paddle in the middle of that region, to make sure we hit the ball even in the worst-case deviation,” Everett says.


In a game of Pong, MIT researchers show that, with perfect measurements, a standard deep learning algorithm is able to win most games (left). But in a scenario where the measurements are influenced by an “adversary” that shifts the ball’s position by a few pixels (middle), the computer easily beats the standard algorithm. The team’s new algorithm, CARRL, handles such adversarial attacks, or manipulations to measurements, winning against the computer, even though it doesn't know exactly where the ball is. Courtesy of the researchers

The method was similarly robust in tests of collision avoidance, where the team simulated a blue and an orange agent attempting to switch positions without colliding. As the team perturbed the orange agent’s observation of the blue agent’s position, CARRL steered the orange agent around the other agent, taking a wider berth as the adversary grew stronger, and the blue agent’s position became more uncertain.
There did come a point when CARRL became too conservative, causing the orange agent to assume the other agent could be anywhere in its vicinity, and in response completely avoid its destination. This extreme conservatism is useful, Everett says, because researchers can then use it as a limit to tune the algorithm’s robustness. For instance, the algorithm might consider a smaller deviation, or region of uncertainty, that would still allow an agent to achieve a high reward and reach its destination.
In addition to overcoming imperfect sensors, Everett says CARRL may be a start to helping robots safely handle unpredictable interactions in the real world.
“People can be adversarial, like getting in front of a robot to block its sensors, or interacting with them, not necessarily with the best intentions,” Everett says. “How can a robot think of all the things people might try to do, and try to avoid them? What sort of adversarial models do we want to defend against? That’s something we’re thinking about how to do.”
This research was supported, in part, by Ford Motor Company as part of the Ford-MIT Alliance.

As more and more technologies invaded the digital evolution, the possibilities to record geospatial data became easier. Beneath the digital transformation, geospatial intelligence is where perception and reality merges. However, the future of geospatial intelligence opens door to artificial intelligence and 3D..Geospatial intelligence is the information derived from an analysis of images and data associated with a particular location. The technology uses imagery to survey and assess human activity and physical geography anywhere on earth. Initially, the US military used geospatial intelligence to function in a better way. Soon, the technology was adopted across many countries and for different means. Today, geospatial intelligence is being used for energy transmission, smart cities, military bases, etc. The role of geospatial intelligence is becoming more vital in the digital world. As a part of technological evolution, artificial intelligence and 3D has made an influence on geospatial intelligence recently. AI and 3D printing are changing the fundamental way of how IT solutions are implemented and operated across all application domains, including geospatial intelligence..In order to capture reality, technology is being implemented in various domains. Applications of sensors, robotics, cameras, machine learning, encryption, cloud computing and other software, and hardware intelligence are shifting the way we perceive the routine. Henceforth, geospatial intelligence goes beyond satellite imagery and creates 3D point clouds with the help of LIDAR scans. They represent real-life objects in digital means. But the existing geospatial capture methods are painfully slow to analyze manually. To relieve humans from the lengthy labour work, artificial intelligence and 3D makes their way into geospatial intelligence. AI, along with computer vision can help people generate insights from 3D data with the help of cloud computing and storage. Besides recording the real-time happenings, geospatial intelligence along with AI and 3D printing can move further and analyze, and make predictions on natural disasters. They can prevent natural calamities like wildfire, assist humans during critical times and respond quickly to disasters..3D point cloud and digital twin.3D digital cloud has the capability to represent almost any type of physical object, site, landscape, geographic region, or infrastructure. The technology comes with a handful of benefits like environmental monitoring, disaster management, urban planning, building information models or self-driving vehicles. In a nutshell, 3D point clouds are used as base data for reconstructing 3D models..On the other hand, digital twins are virtual models that connect the virtual and physical world at a point. While the bottom line of the virtual and physical world is handled by sensors, the virtual models have to be derived from the physical counterparts. For example, 3D clouds are used to derive 3D indoor models, which are essential components for real-time building information models together with sensor network and IoT devices. In general, 3D point clouds represent the key components of geospatial digital twins. These real-world digital twin models include 3D terrain, vegetation, buildings, and infrastructures like power lines, roads, and waterworks..Geospatial intelligence in environmental epidemiology.The traces of geospatial intelligence along with AI and 3D printing have unravelled a world where the technologies can be specifically applied to environmental epidemiology. In 2020 and 2021, a record-breaking number of wildfires have been recorder in the western nations. The famous California fires were one of the pivotal things that made authorities think about a technological means to counter the natural disaster. Geospatial intelligence can provide a digital view of the physical world, and when paired with AI and 3D printing, it gives stakeholders the informational edge they need to prevent, battle, and recover from wildfires. Geospatial AI technologies have the ability to automatically build and continuously update high-resolution wildfire maps in real-time..Besides, geospatial intelligence combined with AI and 3D printing can detect hurricane hotspots. The model has data on weather such as rainfall, winds, and flooding. This can alert authorities on any expected mishaps. The data also provides an insight into the damage of buildings, transportation, and downed power lines..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

We have computer systems and software making our jobs less labor-focused. Work after a decade from now won't be the same either. Innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics along with the disruption that came along with COVID-19 are reshaping the future of work..The coronavirus pandemic changed the physical distribution of the workforce by making employees work remotely. This rapid restructuring of the workforce accelerated what was underway long before the pandemic at its own pace. In the past 10 years, the number of remote employees increased by 91% according to FlexJobs 2019 report. The number of gig workers/ on-call workers/temporary workers has also increased by 15% since 2020 according to the ADP 2020 report. Another growing trend aiding the first two is the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace..Workplace Transformation .Since evolution, the way humans worked has undergone several transformations. The steady rise of technology, right from the invention of computers to digitization has not only reshaped how we work but also where we work from, the nature of the job roles, and the skills required for the role. At this rate, the industry leaders will be required to come up with innovative solutions that will support the evolution of work in the future..Let's deep dive into the catalysts of change..How &amp; Where We Work: When mobiles were invented, they were merely a device to make phone calls. Today, smartphones are used by employees as portals to advanced software and data management tools. A recent study showed that 87% of companies required employees to have access to mobile business apps from their smartphones. Thanks to portable devices like laptops and tablets augmented with AI and other digital systems, employees became more distant from office desks. They can now work from wherever they are and focus their minds on innovative solutions rather than mundane tasks..Changing Job Roles: As more and more companies adopt AI for their business functions, demand for job roles that are knowledge-based and cognitive. While there are rumors going that AI will push humans towards unemployment, a 2018 WEF report suggests that while AI is abolishing traditional job roles, digitization is creating up to 133 million new job roles by 2022..Demand For New Skills: As workplaces are digitizing their operations, the need for knowledge-intensive tasks is increasing. From 2000 to 2019, the rate of employees with graduate-level education increased from 24% to 42% and the need for complex problem solving and innovative thinking skills rose to 20%. Of course, the need for knowledge of working around computer systems is obvious..The reality of dynamic technology and market changes is becoming more evident than ever. Companies are increasingly prioritizing their functions in order of efficiency, personalization, and flexibility. Contract workers, remote workers, and consultants are becoming a significant segment of the workforce. Instead of hiring employees with basic skills to be physically working out of a permanent office, the new trend is to form dynamic teams based on task-oriented skills that are capable of working with a less centralized and hierarchical structure..Another trend that is already being adopted by companies but has a long way to go with further innovations in AI. By automating tasks and minimizing human errors, AI is taking over mundane repetitive tasks. This is allowing employees to focus on problem-solving and creative tasks. AI-powered systems can analyze and interpret big data and huge pools of datasets for accurate business decisions..The Future Of Work Is Improving The Society .With businesses across industries welcoming technology and making it an active part of the work, they are enabling employee upskilling which is empowering today's society and reshaping the future. Integrating AI and digital solutions into the workplace requires companies to give specialized training to all its staff which improves employee satisfaction, reduces their work stress, and pressurizes academic institutions to revamp their syllabus to teach the future generation necessary skills to join the future workforce which, more likely than now, will involve co-existing with AI bots and machines..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
