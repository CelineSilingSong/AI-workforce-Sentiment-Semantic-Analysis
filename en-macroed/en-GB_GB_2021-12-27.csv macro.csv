The role of artificial intelligence in the future of content


AI will play a key role in the future of content, as it can simplify tasks, create new business apps and improve file storage. But these changes won't happen overnight.

Rather than simple text and images, modern content management encompasses different types of information -- like photos, interactive graphics, videos, audio and other digitized assets -- that systems can assemble dynamically.







Modern content management serves a business purpose and streamlines how organizations create and distribute digital experiences. And, in the future of content management, AI plays a key role. Organizations must control the content that travels through their networks to improve digital work and create business value, which may mean embracing more advanced technologies.

The state of content management
Initially, content management sought to separate technical tasks -- like website launches -- from editorial tasks, like information updates. Web administrators and IT support staff also needed easy ways to hand off routine chores, like webpage maintenance, to nontechnical users, which content management made easier.
Over the years, aspects of content management have evolved, including types of content and required skills, relevant tools and storage.
Types of content and required skills
Content management continues to support two audiences: technical professionals and line-of-business users. Yet, content has evolved from information on static webpages into dynamic experiences across multiple devices, business channels and customer touchpoints.
The content evolution developed new tasks, which require new business roles. And, within IT and line-of-business groups, more professionals with different technical and nontechnical skills perform computational tasks, produce content and embrace innovative business apps.
With those innovative business apps, digital marketers, sales executives and other line-of-business managers expect to combine content from disparate sources for purpose-built apps. For example, marketers can launch digital campaigns with interactive webpages, targeted emails and personalized offers based on buyers' intent.
Tools and storage
Content management no longer limits file storage to self-contained repositories and content to predefined webpages, but encompasses multiple cloud-based repositories.
A modern approach to content management supports the following four key computational capabilities known as MACH:

Microservices. Microservices can locate content stored within repositories and perform other discrete functions.
APIs. Content management uses open web standards to support APIs, which can interconnect disparate repositories to develop new apps.
Cloud environments. Organizations can store content in cloud environments.
Headless services. Content management supports headless back-end services, so the technology doesn't assume how webpages present or display information.






The roles of artificial intelligence and machine learning
AI encompasses many computational capabilities to create and analyze information. Organizations can use AI and machine learning (ML) to recognize patterns in data and metadata in the following ways:

Natural language processing combines computational linguistics and other techniques to extract meaning from text.
Predictive and prescriptive ML algorithms calculate the best actions to respond to queries, tasks or activities.
Image recognition analyzes patterns in images or videos to distinguish objects, matches patterns against available information and analyzes metadata to identify what the images or videos contain.
Audio and speech recognition algorithms analyze wave patterns in audio streams to determine words, tone-of-voice, music and other acoustic characteristics.

While AI algorithms require employees with the expertise to implement and maintain them, this technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. Instead, organizations tie AI to predefined tasks and activities to save workers time and effort.
Independent software vendors, ranging from industry stalwarts to startups, embed AI capabilities in their tools. They condense specific algorithms into microservices, making these services accessible through APIs, and rely on cloud connections to control content flows.
To develop content-powered apps, organizations must focus on app integration. AI aims to create next-generation business apps with microservices and APIs connected through cloud environments to back-end content repositories -- a MACH-based architecture. This architecture could simplify how AI integrates into content flows from disparate sources, like apps, and weaves together metadata.





Predictions for AI and the future of content
AI can make apps more useful, but organizations won't produce content-powered apps overnight. Organizations should consider four trends to assess how AI will affect operations to prepare for the future.
Content enrichment
Content management depends on explicit and implicit metadata. As organizations develop business apps, they define metadata categories through information architectures.
AI algorithms can automate metadata management to read through documents, scan images, extract meaning from text, recognize objects within digital assets and assign relevant categories to content. AI can enable app developers to access more relevant content to build smarter apps.
Micro-experiences
AI can create micro-experiences to automate tasks, actions and activities.
With a shoppable content micro-experience, customers could buy items directly in an app without a storefront or website. For example, a person might see a sweater in a photo, tap it and then buy it -- all without visiting the brand's website.
Similarly, writers may rely on writing support tools to check spelling and grammar, get advice on tone-of-voice, verify brand terminology, check style guidelines and recommend revisions. AI could expedite editorial tasks that proofreaders and editors typically perform and reduce production costs.
Smart processes
With MACH, content management could combine content from more disparate sources, and AI could make that content actionable.



Even with innovative AI-powered tools, human insight matters.




Thus, compliance teams may rely on AI to monitor and decrypt large document collections stored within content repositories. Marketing teams can automatically verify digital image rights before they approve them for distribution, add them to websites and include them in advertising campaigns.
However, organizations may struggle to design smart processes that separate business problems into tasks, combine content from disparate sources and determine how AI algorithms can enhance work. Additionally, organizations must focus on people and how they handle processes.
New roles
Even with innovative AI-powered tools, human insight matters. Organizations will require new roles for employees, contractors and business partners beyond the technical and line-of-business silos.
Instead, these roles should add specialized skills that combine computational and business expertise to work with innovative content management technologies. Improving work could lead to next-generation content-powered apps, staffed and managed with human intelligence.


Key takeaways
As content has evolved, so have the skills and tools required to manage it. In the future, AI and ML will help enrich content, develop micro-experiences, enable smart processes and create new roles for employees. But this isn't a change that will happen overnight. Instead, organizations must prepare for a steady and inevitable progression.

(Left: Austrian National Library/Google Arts and Culture; right: Belvedere/Google Arts and Culture)By  Kelsey AblesDecember 29, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. ESTGustav Klimt’s 1900 painting “Philosophy” might have been remembered as a pivotal artwork. Made at a turning point in the artist’s career, it was vividly colored, dramatically composed — even provocative in its blatant nudity and unflinching emotion. But in 1945, the work was destroyed in a fire and essentially lost to history.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFor decades, only black-and-white photographs of “Philosophy” existed. Now, thanks to artificial intelligence, we can see the work in full color. But does the re-creation really look like the original? Does it even look like a Klimt?The new version, created by Google Arts and Culture using machine learning, shows a very different Klimt than you’d expect if you’re familiar with “The Kiss” or “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” On the left side of the canvas, interwoven, nude bodies create a fleshy, blue-hued form that looks almost bruised. On the right, an expressionless, algae-colored sphinx dominates a lurid green sky. A glance at the colors in the reconstructed work, and you might mistake Klimt for his Fauvist contemporaries or think he was hanging around with the painter Marc Chagall.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Philosophy” is one of three massive “faculty paintings” that the Austrian painter (1862-1918) created for the University of Vienna’s assembly hall ceiling and that were lost in a fire at the end of World War II. Earlier this year, Franz Smola, a curator at Vienna’s Belvedere Museum, which has the largest Klimt collection in the world, guided the paintings’ “recoloring” for the Google Arts and Culture “Klimt vs. Klimt” exhibition online.🖼️Follow ArtFollow“I don’t know any better than Google what those paintings really look like, but I don’t think that they looked like that,” says Jane Kallir, longtime director of the Galerie St. Etienne in New York, which gave Klimt his first shows in the United States. “These things look like cartoons. They don’t look like Klimt paintings.“It’s like people who try to clone their dogs. You can do it, but it’s not the same dog.”The faculty paintings are one of several recent attempts to use artificial intelligence to re-create lost art. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam used AI to reconstruct missing panels from the edges of Rembrandt’s famous “Night Watch” and, over the summer, temporarily installed them alongside the real thing. A pair of researchers in the United Kingdom, who call themselves Oxia Palus, say they’ve rebuilt a Picasso nude that was hidden beneath “The Blind Man’s Meal,” using 3-D printing and AI. In October, an orchestra in Bonn, Germany, “played” Beethoven’s 10th and unfinished symphony in full. The version was written by an algorithm.Crypto artists have been building a rebellious, underground community of outsiders for years. Now they’re making a living selling NFTs.George Cann, co-founder of Oxia Palus, posits that artificial intelligence “could give us this parallel alternative universe of art that we never really quite had.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s an alluring idea. Peek beneath a Picasso at an earlier painting under the surface layer and it’s like you’re peering into the artist’s mind, eavesdropping on thoughts from a century ago. See a painting that was lost to catastrophe come back to life and it’s like you’ve traveled back in time, reversed fate. But if any of this re-created universe of lost art, like “Philosophy,” is inaccurate, the AI creators might not be resurrecting history but inadvertently rewriting it.Klimt’s faculty paintings make a particularly compelling case for the kind of rediscovery promised by AI.In 1894, Austria’s Ministry of Education commissioned Klimt to paint allegories representing the disciplines of Medicine, Philosophy and Jurisprudence, expecting he’d use the same traditional mural style that he was known for around Vienna. That’s not what they received. Klimt painted chaotic, dark images of suffering. A sick-looking, motley crew appears in “Medicine,” and “Jurisprudence,” which shows a gaunt man beneath three glamorous, gold-clad judges, seems to depict not the law’s strengths but its elitism.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe works were lambasted by academics who suspected Klimt was mocking their disciplines and by conservative politicians who believed the depictions of female sexuality and nudity would incite immoral behavior. Klimt bought back the paintings from the state and never again did a public commission.It was a watershed moment in the artist’s career. With the faculty paintings, Smola says, Klimt “started for the first time to do his own thing, to go his own way,” adding that, had they survived, they would be displayed in museums as landmarks of European Symbolist art.That was part of the impetus to recolor the works with AI. Emil Wallner, a researcher at Google, built the algorithm. He used 100,000 art historical references and programmed it to have a bias toward Klimt’s style. For his part, Smola combed through articles and texts where writers responded to the faculty paintings, seeking an objective sense of color in the subjective writing of criticism.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThroughout the process, Smola had to make bold choices, such as instructing the AI to color “Jurisprudence’s” background red, a decision made after discovering that one of Klimt’s biggest critics noted that “Jurisprudence” featured the colors of the German flag.Wallner says that in the recolored paintings, he saw a new, “rebellious” side of Klimt. “When you see his most famous works like “The Kiss” and the gold [period] artworks, it can be easy to forget his spirit and who he was as a person,” he says.But for Kallir, there is little of Klimt in what she calls the “gaudy” re-creations, adding that the paintings would have been more subdued, with smoother transitions from one color to the next.Story continues below advertisement“If you’ve got a decent eye, and you look at the black-and-white reproductions and compare them to other paintings that were done around the same time, you can probably get a better idea of what they really look like,” she says.Each application of AI to art has different levels of rigor. To reconstruct Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” Rob Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum, collected 55 terabytes of data, collaborated with the museum’s art historians, and used a copy of the original painting as a reference. All to give visitors, he says, “the sense — if they squinted — of what the [‘Night Watch’] might have looked like if it had not been cut down.”But terms like “digital restoration” can confer a misleading legitimacy. To make a 3-D re-creation of the Picasso underpainting, Oxia Palus used an X-ray available online and guided its algorithm with paintings from the artist’s broad “Blue Period.” They didn’t talk to art historians about the original work, but told CNN that “the treasure [Picasso has] hidden for future generations is finally being revealed.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementKenneth Brummel, who co-curated the new exhibition “Picasso: Painting the Blue Period” at the Art Gallery of Ontario, has reservations about Oxia Palus’s approach, noting that to re-create a canvas’s surface, they would need information accessible only to the museum that owns the work.“My concern about the methods used here is [not just] that there is incomplete data,” Brummel says, “but also that the algorithms that are used are based on a group of individuals’ arbitrary and highly subjective selection of works of art that they deem to be related.”Brummel’s exhibition explores technical methods used to learn more about Picasso’s underpainting, including advanced microscopy and spectroscopic imaging. He says he prefers to present the raw scientific data because it allows visitors to draw their own conclusions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Part of the beauty of providing a narrative that is incomplete is that you’re inviting others to participate,” he says.From one perspective, mechanically reproducing lost art does the opposite: It offers a clean answer where there are none, and relies on the predictable when the beauty is, often, in the unexpected.“Whether it’s an artist or a composer or whatever, there is such a thing as genius,” Kallir says. “The reason that we are awestruck by a Beethoven symphony or a Klimt painting is because they had something that’s inimitable.”

From a technology that was looked at with mistrust as promises pushed it as a replacement for medical professionals, AI has grown into the second set of eyes that never need to sleep.Artificial intelligence, AI in medical diagnosis, and healthcare gives dependable support to overworked medical practitioners and institutions, reducing workload pressure and increasing practitioner efficiency.Artificial Intelligence’s Significance in Reducing Physician WorkloadPhysician burnout is a serious issue. Many medical professionals’ performance is being harmed by weariness and overwork. Physicians are quitting their professions, straining to provide high-quality patient care while dealing with complicated emotional issues.Long hours, heavy workloads, and a lack of support are all contributing factors. Physicians make difficult and life-changing choices daily, yet they frequently lack the space or time to efficiently manage their duties. The data in the latest Medscape National Physician Burnout and Suicide Report 2020 highlighted the dangers of putting too much pressure on doctors, particularly those juggling families, retirement plans, and the intricacies of their employment.This is where artificial intelligence (AI) can help. AI-based medical diagnosis, when designed with purpose, may not only relieve strain on clinicians when working with massive amounts of data and imaging, but it can also take on a substantial portion of the administrative burden.Medical practitioners may benefit from the correct technologies, which have been built expressly for the healthcare industry, to help them handle rising amounts of data, information, and imagery.With solutions designed to reduce stress and enhance time spent with patients, AI may give meaningful help to busy physicians.Applications and Use of AI in Medical Diagnosis1. Diseases Are IdentifiedTo effectively identify ailments, years of medical training are necessary. Diagnostics, on the other hand, can be a difficult and time-consuming process. In many fields, the demand for knowledge far outnumbers the available supply. This puts doctors under a great deal of stress, and it frequently leads to delays in life-saving patient diagnoses.Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Deep Learning algorithms, have recently made great progress in autonomously recognizing ailments, decreasing the cost of diagnostics, and making them more accessible.2. Drug DiscoveryAI has previously proven to be effective in all four stages of drug development:Stage 1: Identifying intervention targetsStage 2: Identifying pharmacological possibilitiesStage 3: Increasing the speed of clinical studiesStage 4: Identifying biomarkers for illness diagnosisDrug development is a famously costly procedure. Machine Learning can improve the efficiency of many of the analytical techniques used in drug development. This might save years of labor and hundreds of millions of dollars in investments.3. Neurotechnology and Bioelectronic MedicineThe domains of bioelectronic medicine and neurotechnology are two of the most interesting uses of AI in medical diagnosis. These domains make use of the massive quantities of data generated by the human brain and nervous system, which is exactly the type of challenge AI excels at addressing.We can train algorithms to make sense of neurological data using machine learning. Electrical impulses are used by our bodies to communicate between different sections of the brain as well as between the brain and the spinal cord or peripheral nervous system. To filter out the noise and attach meaning to the signals we detect, we need a lot of processing capacity to interpret them.Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested and years of labor have been put in.Challenges With Medical Datasets“Medical datasets” have one major obstacle: data scarcity. Even more so, there is a lack of data from the medical category, which is what we are most interested in forecasting using the models we create.Due to a lack of data, two major issues arise: class imbalance and the need to curate the test set. Other industries, such as manufacturing, may face similar issues. In manufacturing, for example, class imbalance occurs when the number of faulty components is considerably fewer than the number of non-defective components.EndNoteArtificial intelligence is already helping us to diagnose diseases more effectively , create pharmaceuticals, personalize therapy, and even modify DNA.But this is only the beginning. The more we digitize and integrate our medical data, the more AI can help us spot important patterns: patterns that can be utilized to make right, cost-effective decisions in complex analytical operations.

Artificial Intelligence is the science and practice of designing software and intelligent systems that exhibit artificial intelligent behavior. The main field of AI is machine learning – the ability for a machine to learn from experience – the machine can analyze data to generate an outcome.
The classic example is a baby. If we feed it images and sounds and say that it is learning then it would learn from those experiences and display the outcome, when it should, when it feels like it should. It is a very powerful concept and one that we will continue to hear a lot more about.
AI is the stuff of sci-fi films, where we see robots, called bots, and we see humanoid robots called DIMA, and we see AI machines, like Siri, and Alexa, and Cortana.
In the industry of Artificial Intelligence or AI, AI is defined as a branch of computer science that builds software, hardware, or hardware components that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI is similar to software that can do things that a human being can do.
If you can’t make decisions as quickly as you want in a limited timeframe and don’t have all the relevant data you need to make those decisions, then you’d better start finding ways to automate that process. That’s why “AI” is such a buzzword right now.
Top Five Things You Need to Know About Artificial Intelligence


 It’s here to stay


Although AI has been around for decades, it hasn’t been widely applied. However, there is a strong push in recent years by companies such as Google and Microsoft to make the technology more commonplace by making it affordable for all businesses.
Just as smartphones came with the capacity to make calls, they also came with the ability to make and receive calls. And, just as today’s smartphones have powerful applications that make them indispensable, today’s business tools will have the ability to serve as powerful tools for a variety of uses — from inventory management to customer service and more.


 AI will speed your processes


If your processes are already organized and streamlined, chances are there’s not much that AI can do to improve them. However, if your processes aren’t organized at all, then AI can help a great deal.
As you know, data is king. However, collecting data is labor-intensive. And, the more data you have, the longer it takes to analyze it and come up with answers.
That’s where AI comes in. That’s because machines can think and make decisions much faster and more efficiently than humans.
For example, consider customer service. When you have a customer service representative who has worked with hundreds of customers, their skills become very valuable. However, it can be hard to give them the attention they need to do their job effectively.
When you have AI monitoring your customer service representative’s performance, AI can provide real-time feedback so they can better serve your customers.


 AI can improve your quality


We live in a very competitive world today. Customers are more discerning than ever and are not impressed with business just because it’s in their backyard. But, to stand out, businesses need to provide better quality and service.
In the same vein, businesses are going to need to provide better quality and service if they’re going to have better results from their marketing campaigns.
However, many businesses don’t have the expertise to do this type of work well. And, they can’t afford to hire more salespeople or marketing specialists to deliver more quality and service than they’re currently providing.
AI is now making it possible to turn most business problems into data problems, where AI’s ability to think and solve problems can be put to good use.


 AI can make your workforce more productive


As the productivity of the workforce declines, businesses are looking for ways to make the workforce more productive and decrease costs.
In fact, according to the research-by-research group, McKinsey, roughly half of workers in many companies are either over-or under-utilized. As these workers perform the same job but have different levels of productivity, there’s wasted revenue.
But AI is helping to remove the limitations of the workforce, allowing workers to do more with less.
Consider Amazon, which has an estimated 40,000 robots working in its warehouses, taking the jobs of the millions of employees in the company.
Robots can perform their tasks with much more efficiency, allowing them to produce the same results with a fraction of the workforce.


 AI is learning and developing its own capabilities


AI is a very unpredictable and ever-changing field. Since it’s new and isn’t well understood by most business leaders, you can’t be sure what tomorrow’s AI might be capable of.
However, what is for certain is that AI’s ability to learn will continue to expand.
Research company, Tractica, estimates that AI applications will generate roughly $3.9 trillion of revenue globally by 2025. This is a $2.3 trillion increase from 2017’s estimate. And, it’s a 57% increase from 2016.
That’s a pretty remarkable growth curve. It’s so astounding that one of the world’s leading venture capital firms, CapitalG, invested over $400 million in AI companies.
Its Effect on Humanity
Now we are going to discuss how artificial intelligence is good or bad for humanity-
Bad Effects

There will be huge social changes that will disrupt our way of life in the human community. Humans have to work hard to earn a living, but with artificial intelligence, we can simply program machines to do something for us without having to pick up tools. Human intimacy will gradually diminish as AI replaces the need for people to meet and exchange ideas in person. AI will stand amongst people as it will no longer require face-to-face meetings to communicate.
Unemployment is next as many jobs will be replaced by machines. Many automobile assembly lines today are full of machines and robots, leaving traditional workers out of work. Even supermarkets don’t need shopkeepers anymore because digital devices can outperform human labor.
Wealth inequality occurs when investors receive most of their income. The gap between the rich and the poor will widen. The so-called ‘M’-shaped distribution of wealth will become clearer.
New problems arise not only in a social sense but also in AI itself, as an AI that has been trained and learned how to perform a given task can eventually move to a stage beyond human control. It leads to unexpected problems and consequences. This refers to the ability of the AI to automatically function on its own, ignoring commands provided by a human controller, after loading all necessary algorithms.
AI can invent things that are racially biased or self-centered to harm certain people. or stuff. For example, the United Nations have decided to limit the spread of nuclear power for fear of using it indiscriminately to destroy humanity or attacking certain races or regions to achieve the goal of domination. AI could cause global catastrophe by targeting specific races or some objects programmed to execute programmers’ orders of destruction.

Good Effects

However, it has many positive effects on humans, especially in the field of health care. AI gives computers the ability to learn, reason, and apply logic. Scientists, medical researchers, clinicians, mathematicians, and engineers can work together to develop AI that targets medical diagnosis and treatment to provide a reliable and secure healthcare delivery system.
As health professors and medical researchers strive to find new and effective ways to treat disease, digital computers will not only support analytics but also create robotic systems to precisely perform some delicate medical procedures.


Fast and Accurate Diagnosis 


An IBM Watson computer was used for diagnosis with surprising results. AI diagnostics are provided when data is immediately downloaded to your computer. AI can also suggest different treatments to doctors.
The procedure is as follows. By downloading the digital results of the physical examination to your computer, it considers all possibilities, automatically diagnoses whether the patient has a disability or disease, and suggests different types of available treatments.


Reduce Human Fatigue Error 


Human error in the workforce is inevitable and often costly. The higher the fatigue, the higher the risk of errors. However, Al technology does not suffer from fatigue or emotional distractions. This eliminates errors and allows you to complete tasks faster and more accurately.


Artificial Intelligence Surgery 


Artificial intelligence-based surgical procedures were a choice for people. This AI will still have to be managed by medical professionals, but it can get the job done with minimal damage to the body. The da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic technology that enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures, is now available in most hospitals.
These systems provide a higher level of precision and accuracy than manual procedures. Less invasive surgery, less trauma, and less bleeding, less anxiety for the patient.


Virtual Existence 


Virtual presence technology enables remote diagnosis of disease. The patient does not have to get out of bed, but with the help of a remote presence robot, the doctor can see the patient without actually being there. Healthcare workers can move and interact efficiently as if they were there. This allows professionals to help patients who cannot travel.

The history of human civilisation has hinged around decisions and their consequences. Although history in posterity and retrospect judges the quality of decision making, traditionally it has been well known that culture, education, upbringing, risk-taking nature, age, experience, lifestyle, occupation, character, emotional state, and circumstances have influenced decision making. It has also been discussed and debated that decision-making competences take into account human intelligence, emotional makeup, motivation, experience, risk profile, and other factors. Whether the decisions were favourable or not, there was always the feeling that more and more information, data, and planning could have provided better insights to overall improve the decision-making process.With the world of Information Technology, computers, and telecoms permeating lives and businesses more and more, the humongous amount of data, insights, and advancement in analytics, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning brought about a revolutionary change in Decision Making: the era of Decision Intelligence. Way back in 2014, as mentioned in a McKinsey research, pondered about how the C-Level Executives would work along with Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms through the decision making process: leaving objectivity to the machines and subjective and soft aspects to humans. This also called for a sea change in the working and mindset of management teams especially in terms of empowerment and de-centralisation of decision-making processes due to the democratisation of the AI, data, and insights throughout the business functions, units of the enterprise. This also necessitates up-skilling and reskilling in functional, IT, and soft skills areas.In one of the LinkedIn articles just prior to the advent COVID-19 pandemic, the term Decision Intelligence was defined as a new discipline that gives a holistic view of evaluating and selecting options. This helps people and enterprises improve their lives and business outcomes, respectively by leveraging data sciences along with managerial and social skills, managerial science into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives, their businesses, and the world around them. It is the culmination and sort of the objective and conclusion of the AI journey and encompasses all skills and tips to lead the automation and AI and ML projects in a holistic, responsible and realistic manner with contingency management.In the post-COVID era, why is there a buzz about the Decision Intelligence market?First and foremost is the size of the market. Report Linker here estimates that the global Decision Intelligence market size will reach slightly under USD 10 billion by the end of 2021 and with a CAGR of just under 10%, reach well over USD 15 Billion by 2026.Gartner has also included engineered Decision intelligence amongst their top 10 analytics and data trends for 2021. With organisations increasingly adopting common data layers and fabrics, engineered decision intelligence can be aggregated, leveraged into reusable and auditable components. Decision intelligence has also been very recently included in Gartner&rsquo;s e-book on the top 12 strategic trends that will determine the scale and future of digital transformation in 20222 and beyond.Thirdly, Decision Intelligence Systems are an increasingly widely used scenario of Super Teams: in which Artificial Intelligence works along with Humans and Robotics to create outcomes of scale, diversity and acceleration which were not possible earlier. In fact, Deloitte in one of its reports clearly mentions that Super Teams are a key driver of the latest Human Capital trends.What are the components of Decision Intelligence?As mentioned before, Decision Intelligence merges Social Science covering user requirements and desired experiences along with Data Science as well as Managerial Science to implement the insights in an actionable and accountable manner.The fundamental components hence include Artificial Intelligence ready cleaned and sanitised dataset, centralised intelligence, and learning models, actionable user interface for implementation, monitoring, review, and fine-tuning as the basic building blocks. In addition to this, in the ethos of designing the decision itself, the Project Design and Management concepts including Requirements Analysis, Specifications definition, Quality Assurance, Scenario Modelling, Security as well as business dashboards, What-if Analyses and Assumption based planning help improve efficiency, effectiveness and implementation aspects of the decision intelligence exercise.Skills such as sensitivity analysis, causal loop diagrams, statistical regression analysis, data flow diagrams, operational research, and artificial neural networks are leveraged by the decision intelligence framework.Are there any practical examples of leveraging Decision Intelligence in Asia?Tookitaki, an intelligent decision-support system for compliance programs in the financial services sector, operates across the six larger Southeast Asian countries. Banking and Telecom Companies in Asia and Worldwide use recommendation engines which is another example of decision intelligence. Netflix leverages decision intelligence to enable their consumers to scroll through the thousands of titles, basis their likes, demographics and history. A transport company was able to successfully use decision intelligence and save millions of unnecessary miles, reduce driver fatigue and satisfaction and improve retention.What does the future hold, especially for Asia?Decision Intelligence which combines Statistics, Economics, Game Theory, Design Analytics, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, User Experience, Machine Learning, and Data Science has immense potential, especially in the Asia Pacific. With a discernible gap in Data Scientists and Engineers, as well as the potential of vast automation and AI/ ML projects in the region, enterprises and teams across Asia can very well leverage Engineered Decision Making for substantial and consistent positive decision making. This coupled with the CHRO-CIO collaboration with relation to Super Teams and Digital Transformation in the APAC region, make Asia the best place to be.In the Post COVID recovery path, Decision Intelligence is indeed a critical lever for the organisational journey in this ever-so-complex world of intersecting realities and uncertainties. Decision Intelligence does indeed make immense sense!",Big Data,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574459-cio-sea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@etcio.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://ciosea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,

             It wasn't long ago that artificial intelligence (AI) started as a revolution, and the world paced up with it rapidly. Consequently, we see an evergrowing AI-focused market of possibilities, even in Bangladesh. The industry has much to offer, from a first-rate salary to diverse, hands-on research works. The story of Intelligent Machines Limited: Working with AI is engaging. Intelligent Machines Limited is one company that started with the dream of empowering Bangladesh's talented youth to solve local business problems with tech solutions. It works extensively in AI and advanced analytics to give businesses technological headway. Potential to reach unprecedented heights: ""The medicine that costs Tk 15, would you like to help make it one-tenth of its current price without compromising anything, but by making it more efficient to produce and distribute? Not for its applications in Bangladesh, you can make fundamental contributions to the core body of knowledge. Have you ever wished you could have lived in the early time of scientific discoveries? Well, you are living in one now!"" stated Oli Ahad, the founder and CEO of the company. AI needs to be normalised in the industry to allow its growth, so thinks Mr Ahad.""We are in its early start-and everyone in the ecosystem is building the blocks as they are trying to make progress. First came mechanisation, then electricity and the internet. The inventors, early adopters, regulators, and everyone in the ecosystem needed to work their ways ahead. What could help this acceleration? The understanding level grew. We should stop giving AI the special treatment that we do now, to allow the growth,"" he added. ""Engaging with local resources is also of tantamount importance. From engineering to data annotation and beyond, the more widely we empower local talent, the faster we can build a thriving AI ecosystem,"" said Tamjeed Sayeed Kashem, finance lead of the company. The recruitment process at Intelligent Machines: The brand arranges position-based coding assessments, followed by a cultural get-to-know to see if the employee is the fit for them or not, and vice versa. The recruiters hire engineers through Workera.ai and Codility to compare the performance-level of local interviewees with global interview performances taking place at brands like Google. The brand encourages employees to have business knowledge, not only technical skills. Python and MySQL are on-demand languages. One needs to be good at scripting languages like Python and know database services like MySQL. Questions for an AI Engineer's post would include deep-learning frameworks. To work with backend tech, one needs to answer data structures and algorithms-related questions. For eligibility as an analytics engineer, one needs to answer the data visualisation questions and have a good grip on Python.The journey of eGeneration: eGeneration is a Bangladeshi brand providing technological services to its clients. In addition, the company specialises in AI and machine learning. The brand has created AI-based IT solutions on national levels. Research opportunities with AI: Sabbir Arif Siddique, technical architect at eGeneration, shared his insights on the bright sides of pursuing a career in AI. Mr Siddque, a Summa Cum Laude graduate from United International University, Bangladesh, is an Erasmus Mundus, EU - Full Funded Scholar to Computational Intelligence Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. ""Research and development in artificial intelligence is now a reality in Bangladesh. A noticeable number of CSE students with experience in AI and ML (machine learning) research are finding their way into the industry. Collaboration between local brands and academia can take AI-based development to a much greater height. In addition, showcasing our local AI products to the international market will create more business opportunities. Support from the government and BASIS in this regard is significant.""AI offers cutting-edge technology. It's one of the main components of the 4th Industrial Revolution. B2B (Business-to-business) relationships, entertainment industry, educational sectors rely on AI. Every industry requires data-driven decisions. With AI, data analysis becomes a way to analyse customers' tastes. As a captive career opportunity: Why would AI be a captivating career option? AI stays as magic as its application surpasses the human brain in abilities and precision. An AI system doesn't forget while the human brain does. Pattern recognition, a way to identify anything/anyone through the analysis of their records, is one way of applying AI to numerous daily-life applications. AI also ensures job stability since there is always a demand for exploration, the trends and consumers' interests change, statistical models shift accordingly. ""AI allows you to create products that are rare yet on-demand, for example, aBangla Chatbot,"" said Mr Siddique.""I have led an AI project named 'h‡š¿i Af¨_©bv-Smart Receptionist' for ICT Division. The system can replace manual reception services in universities, hospitals, and banks. The system integrated Bangla speech synthesis, speech recognition, and automatic question answering. The system can talk in Bangla with any guest. It will identify a visitor using facial recognition and access the previous conversation in the cloud to better serve the visitor much quicker than a human receptionist,"" he added. The recruitment at eGeneration: AI projects, research projects related to Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, or other AI fields are encouraged from the applicants. Applicants need to face one written test and show their programming knowledge. A decent academic result is an added advantage. AI boosts the idea that technology is like magic. The Bangladeshi AI industry needs enthusiasts, skilled and optimistic minds to grow. Global recognition of the Bangladeshi AI industry would facilitate its development.
