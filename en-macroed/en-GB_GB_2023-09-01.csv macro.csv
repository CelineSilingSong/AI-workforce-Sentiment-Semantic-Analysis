Research suggests that the technology will indeed shake up the workplace. One study published in March found that the introduction of large language models such as ChatGPT could result in some 80 per cent of the US workforce having at least 10 per cent of their tasks affected by the technology. Nearly a fifth of workers could have at least 50 per cent of their tasks affected, and the impact is likely to be felt far beyond tech roles, in more language-intensive areas such as law, advertising and finance.

But some experts believe that the technology will not cause the jobs market to shrink but could instead be a boon for it — with new types of roles being created and the emergence of human-AI symbiosis.

According to Stanford University professor and AI specialist Erik Brynjolfsson, in the past many advances and transformative technologies have tended to increase gaps in income inequality between more and less experienced workers, or college and non-college students.

But this is not necessarily the case with generative AI. In a study conducted alongside other academics from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, Brynjolfsson found that deploying generative AI in a customer service centre — to suggest the best answers that staff could give to customers — boosted employee productivity by 14 per cent. Less experienced or skilled staff benefited the most, with about a 30 per cent boost to productivity, he says, adding that this could typically be applied across many industries.

“Some of the most productive uses [of generative AI] are the ones that augment humans rather than imitate or replace [them],” says Brynjolfsson, who has co-founded a work management platform called Workhelix that reviews the tasks typically carried out in a company and flags opportunities for AI to help.

Research suggests that the way most managers justify return on investment in technologies such as AI is through the promise of a swift reduction in headcount. But Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi, associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an authority on AI, warns that the hunt for short-term efficiencies through task automation could in the longer term lead to unintended consequences, such as the loss of valuable expertise.

“Generative AI systems are a task centre,” he says. “For the most part this intelligence is very related to specific tasks . . .[But] machines cannot penetrate that tacit understanding of the organisation as a whole.”

By contrast, Jarrahi says, humans have “important competitive advantages”, including emotional and social intelligence, and strategic, holistic thinking based on years of internalised experience.

As a result, AI-human partnerships will be of prime importance, he says, as will our ability to collaborate with these machines. “The human experts have to stay in the loop,” he says. “Our roles are going to shift as partners to these systems. It’s not about human-to-human skills but co-operation skills between us and them.”

Nevertheless, as part of the shift, humans will need to acquire new skills in order to stay ahead, such as increased AI literacy. This might include greater familiarity with large language models such as ChatGPT, to understand where the underlying data comes from, and whether there are biases in the algorithms, or other flaws.

“That is going to require strong critical thinking skills,” says Ravit Dotan, an AI ethics adviser and researcher. “In generative AI, lots of social and cultural assumptions are being made and these can be invisible to those who are not culturally aware.” She emphasises that companies will need to appoint individuals who will take on the thorny ethical questions.

In some cases, new AI-specific roles will emerge to cater to the technology’s explosion in popularity. Already there is a growing market for the data-labellers or annotators who help to train the algorithms — for example, by clarifying what a particular object is. “Labelling can be a really important skill but it needs to be recognised and valued for what it is,” Dotan says. “It can be a very sensitive job [but] people look at this as cheap labour. It will often be outsourced to other countries.”

Another up-and-coming role in this arena is the “prompt engineer” — a software engineer whose job it is to test and develop the text prompts that will generate the most accurate and desirable response from any AI application.

“It becomes increasingly important to think about the right questions to ask — so having an understanding of what the customer problems are and what you want to aim this powerful tool at is important,” says Brynjolfsson. “We need to be encouraging [employees] to lean in and think about how I can use this tool to be more creative.”

The underlying transformer is a set of &lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/""&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt; that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike earlier recurrent neural networks (RNN) that sequentially process inputs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel. This allows the data scientists to use GPUs for training transformer-based LLMs, significantly reducing the training time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transformer neural network architecture allows the use of very large models, often with hundreds of billions of parameters. Such large-scale models can ingest massive amounts of data, often from the internet, but also from sources such as the &lt;a href=""https://registry.opendata.aws/commoncrawl/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Common Crawl&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises more than 50 billion web pages, and Wikipedia, which has approximately 57 million pages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Read more about&amp;nbsp;neural networks&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/deep-learning/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Read more about&amp;nbsp;deep learning &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Why are large language models important?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '&lt;p&gt;Large language models are incredibly flexible. One model can perform completely different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences. LLMs have the potential to disrupt content creation and the way people use search engines and virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, LLMs are demonstrating a remarkable ability to make predictions based on a relatively small number of prompts or inputs. LLMs can be used for &lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; (artificial intelligence) to produce content based on input prompts in human language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLMs are big, very big. They can consider billions of parameters and have many possible uses. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Open AI&amp;#39;s GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. Its cousin, ChatGPT, can identify patterns from data and generate natural and readable output. While we don&amp;rsquo;t know the size of Claude 2, it can take inputs up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means it can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even an entire book.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;AI21 Labs&amp;rsquo; Jurassic-1 model has 178 billion parameters and a token vocabulary of 250,000-word parts and similar conversational capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Cohere&amp;rsquo;s Command model has similar capabilities and can work in more than 100 different languages.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;LightOn&amp;#39;s Paradigm offers foundation models with claimed capabilities that exceed those of GPT-3.

Earlier forms of machine learning used a numerical table to represent each word. But, this form of representation could not recognize relationships between words such as words with similar meanings. This limitation was overcome by using multi-dimensional vectors, commonly referred to as word embeddings, to represent words so that words with similar contextual meanings or other relationships are close to each other in the vector space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using word embeddings, transformers can pre-process text as numerical representations through the encoder and understand the context of words and phrases with similar meanings as well as other relationships between words such as parts of speech. It is then possible for LLMs to apply this knowledge of the language through the decoder to produce a unique output.&lt;/p&gt;\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are applications of large language models?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '&lt;p&gt;There are many practical applications for LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Copywriting&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from GPT-3 and ChatGPT, Claude, Llama 2, Cohere Command, and Jurassiccan write original copy. AI21 Wordspice suggests changes to original sentences to improve style and voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge base answering&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often referred to as knowledge-intensive natural language processing (KI-NLP), the technique refers to LLMs that can answer specific questions from information help in digital archives. An example is the ability of AI21 Studio playground to answer general knowledge questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Text classification&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using clustering, LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or sentiments. Uses include measuring customer sentiment, determining the relationship between texts, and document search.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Code generation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLM are proficient in code generation from natural language prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline""&gt;Amazon Q Developer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;can code in Python, JavaScript, Ruby and several other programming languages.

These networks contain multiple nodes and layers. Each node in a layer has connections to all nodes in the subsequent layer, each of which has a weight and a bias. Weights and biases along with embeddings are known as model parameters. Large transformer-based neural networks can have billions and billions of parameters. The size of the model is generally determined by an empirical relationship between the model size, the number of parameters, and the size of the training data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training is performed using a large corpus of high-quality data. During training, the model iteratively adjusts parameter values until the model correctly predicts the next token from an the previous squence of input tokens. It does this through self-learning techniques which teach the model to adjust parameters to maximize the likelihood of the next tokens in the training examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once trained, LLMs can be readily adapted to perform multiple tasks using relatively small sets of supervised data, a process known as fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three common learning models exist:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Zero-shot learning; Base LLMs can respond to a broad range of requests without explicit training, often through prompts, although answer accuracy varies.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Few-shot learning: By providing a few relevant training examples, base model performance significantly improves in that specific area.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Fine-tuning: This is an extension of few-shot learning in that data scientists train a base model to adjust its parameters with additional data relevant to the specific application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What is the future of LLMs?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '&lt;p&gt;The introduction of large language models like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Llama 2 that can answer questions and generate text points to exciting possibilities in the future.

Here are some thoughts on the future of LLMs,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Increased capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As impressive as they are, the current level of technology is not perfect and LLMs are not infallible.

[+] employees to take their mental wellness into their own hands.getty
Everyone knows that generative artificial intelligence (AI) is the hot topic in the workplace right now. The rise in AI has caused a mixture of excitement and fear as it becomes a standard part of our lives. Some say it’s a risk to civilization, while others insist it is transforming the way we work, live and interact with one another. The part that is not debatable is that AI is on the upswing. Arianna Huffington, founder and CEO of Thrive Global addresses these perceived threats. “AI is ultimately a tool, and its impact will depend on how humanity uses it,” she explains. “The more we can use this moment to bring together a critical mass of people working in good faith and with empathy, the more likely it is that humanity will use AI to flourish.” It sounds like science fiction, but that’s exactly what the newest AI tools are doing—turning the tide when it comes to mental wellness in the workplace.


Using AI To Take Charge Of Your Mental Health
Increasingly, employers know that mental health is a priority, but, according to a recent study, many are unsure of the steps they need to take to make that happen. And with more Gen Zs entering the workforce, it’s essential that companies get it right. The younger cohort has no qualms with job hopping if they believe their health and wellness needs are not met. Now, it’s possible to enlist AI, instead of a human being, to help employees take charge of their mental health. It sounds like an odd coupling, but technology has produced new AI-backed mental health tools that enable employers to better support their employees.

Grace Chang, co-founder and CEO of mental healthcare startup Kintsugi, believes AI’s omnipresence in the workplace gives employees greater control over their mental wellness. Plus, she says it brings the opportunity to better support employees and foster a more productive workforce, more efficient processes and more profitable businesses.

PROMOTED
Chang informs me by email that Kintsugi offers AI-backed voice journaling and platforms that provide employees real-time insights into their own mental health and make recommendations on the kind of support needed. “We’re entering a crucial era when it comes to mental wellness at work,” Chang points out. “In 2023, employers know they must make mental health a priority—95% of the employers we’ve surveyed have told us that mental healthcare access is their top care need. They know that the cost of unaddressed mental health challenges is too high to ignore, leading to almost 12 missed workdays per employee per year and costing the U.S. economy $47.6 billion annually.”

Still, Chang says that many business leaders remain unsure about how to best support their teams’ mental health. “There’s been an explosion of employer-focused mental healthcare solutions since the pandemic—from wellness apps to coaching to therapists to digital therapeutics and more. We’ve reached the point where employers are spolit for choice. Therefore, matching employees to the right interventions at the right time is a greater challenge than ever.”

AI Detects Mental Health Conditions From Your Voice
Another hurdle, according to Chang, is that in the past employers generally had no way of measuring how well any given mental health intervention is working. Without objective data pointing to an ROI, she emphasizes, it can be difficult to justify continuing with a program or app. But this is at odds with the mental health field, which has traditionally relied on subjective, as opposed to objective, insights.

She explains that AI-powered solutions like Kintsugi Voice are designed with these challenges in mind. “Kintsugi Voice detects signs and severity of mental health conditions in real-time, just by listening to someone’s voice,” she adds. “Our tech seamlessly integrates with care management call centers and telehealth platforms, where it ‘listens’ in the background, with patient consent.” The technology generates real-time, quantitative insights into someone’s mental wellness that help connect those in need to the right level of behavioral care.

“In the same way, our tool offers an easy and affordable way to track mental health over time, so users can determine whether, and to what extent, an intervention is working for them,” she told me. “Currently, mental health screening takes place once a year (if at all). With our tool, it can take place during every healthcare interaction, bringing with it the opportunity for unprecedented insights into employee mental well-being. Employers can ask their payor-partners to integrate technology like Kintsugi into their care management call centers and telehealth platforms to leverage AI and voice biomarkers to make mental healthcare more personalized, more convenient, higher quality, more affordable and more accessible for everyone.”
Do Employees Feel Secure With AI Mental Health?
The prevailing narrative is that employees fear being replaced by AI or that it will somehow invade their privacy. But are employee fears of AI blown out of proportion? And would employees consent to having AI track their mental health? Chang reveals that in a recent pilot, 80% of a patient population consented to be screened for mental health conditions by the AI-powered voice analysis tool. Based on these findings, she surmises that the majority of people embrace the use of AI in healthcare, as long as it enhances their overall healthcare experience and delivers tangible value.
A separate study by Workhuman found similar results. Over half of workers (58.4%) believe AI won’t put their jobs at risk. And 41% of employees say they anticipate that learning to use AI tools will become a part of their workplace training, and 34.4% believe that learning these tools will be encouraged in general. The data shows that apprehension is strongest among younger employees, including Gen Z digital natives, who have grown up with intimate knowledge of the risks and rewards of new tech. While only 20.4% of workers on average feel that AI puts their job at risk, the figure increases to nearly 30% for Gen Z employees.
These findings are valuable information for leaders implementing AI technology to instill confidence in workers who are concerned that their jobs could be at risk. The Workhuman study recommends that employers ensure that workers have the tools and training they need to understand how the technology works and how it can benefit them. It adds that knowledge and competency will help not only to assuage employees’ AI fears but will help them make the most of the technology in their day-to-day work. The study concludes that when employees feel recognized for their humanity—which can include opinions and concerns around AI at work—and not just their productive output, they’ll likely feel less worried about whether AI has the potential to replace them and more valued as a whole individual.

And while many companies are embarking on pilots, hackathons, and &quot;promptathons,&quot; I want to share what we&#039;ve learned. (For an in-depth report on AI in HR please read our Deep Dive on AI in HR research.)  HR Is An Integrated Operating Function  Let&#039;s remind ourselves that HR, like Finance, IT, and other internal functions, is a design, support, and integration function. HR partners with the business and deals with a myriad of complex issues: hiring, onboarding, training, leadership development, performance management, pay, rewards, benefits, hybrid work, organization design, diversity strategy, culture, and more. And prior to the emergence of what we call Systemic HR, most of these operating functions were done somewhat independently.  Today companies are dealing with a competitive labor market, high levels of turnover and workforce stress, and the need to reskill, upskill, and intelligently move people internally. Problems like diversity and inclusion, culture, and leadership development remain paramount, and HR teams are also worried about employee experience, productivity, and internal efficiency.  Data within HR is spread all over the place. The average large company has more than 80 employee facing systems, and each one stores large volumes of important data to help manage its own area. When a business leader or executive wants to make a change, look at a business scenario, or fix an underperforming group, they need all this data in one integrated place. AI promises to bring this dream to life (more below).  As HR teams build new programs and solutions, we are also dealing with an overwhelmed workforce. Employees are largely tapped out (87% believe they are operating at full capacity) so we have to simplify work, reduce the number of systems, and save people time on administrative functions (enabling them to operate at the &quot;top of their license&quot;). This means HR teams are continuously dealing with this problem of expanding the number of services yet shrinking their footprint and making them easier to use. AI helps with this.  Finally, HR teams are turning into creators, developers, and consultants. As our Systemic HR research points out, the future of HR is fewer &quot;support agents&quot; and more &quot;consultants, product managers, designers, and advisors.&quot; This means more and more HR teams are &quot;building things&quot; and &quot;analyzing things,&quot; which is essentially a core part of what Generative AI does.  So in a sense, Generative AI is the perfect new solution for almost every challenge HR teams face.  How Will We Get There: Real Use Cases  As we&#039;ve talked with dozens of companies and vendors, let me summarize some of the big, high-ROI, real-world use-cases we see.  1/ Talent Intelligence for Recruiting, Mobility, Development, Pay Equity  Talent Intelligence is now a reality. Companies can use LLM-based systems (Eightfold, Gloat, Beamery, Seekout, Phenom, Skyhive) to identify hundreds of characteristics (ie. skills) in their people, enabling companies to intelligently source candidates, decide who is ready for promotion, move people to new opportunities (talent marketplace), and identify pay inequities.  This domain, which we&#039;ve studied for several years, is now available &quot;off the shelf&quot; from many vendors and using data from providers like Lightcast a company can relatively easily start to identify capability gaps, look into the outside market for trends, and build a strategic and operational solution for many HR practices using AI. Our Talent Intelligence Primer explains this in detail - I believe this market is still young and will eventually disrupt many of the core HCM players. (SAP introduced their Talent Intelligence Hub this year, by the way.)  In recruiting there are now plugins to generate job descriptions, tune them for different roles, create personalized candidate emails, and enrich your own resume. These tools are getting smarter by the minute: they can now personalize every part of the recruiting process, saving recruiters time in outreach and writing. I just saw Eightfold&#039;s latest AI job description builder, for example, and it lets you tweak the description based on skills, technologies, and many other factors (Seekout has a similar offering).  2/ Employee Experience Apps (Onboarding, job transition, administration)  The second growing space is the &quot;intelligent employee chatbot&quot; that brings together documents, support materials, and transactional systems into an easy to use experience. Several of our clients are experimenting with this and our own JBC HR Copilot offers this type of solution to HR professionals themselves. These are really enterprise applications, where companies put together their own content, develop a data security strategy (we don&#039;t want every employee seeing every document or process), and then use &quot;orchestration&quot; tools to connect the chatbot to enterprise systems.  There are many ways to do this. OpenAI has a feature called &quot;function calling&quot; that lets a develop take any input (&quot;I want to log my vacation.&quot;) and turn it into a simple call to an API like the vacation page in Workday or SAP. IBM Watson Orchestrate is designed for this (now in use by SAP), and there will be many such tools available from platform vendors and the HCM providers. The Workday Assistant is a first generation attempt at this.  Once you marry the knowledge of the various HR systems with process documentation, the chatbot can be an eventual replacement for many or most employee portals. I just talked with a large media company and the HR leader told me it took her three hours to find the right information on executive comp to do her analysis. This type of situation is common everywhere.  So far what we&#039;re discovering is that these should be focused on narrow use cases first, then they can expand. A large hotel chain, for example, just build a chatbot designed to help front office workers understand precisely how to serve high net-worth customers. It connects to the reservation system and helps the employees know how to customize services for that client. Imagine an onboarding tool, leadership transition system, etc. like this.  Every EX vendor is going to want to be part of this. Providers like Firstup use AI to customize employee communications to each person individually. This will become a core set of features we use for many of our employee experience apps.  3/ Employee Training and Compliance Apps  The $350 billion employee training industry is hungry for Generative AI. We&#039;ve seen tools that generate training from documents, automatically create quizzes, and take existing content and turn it into a &quot;teaching assistant.&quot; Just yesterday I talked with a client who has a new leadership development program they just built with a vendor. We discussed taking that content and putting it into our Copilot to make it available &quot;on-demand&quot; with a conversational interface for managers. That is not a difficult project once you have the AI platform in place.  But there&#039;s more. Cornerstone, Docebo, Degreed and others are now using AI to intelligently recommend content (based on Talent Intelligence, not just clickstreams), produce and recommend micro-learning based on role, team, location, and employee activity, and even use AI as a game to &quot;prompt&quot; the employee to learn more.  To give you an example: we just launched a micro-learning program in our Academy to teach HR people about AI. That course, which consists of a series of interactive questions and small notes and interactions on your phone, could be imported into our copilot, for example, and offered when someone asks a question. These are not quite out of the box solutions but we&#039;re close.  Remember that much of an L&amp;D teams job revolves around content creation. These new Gen AI apps that build characters, images, scenarios, and videos are going to be widely used by L&amp;D teams. I just found a tool that takes long videos (ie. instructor-led courses) and quickly finds the &quot;most interesting&quot; or &quot;most dense&quot; content to create mini-snippets. Imagine the opportunity you&#039;ll have to take long videos and turn them into chapters, on-demand learning, and promotions for new things to learn.  4/ Employee Development and Growth Apps  Next there&#039;s the massive new area of tools and platforms to help employees with their careers. Thanks to Talent Intelligence platforms, we now have &quot;career pathways&quot; being generated by AI (not your boss). These systems look at your skills and your experience and show you (graphically) all the options you have for growth, all based on the experience of millions of others.  Did you know, for example, that a marketing manager who does analytics could move into data science, cyber security, or even financial analysis? Or that a person who works as an hourly &quot;transportation support&quot; person in a hospital can join a career pathway to become an X-ray tech or clinical nurse?  These pathways are all exposed and explained by AI, and these new systems show you precisely what you need to learn, what certifications you must acquire, and even who you can talk to about this path. We are actually working on this type of solution for HR professionals (coming soon) and you&#039;ll be amazed at how helpful these tools can be.  Why is AI so important? Because this is fundamentally a big-data problem. I cannot possibly guess all the career options an individual may have in our company, but if I plug their profile and history into a system like the Eightfold Career Navigator or others, we can both see many options we never even considered. Products like Gloat, Fuel50, Eightfold, Beamery, and Workday all offer this out of the box.  And think about how this will help non-degreed workers move up in their careers. No more shopping around on websites to guess where to apply for a job - these career navigation systems are going to transform the lives of many many people.  5/ Performance Management and Operational Improvement  Should AI be used for performance management? Well I don&#039;t expect these systems to write performance reviews, but yes, they will help a lot. Consider the typical problem we have in every company: a team, a workgroup, or an individual is simply underperforming. This group or person&#039;s numbers are behind, their projects are late, or their quality is not up to snuff. Do we wait for the manager to decipher what&#039;s wrong and let them figure out what to do?  That&#039;s how it works today: each manager has to guess, figure out, and decide &quot;what to do&quot; about a low performing individual, team, or project. Why not let the AI do some of this for us? We have seen apps, for example, that show you the integrated &quot;view&quot; of performance in a company. This is, in many ways, a data problem.  What if we find, for example, that the project teams that are over a certain size simply don&#039;t get things done? What if we look at the skills composition of a team and see that an important one is missing? Maybe tenure is the problem (it often is, by the way). Maybe diversity is holding teams back.  While the line manager may not do this kind of analysis, I can guarantee you that the HR consultant would love to help here. These kinds of broader organizational design and performance projects are everywhere, and once we have all the data in an AI system we can simply ask it questions. (Check out our new Org Design SuperClass for more on this!)  I asked Bard, &quot;please compare the financial growth, returns, and margins of Chevron and Exxon.&quot; It did a pretty good job in about ten seconds. Imagine if you did that in your own company across teams? Once we get our internal data into the right AI system this is going to be a regular and common thing to do.  6/ Retention, Hybrid-Work, Wellbeing, Engagement Analysis  And that leads me to my final big area: studying, analyzing, and improving employee retention, wellbeing, and engagement.  Every company I talk with is now dealing with employee burnout, wellbeing, and other engagement issues. For decades we relied on surveys and various benchmarks to try to figure out what to do. And yes, good feedback systems give us lots of information that helps.  But what if we simply put this data into our big AI platform and asked it some questions.  &quot;What are the top factors contributing to turnover in the sales department?&quot; It may be manager. It may be compensation. It may be tenure. It may be something else.  Yes we can always use surveys, town halls, and other listening methods to do this. But what if we just look at the data? The Bank of America Academy, which we&#039;ve written about many times, is a story of a company that &quot;discovered&quot; what its talent problems were by detailed analysis of the data. They found out, for example, that bank balances are very correlated to the tenure of employees in the branch. And tenure is driven by many other factors: how people where hired, onboarded, and supported in their career journey. By doing that analysis they were able to dramatically improve their business performance and retention. Their engagement surveys would never have pointed this out.  How Do You Get Started?  And that leaves us with the big question: How do you get started? Let me share what we&#039;ve learned.  First, rather than &quot;chase the technology&quot; it&#039;s much better to &quot;fall in love with the problem.&quot;  In other words, what problem would you like to focus on? Is it employee onboarding? HR self-service? Hourly worker scheduling and shift management? This means getting your team together to prioritize your investment, because building an AI-based solution won&#039;t be as simple as you think.  Second, once you&#039;ve decided where to start it&#039;s time to get the IT team involved. Each one of these use-cases turns into a set of issues with data quality, data management, data dictionaries, and then security, business rules, and confidentiality.  Remember that &quot;throwing information into an LLM&quot; may sound like fun, but even if it works you&#039;ve just given all sorts of people access to information they may not need, want, or even be allowed to see. So a chatbot implementation means focusing on user experience, data management, search, and orchestration all at once.  Our work on our own copilot has already given us this experience. Once you get the data together (and in most cases it&#039;s not clear who owns what), you have to start testing Gen AI use cases, define security rules, and decide what, if any, back-end orchestration you want. These aren&#039;t as exciting as &quot;throwing a bunch of spreadsheets into OpenAI and starting to ask questions,&quot; but this is what real solutions need to do.  Third, you have to realize that AI systems, unlike transactional systems, take care and feeding. &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot; means tuning the system to answer questions correctly, finding gaps in your data or documentation, and continuously trying to keep the user experience simple. And once the chatbot or other system is operational, I can guarantee there will be demands for more (and new) data.  In many ways a new AI system is like a new baby. It has to learn how to walk, talk, behave, and stay out of trouble. The off-the-shelf tools won&#039;t do this until you&#039;ve really used it, so you&#039;ll need IT&#039;s help making sure your system is sustainable and supportable as it grows.  How Will AI Impact HR Itself?  And then there&#039;s the big question about your role. Will these new systems make you obsolete?  The answer is clearly no. These intelligent systems are data hungry fiends. Once you build them and add the right information, you&#039;re going to turn into an analyst, a chatbot trainer, a product manager, and a designer. A lot of the mundane work of finding information and analyzing it may go away, but your higher level job of knowing what information to use will remain. And there will be many new jobs taking care of the AI systems, tuning them, and continuously improving them as new applications arrive.  Let me leave you with this: despite the explosion of excitement in this space, AI implementations in HR are technology projects. They have many of the same issues and challenges of any transactional system, with the added element that the system itself is &quot;learning&quot; along the way. SAP doesn&#039;t change behavior as you use it: the AI system will.  I can assure you that this entire domain is both over-hyped and under-estimated. If you start small, get your hands dirty, and bring your IT team with you, you&#039;ll start to see astounding business benefits in any of the areas I discuss.

We now know that Generative AI will play a transformational role in Human Resources. And while many companies are embarking on pilots, hackathons, and “promptathons,” I want to share what we’ve learned. (For an in-depth report on AI in HR please read our Deep Dive on AI in HR research.)
HR Is An Integrated Operating Function
Let’s remind ourselves that HR, like Finance, IT, and other internal functions, is a design, support, and integration function. HR partners with the business and deals with a myriad of complex issues: hiring, onboarding, training, leadership development, performance management, pay, rewards, benefits, hybrid work, organization design, diversity strategy, culture, and more. And prior to the emergence of what we call Systemic HR, most of these operating functions were done somewhat independently.
Today companies are dealing with a competitive labor market, high levels of turnover and workforce stress, and the need to reskill, upskill, and intelligently move people internally. Problems like diversity and inclusion, culture, and leadership development remain paramount, and HR teams are also worried about employee experience, productivity, and internal efficiency.
Data within HR is spread all over the place. The average large company has more than 80 employee facing systems, and each one stores large volumes of important data to help manage its own area. When a business leader or executive wants to make a change, look at a business scenario, or fix an underperforming group, they need all this data in one integrated place. AI promises to bring this dream to life (more below).
As HR teams build new programs and solutions, we are also dealing with an overwhelmed workforce. Employees are largely tapped out (87% believe they are operating at full capacity) so we have to simplify work, reduce the number of systems, and save people time on administrative functions (enabling them to operate at the “top of their license”). This means HR teams are continuously dealing with this problem of expanding the number of services yet shrinking their footprint and making them easier to use. AI helps with this.
Finally, HR teams are turning into creators, developers, and consultants. As our Systemic HR research points out, the future of HR is fewer “support agents” and more “consultants, product managers, designers, and advisors.” This means more and more HR teams are “building things” and “analyzing things,” which is essentially a core part of what Generative AI does.
So in a sense, Generative AI is the perfect new solution for almost every challenge HR teams face.
How Will We Get There: Real Use Cases
As we’ve talked with dozens of companies and vendors, let me summarize some of the big, high-ROI, real-world use-cases we see.
1/ Talent Intelligence for Recruiting, Mobility, Development, Pay Equity
Talent Intelligence is now a reality. Companies can use LLM-based systems (Eightfold, Gloat, Beamery, Seekout, Phenom, Skyhive) to identify hundreds of characteristics (ie. skills) in their people, enabling companies to intelligently source candidates, decide who is ready for promotion, move people to new opportunities (talent marketplace), and identify pay inequities.
This domain, which we’ve studied for several years, is now available “off the shelf” from many vendors and using data from providers like Lightcast a company can relatively easily start to identify capability gaps, look into the outside market for trends, and build a strategic and operational solution for many HR practices using AI. Our Talent Intelligence Primer explains this in detail – I believe this market is still young and will eventually disrupt many of the core HCM players. (SAP introduced their Talent Intelligence Hub this year, by the way.)
In recruiting there are now plugins to generate job descriptions, tune them for different roles, create personalized candidate emails, and enrich your own resume. These tools are getting smarter by the minute: they can now personalize every part of the recruiting process, saving recruiters time in outreach and writing. I just saw Eightfold’s latest AI job description builder, for example, and it lets you tweak the description based on skills, technologies, and many other factors (Seekout has a similar offering).
2/ Employee Experience Apps (Onboarding, job transition, administration)
The second growing space is the “intelligent employee chatbot” that brings together documents, support materials, and transactional systems into an easy to use experience. Several of our clients are experimenting with this and our own JBC HR Copilot offers this type of solution to HR professionals themselves. These are really enterprise applications, where companies put together their own content, develop a data security strategy (we don’t want every employee seeing every document or process), and then use “orchestration” tools to connect the chatbot to enterprise systems.
There are many ways to do this. OpenAI has a feature called “function calling” that lets a develop take any input (“I want to log my vacation.”) and turn it into a simple call to an API like the vacation page in Workday or SAP. IBM Watson Orchestrate is designed for this (now in use by SAP), and there will be many such tools available from platform vendors and the HCM providers. The Workday Assistant is a first generation attempt at this.
Once you marry the knowledge of the various HR systems with process documentation, the chatbot can be an eventual replacement for many or most employee portals. I just talked with a large media company and the HR leader told me it took her three hours to find the right information on executive comp to do her analysis. This type of situation is common everywhere.
So far what we’re discovering is that these should be focused on narrow use cases first, then they can expand. A large hotel chain, for example, just build a chatbot designed to help front office workers understand precisely how to serve high net-worth customers. It connects to the reservation system and helps the employees know how to customize services for that client. Imagine an onboarding tool, leadership transition system, etc. like this.
Every EX vendor is going to want to be part of this. Providers like Firstup use AI to customize employee communications to each person individually. This will become a core set of features we use for many of our employee experience apps.
3/ Employee Training and Compliance Apps
The $350 billion employee training industry is hungry for Generative AI. We’ve seen tools that generate training from documents, automatically create quizzes, and take existing content and turn it into a “teaching assistant.” Just yesterday I talked with a client who has a new leadership development program they just built with a vendor. We discussed taking that content and putting it into our Copilot to make it available “on-demand” with a conversational interface for managers. That is not a difficult project once you have the AI platform in place.
But there’s more. Cornerstone, Docebo, Degreed and others are now using AI to intelligently recommend content (based on Talent Intelligence, not just clickstreams), produce and recommend micro-learning based on role, team, location, and employee activity, and even use AI as a game to “prompt” the employee to learn more.
To give you an example: we just launched a micro-learning program in our Academy to teach HR people about AI. That course, which consists of a series of interactive questions and small notes and interactions on your phone, could be imported into our copilot, for example, and offered when someone asks a question. These are not quite out of the box solutions but we’re close.
Remember that much of an L&D teams job revolves around content creation. These new Gen AI apps that build characters, images, scenarios, and videos are going to be widely used by L&D teams. I just found a tool that takes long videos (ie. instructor-led courses) and quickly finds the “most interesting” or “most dense” content to create mini-snippets. Imagine the opportunity you’ll have to take long videos and turn them into chapters, on-demand learning, and promotions for new things to learn.
4/ Employee Development and Growth Apps
Next there’s the massive new area of tools and platforms to help employees with their careers. Thanks to Talent Intelligence platforms, we now have “career pathways” being generated by AI (not your boss). These systems look at your skills and your experience and show you (graphically) all the options you have for growth, all based on the experience of millions of others.
Did you know, for example, that a marketing manager who does analytics could move into data science, cyber security, or even financial analysis? Or that a person who works as an hourly “transportation support” person in a hospital can join a career pathway to become an X-ray tech or clinical nurse?
These pathways are all exposed and explained by AI, and these new systems show you precisely what you need to learn, what certifications you must acquire, and even who you can talk to about this path. We are actually working on this type of solution for HR professionals (coming soon) and you’ll be amazed at how helpful these tools can be.
Why is AI so important? Because this is fundamentally a big-data problem. I cannot possibly guess all the career options an individual may have in our company, but if I plug their profile and history into a system like the Eightfold Career Navigator or others, we can both see many options we never even considered. Products like Gloat, Fuel50, Eightfold, Beamery, and Workday all offer this out of the box.
And think about how this will help non-degreed workers move up in their careers. No more shopping around on websites to guess where to apply for a job – these career navigation systems are going to transform the lives of many many people.
5/ Performance Management and Operational Improvement
Should AI be used for performance management? Well I don’t expect these systems to write performance reviews, but yes, they will help a lot. Consider the typical problem we have in every company: a team, a workgroup, or an individual is simply underperforming. This group or person’s numbers are behind, their projects are late, or their quality is not up to snuff. Do we wait for the manager to decipher what’s wrong and let them figure out what to do?
That’s how it works today: each manager has to guess, figure out, and decide “what to do” about a low performing individual, team, or project. Why not let the AI do some of this for us? We have seen apps, for example, that show you the integrated “view” of performance in a company. This is, in many ways, a data problem.
What if we find, for example, that the project teams that are over a certain size simply don’t get things done? What if we look at the skills composition of a team and see that an important one is missing? Maybe tenure is the problem (it often is, by the way). Maybe diversity is holding teams back.
While the line manager may not do this kind of analysis, I can guarantee you that the HR consultant would love to help here. These kinds of broader organizational design and performance projects are everywhere, and once we have all the data in an AI system we can simply ask it questions. (Check out our new Org Design SuperClass for more on this!)
I asked Bard, “please compare the financial growth, returns, and margins of Chevron and Exxon.” It did a pretty good job in about ten seconds. Imagine if you did that in your own company across teams? Once we get our internal data into the right AI system this is going to be a regular and common thing to do.
6/ Retention, Hybrid-Work, Wellbeing, Engagement Analysis
And that leads me to my final big area: studying, analyzing, and improving employee retention, wellbeing, and engagement.
Every company I talk with is now dealing with employee burnout, wellbeing, and other engagement issues. For decades we relied on surveys and various benchmarks to try to figure out what to do. And yes, good feedback systems give us lots of information that helps.
But what if we simply put this data into our big AI platform and asked it some questions.  “What are the top factors contributing to turnover in the sales department?” It may be manager. It may be compensation. It may be tenure. It may be something else.
Yes we can always use surveys, town halls, and other listening methods to do this. But what if we just look at the data? The Bank of America Academy, which we’ve written about many times, is a story of a company that “discovered” what its talent problems were by detailed analysis of the data. They found out, for example, that bank balances are very correlated to the tenure of employees in the branch. And tenure is driven by many other factors: how people where hired, onboarded, and supported in their career journey. By doing that analysis they were able to dramatically improve their business performance and retention. Their engagement surveys would never have pointed this out.
How Do You Get Started?
And that leaves us with the big question: How do you get started? Let me share what we’ve learned.
First, rather than “chase the technology” it’s much better to “fall in love with the problem.”
In other words, what problem would you like to focus on? Is it employee onboarding? HR self-service? Hourly worker scheduling and shift management? This means getting your team together to prioritize your investment, because building an AI-based solution won’t be as simple as you think.
Second, once you’ve decided where to start it’s time to get the IT team involved. Each one of these use-cases turns into a set of issues with data quality, data management, data dictionaries, and then security, business rules, and confidentiality.
Remember that “throwing information into an LLM” may sound like fun, but even if it works you’ve just given all sorts of people access to information they may not need, want, or even be allowed to see. So a chatbot implementation means focusing on user experience, data management, search, and orchestration all at once.
Our work on our own copilot has already given us this experience. Once you get the data together (and in most cases it’s not clear who owns what), you have to start testing Gen AI use cases, define security rules, and decide what, if any, back-end orchestration you want. These aren’t as exciting as “throwing a bunch of spreadsheets into OpenAI and starting to ask questions,” but this is what real solutions need to do.
Third, you have to realize that AI systems, unlike transactional systems, take care and feeding. “Prompt Engineering” means tuning the system to answer questions correctly, finding gaps in your data or documentation, and continuously trying to keep the user experience simple. And once the chatbot or other system is operational, I can guarantee there will be demands for more (and new) data.
In many ways a new AI system is like a new baby. It has to learn how to walk, talk, behave, and stay out of trouble. The off-the-shelf tools won’t do this until you’ve really used it, so you’ll need IT’s help making sure your system is sustainable and supportable as it grows.
How Will AI Impact HR Itself?
And then there’s the big question about your role. Will these new systems make you obsolete?
The answer is clearly no. These intelligent systems are data hungry fiends. Once you build them and add the right information, you’re going to turn into an analyst, a chatbot trainer, a product manager, and a designer. A lot of the mundane work of finding information and analyzing it may go away, but your higher level job of knowing what information to use will remain. And there will be many new jobs taking care of the AI systems, tuning them, and continuously improving them as new applications arrive.
Let me leave you with this: despite the explosion of excitement in this space, AI implementations in HR are technology projects. They have many of the same issues and challenges of any transactional system, with the added element that the system itself is “learning” along the way. SAP doesn’t change behavior as you use it: the AI system will.
I can assure you that this entire domain is both over-hyped and under-estimated. If you start small, get your hands dirty, and bring your IT team with you, you’ll start to see astounding business benefits in any of the areas I discuss. And in the next article I’ll explain how to build an AI-Hackathon for your team.

But is it true? Back in April, Dropbox announced it was cutting 500 employees. In May, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas let go of almost 4,000 people. And in July, the founder of an e-commerce startup said he laid off 90% of his support team. The common reason cited? You guessed it: artificial intelligence. Goldman Sachs economists have estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI, with up to a quarter of all jobs being completely done by AI. Indeed, large language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated a pretty remarkable ability to write code, offer detailed instructions for different tasks, pass a law school bar exam, and even express empathy when answering medical questions. And while this technology has the potential to cause widespread disruption, the effects may not be felt evenly across the workforce, with white-collar workers likely to be more affected than manual laborers. AI isn’t always better, faster or cheaper, though. In fact, current iterations are prone to making mistakes and spitting out false information. News outlet CNET had to issue several corrections after it used an AI tool to help write stories. And some workers, including members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, have said that their workload actually increased since their companies implemented new AI tools. In some industries, experts have suggested a future in which AI can assist humans rather than replace them entirely. In others, artificial intelligence may have little to no impact at all. To get a better sense of the effect AI might have on different industries across the labor market, we reached out to experts in medicine, law, art, retail, film, tech, education and agriculture, to address 1) How will AI change the nature of work? and 2) How will AI change the labor force in this specific industry? Read on to see what they had to say. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Medicine Erich S. Huang: Do you want AI to be your doctor? Erich S. Huang is the head of Clinical Informatics at Verily and former chief data officer for quality at Duke Health and assistant dean for Biomedical Informatics at Duke University School of Medicine. Imagine you are sitting in an exam room. You are a 47-year-old with a 16-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Last week you had your annual screening mammogram and the radiologist identified a suspicious lesion. This week you have an ultrasound and a core needle biopsy. You’ve never needed a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor more than now. How much of this experience do you feel comfortable outsourcing to artificial intelligence? How do we position algorithms in settings where we still need professionals to sit down, look you in the eye, understand who you are as a person, help you understand what is going to happen next and answer all of your questions? I’ve worked on AI in biomedicine for my entire career. I absolutely believe in its potential and know that AI will certainly be a part of medicine as we work to improve and further personalize care. AI can win back time and space for clinicians and help to reduce the administrative burden that is mostly tangential to direct patient care. How often do you notice your doctor or nurse looking at a screen rather than looking at you? Several hours and thousands of mouse clicks a day are laboriously devoted to entering data into an electronic health record. Many health care person hours are spent on billing and reimbursement rather than patient care. These represent low-hanging opportunities for automation that will help your doctor be more present for you. But AI should not take away clinical jobs. While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can. Graduating from medical school, we raise our right hands and pledge the Hippocratic Oath. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence do not. The best clinicians make data-driven decisions while helping you and your family understand your options with compassion. They are professionals. Algorithms are not. Think of navigation aids like Apple or Google Maps: We entrust algorithms to evaluate factors such as traffic and road construction to find us the best route to our destination. We still drive the car. We still scan the road ahead for changing conditions and pump the brakes (even with self-driving cars) when we need to react quickly. We must do the same for health care. Our task is to use algorithms to marshal data to efficiently assist human professionals to help other human beings to better health. How we care for patients should not be “artificial.” Regina Barzilay: AI can shift late-stage treatment to prevention Regina Barzilay is a distinguished professor for AI and health in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. She is the AI lead of Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health. Barzilay is also a MacArthur Fellow and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2016, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton made a bold prediction that within five to 10 years, AI models would outperform humans in reading medical images, saying, “People should stop training radiologists now.” He was right in some ways and wrong in others. Most clinicians refer to this quote as an example of AI hype, citing the significant shortage of radiologists, who are still very much in demand today. But he was right about AI’s abilities — in some areas of clinical AI, primarily radiology, machines indeed match and even outperform human experts. Among AI practitioners, Hinton’s comments often ignite feelings of frustration over the increasing gap between the performance capacity of these existing tools and the slow rate of their adoption in health care systems. Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care. We already see research models that can diagnose diseases years prior to symptom occurrence, predict an individual patient’s response to intervention and personalize the treatment. But real-world integration of AI in health care has been slow due to a number of reasons, from the initial cost of adoption to qualms about safety and regulation. Based on my experience collaborating with hospitals, health care systems are more likely to utilize AI to reduce the administrative burden in care management, fueled by advancements in natural language processing tools (such as ChatGPT) that can automate the transcription of doctors’ notes, help with scheduling and streamline office support. Instead of replacing doctors, this technology can help address issues of burnout and allow health care providers to focus more on improving the patient experience. But the more fundamental change to health care will come from the uptake of new AI-powered diagnostic and treatment tools which will shift late-disease treatment to prevention and early-stage interventions. In the same way that e-commerce provides recommendations tailored to a consumer, AI-empowered medicine will eventually be personalized. To achieve this vision, advancements in AI are not sufficient on their own; clinicians, regulators and the general public have a role to play in determining the extent to which AI will be adopted in hospitals and doctors’ offices. Law Daniel W. Linna Jr.: AI is changing the skills lawyers need Daniel W. Linna Jr. has a joint appointment at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law and McCormick School of Engineering. Dan’s research and teaching focus is on using AI for legal services and the regulation of AI in society. Previously, Dan was a litigator and equity partner at Honigman, a large law firm, and an IT manager, developer and consultant. Artificial intelligence will better equip society to uphold the values and achieve the goals of the law. With AI assistance, lawyers can spend more time working on the challenges that attracted many of us to the law, such as eradicating inequality, ensuring access to justice, safeguarding democracy and strengthening and expanding the rule of law. For instance, we can develop AI tools to help individuals understand their responsibilities and rights, and preserve and enforce those rights. At Northwestern University’s CS+Law Innovation Lab, where my colleague and I oversee teams of law and computer science students who build prototype technologies, we have worked with the nonprofit Law Center for Better Housing to improve Rentervention, a chatbot that helps tenants in disputes with landlords. If a landlord does not return a security deposit, for example, Rentervention can help tenants determine if they are entitled to the security deposit and, if so, help draft a letter demanding its return. People in businesses, large and small, are already using chatbots, AI assistants and other AI tools to help them comply with laws, regulations and internal policies. AI tools specifically developed for legal tasks can help them draft and negotiate contracts, make business decisions consistent with legal and ethical principles and proactively identify potential problems that they should discuss with a lawyer. For lawyers, this means that AI can automate or augment many legal tasks that they perform. Most lawyers spend a lot of time finding applicable laws, organizing information, spotting common issues, performing basic analysis and drafting formulaic language in emails, memos, forms, contracts and briefs. AI systems will be able to do this faster, cheaper and better. Large language models, like those behind ChatGPT, have significantly increased the capabilities of these systems. Established legal information providers and many startups are rapidly developing and releasing AI systems that are “fine-tuned” or specialized for legal tasks. Unsurprisingly, AI is changing the skills lawyers need. To responsibly use AI, they will need a functional understanding of the technology to evaluate the benefits and risks of using it, such as how it might fail and the ways in which it might be biased or unfair. Lawyers will also need to exercise judgment to tailor an AI system’s output for specific situations. For example, in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs, using the specific language and arguments that are most likely to persuade the assigned judge to rule in favor of the client, based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions. A lawyer will need to determine if the prediction and the proposed language and arguments are a good fit given the client’s goals and interests. Perhaps what would be a winning argument, for example, would cause damage to the client’s brand in the eye of the public, and the lawyer should revise it. Lawyers will continue to play a significant role as governments update laws, regulations and policies for emerging technologies, including to address AI bias, discrimination, privacy, liability and intellectual property. Additionally, new roles are emerging in the legal industry, such as legal engineers who build systems, legal data scientists and legal operations professionals. And there is significant unmet demand for legal services from individuals and even businesses. Considering all of this, the best long-term prediction now is that there will continue to be a stable number of jobs for lawyers and other legal professionals, so long as the legal industry embraces technology and trains professionals to develop important complementary skills. While there is uncertainty about the future, there have never been more opportunities for lawyers to make an impact on society. Art Refik Anadol: AI will force artists to push their imaginations even further Refik Anadol is a media artist and director who owns and operates Refik Anadol Studio and teaches at UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts. His work locates creativity at the intersection of art, science and technology, and has been featured at landmark institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, The Centre Pompidou and Walt Disney Concert Hall. Artificial intelligence and automation will initially cause some shifts in the labor force in the arts, but I do think that in the long run, it will create more jobs than it will disrupt. For example, we already need an army of ethicists, translators, linguists and humanities professionals to oversee chatbots and implement policies to make sure they make fewer mistakes. And because AI will continue to push human imagination — whether for the pursuit of meaningful human-AI collaborations or to prove that man-made art is better than AI-generated art — it will give rise to more areas for further professional training. We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI. For almost a decade, I have been using AI as a collaborator in my media art practice. I use publicly available data sets to train AI algorithms, ranging from cities’ weather patterns to photographs of California’s national parks. Since the pandemic, my focus has been to compile the largest nature-themed data set and contribute to its preservation by creating archives of images of disappearing natural places or through fundraising. Our work changes with every new AI-related invention, because we engage with deep research to first understand and then incorporate novel technologies into our works. Generative AI uses still-evolving projection algorithms that can learn from existing artifacts to create novel artifacts that accurately reflect the features of the initial data without repeating them. It provides us the possibility to train algorithms with any image, sound or even scent data. The current hype around generative AI models such as text-image generators and natural language chatbots made us put more emphasis on alternative data collection methods. We are committed to contributing to the practice of and dialogues around safeguarding against data bias, protecting data privacy and full transparency about how data is collected and used in training algorithms. A big challenge of using generative AI in art is figuring out how to provide the models with original and authentic data for the kinds of artistic output that I imagine in the beginning. For example, for our most recent project, “Glacier Dreams” — a series of multisensory AI art installations — we decided not to use models already trained with existing glacier images. Making sure that the trained models use ethically sourced data in terms of consent, or even making sure that the data we collect from publicly available platforms fall under that category, is one of the major concerns in our field. So, in order to address these issues, we started to collect our own images, sounds and climate data. By traveling to our first destination, Iceland, we were able to capture the beginning of our own narrative of glaciers by taking our own images and videos. I think that the increasing prevalence, accessibility and acceptance of AI-generated art will force not only artists, but also writers, designers and other creatives to re-consider the meaning of creativity and push their imagination even further. This will require time, effort and in some cases re-structuring of methods and practices, but I am in favor of keeping an open mind while reviewing innovation through a respectful and critical lens. Retail Adam Elmachtoub: AI will help grocery stores set inventory for game days Adam Elmachtoub is an associate professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, specializing in machine learning, optimization and pricing algorithms for e-commerce and logistics. Consider a grocery retailer or restaurant chain on the day that the NBA releases its playoff schedule. For cities that are hosting games, AI tools will one day be able to immediately realize that this news will adjust the demand forecast for foods like chicken wings and potato chips, which are associated with basketball viewing parties. AI tools will then quickly re-optimize decisions associated with inventory shipments, staffing and promotions. Over the last decade, online and brick-and-mortar retail have leveraged many advances in AI, particularly in the fields of operations research and machine learning. Operations research methodologies are used for inventory management, price optimization and delivery logistics, while machine learning tools are used for forecasting demand, digesting product reviews and targeted advertising. In the next wave of AI, we will solve operations problems faster by learning from past data, while also predicting changes to demand at a more granular level (both in space and time). Suppose the “Wannabe” music video by the Spice Girls was released today, rather than in 1996, and went viral on social media. A clothing retailer with an AI system in place can pick up on this viral hit immediately and initiate designs for similar clothing styles as in the video. Machine learning can help predict the demand at a local level, while operations research tools can help to immediately start sourcing materials, optimize manufacturing and plan inventory shipments. While it is possible that retailers might have data scientists that follow the NBA and social media closely, there are countless other events that AI systems will detect and react to in real time — with less human intervention and serendipity required. AI will help make data scientists and managers more efficient, but not necessarily take away jobs, as there will be more opportunities to leverage data and improve the customer experience. Of course, human workers will still be needed to manage AI systems, which can have trouble navigating through satire, false information and adversarial attacks. While some roles, such as operating a register or stocking shelves, might be replaced by AI-powered robots in the future, more jobs may open up in assisting customers with complex tasks such as returns or advice, as retailers compete more on (human) service quality. Nisreen Ameen: Not sure what sunglasses suit you? AI can analyze your face and decide Dr. Nisreen Ameen is a senior lecturer in digital marketing and co-director of the Digital Organisation and Society (DOS) Research Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London. Nisreen is also currently serving as vice president of the UK Academy of Information Systems (UKAIS).  AI will be a game changer for retailers, and the value of this technology in the global retail market is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years. AI will allow retailers to improve the online shopping experience and connect with their customers through personalization, whether it be through online advertisements or curated product pages. Instead of having customers scroll through hundreds of products to find one item that they like or need, selected products can be presented to meet the customer’s tastes or demands, leading to higher engagement and increased sales. AI can also transform the shopping experience in new and unique ways. Some retailers have already installed smart mirrors, which use augmented reality and artificial intelligence for virtual try-ons. These mirrors can suggest different sunglasses, for example, based on an analysis of the customer’s face shape, or help customers visualize how certain beauty products will look. In some cases, customers can also create a digital avatar for online shopping, helping them to confidently select the best size and fit. AI will have an enormous impact on both the nature of work in retail and the labor force in this industry. Chatbots are already widely used in customer service, and AI-driven robots can assist with tasks like inventory monitoring and answering simple questions in retail stores, such as where to find certain items. While AI can handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks or synthesize massive amounts of data, and some retail jobs could be in danger of being replaced, employees’ input is still currently required for decision making and tasks that require empathy and emotional intelligence — particularly when it comes to branding, marketing and public relations, for example. For many employees, AI will redefine job descriptions, and the integration of this technology will require upskilling in order to work with AI and remain creative. Managers in retail should understand the potential and limitations of this new technology and focus on augmentation — utilizing AI in conjunction with human intelligence — instead of automation. Film Theodore Kim: Get ready for the rise of the mockbuster Theodore Kim is a professor of computer science at Yale, a former senior research scientist for Pixar and a two-time Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner. If the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, don’t secure stricter guardrails against the use of AI during their negotiations with Hollywood studios, the film industry will end up relying less on the traditional writers, actors and directors who help bring movies to life. Instead, movies will increasingly be made on the cheap by people who wrestle images out of generative AI systems — a prestigious-sounding task called “prompt engineering.” In reality, this grueling and inevitably low-paying vocation will make today’s relentless, unsustainable visual effects work look like a beach weekend. Instead of meticulously manipulating digital shapes and lights, they will generate images using indirect and ever-more baroque text prompts, and the final images will still get credited to AI. Paychecks will shrink, as they always do when occupations undergo deskilling. Moreover, if all this comes to pass, we should prepare for the golden age of the mockbuster. With no protections in place for writing or acting, the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated. The ChatGPT prompts will begin with, “Make me a ‘Mission Impossible,’ but different enough that I can’t get sued.” These AI-generated films will be a computational distillation of that episode of “30 Rock” where a Janis Joplin biopic that failed to secure her life rights was transformed into the more legally defensible “Jackie Jormp-Jomp” story. As much as advocates breathlessly proclaim that AI will unleash new forms of creative expression, it excels most at imitation and interpolation, and may as well have been custom-made for mockbusters. We’re already seeing AI-generated trailers rip off Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” in a litigiously ambiguous manner. That’s not Leonardo DiCaprio, the argument goes. The hair color is different and the face is creepily blurrier. It remains to be seen whether the use of AI will backfire on the studios and whether audiences might be willing to wait a week for close-enough ripoffs to appear on YouTube. In the meantime, AI-generated films won’t be a boon to actors, directors or viewers. With all those billable hours spent chasing after mockbusters, the winners here will be the lawyers. Tech Eirini Kalliamvakou: A big win for software developers — and society Dr. Eirini Kalliamvakou is a staff researcher at GitHub Next, where she guides the team’s strategic prototyping efforts. Eirini has led the productivity research on GitHub Copilot, and has spoken extensively about developer productivity and happiness. AI has already proven to be one of the best tools we have to empower the next generation of software developers by redefining productivity and lowering barriers to entry. I believe AI will change the way developers work while ultimately increasing demand for these already highly sought-after professionals. A survey of 500 US-based developers found that the vast majority (92%) is already using AI coding tools, and in a controlled study, we found that GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that offers automated code suggestions, helps developers complete tasks 55% faster than they could without it. AI tools like GitHub Copilot can reduce the amount of repetitive code developers need to write by providing auto-complete suggestions that can be accepted with minor edits. The code completions also contain the right coding syntax that developers would otherwise have to look up, minimizing interruptions to their work. More than 2,000 developers have reported that GitHub Copilot helps them stay in the flow, focus on more satisfying work and conserve mental energy. That’s a clear win for overall developer happiness. As for how developers might use the time saved by AI? They can focus more on problem solving, software architecture and innovation. Development work is endless, and software companies and projects often have long backlogs of features, ideas and innovations that they never get to build because their resources are poured into the day’s work. This increase in productivity could make a huge material difference — research shows that AI developer tools could boost global gross domestic product by more than $1.5 trillion by 2030. Given the benefits, learning how to use these tools will soon become table stakes for software developers, who will become more fluent in prompting and interacting with AI. This will ultimately help democratize access to a career in software development and establish AI pair programming tools as part of the standard education and training in this field. If the past is any indication, new developer tools will only augment developers and improve their workflows. The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers. In fact, the number of developers has increased, their wages have gone up, and the barriers to entry have lowered. We expect AI to have a similar effect. Developers’ work is already becoming faster and more enjoyable with AI tools. Can it also become less mentally taxing, more expressive and exactly collaborative enough? Our ambition now spreads to reimagine a different way for developers to bring their ideas to life, work with code and work with AI. Developers and organizations will be more ambitious with what they can accomplish through software development, which helps accelerate overall human progress — a win for developers and society alike. Education Ashok Goel: AI will fully power universities in the next few years Ashok Goel is a professor of computer science and human-centered computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and the executive director of the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and headquartered at Georgia Tech. In 2016, when my laboratory created a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson to automatically answer students’ common questions in online education, we offloaded a routine task from professors to AI agents. This provided students with access to the virtual teaching assistant any place and any time. Over time, this also freed professors to attend to other, more important tasks, such as engaging in deeper conversations with students. Since then, my laboratory has developed interactive books and interactive videos to enhance cognitive engagement, virtual assistants that facilitate social interactions, and learning environments that personalize learning. I believe that AI will have a deep, profound and systemic impact on education. The impact will be more rapid and radical in higher education because it has more freedom to experiment; a variety of social, cultural and political forces often make changes in K-12 education more difficult to achieve. I expect that within the next few years, we will see the rise of the first fully AI-powered universities in which every office, job and activity will be automated or augmented by AI. It has been said that AI helps humans do things better, for example, do things faster and more easily. While this is true for many administrative tasks, the real value of AI is in helping humans do better things, for example, be more creative. Based on Jill Watson and other experiments in our laboratory, I expect that students in general will embrace the new AI technologies. And most professors will adapt to advances in AI, as the tools will help amplify their voice and reach. AI will allow them, for instance, to reach more students. Professors will also have more time to focus on important tasks such as creating new content and mentoring students. It remains to be seen how easily administrative staff will accommodate the approaching changes, as some may see AI as a potential threat to their jobs. While I see no reason for professors to lose their jobs, some staff positions may well be lost to AI. More generally, AI will enable universities to engage in more creative educational practices, for example, personalized learning — learning tailored to the needs and profiles of individual students — and lifetime education — learning new skills throughout a student’s lifetime. This will empower students, enabling them to learn what they want and when they want it. This will redefine the role of institutions of higher education in our lives and society, as these institutions will emerge as centers of continuous and sustained workforce development critical to the economy. Kristen DiCerbo: AI will allow teachers to be more human Kristen DiCerbo, Ph.D. is the chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She has spent most of her career designing and researching digital learning environments. Within the education system, teachers are often being asked to do too much and, in some places for some subjects, there are teacher shortages. The promise of AI in education is that we can free up teachers’ time by providing them assistance to complete labor-intensive activities, such as lesson planning, rubric creation, and even feedback and grading. An AI teaching assistant, for example, can offer students more frequent and immediate feedback on their writing, and can ask them to explain their steps on a math problem. Students learn best when they get a chance to practice new skills and get immediate feedback on their efforts, but this is impossible with one teacher and large class sizes. So AI will really become an extension of the teacher rather than a replacement. Systems based on large language models, like chatbots, can help teachers differentiate lessons for learners at different levels. It can reduce the amount of time teachers spend on planning by serving as a partner in creating lesson plans, brainstorming class activities and drafting quizzes. Spending less time on these tasks does not mean we need fewer teachers. It means teachers have more time to build relationships with students. Studies show that strong relationships with teachers and school staff help increase students’ motivation and academic engagement. Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that. National assessment results are not where we want them to be. We are not reaching all learners. Using AI can shift responsibilities so teachers can focus on the uniquely human things they can do to help students learn and prepare to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Agriculture Alireza Pourreza: When it comes to AI, farmers will need to strike a balance Dr. Alireza Pourreza is an associate professor of extension in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering department at the University of California, Davis, and the director of the university’s Digital Agriculture Lab. Pourreza leads research and extension education in digital agriculture, remote sensing, precision agriculture, and mechanization. Artificial intelligence can transform agriculture and food production, revolutionize decision-making and help farmers address emerging issues from crop diseases to extreme weather events. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI provides farmers with valuable decision-support tools that help optimize best practices and increase productivity. AI-driven predictive crop growth models can offer accurate crop yields and quality forecasts by analyzing weather patterns, soil conditions and crop health. This data helps farmers make effective decisions when it comes to planting schedules, allocating resources and marketing their crops by aligning supply with demand, adjusting pricing, timing market entry, targeting specific segments and negotiating contracts effectively based on accurate yield predictions. AI is also helpful for precision agriculture, or tailoring farming practices such as irrigation, fertilization and pest control to the specific needs of different areas within a field, recognizing that some areas may require different treatments for optimal crop growth and health than others. This can lead to improved yields, reduced waste and enhanced quality. Drones equipped with AI-driven sensors and spectral cameras can also identify crop stress and damage or detect pests and diseases, allowing for timely intervention. A farmer might use an AI-driven irrigation system to monitor soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation daily to meet the specific needs of different areas within a field. This precise control can conserve water and promote healthier crop growth, adapting to weather changes and leading to higher yields. Labor shortages are common in the agriculture industry and autonomous robotic systems can harvest crops accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered machines can streamline sorting and packaging. By automating labor-intensive tasks, AI enables farmers to strategically allocate their workforce, focusing on other activities that require human expertise. While AI offers immense potential, there are limitations. AI relies on the quality and accuracy of data, as well as wireless connectivity, which can be limited in rural areas. Initial implementation costs may also pose a challenge for small-scale farmers with limited resources. And it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work. By striking a balance between leveraging AI’s capabilities and recognizing the value of human expertise, farmers can embrace AI as a powerful tool, ensuring a more sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.",5403.0,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}",,,,,N/A,N/A,"

         — 
    


            “AI is coming for your job.”
    

            That’s just one variation of the many headlines you’ve probably seen ever since ChatGPT exploded in popularity and won the world’s attention late last year. But is it true?
    

            Back in April, Dropbox announced it was cutting 500 employees. In May, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas let go of almost 4,000 people. And in July, the founder of an e-commerce startup said he laid off 90% of his support team. The common reason cited? You guessed it: artificial intelligence.
    

Goldman Sachs economists have estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI, with up to a quarter of all jobs being completely done by AI.
    

            Indeed, large language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated a pretty remarkable ability to write code, offer detailed instructions for different tasks, pass a law school bar exam, and even express empathy when answering medical questions. And while this technology has the potential to cause widespread disruption, the effects may not be felt evenly across the workforce, with white-collar workers likely to be more affected than manual laborers.
    

            AI isn’t always better, faster or cheaper, though. In fact, current iterations are prone to making mistakes and spitting out false information. News outlet CNET had to issue several corrections after it used an AI tool to help write stories. And some workers, including members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, have said that their workload actually increased since their companies implemented new AI tools.

            In some industries, experts have suggested a future in which AI can assist humans rather than replace them entirely. In others, artificial intelligence may have little to no impact at all.
    

            To get a better sense of the effect AI might have on different industries across the labor market, we reached out to experts in medicine, law, art, retail, film, tech, education and agriculture, to address 1) How will AI change the nature of work? and 2) How will AI change the labor force in this specific industry?
    

            Read on to see what they had to say. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.
    

        Medicine


        Erich S. Huang: Do you want AI to be your doctor?


Erich S. Huang is the head of Clinical Informatics at Verily and former chief data officer for quality at Duke Health and assistant dean for Biomedical Informatics at Duke University School of Medicine.


            Imagine you are sitting in an exam room. You are a 47-year-old with a 16-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Last week you had your annual screening mammogram and the radiologist identified a suspicious lesion. This week you have an ultrasound and a core needle biopsy. You’ve never needed a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor more than now.
    

            How much of this experience do you feel comfortable outsourcing to artificial intelligence? How do we position algorithms in settings where we still need professionals to sit down, look you in the eye, understand who you are as a person, help you understand what is going to happen next and answer all of your questions?

“While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can.”
Erich S. Huang




            I’ve worked on AI in biomedicine for my entire career. I absolutely believe in its potential and know that AI will certainly be a part of medicine as we work to improve and further personalize care. AI can win back time and space for clinicians and help to reduce the administrative burden that is mostly tangential to direct patient care.

            How often do you notice your doctor or nurse looking at a screen rather than looking at you? Several hours and thousands of mouse clicks a day are laboriously devoted to entering data into an electronic health record. Many health care person hours are spent on billing and reimbursement rather than patient care. These represent low-hanging opportunities for automation that will help your doctor be more present for you.
    

            But AI should not take away clinical jobs. While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can.
    

            Graduating from medical school, we raise our right hands and pledge the Hippocratic Oath. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence do not. The best clinicians make data-driven decisions while helping you and your family understand your options with compassion. They are professionals. Algorithms are not.
    

            Think of navigation aids like Apple or Google Maps: We entrust algorithms to evaluate factors such as traffic and road construction to find us the best route to our destination. We still drive the car. We still scan the road ahead for changing conditions and pump the brakes (even with self-driving cars) when we need to react quickly.
    

            We must do the same for health care. Our task is to use algorithms to marshal data to efficiently assist human professionals to help other human beings to better health. How we care for patients should not be “artificial.”

        Regina Barzilay: AI can shift late-stage treatment to prevention


Regina Barzilay is a distinguished professor for AI and health in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. She is the AI lead of Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health. Barzilay is also a MacArthur Fellow and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.


            In 2016, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton made a bold prediction that within five to 10 years, AI models would outperform humans in reading medical images, saying, “People should stop training radiologists now.”
    

            He was right in some ways and wrong in others. Most clinicians refer to this quote as an example of AI hype, citing the significant shortage of radiologists, who are still very much in demand today. But he was right about AI’s abilities — in some areas of clinical AI, primarily radiology, machines indeed match and even outperform human experts. Among AI practitioners, Hinton’s comments often ignite feelings of frustration over the increasing gap between the performance capacity of these existing tools and the slow rate of their adoption in health care systems.
    



        Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care.

            Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care. We already see research models that can diagnose diseases years prior to symptom occurrence, predict an individual patient’s response to intervention and personalize the treatment.
    

            But real-world integration of AI in health care has been slow due to a number of reasons, from the initial cost of adoption to qualms about safety and regulation. Based on my experience collaborating with hospitals, health care systems are more likely to utilize AI to reduce the administrative burden in care management, fueled by advancements in natural language processing tools (such as ChatGPT) that can automate the transcription of doctors’ notes, help with scheduling and streamline office support. Instead of replacing doctors, this technology can help address issues of burnout and allow health care providers to focus more on improving the patient experience.
    

            But the more fundamental change to health care will come from the uptake of new AI-powered diagnostic and treatment tools which will shift late-disease treatment to prevention and early-stage interventions. In the same way that e-commerce provides recommendations tailored to a consumer, AI-empowered medicine will eventually be personalized.
    

            To achieve this vision, advancements in AI are not sufficient on their own; clinicians, regulators and the general public have a role to play in determining the extent to which AI will be adopted in hospitals and doctors’ offices.
    

        Law


        Daniel W. Linna Jr.: AI is changing the skills lawyers need


Daniel W. Linna Jr. has a joint appointment at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law and McCormick School of Engineering. Dan’s research and teaching focus is on using AI for legal services and the regulation of AI in society. Previously, Dan was a litigator and equity partner at Honigman, a large law firm, and an IT manager, developer and consultant.


            Artificial intelligence will better equip society to uphold the values and achieve the goals of the law. With AI assistance, lawyers can spend more time working on the challenges that attracted many of us to the law, such as eradicating inequality, ensuring access to justice, safeguarding democracy and strengthening and expanding the rule of law.
    

            For instance, we can develop AI tools to help individuals understand their responsibilities and rights, and preserve and enforce those rights. At Northwestern University’s CS+Law Innovation Lab, where my colleague and I oversee teams of law and computer science students who build prototype technologies, we have worked with the nonprofit Law Center for Better Housing to improve Rentervention, a chatbot that helps tenants in disputes with landlords. If a landlord does not return a security deposit, for example, Rentervention can help tenants determine if they are entitled to the security deposit and, if so, help draft a letter demanding its return.
    

            People in businesses, large and small, are already using chatbots, AI assistants and other AI tools to help them comply with laws, regulations and internal policies. AI tools specifically developed for legal tasks can help them draft and negotiate contracts, make business decisions consistent with legal and ethical principles and proactively identify potential problems that they should discuss with a lawyer.

“…in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs …  based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions.”
Daniel W. Linna Jr.




            For lawyers, this means that AI can automate or augment many legal tasks that they perform. Most lawyers spend a lot of time finding applicable laws, organizing information, spotting common issues, performing basic analysis and drafting formulaic language in emails, memos, forms, contracts and briefs. AI systems will be able to do this faster, cheaper and better. Large language models, like those behind ChatGPT, have significantly increased the capabilities of these systems. Established legal information providers and many startups are rapidly developing and releasing AI systems that are “fine-tuned” or specialized for legal tasks.
    

            Unsurprisingly, AI is changing the skills lawyers need. To responsibly use AI, they will need a functional understanding of the technology to evaluate the benefits and risks of using it, such as how it might fail and the ways in which it might be biased or unfair.
    

            Lawyers will also need to exercise judgment to tailor an AI system’s output for specific situations. For example, in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs, using the specific language and arguments that are most likely to persuade the assigned judge to rule in favor of the client, based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions.
    

            A lawyer will need to determine if the prediction and the proposed language and arguments are a good fit given the client’s goals and interests. Perhaps what would be a winning argument, for example, would cause damage to the client’s brand in the eye of the public, and the lawyer should revise it.
    

            Lawyers will continue to play a significant role as governments update laws, regulations and policies for emerging technologies, including to address AI bias, discrimination, privacy, liability and intellectual property. Additionally, new roles are emerging in the legal industry, such as legal engineers who build systems, legal data scientists and legal operations professionals. And there is significant unmet demand for legal services from individuals and even businesses. Considering all of this, the best long-term prediction now is that there will continue to be a stable number of jobs for lawyers and other legal professionals, so long as the legal industry embraces technology and trains professionals to develop important complementary skills.
    

            While there is uncertainty about the future, there have never been more opportunities for lawyers to make an impact on society.
    

        Art


        Refik Anadol: AI will force artists to push their imaginations even further


Refik Anadol is a media artist and director who owns and operates Refik Anadol Studio and teaches at UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts. His work locates creativity at the intersection of art, science and technology, and has been featured at landmark institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, The Centre Pompidou and Walt Disney Concert Hall.


            Artificial intelligence and automation will initially cause some shifts in the labor force in the arts, but I do think that in the long run, it will create more jobs than it will disrupt.
    

            For example, we already need an army of ethicists, translators, linguists and humanities professionals to oversee chatbots and implement policies to make sure they make fewer mistakes. And because AI will continue to push human imagination — whether for the pursuit of meaningful human-AI collaborations or to prove that man-made art is better than AI-generated art — it will give rise to more areas for further professional training. We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI.
    

            For almost a decade, I have been using AI as a collaborator in my media art practice. I use publicly available data sets to train AI algorithms, ranging from cities’ weather patterns to photographs of California’s national parks. Since the pandemic, my focus has been to compile the largest nature-themed data set and contribute to its preservation by creating archives of images of disappearing natural places or through fundraising.

“We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI.”
Refik Anadol




            Our work changes with every new AI-related invention, because we engage with deep research to first understand and then incorporate novel technologies into our works. Generative AI uses still-evolving projection algorithms that can learn from existing artifacts to create novel artifacts that accurately reflect the features of the initial data without repeating them. It provides us the possibility to train algorithms with any image, sound or even scent data. The current hype around generative AI models such as text-image generators and natural language chatbots made us put more emphasis on alternative data collection methods. We are committed to contributing to the practice of and dialogues around safeguarding against data bias, protecting data privacy and full transparency about how data is collected and used in training algorithms.
    

            A big challenge of using generative AI in art is figuring out how to provide the models with original and authentic data for the kinds of artistic output that I imagine in the beginning. For example, for our most recent project, “Glacier Dreams” — a series of multisensory AI art installations — we decided not to use models already trained with existing glacier images. Making sure that the trained models use ethically sourced data in terms of consent, or even making sure that the data we collect from publicly available platforms fall under that category, is one of the major concerns in our field. So, in order to address these issues, we started to collect our own images, sounds and climate data. By traveling to our first destination, Iceland, we were able to capture the beginning of our own narrative of glaciers by taking our own images and videos.
    

            I think that the increasing prevalence, accessibility and acceptance of AI-generated art will force not only artists, but also writers, designers and other creatives to re-consider the meaning of creativity and push their imagination even further. This will require time, effort and in some cases re-structuring of methods and practices, but I am in favor of keeping an open mind while reviewing innovation through a respectful and critical lens.
    

        Retail


        Adam Elmachtoub: AI will help grocery stores set inventory for game days


Adam Elmachtoub is an associate professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, specializing in machine learning, optimization and pricing algorithms for e-commerce and logistics.


            Consider a grocery retailer or restaurant chain on the day that the NBA releases its playoff schedule. For cities that are hosting games, AI tools will one day be able to immediately realize that this news will adjust the demand forecast for foods like chicken wings and potato chips, which are associated with basketball viewing parties. AI tools will then quickly re-optimize decisions associated with inventory shipments, staffing and promotions.
    

            Over the last decade, online and brick-and-mortar retail have leveraged many advances in AI, particularly in the fields of operations research and machine learning. Operations research methodologies are used for inventory management, price optimization and delivery logistics, while machine learning tools are used for forecasting demand, digesting product reviews and targeted advertising. In the next wave of AI, we will solve operations problems faster by learning from past data, while also predicting changes to demand at a more granular level (both in space and time).

            Suppose the “Wannabe” music video by the Spice Girls was released today, rather than in 1996, and went viral on social media. A clothing retailer with an AI system in place can pick up on this viral hit immediately and initiate designs for similar clothing styles as in the video. Machine learning can help predict the demand at a local level, while operations research tools can help to immediately start sourcing materials, optimize manufacturing and plan inventory shipments.
    

            While it is possible that retailers might have data scientists that follow the NBA and social media closely, there are countless other events that AI systems will detect and react to in real time — with less human intervention and serendipity required. AI will help make data scientists and managers more efficient, but not necessarily take away jobs, as there will be more opportunities to leverage data and improve the customer experience. Of course, human workers will still be needed to manage AI systems, which can have trouble navigating through satire, false information and adversarial attacks. While some roles, such as operating a register or stocking shelves, might be replaced by AI-powered robots in the future, more jobs may open up in assisting customers with complex tasks such as returns or advice, as retailers compete more on (human) service quality.
    

        Nisreen Ameen: Not sure what sunglasses suit you? AI can analyze your face and decide


Dr. Nisreen Ameen is a senior lecturer in digital marketing and co-director of the Digital Organisation and Society (DOS) Research Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London. Nisreen is also currently serving as vice president of the UK Academy of Information Systems (UKAIS). 


            AI will be a game changer for retailers, and the value of this technology in the global retail market is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years.
    

            AI will allow retailers to improve the online shopping experience and connect with their customers through personalization, whether it be through online advertisements or curated product pages. Instead of having customers scroll through hundreds of products to find one item that they like or need, selected products can be presented to meet the customer’s tastes or demands, leading to higher engagement and increased sales.
    

            AI can also transform the shopping experience in new and unique ways. Some retailers have already installed smart mirrors, which use augmented reality and artificial intelligence for virtual try-ons. These mirrors can suggest different sunglasses, for example, based on an analysis of the customer’s face shape, or help customers visualize how certain beauty products will look. In some cases, customers can also create a digital avatar for online shopping, helping them to confidently select the best size and fit.
    






CNN




“These mirrors can suggest different sunglasses, for example, based on an analysis of the customer’s face shape, or help customers visualize how certain beauty products will look.”
Nisreen Ameen




            AI will have an enormous impact on both the nature of work in retail and the labor force in this industry. Chatbots are already widely used in customer service, and AI-driven robots can assist with tasks like inventory monitoring and answering simple questions in retail stores, such as where to find certain items.
    

            While AI can handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks or synthesize massive amounts of data, and some retail jobs could be in danger of being replaced, employees’ input is still currently required for decision making and tasks that require empathy and emotional intelligence — particularly when it comes to branding, marketing and public relations, for example.
    

            For many employees, AI will redefine job descriptions, and the integration of this technology will require upskilling in order to work with AI and remain creative. Managers in retail should understand the potential and limitations of this new technology and focus on augmentation — utilizing AI in conjunction with human intelligence — instead of automation.
    

        Film


        Theodore Kim: Get ready for the rise of the mockbuster


Theodore Kim is a professor of computer science at Yale, a former senior research scientist for Pixar and a two-time Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner.


            If the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, don’t secure stricter guardrails against the use of AI during their negotiations with Hollywood studios, the film industry will end up relying less on the traditional writers, actors and directors who help bring movies to life.
    

            Instead, movies will increasingly be made on the cheap by people who wrestle images out of generative AI systems — a prestigious-sounding task called “prompt engineering.” In reality, this grueling and inevitably low-paying vocation will make today’s relentless, unsustainable visual effects work look like a beach weekend. Instead of meticulously manipulating digital shapes and lights, they will generate images using indirect and ever-more baroque text prompts, and the final images will still get credited to AI. Paychecks will shrink, as they always do when occupations undergo deskilling.

“…the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated.”
Theodore Kim




            Moreover, if all this comes to pass, we should prepare for the golden age of the mockbuster. With no protections in place for writing or acting, the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated.
    

            The ChatGPT prompts will begin with, “Make me a ‘Mission Impossible,’ but different enough that I can’t get sued.” These AI-generated films will be a computational distillation of that episode of “30 Rock” where a Janis Joplin biopic that failed to secure her life rights was transformed into the more legally defensible “Jackie Jormp-Jomp” story.
    

            As much as advocates breathlessly proclaim that AI will unleash new forms of creative expression, it excels most at imitation and interpolation, and may as well have been custom-made for mockbusters. We’re already seeing AI-generated trailers rip off Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” in a litigiously ambiguous manner. That’s not Leonardo DiCaprio, the argument goes. The hair color is different and the face is creepily blurrier.
    

            It remains to be seen whether the use of AI will backfire on the studios and whether audiences might be willing to wait a week for close-enough ripoffs to appear on YouTube. In the meantime, AI-generated films won’t be a boon to actors, directors or viewers. With all those billable hours spent chasing after mockbusters, the winners here will be the lawyers.
    

        Tech


        Eirini Kalliamvakou: A big win for software developers — and society


Dr. Eirini Kalliamvakou is a staff researcher at GitHub Next, where she guides the team’s strategic prototyping efforts. Eirini has led the productivity research on GitHub Copilot, and has spoken extensively about developer productivity and happiness.


            AI has already proven to be one of the best tools we have to empower the next generation of software developers by redefining productivity and lowering barriers to entry. I believe AI will change the way developers work while ultimately increasing demand for these already highly sought-after professionals.
    

            A survey of 500 US-based developers found that the vast majority (92%) is already using AI coding tools, and in a controlled study, we found that GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that offers automated code suggestions, helps developers complete tasks 55% faster than they could without it.
    

            AI tools like GitHub Copilot can reduce the amount of repetitive code developers need to write by providing auto-complete suggestions that can be accepted with minor edits. The code completions also contain the right coding syntax that developers would otherwise have to look up, minimizing interruptions to their work.
    






CNN




“The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers.”
Eirini Kalliamvakou




            More than 2,000 developers have reported that GitHub Copilot helps them stay in the flow, focus on more satisfying work and conserve mental energy. That’s a clear win for overall developer happiness.
    

            As for how developers might use the time saved by AI? They can focus more on problem solving, software architecture and innovation. Development work is endless, and software companies and projects often have long backlogs of features, ideas and innovations that they never get to build because their resources are poured into the day’s work.
    

            This increase in productivity could make a huge material difference — research shows that AI developer tools could boost global gross domestic product by more than $1.5 trillion by 2030. Given the benefits, learning how to use these tools will soon become table stakes for software developers, who will become more fluent in prompting and interacting with AI. This will ultimately help democratize access to a career in software development and establish AI pair programming tools as part of the standard education and training in this field.
    

            If the past is any indication, new developer tools will only augment developers and improve their workflows. The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers.
    

            In fact, the number of developers has increased, their wages have gone up, and the barriers to entry have lowered. We expect AI to have a similar effect.
    

            Developers’ work is already becoming faster and more enjoyable with AI tools. Can it also become less mentally taxing, more expressive and exactly collaborative enough?
    

            Our ambition now spreads to reimagine a different way for developers to bring their ideas to life, work with code and work with AI. Developers and organizations will be more ambitious with what they can accomplish through software development, which helps accelerate overall human progress — a win for developers and society alike.
    

        Education


        Ashok Goel: AI will fully power universities in the next few years


Ashok Goel is a professor of computer science and human-centered computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and the executive director of the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and headquartered at Georgia Tech.


            In 2016, when my laboratory created a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson to automatically answer students’ common questions in online education, we offloaded a routine task from professors to AI agents. This provided students with access to the virtual teaching assistant any place and any time. Over time, this also freed professors to attend to other, more important tasks, such as engaging in deeper conversations with students. Since then, my laboratory has developed interactive books and interactive videos to enhance cognitive engagement, virtual assistants that facilitate social interactions, and learning environments that personalize learning.
    

            I believe that AI will have a deep, profound and systemic impact on education. The impact will be more rapid and radical in higher education because it has more freedom to experiment; a variety of social, cultural and political forces often make changes in K-12 education more difficult to achieve. I expect that within the next few years, we will see the rise of the first fully AI-powered universities in which every office, job and activity will be automated or augmented by AI.

            It has been said that AI helps humans do things better, for example, do things faster and more easily. While this is true for many administrative tasks, the real value of AI is in helping humans do better things, for example, be more creative.
    

            Based on Jill Watson and other experiments in our laboratory, I expect that students in general will embrace the new AI technologies. And most professors will adapt to advances in AI, as the tools will help amplify their voice and reach. AI will allow them, for instance, to reach more students. Professors will also have more time to focus on important tasks such as creating new content and mentoring students. It remains to be seen how easily administrative staff will accommodate the approaching changes, as some may see AI as a potential threat to their jobs. While I see no reason for professors to lose their jobs, some staff positions may well be lost to AI.
    

            More generally, AI will enable universities to engage in more creative educational practices, for example, personalized learning — learning tailored to the needs and profiles of individual students — and lifetime education — learning new skills throughout a student’s lifetime. This will empower students, enabling them to learn what they want and when they want it. This will redefine the role of institutions of higher education in our lives and society, as these institutions will emerge as centers of continuous and sustained workforce development critical to the economy.
    

        Kristen DiCerbo: AI will allow teachers to be more human


Kristen DiCerbo, Ph.D. is the chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She has spent most of her career designing and researching digital learning environments.


            Within the education system, teachers are often being asked to do too much and, in some places for some subjects, there are teacher shortages. The promise of AI in education is that we can free up teachers’ time by providing them assistance to complete labor-intensive activities, such as lesson planning, rubric creation, and even feedback and grading.
    

            An AI teaching assistant, for example, can offer students more frequent and immediate feedback on their writing, and can ask them to explain their steps on a math problem. Students learn best when they get a chance to practice new skills and get immediate feedback on their efforts, but this is impossible with one teacher and large class sizes.
    



        Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.

            So AI will really become an extension of the teacher rather than a replacement. Systems based on large language models, like chatbots, can help teachers differentiate lessons for learners at different levels. It can reduce the amount of time teachers spend on planning by serving as a partner in creating lesson plans, brainstorming class activities and drafting quizzes.
    

            Spending less time on these tasks does not mean we need fewer teachers. It means teachers have more time to build relationships with students. Studies show that strong relationships with teachers and school staff help increase students’ motivation and academic engagement. Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.
    

National assessment results are not where we want them to be. We are not reaching all learners. Using AI can shift responsibilities so teachers can focus on the uniquely human things they can do to help students learn and prepare to solve the challenges of tomorrow.

        Alireza Pourreza: When it comes to AI, farmers will need to strike a balance


Dr. Alireza Pourreza is an associate professor of extension in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering department at the University of California, Davis, and the director of the university’s Digital Agriculture Lab. Pourreza leads research and extension education in digital agriculture, remote sensing, precision agriculture, and mechanization.


            Artificial intelligence can transform agriculture and food production, revolutionize decision-making and help farmers address emerging issues from crop diseases to extreme weather events.
    

            By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI provides farmers with valuable decision-support tools that help optimize best practices and increase productivity. AI-driven predictive crop growth models can offer accurate crop yields and quality forecasts by analyzing weather patterns, soil conditions and crop health. This data helps farmers make effective decisions when it comes to planting schedules, allocating resources and marketing their crops by aligning supply with demand, adjusting pricing, timing market entry, targeting specific segments and negotiating contracts effectively based on accurate yield predictions.

“…it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work.”
Alireza Pourreza




            AI is also helpful for precision agriculture, or tailoring farming practices such as irrigation, fertilization and pest control to the specific needs of different areas within a field, recognizing that some areas may require different treatments for optimal crop growth and health than others. This can lead to improved yields, reduced waste and enhanced quality. Drones equipped with AI-driven sensors and spectral cameras can also identify crop stress and damage or detect pests and diseases, allowing for timely intervention. A farmer might use an AI-driven irrigation system to monitor soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation daily to meet the specific needs of different areas within a field. This precise control can conserve water and promote healthier crop growth, adapting to weather changes and leading to higher yields.
    

Labor shortages are common in the agriculture industry and autonomous robotic systems can harvest crops accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered machines can streamline sorting and packaging. By automating labor-intensive tasks, AI enables farmers to strategically allocate their workforce, focusing on other activities that require human expertise.
    

            While AI offers immense potential, there are limitations. AI relies on the quality and accuracy of data, as well as wireless connectivity, which can be limited in rural areas. Initial implementation costs may also pose a challenge for small-scale farmers with limited resources. And it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work.
    

            By striking a balance between leveraging AI’s capabilities and recognizing the value of human expertise, farmers can embrace AI as a powerful tool, ensuring a more sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.

                Generative AI is already affecting work, but a ‘long journey’ awaits
            
Walmart announced a rollout of the tech to employees last week. AI will help “lower some friction between humans and software,” a source told HR Dive.

The world’s largest private employer is rolling out a generative artificial intelligence tool to frontline employees in what may be remembered as a milestone for workplace technology.
In an Aug. 30 LinkedIn post, Walmart’s Executive VP and Chief People Officer Donna Morris announced the launch of My Assistant, a generative AI program for the company’s associates that the company said will speed up processes such as drafting, summarizing large documents and problem solving.
The program is available to some 50,000 employees via both desktop and mobile interfaces, CIO Dive reported, and is intended to boost employee productivity as well as creativity and innovation, according to the announcement.

“Ideally, this technology will free [employees] from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing more time and focus for improving the customer/member experience,” Morris and co-author Cheryl Ainoa, executive vice president of new businesses and emerging technologies at Walmart, wrote on LinkedIn.
Though mainstream users became aware of generative AI less than one year ago, the tech has become increasingly present in workplaces. That is thanks in part to legacy vendors that have rolled out their own generative AI offerings. Two of the most prominent are Microsoft’s 365 Copilot and Google’s Duet AI, which integrate AI into software that is already widely used by employees, said J.P. Gownder, VP and principal analyst for Forrester’s future of work team.
For example, an employee could use the Microsoft and Google tools to quickly source images for a slideshow or build pivot tables for data analysis, all by directly communicating with an AI. Aside from speed, trackability is another advantage of these tools, Gownder said, as they can be audited for security, privacy and usage type by employers.
“Generative AI is going to lower some friction between humans and software,” Gownder continued. “It’s going to be very useful in much of the tech and software that we already use.”
The organizational AI approach is an alternative to the “bring your own AI” model in which employees apply publicly available tools to everyday tasks — often without their boss’ knowledge. A February survey of workers by Glassdoor’s Fishbowl found that more than one-third of employees were using AI tools for work, and 68% of that contingent said they did so without first informing management.

There are a few risks that come with this approach, Gownder said, including the security concerns inherent in feeding sensitive organizational data into an AI tool, as well as the problem of AI “hallucination” that sees some programs provide inaccurate or false information in response to a user prompt.
All generative AI programs present some potential downsides, however, Gownder noted. Authenticity is one such concern, particularly if AI is used for drafting and messaging purposes.
“If I were to send you an email, you’re not going to know if I wrote it using an assistant or if I just let Copilot write it, and I think there is a difference in knowing which of those scenarios is true,” he said. “If we sent a personalized email from the CEO, but it’s not actually written by the CEO, what’s the actual level of authenticity in that communication?”
Employers already have some awareness of AI’s limitations. Morris and Ainoa wrote that while the tech has the potential to help workers perform their jobs faster and more efficiently, “it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on.”
Training is key for employees, too. An IBM Institute for Business Value report found that reskilling poses a challenge to AI adoption. Gownder said employers that roll out AI should take charge in order to ensure workers get the most out of the tech.
“If you’re deploying [AI], it is your responsibility to train workers,” he said. “Your return on investment also depends on workers using the right skills. They’re not going to be effective if employees aren’t using them properly.”
And even if an organization decides to prohibit users from bringing their own AI to work, the widespread availability of generative AI platforms could still present some tension, Gownder said.

Despite these concerns, employee enthusiasm for AI has grown by some measurements. A recent Robert Half survey found that about 4 in 10 U.S. employees said they thought generative AI would have a positive effect on their careers, including more than half of HR professionals in the survey. That enthusiasm is all the more reason for employers to take time to consider how they will approach the subject, according to Gownder.
“You really need to think carefully about the users you’re intending to deploy AI to,” he said. “It’s going to be a long journey.”

 With its abilities to answer questions, perform research, generate content, and perform other human-like tasks, fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could threaten some jobs and industries aren't unfounded. But similar to past technological revolutions, AI isn’t likely to cause widespread job losses, and could eventually help stimulate the labor market, a report from Wells Fargo Economics concluded.


Key Takeaways
A Well Fargo Economics report found that past technological revolutions, like the Internet adoption of the 1990s, helped contribute to higher employment trends.Studies show that AI can perform part of some jobs, perhaps all of a few, but also that new technology often creates jobs that previously hadn't been imagined.Slow labor-force growth in the U.S. means that AI could help meet the increasing need for more workers.
 Acknowledging that some industries and occupations could indeed be rendered obsolete by AI, the four-part report showed that past technological revolutions failed to cause the widespread labor-market disruptions that some feared.


 Looking at the Internet revolution of the 1990s, the report noted that in the period between business-cycle peaks in July 1990 and March 2001, payrolls grew an average of 1.8% a year, adding about 23 million jobs.1 


 “History is rife with examples of groups that have opposed technological change due to fears of widespread job losses,” Wells Fargo Chief Economist Jay Bryson and others wrote in the analysis. “Time and again, however, aggregate levels of employment and income have risen in the aftermath of the introduction of the new technology.”2


  AI Poses Threat to Some ‘White-Collar’ Jobs, but Labor Market Proves Resilient  
 Studies of how much work could be accomplished by generative AI vary. The Wells Fargo report cited a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania with OpenAI and OpenResearch, which determined that 80% of workers could have at least 10% of their tasks done with generative AI, and 19% of workers could have 50% or more of their job covered by AI.3


 Another look from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that the share of time spent on work tasks that could be automated through AI or other technology amounted to 60% to 70%.1




 ""White-collar"" jobs are likely to face the most exposure to the technology, the report noted. Case in point, one study found that some jobs most threatened by AI include telemarketers, political scientists, mediators, judges, psychologists, and postsecondary teachers in foreign languages, history, and law. The least threatened: cement masons, roofers and welders.


 So far, predictions about the impacts of automation haven’t panned out. Wells Fargo pointed to a 2013 paper from Oxford University that forecast 47% of U.S. employment was at risk to automation over the next decade or two that failed to foresee the current labor market where the unemployment rate of 3.5% has hovered around record lows.1


  Slower Adoption of Technology Can Preserve Jobs  
 Another trend that’s likely to help preserve the labor market is that while technological development can happen quickly, widespread adoption can take more time, allowing transitions in the workforce to happen more gradually. With AI, factors as varied as government regulation to hardware costs to labor union strikes could help slow uptake of the technology enough to give the labor market time to transition. 


 The report also noted that technology like AI might help to fill the gap that a slowdown in the growth of the labor force has created. Estimates show that the U.S. labor force is expected to grow by 0.5% a year from 2023 to 2033, about half the pace of the past 30 years.1 


 The structural slowdown in the labor supply, which includes weak growth of the working-age population and smaller gains in labor-force participation, means that more workers will be needed and, in some cases, workers will need to do more, all of which could be accomplished by AI. 


 Most likely, the report said, AI would create jobs as others are replaced, noting that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 60% of the job roles performed in 2018 hadn't yet been created in 1940.1


 “Making the widespread displacement of jobs the base case risks us joining a long historical record of commentators who have rung the alarm bell about surging unemployment due to new inventions that seemed unbelievable to the humans of the time,” it said.2

Generative AI and it’s impact on the entry-level job market: The future of work for Gen Z – Sarah Green Carmichael 
5th September 20235th September 2023 by Editor BizNews 


The article discusses the potential impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, on entry-level jobs and the career prospects of younger workers, particularly Gen Z. It explores concerns that AI automation could reduce the number of available professional jobs and limit learning opportunities for new entrants to the workforce. However, some experts argue that AI may raise the performance standards for entry-level workers, making them more efficient and capable, ultimately benefiting companies. While some entry-level jobs may evolve or even disappear due to AI, history shows that technological revolutions often create new industries and job opportunities in the long run. The article emphasizes the need to pay attention to the potential impact on workers without college degrees and highlights that AI still requires human oversight due to its limitations.
Is ChatGPT Coming for Entry-Level Jobs?: Sarah Green Carmichael
By Sarah Green Carmichael
The first years of my career in media were spent making photocopies, collecting faxes and filing papers. I also opened reader mail, took notes on meetings and ran errands for my bosses — picking up everything from skim lattes to control-top Donna Karan tights.
I’ve been thinking back to those dues-paying days recently due to an onslaught of depressing research about how generative AI, the technology that includes image and text creation tools like ChatGPT, could hurt the career prospects of Gen Z. If it transforms or even takes over typical entry-level tasks in professional occupations — building spreadsheets, writing first drafts or creating presentations — what will happen to jobs for younger workers?
At first blush, the outlook is bleak. Long before generative AI was a buzzword, entry-level jobs were becoming tougher to land. The Great Recession caused a spike in the un- and under-employment rate for recent graduates. Younger workers have smaller networks, which makes job-searching tougher.
And many employers have simply decided they don’t want to bother with brand-new workers. A 2018 analysis of almost 100,000 job postings found that most “entry-level” jobs required three or more years of experience. Employers don’t want to invest time and money in training. That’s short-sighted, but it’s a trend entry-level workers have been fighting for decades.
Some say that AI will compound these problems. Not only will there be fewer professional jobs to go around, but as more of those tasks are automated, young workers will miss out on learning opportunities and fail to build the skills they need to advance.
It’s a fair concern, but it’s probably too gloomy. “I don’t buy the doomsday scenarios at all,” says Amit Joshi, a professor who studies artificial intelligence at IMD business school in Lausanne, Switzerland. He says it’s more likely that AI will raise the benchmark for what an entry-level worker can achieve. Instead of taking a week to analyze and summarize 50 academic papers, a research assistant using ChatGPT might only need a day to synthesize the core points and check for errors.
Tsedal Neeley, a professor at Harvard Business School, agrees. “For young people, what you’re going to see is that they’re going to be able to perform better at their jobs. They’re going to be able to contribute more.” It’s not only that a PowerPoint that used to take four hours to build might now be completed in an hour. It’s that the young workers who struggled with basic writing and coding will now have a tool that helps them get to a higher minimum standard.
If entry-level workers get that much faster and better, won’t companies be able to get by with fewer of them? Maybe. Those are among the reasons that studies from Pew and Brookings flag entry-level workers as particularly at risk of losing employment to AI. Even McKinsey, which is more bullish on generative AI, points out that jobs in office support and sales are likely to see declines.
But eventually, new jobs — indeed, new industries — will be invented, says Neeley. In the long term, “technological revolutions like generative AI create more jobs than they disrupt,” even if the long term sometimes takes a while to arrive.
After all, when photocopying and faxing disappeared as entry-level tasks, entry-level jobs didn’t disappear. Arguably, they got more interesting. If I were a new grad in journalism today, I would probably be a social media manager — a job that didn’t exist when I graduated. And I might be better off: Writing social copy and making TikTok videos is undoubtedly more challenging and rewarding than fixing paper jams.
Similarly, the advent of computers put an end to the typing pool; women who had been consigned to such work began to take on more complex jobs.
That’s not to say that there’s no reason to be concerned. Manufacturing provides an obvious example of an industry where automation destroyed good blue-collar jobs. Some experts predict that generative AI could have a similar effect on computer-based jobs for workers without college degrees, like customer service.
It’s the fate of those workers that should be commanding more attention from pundits and policymakers.
Among the college-educated workforce, the advent of generative AI is less likely to erase jobs and more likely to prompt employees to learn new skills. For example, if a bot can churn out fluid-sounding text in minutes or even seconds, perhaps the human’s job shifts from writing to editing — checking the facts to make sure they’re correct, finding ways to improve the logic and persuasiveness of the piece, injecting verve and style. All of this requires critical thinking.
Generative AI still needs human oversight — and maybe always will, despite its ability to rapidly learn new skills. As Walmart executives put it in a LinkedIn post last week when the company announced the rollout of a generative AI app for its office employees, “GenAI can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: It lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on.”
For an example, consider my own early experiment testing ChatGPT. To see whether it could help me chase down a statistic for a column on child care, I asked it how many remote workers had kids at home without day care. It responded with a statistic and cited FlexJobs; when I asked for the URL, it provided one. When that produced only an error page, I contacted FlexJobs, and they said they couldn’t remember ever conducting such a survey. It seems ChatGPT just fabricated it. A hallucinating assistant is far worse than a slow one.
The college graduates of the future will still be able to find jobs, even if the hunt is grueling — and even if we can’t predict exactly what the work will look like. I just hope it’s more interesting than buying someone else’s pantyhose. (Bloomberg Opinion)

Key points

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the slow, labour-intensive, and costly process of counting tiny things within our science. 
We’re using AI to count hairs on cotton leaves and microscopic cells of harmful algae.  
AI can bring greater accuracy, speed and scale to tasks that are onerous for our scientists.    














        Identifying harmful algal cells in microscopic images is one way we're using artificial intelligence to transform the way we do science. 
      

There’s been a lot of talk about how AI will transform the way we work. 
Whether you see AI in the workforce as a friend or foe, there is no doubt this technology will change some jobs as we know them. This includes jobs in the world of science. Our researchers are exploring and responsibly embracing the use of AI in our work.

AI is a particularly useful tool to overcome pesky biological limitations. For example, the human eye can’t distinguish objects smaller than about 0.2mm. Traditionally, we use microscopes to overcome this. But once an object or substance is magnified, a highly-trained expert still needs to look at it to identify and count items of interest. Counting specimens or objects for science can be a slow, labour-intensive, and costly process.

Here are a couple of examples where we’ve leveraged the impressive advances in machine learning over the past decade to make AI count. These projects were advanced by our Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform, which unites collaborators from across the organisation to advance machine learning for scientific discovery.

Counting hairs on cotton leaves











        Dr Vivien Rolland and Moshiur Farazi inspect cotton in a glasshouse in Canberra. 
      

Working with our experts in agriculture, we’ve created a model that can quantify the number of hairs on the back of a cotton leaf.
Leaf hairiness impacts the insect resistance, fibre yield and value of new varieties of cotton.  Traditionally, it’s eyeballed by experts in commercial breeding programs and given a score between one and five. 
First we developed AI models which can generate the same hairiness scores as humans with 95 per cent accuracy.
Dr Moshiur Farazi is one of our experts in computer vision, focusing on enabling computers to identify and understand objects in images and video. He said HairNet2 is now moving beyond automating current methods.

""Training models to reproduce human ratings of hairiness can increase the speed and scale of analysis. However, these models reproduce the variability in the human estimates they've been trained on,"" Moshiur said.   
“In HairNet2 we’ve created a new method of AI-augmented scoring which is more robust, reliable and accurate. 
""This model estimates the area of the leaf that is covered by hairs by locating all hairs on the leaf, something that is not completely impossible for a human to do, but incredibly difficult and time consuming.

“HairNet2 was trained using about 1000 images where humans had annotated every single hair. This laborious annotation process helped build an AI tool that can automate the hairiness scoring beyond human perception,"" he said.  
The new models are being deployed on a web interface for breeders to test during the next cotton season. You can try an early demo yourself. 











        HairNet2 uses artificial intelligence to detect individual hairs on cotton leaves 
      

Counting microscopic algae cells
Harmful algal blooms are large populations of algae that can be toxic for both humans and animals.
To identify harmful algal blooms, experts undertake extensive testing using a microscope and a counting chamber (a slide with precise gridlines allowing scientists to estimate the number of harmful algal cells in a liquid sample).  
Dr Chris Jackett is an expert in object detection. He began working to augment this manual process with AI as a postdoctoral research fellow with our National Research Collections Australia.  
""It’s an enormously time-consuming and labour-intensive exercise, and humans are limited in the number of samples they can process,"" Chris said.  
""Extended sessions at the microscope can also lead to health issues like vision problems, bad posture, physical strain, and headaches.""  
In response to this challenge, we are training machine learning models to automatically detect harmful algae in images.  











        Harmful algal cells detected by machine learning 
      

Our team is systematically photographing and annotating algae strain samples from the Australian National Algae Culture Collection. We are also beginning to use a range of AI tools to help speed up the annotation process. 
With this combined human/computer effort, we have built up an annotated dataset for 15 different strains of algae to-date, which are now being used to train the AI models. Early testing suggests these models can successfully detect the target strains with a high level of accuracy.  
Using AI to provide faster and more accurate detection of toxic algae could have significant economic, environmental and social impacts.  
“Improving the speed and accuracy of harmful algae detection could provide an early warning signal for water managers indicating when and where blooms might occur,” Chris said.
AI-enhanced risk management and decision-making could help safeguard the health of the environment as well as coastal communities, consumers and Australian fisheries and aquaculture businesses. 
How you can make AI count for your business
Many organisations are currently grappling with the potential of AI to transform their processes and business.
If your core business involves counting or identifying objects, AI may be a friend.  
Moshiur said the barrier to entry for those looking to implement AI for object detection is low.  
“Five or 10 years back you needed to train the model on your own and needed a lot more data and compute power to experiment with AI,"" Moshiur said.  
“If you have a very small amount of data, you can fine-tune open-source models to work on your problem with as little as a couple of hundred images.”
However, he said the successful application of AI depends on asking the right questions.  
“At the end of the day, most users want a black box where they can click buttons and get the desired answer. But we need to unpack what they want the buttons to do and get the data ready in a way that enables those buttons to arrive at the right answer,"" Moshiur said.  
“Taking time to sit down and explore the questions you want answered, and consider the problems you haven’t been able to solve with human-driven methods or processes, is the best place to start.""

These days, there's no shortage of news about artificial intelligence. Some industries are dominated by praise and excitement for how AI can make life easier, while other professional sectors lament the loss of jobs and human touch. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, and the world of home design is no exception.
So, what does AI have to do with home design? And how might it shape the future of interiors? Experts offer insights on how AI is streamlining their workflows and expanding their creative potential.
Generative AI 101
Generative AI is the term for any artificial intelligence that can come up with new text or images in response to human prompts. You've likely heard of ChatGPT, a text-based generative AI. Type in a prompt such as, ""Write an email that explains biophilic design,"" and ChatGPT will spit out a message complete with a subject line, greeting, description of the design style and a signoff.
There are many uses for ChatGPT, but designers are more interested in images than text. Imagine coming up with a cool theme for a bedroom or a fun concept for a new type of sofa. If you can describe it in words, a generative AI tool like Midjourney or DALL-E can create an image. For interior designers, that's like having a talented robo-artist available at all times.
""With AI apps like Midjourney, you can just type in what you're thinking, and the machine does all the work for you,"" says Annilee B. Waterman, a Dallas-based artist(link is external), interior designer and certified professional building designer. ""It pulls in all the information that could have taken you hours to hunt down on the internet and quickly creates custom, unique images that you own and can use anywhere.""
The True Story of an AI-Designed Sink
""I was recently given the opportunity to collaborate with Midjourney's artificial intelligence bot to design the world's first AI sink, named AILA,"" explains Leslie Carothers of Savour Partnership(link is external), a digital marketing consultancy at the forefront of educating home and design professionals on how to use Midjourney AI.
Earlier this summer, luxury kitchen and bath product brand Thompson(link is external) emailed Carothers with an idea: If she could design a sink with AI, Thompson would create it in the real world. Thrilled with the idea, she got to work. Designing the sink and getting the green light for production by Thompson's copper artisans took less than two weeks. Now in production, the copper sink will eventually be unveiled in February 2024 at the National Kitchen and Bath Show in Las Vegas.
""I predict these types of collaborations will become the new normal once manufacturers see and understand how fast Midjourney makes the product ideation process,"" says Carothers. ""I also predict that any manufacturer who offers custom capabilities like Thompson does will have many more designers and retailers wanting to use Midjourney to create and then offer bespoke products to their clients and customers on their own websites.""
Looking to the Future
For many real estate professionals, AI still looks like a wild frontier—a creative sandbox more than a reliable trade tool. But AI is quickly going mainstream. Specifics are hard to predict, but it's almost inevitable that AI-assisted designs will become more prevalent in interiors and architecture in the next decade.
""I predict AI will be used by almost everyone as part of their home design conceptualization process,"" says Carothers.
Still, Waterman emphasizes that AI is a tool—it’s designed to be used by professionals, not replace them. She says AI is great for quickly showcasing ideas, but it can’t design in a vacuum. And while AI can generate a blueprint, Carothers reminds that it cannot build the product or room or home or cover practicalities like material durability or HVAC.
""AI cannot deliver on the most important factor for most consumers who want a well-designed home: the human connection to make sure that all the issues that come up in the execution process are resolved in as stress-free a manner as possible,"" says Carothers.
AI Tools for Real Estate Professionals
Artificial intelligence isn't going away anytime soon. Here are some tools that might help streamline your work as a real estate professional:

Epique AI. Designed specifically for real estate businesses, Epique AI(link is external) can help you quickly generate new realtor biographies for your website, real estate newsletter copy, inspirational quotes for your Instagram page, and more.
Virtual Staging AI. Attractive staging for listings is easier than ever with Virtual Staging AI(link is external), which automatically adds furniture and decor to your uploaded photos of empty rooms.
RealityNinja AI Listing Description Generator. Accelerate the process of writing listing descriptions with RealityNinja's AI(link is external), which creates multiple description options after you input a property's basic information (such as square footage, location, and key features).

In an age where technology advances at an unprecedented pace, the proliferation of AI has raised concerns about its potential to disrupt various industries, and prompted individuals to reconsider the future of their careers.
The focus has shifted from whether AI will replace human jobs, to understanding how and when this transformation will occur.
This debate draws parallels with historical industrial revolutions, but while 18th-century automation transformed farming and textiles, the rise of AI has the potential to reshape multiple industries.
An 11-year research project undertaken by PwC found a significant portion of jobs would be affected by automation by 2030.
In its report, Workforce of the Future: Shaping 2030, PwC claims the overall percentage of affected jobs would be 38 percent for the US, 35 percent for Germany, 30 percent for the UK and 21 percent for Japan.
However, the report does not only foretell gloom. It outlines a roadmap that empowers  individuals to reposition themselves in the 2030 employment landscape, and offers guidance to future-proof their careers.
Central to this roadmap are the “four worlds of work”.
The Red World: A realm characterised by rapid innovation and consumer-driven demand. Adaptability and updated skills are essential.
The Blue World: Corporations dominate, while social responsibility takes a back seat. Corporate careers thrive, and professional enhancements become common.
The Green World: Corporations uphold environmental and social accountability, with automation aligned to a greener agenda.
The Yellow World: Small, ethical businesses flourish, valuing artisanal products. Automation complements human efforts, and collective action protects jobs.
The likelihood of any one world emerging is uncertain, but in all four, adaptation and continuous learning emerge as strategies for employment.
Beyond embracing technology, cultivating new skills such as leadership, creativity, innovation, imagination and problem-solving becomes vital. These attributes are poised to be in high demand, transforming how we define ourselves by our skills rather than our job titles.
We can also recognise that AI’s impact on jobs is not purely destructive. It has the potential to refine, enhance and transform job roles, augmenting human capabilities and reshaping the very nature of work.
For those embarking on their career journeys, two potential avenues emerge: sticking to a discipline that’s highly specialised and therefore likely to be in high demand, or remaining in a current career while cultivating adaptability and creativity.
For both avenues, education and upskilling will be key to success, with institutions like Curtin University already preparing individuals for the shifting tides of change through their MBA programs.
Curtin’s MBA delves into executive financial decision-making, global business sustainability, and organisational strategy, equipping individuals with the skills and flexibility to pivot careers, transition from technical roles to leadership positions, or explore entirely new sectors.
Individuals on these courses are preparing to graduate in a new era, where the future of work embraces new technologies, and teaming up with AI will be just a regular part of the journey.

You can’t open your internet browser without seeing its impact.Generative AI — also known colloquially by product names like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot — has been on the minds of almost every leader in many verticals. I’ve heard CIOs and CTOs say, “we’re testing ChatGPT” or “we’re exploring how to approach generative AI.”Generative AI continues to capture interest at the highest levels of leadership, with 96% of executives saying that it is a key topic in boardroom discussions, according to an article from Business Chief. And, in a recent survey by CNBC, 47% of technology leaders said artificial intelligence is their top budget item over the next year.Don’t be fooled. While there may be interest, and there may be (big) spend, adoption of the technology — actual deployment of it — is still in the very early stages. That’s especially true in financial services where actions don’t necessarily match the talk.At Ally, we’re taking a deliberate, but proactive approach to capabilities around generative AI. In July, we formally launched Ally.ai — a proprietary, cloud-based platform that brings the speed and large language model (LLM) functionality of commercial AI tools together with the human touch and data security protections that are required for a financial services company. We’ve deployed other AI tools including natural language processing, machine learning, predictive analytics and computer vision. Now, we have a secure platform, built by the talented Ally Tech team, that can house all of this, and integrate any commercially available LLM.The consensus is that generative AI has staying power. As a trusted, forward-thinking digital bank, we’re known for being on the front foot of tech exploration. But that doesn’t mean we cut corners. We want to do it right with AI, which means embedding AI seamlessly into our business and the way we work — in a responsible, collaborative and scalable manner. Our team has started with two pilot programs, one for SEO marketing and one for Customer Care and Experience, that will help us dive deep and understand how generative AI fits within our current technology landscape, security frameworks and how it might positively impact business processes.Security and customer data privacy is in the forefront of everything we do as a digital-first organization. The entire Ally.ai platform is built on our dedicated cloud infrastructure with its own private network. Ally’s data stays private, meaning we have created a fully secured Ally environment with no external access. Steps have been taken so that Ally data is not used by others to train these foundation models. We’ve also created an AI playbook that details our use of generative AI — and creates a common platform and understanding for the entire enterprise to operate on.In addition, we have an enterprise-wide cross functional AI Working Group at Ally who work with our AI experts to review and advise on generative AI use cases. Humans are actively trained and involved in the evaluation and use of generative AI technology. Any time we launch a pilot program or explore the use of generative AI, training and oversight mechanisms will be fully defined ahead of time. While having humans trained and involved in all aspects of generative AI work is a risk mitigation standard, there’s also another benefit. The more human feedback that Ally can accumulate, and the more we can optimize our AI models, the better AI offerings we can develop that will ultimately benefit our customers and employees.This evolution and active usage of generative AI also maps closely with our long-term technology strategy where the experience of our customers — not our individual products — takes center stage. Generative AI has the potential to serve our customers even better by helping us understand their financial journeys more holistically, enabling a more personalized banking experience. And that’s really the point. How can generative AI make our customers’ financial experience stronger? How can it make the work that our employees do more efficient or easier?For several weeks in June and July, more than 700 customer service associates who work with deposit customers have participated in a call summarization pilot program where the Ally.ai platform and LLM facilitates real-time summaries of customer interactions held over the phone. Feedback from our associates has been very positive around accuracy and convenience. We’re seeing that for about 82% of summaries coming back from Ally.ai, Ally associates report that they don’t require any human modification. They also report that the tool is a welcome backstop so they can focus most of their energy on meaningful customer interactions. They’ve seen increases in productivity and a lighter lift when it comes to multi-tasking — taking notes, toggling between screens, concentrating on live conversation — while taking customer calls. It’s our hope that we can shave minutes off the time it takes for an associate to document and close an interaction with a customer, which makes a better experience for all involved.While I’ve given you just one example of the work actively happening at Ally with generative AI, the opportunities are vast. Our Auto team is looking at how the technology may be able to give real-time vehicle inventory updates via the Smart Auction platform. The Security team is exploring how AI could help our teams fighting fraud and money laundering. This is a quickly evolving technology, and if you’re standing still or just figuring out where to start, you might already be behind.More than three years ago, Ally started building an infrastructure — centralized data and analytics, advanced public/private cloud, hardened security tools and processes — that could support emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, and much more. We developed in-house capabilities — a deep bench of engineers that have the expertise to build a platform like Ally.ai, combined with our best-in-class security standards — to maintain and lock down the technology. I’m proud to say that the Ally team saw around corners to what AI could do for our business, and then strategically took action to meet the moment.Generative AI has the potential to be a game-changer in financial services, especially at a pace that requires organizations to be nimble while maintaining high standards. While we continue to be prudent and cautious, we’re not standing still. Actions will speak louder than words when it comes to AI adoption and usage in banking. We’re going to continue to make moves and do it right with AI.Interested in joining Ally's team of talented technologists to make a difference for our customers and communities?

Does Generative AI Generate Jobs?

By Jacques Bughin
The evolution of AI and its quick adoption by organisations has predisposed many workers to the fear of losing their jobs to the technology. This fear might be largely unfounded.
Are you afraid of losing your job to generative AI? The debate rages since digital citizens are rushing to use generative AI software like MidJourney or ChatGPT. Yuval Noah Harari,1 famous historian and author of popular books Sapiens and Homo Deus, recently voiced his concern that while generative AI is a game changer, the technology can develop its own content and ideas, build its own social culture, and replace an entire part of our abstract production. The media has jumped on it and CNBC recently ran a catchy headline claiming that “Thirty-seven percent of workers between the ages of 18 and 24 are worried about new technology eliminating their jobs”.2 The BBC also had its own contribution with the headline “AI anxiety: The workers who fear losing their jobs to artificial intelligence”.3

Anxiety might be present, but the disturbing truth is that media is building the anxiety, rather than developing a sound perspective on the relationship between jobs and AI.
Looking backward
Looking back on how major tech innovations played out, fear around how technology can deconstruct work/knowledge has always been present. In the Middle Ages, as reported by Le Point,4 a Benedictine monk, Johannes Trithemius, defended the work of copying texts by his peers, because the slowness of the work was synonymous with a process of contemplation and profound discovery of the contents. He opined that the printing of books was not only toxic but would trivialise and weaken learning and culture. Even much later, renowned economists, from John Stuart Mill to David Ricardo, were suspicious of the idea that technology may build jobs. John Maynard Keynes5 further coined, in 1931, the term “technological unemployment” in his essay named Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, in which he predicted that due to technology diffusion, the “most pressing problem in the developed economies would be how to fill our leisure time.”

Well, we still have jobs today despite Keynes´s prediction—and the academic literature has proven with a large set of studies6 that new jobs could be created in the wake of multiple technological developments.
Looking forward

The key question is whether this time can be different.7 Technologies are becoming, no doubt, more powerful, and their economic scope getting larger by the day. But three important facts are usually not taken into account by techno-pessimists.
1. Technology is as much about augmentation than a substitute to jobs.
Let´s provide a few examples regarding generative AI. Consider first how Reuters and Associated Press have experimented with AI-generated news articles for tasks like financial reporting and sports recaps. Artists and designers also can leverage generative AI tools to enhance their creative process. For instance, Adobe’s Project Scribbler uses AI to transform rough sketches into polished artwork, providing inspiration and saving time. A few years back, musician and composer Holly Herndon8 released a music album, relying on an AI system trained on Herndon’s own voice and musical style. For the musician, AI complemented her exploration of new musical possibilities and pushed the boundaries of traditional composition for her own benefits instead of separating the tasks between production and performance.
The rise of social media platforms has led to the need for professionals who can manage and enhance a company’s online presence, engage with customers, and create targeted social media strategies. 
Another example where generative AI has built new inroads is coding. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed to generate code suggestions and snippets based on the context and programming language being used. While this has replaced some tasks of coders, programmers are using their freed up time to do more added-value tasks; productivity follows and more jobs, no less, are being driven to complex software tasks. Finally, AI works on data, and the critical issue for many companies is not about data processing but data generation. What generative AI is good at is building synthetic data.9 Those synthetic data modelled on real data may help provide enough data for more powerful analysis, justifying the jobs of data analysts — (while providing a layer of privacy as real user data is not being utilised to power models).
2. Technology is less often used for efficiency than for higher quality and stronger innovation — and great innovation expands output and employment.
Quality is often the result of technology, and in the long term, builds wealth. Grammarly’s users, a popular AI writing assistant tool have reported a 76% increase in writing accuracy. Google Translate has improved translation quality by 60%, making it more accessible for users globally. Among marketers using generative AI, half of them report that the most important benefit is a faster creative output cycle and better creative design.

Innovation is another by-product of AI. A case in point is BioNTech, a biotechnology company that used Generative AI and machine learning techniques during the drug discovery process and developed a COVID-19 vaccine in no time. With these innovations, BioNTech expanded its workforce not by 20%, not even by 100%. In fact, its employment went 4-fold in just three years. Adobe a leading software company has integrated generative AI capabilities into its software products, such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, expanding customer support and training teams to assist users in leveraging these new capabilities effectively. Employment grew especially in areas of trainers and documentation specialists who focus on supporting and educating customers on using generative AI features.
3. Technology and employment are not only to be checked at the firm level but at the entire ecosystem.
The type of catchy media titles we see today about AI and jobs tend to be more about AI and one’s current job. But those articles miss the full macroeconomic effect. A new range of jobs will be created by virtue of technologies and other jobs will be created in the entire ecosystems, not the least as part of the gain in productivity out of technology being reinvested in the economy.

Regarding new jobs, let’s first look at digital. The rise of social media platforms has led to the need for professionals who can manage and enhance a company’s online presence, engage with customers, and create targeted social media strategies. The proliferation of mobile applications has created a demand for skilled app developers who can design, develop, and maintain mobile applications for various platforms. As generative AI becomes more prevalent, AI ethicists will explode as being responsible for examining the ethical implications and societal impact of AI systems.
We still have jobs today despite Keynes´s prediction—and the academic literature has proven with a large set of studies6 that new jobs were created in the wake of multiple technological developments in the recent past. 

One other much bigger impact is the fact that technology use often overspills to the entire ecosystem or the economy. In their academic research, Arntz and her colleagues studied the venue of robotics in the German automotive industry. While it killed a few jobs at the start through automation, it made the industry able to compete with the Japanese car exporters, resulting in saving and expanding the automotive industry. The effect was a positive net employment growth out of rapid robotisation. One notable corporate example of such an overspill in ecosystems is how NVIDIA’s GANs have significantly improved the visual quality and realism of computer-generated graphics in video games, creating job opportunities for artists, designers, developers, and animators specialising in creating immersive content. NVIDIA’s GANs have been used to enhance medical imaging and generate synthetic medical data for training and research purposes. The integration of generative AI in healthcare is already increasing the demand for medical imaging specialists, researchers, and professionals with expertise in AI-assisted diagnostics and medical data analysis.


One should think twice as to whether technology kills jobs- it may kill some, but technology has shown ways to build new ones or push new labour demand as a result of major productivity gains reinvested in the economy. Technology brings about creative destruction that is possibly inevitable, but by itself, it does not necessarily paint a picture of a workless future. Maybe, it is time to use generative AI for the good and stop worrying about it.
