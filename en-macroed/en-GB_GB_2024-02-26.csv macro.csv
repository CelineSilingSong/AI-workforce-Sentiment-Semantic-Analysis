Johnson: “The cybernation revolution” will create “a separate nation of the poor, the unskilled, the jobless” who will be unable to find work and to afford life’s necessities, they argued. Three decades earlier, in the 1930s, according to The Atlantic, a California mayor wrote to the US President that industrial technology was a “Frankenstein monster” that threatened to upend manufacturing, “devouring our civilization”.These doom and gloom predictions of how new technology would lead to a worse world proved to be utterly wrong, of course – just as many similar, earlier predictions about the effects of new technology had been. But the most recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, presented a déjà vu moment: An IMF report concluded that 40% of jobs around the world will be affected by AI. In advanced economies, that rises to 60% of jobs set to be affected by machine learning, with about half being negatively impacted. The losers will face lower salaries and reduced hiring, and some jobs will disappear altogether.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesOver the last 200 years, predictions of fewer jobs in the future have generally proven to be false. The pessimists have been wrong repeatedly. But make no mistake – hundreds of millions of jobs have been destroyed. First, agricultural technology replaced millions of farming jobs, while the industrial revolution moved people into factories. Then automation moved them back out of the factories, giving rise to an economy of services. Throughout these waves of creative destruction, however, the total number of people employed has risen. Today there are a record number in employment across the globe and in almost every country.Number of people employed worldwide (billions), 1991-2023 Image: International Labour OrganizationBut it will be different this time because AI is different. Technology will not always support people in doing their jobs, it will primarily replace jobs. New types of jobs will emerge, however.Trying to imagine the new world of workIf you were a farm worker 120 years ago – like roughly three quarters of all people at the time – would it have been possible for you to imagine a world where only one in 20 people worked on farms? Could you have anticipated the range of new jobs available to workers today? Even 20 years ago, economists probably wouldn’t have predicted that there would be 800,000 personal trainers employed in the US today and 2.5 million jobs in the app development industry.It’s possible that we are experiencing the same difficulty today in trying to imagine the new, unknown jobs of the future. We can’t see into the future, but we can shift our perspective on the possible creation of new jobs by asking broader questions.First, are all of our needs satisfied today? For instance, would we like higher quality food? Would we like better services from businesses or government agencies? Would we like more efficiently or more beautifully designed products? Do we want better health – physical and mental? New roles could be created to address these needs and wants.Second, will new needs arrive as our society evolves – as we work through solutions to our current global challenges and as new innovations arrive? A future equivalent to today’s smartphone could create entirely new sectors of employment. It’s possible that we are not able to imagine this today, but if the patterns of the last 200 years continue, these jobs will arrive.Third, will an increase in demand for products and services lead to new jobs? New technology will eliminate some jobs, yes. But in many cases, it will support a worker in doing a better, more efficient job, lowering the cost of production. When products and services become more affordable, demand generally increases.Last, and perhaps most relevant: How can policy makers and government agencies best facilitate the dynamic creation and rotation of the labour market towards new jobs? This will be particularly important if, as is likely, creative destruction and job changes continue, possibly at a higher rate than ever.Investing in new technology and jobsSmall and mid-sized businesses create a disproportionate amount of new jobs around the world. So, freedom for entrepreneurs and investors to create and grow businesses will be more critical than ever as new technology becomes more available. A more flexible and free labour market should allow more rapid moves between sectors and businesses as the nature of jobs change. This means that nations that are less attractive to entrepreneurs and investors because of lower economic freedom and heavily regulated labour markets may suffer from more unemployment. Alternatively, nations with open and free markets will keep creating new jobs to replace the lost ones.Creative destruction stemming from tech development may lead to hard times and new challenges for many people, as well as for whole cities and regions. Governments can play an important role in alleviating this by providing opportunities or support programmes for reskilling, as well as unemployment benefits and other forms of transitional safety nets. During the industrial revolution, local and national governments made major public investments to teach the skills of reading, writing and math that were necessary for the new jobs at that time. There was also investment in new roads, ports and other infrastructure. In this new era, we need public investment in digital skills for everyone, as well as digital highways that allow regions to participate in new economic opportunities.As we all try to imagine the new, unknown jobs of the future, we must ask the right questions about new technology and how it will affect our work and our industries. By shifting our perspective on how new jobs can arise from new technology, we can ensure AI brings about change that works for everyone.Have you read?Climate action and AI can create more and better jobs.

The choice is oursThu 29 Feb 2024 06.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Feb 2024 16.33 ESTShare130130As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America’s economy, there’s a lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people fail to realize is that AI has already changed millions of workers’ jobs – often for the worse.At Amazon, some warehouse and delivery drivers complain that AI-driven bots have fired them without any human intervention whatsoever. At some companies, surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom, with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict.Many corporations gather information about their employees through webcams, keyboards, internet activity and phone logs, and that can include private information about workers’ political opinions, sexual orientation, union activity and even their emotions and mental state. Inside many call centers, AI tools monitor the calls that agents make, and based on factors like the agent’s or customer’s tone of voice, those tools often send messages to an agent’s computer, directing them to talk with more empathy or energy.And then there are the forecasts that AI will wipe out millions of jobs. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2030, tasks that account for up to 30% of the hours now worked across the US could be automated, and that AI will push 12 million American workers out of their jobs. Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will disrupt 300m jobs worldwide by 2030.Workers worry that AI will mean more stress, surveillance, and layoffs. It doesn’t have to be that wayC-suite executives can’t wait to deploy more AI in their offices, warehouses and factories, but many workers, white-collar and blue-collar alike, worry that AI will mean only bad news for them: more stress, surveillance, and speed-ups, and more layoffs, too. It doesn’t have to be that way.In Germany and several other European countries, workers often have a voice in how their employers roll out and use artificial intelligence. German law requires that companies notify their works councils (worker-management committees that exist in most German workplaces) in advance about any plans to introduce AI. Those councils often then discuss how to use AI, typically with an eye to having it complement workers and make them more productive, instead of replacing them.Virginia Doellgast, a Cornell University expert on AI and work, told me that the German model, with its works councils and strong unions, leads to less employee resistance to AI, smoother rollouts of AI-related technologies, and increased productivity that benefits companies and workers alike.But in the United States, a country where workplace decisions are typically top-down with employees having little or no input, workers often feel like victims and guinea pigs when it comes to AI. Indeed, many workers don’t even know when their employers are using AI to surveil them or speed up their jobs.Labor leaders wish that US workers could have a strong voice in how AI is introduced and implemented, but that’s wishful thinking in a nation where just 6% of workers in private industry are in labor unions. At unionized workplaces, but not non-union ones, employees have a right not only to negotiate about AI when it substantially affects working conditions, but also to push for protections against some of AI’s worst effects. Hollywood’s writers’ and actors’ unions won important protections on AI in the negotiations that settled their lengthy strikes last year.One labor leader told me that unions certainly recognize that new technologies can increase productivity and overall prosperity. But he added that AI-related technologies often “speed up the work, deskill the work, make workplaces more stressful and make jobs more demanding”.At some companies, AI-powered tools keep tabs on whether employees meet their production quotas, and those tools sometimes automatically increase the quotas of employees who regularly meet them. With employers increasingly using AI to screen résumés, AI has faced complaints about discriminating against older applicants, women, people of color and workers with disabilities. At many call centers, AI-powered apps review the transcripts of agents’ conversations with customers and sometimes give warnings or demerits to agents for straying too far from the assigned script.Some economists warn that if corporations can roll out AI with little input from workers, then AI will increase production and profits for corporations, with few or any gains for workers – all while increasing the nation’s overall income inequality. Workers will suffer from speed-ups, stress and layoffs, and society at large may have to finance tens of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance, health coverage and perhaps food and rent assistance for many who lose their jobs to AI.To minimize AI’s negative effects on America’s 160 million workers, there are many things government, labor and business should do. Government should require companies to notify their workers when they’re using AI tools to monitor them.Recognizing that workers aren’t in a position to assess the downsides of AI, Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO union federation, has called for having a government agency vet AI technologies to determine whether they’re harmful to workers – just as the FDA vets drugs to make “sure drugs don’t kill people before they’re put out into the world”.‘Disinformation on steroids’: is the US prepared for AI’s influence on the election?Read moreWith AI threatening to cause large-scale layoffs, the government should create incentives for employers to embrace four-day, even three-day workweeks to spread the work around and minimize layoffs. For example, if AI makes a 1,000-employee company consider laying off 200 people, that company could avoid layoffs by shifting its 1,000 employees to four-day workweeks.Labor unions need to snap to attention on AI and educate workers, both union and non-union, about AI’s harms and benefits – it can mean more invasiveness, but also increase productivity and hopefully workers’ wages, too. Unions should also educate workers about how to press their employers to reduce AI’s harms and to share the fruits of AI so that workers, and not just shareholders, benefit from the increased productivity and profits it produces. (The AFL-CIO’s Technology Institute is already doing some of this educating.)Unions should press companies to use AI in ways that complement rather than displace workers, and that means pushing for enhanced training to help employees work with AI. Unions should of course keep up their efforts to unionize tech workers.As for business, Michael Richards, policy director at the US Chamber of Commerce’s technology engagement center, said that “while there are clear benefits” to AI, “there are legitimate concerns” surrounding the technology. Richards said companies “recognize that engaging in an inclusive dialogue about using new technologies is critical”. Such a dialogue could reduce workers’ distrust of AI and encourage employee input, for instance, about ways to tweak AI tools to have them work more efficiently alongside workers.There’s little doubt that AI will bring big changes, good and bad, to America’s workplaces. To reduce AI’s harmful effects, President Biden should create a panel of government, union and business officials, much like the tripartite boards that President Franklin Roosevelt created to maximize arms production during the second world war. This new panel should make recommendations about how best to use AI in America’s workplaces, all with the goal of maximizing AI’s benefits for the nation and sharing the gains from AI while minimizing the pain for workers.

Dive Brief:

When it comes to job security, 87% of marketers are worried about technology replacing their jobs, per a recent report from Gartner based on several recent surveys of marketers. 
Those concerns aren’t unfounded, as 26% of marketing leaders said they plan to reduce personnel due to generative AI in 2024. The findings also point to a martech burden: 61% of respondents said they have encountered technology or process changes in the past 12 months.
However, generative AI use can lead to lower rates of burnout. Those who engage with the technology at high rates are 30% less likely to indicate high rates of burnout and are 40% less likely to leave their job in the next year, per Gartner. 





















Dive Insight:
Gartner’s research underscores some of the challenges and opportunities CMOs face across their marketing organizations as the role of technology broadly continues to expand and as generative AI, more specifically, remains a big focus.
One takeaway is that while technology holds a great deal of usefulness for marketers, gaining the necessary skills remains a challenge: 63% of martech leaders reporting marketing cannot fully integrate or operate technologies in their stack while two thirds of marketers said that learning takes time away from day-to-day responsibilities.
In terms of morale, the report found that 55% of marketers report mismatched job expectations. This is further compounded by environmental factors such as new technology and uncertainty in leadership, with 20% of respondents experiencing a recent change in senior marketing leadership. 
“These findings should be a red flag for CMOs, as high environmental uncertainty, mismatched role expectations and martech burden can lead to burnout as well as increased attrition,” said Iliyana Hadjistoyanova, director, advisory in the Gartner Marketing Practice, in a statement. “CMOs must refocus their talent strategy and prioritize development with a strong focus on upskilling and change management to ensure their function is prepared in the face of ongoing disruption.”
While the use of generative AI has increased in the past year, many consumers remain skeptical. The technology has been linked to increases in misinformation, among other concerns. Additionally, one-fifth of brands say they aim to remain generative AI-free as a point of differentiation.
The report, AI Opportunity Amid Talent Turmoil: 2023 Marketing Talent Survey, is based on surveys of 405 martech leaders between May and June of 2023 and 627 marketers between August and September of 2023. Between September and November of 2023, 822 business executives were surveyed.

Gen AI is game-changing technology, directly impacting the way legal work is done and the current law firm-client business model; and while much remains unsettled, within 10 years, Gen AI is likely to change corporate legal departments and law firms in profound and unique ways

Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) isn’t a futuristic technology — it’s here now, and it’s already impacting the legal industry in many ways.
Already, both corporate legal departments and law firms of all sizes have begun experimenting with Gen AI technology, both with public-facing tools such as ChatGPT, as well as more business-friendly tools such as Microsoft’s Copilot and legal industry-specific technologies. This experimentation has begun to give way to more discrete planning, as well as specific policies and procedures governing the use of Gen AI in the legal workplace.
This shouldn’t be a surprise. After all, just about everybody in legal knows that some sort of dramatic sea change is coming. Indeed, 70% of legal professionals said they believe AI and Gen AI will have a transformational or high impact on the legal profession within the next five years — more than any other trend, including the economy, regulation, and activities around environmental, social & governance (ESG) issues, according to the Thomson Reuters Future of Professionals Report, which also showed that Gen AI brings hope of a new efficient future but also fear of job replacement.
Both that hope and fear may be well-founded, as both the scope and pace of change may be greater than some in the legal industry anticipate. While some law firms are approaching Gen AI as an optional, nice-to-have technology, our research has found that change is likely to take place imminently. And within the next 10 years, the legal industry should expect wide-scale business model changes, as well as some disintermediation of lawyers in situations in which consumers eschew legal professionals altogether in favor of a technological option.
The most successful corporate legal departments and law firms won’t be the ones merely experimenting with Gen AI — they will be the ones preparing now for a legal industry future that will look a lot different in 2034 than it does today. That’s why we are embarking on a new blog series discussing Gen AI usage in the legal industry to help explore that future, laying out the scenarios we anticipate for the legal industry in both the immediate and mid-term future.
Our predictions for AI in the legal industry
To understand how the industry could be impacted by AI in the near and longer term, we garnered the views of Thomson Reuters’s technology and legal market experts, including members of TR Labs, who are at the cutting edge of legal AI research and development. We also interviewed a range of experts across industry and academia. Based on these discussions and other research recently conducted by Thomson Reuters, such as our Future of Professionals Survey, we have been able to make early predictions for how the legal market will evolve over the next decade.

Already, Gen AI has begun to make in-roads among law firms, corporate legal departments, and other legal service providers and technology companies. That impact will likely occur in three overlapping waves; however, the effect will not be linear. Some firms of course will move faster than others, while even within each firm progress could be diverse, with some practice areas with work that’s more susceptible to automation — such as real estate — radically transforming with AI faster than other practice areas, such as litigation.
This first wave we are already beginning to see now, with widespread AI adoption and experimentation occurring in corporate legal departments and law firms of all sizes. Over the next one-to-three years, the legal industry will increasingly gain access to trusted Gen AI tools from both large technology companies and legal technology providers, letting legal departments and law firms move from pure experimentation to putting AI plans into action. Especially at the beginning, this work will be focused on back-office functions and support staff. Law firms and their clients will begin considering how they can optimize their labor costs, reducing numbers of new associate hires and non-fee-earning staff.
The focus on non-billable work will not last for long, however, particularly as Gen AI technology advances to perform more complex tasks. Looking three-to-five years out, we begin to see changes to the legal business model emerge. AI will allow legal work to be done more efficiently, and corporate legal departments will put increasing pressure on law firms and outside providers to deliver work faster. As less time is spent on legal tasks, the billable hour will no longer be the most cost-effective way to capture value, prompting firms to reimagine their billing models to better share in efficiency savings and capture the value that’s added through advanced technology.


Already, Gen AI has begun to make in-roads among law firms, corporate legal departments, and other legal service providers and technology companies.


In response, large law firms will seek to capture more revenue by deploying staff, including juniors, to higher value work. They may also use their new law or internal innovations teams to standardize repeatable work that might otherwise be unprofitable. Meanwhile, small- and midsize law firms will be able to use Gen AI to grow their practice without needing to hire more staff. Regardless of size, however, the point is that change is a must: The law firms that don’t adapt will not be able to keep up with the efficiencies gained by their peers.
Finally, extending the time horizon out five-to-ten years leads to greater automation of legal services — and, in some cases, partial or full disintermediation of the legal professional through AI. With Gen AI technology capable of tackling even more complex tasks, AI will be a primary driver of day-to-day legal tasks, with legal practitioners acting as supervisors and strategists. The result is a complete overhaul of not only how legal services are completed and billed, but also the mix of players in the legal arena that are most needed.
Tech-enabled services will allow some legal clients in both the public and corporate spheres to sometimes bypass law firms entirely, relying on technology to serve their legal needs. This means do-it-yourself (DIY) legal solutions for consumers and small legal business are poised to proliferate, increasing access to justice in an underserved market. For law firms to survive, they will need to learn how to blend AI with human expertise and relationships, perfecting their service delivery to compete with a clientele that is familiar with and fully expectant of AI-enabled expertise.
Gen AI’s rollout looks different based on organizational type
However, as noted above, not all parties in the legal industry will fully embrace Gen AI’s introduction, nor will the technology’s advancement affect everyone equally. Gen AI will impact differently sized corporate legal departments and law firms unevenly.
At the forefront of the market, corporate legal departments will purchase and access Gen AI in a way that could transform their structure and day-to-day work product. Gen AI usage will likely be enterprise-wide at many companies, with the legal function receiving the benefits of economies of scale and outside technology investment. As corporate legal departments continue to experience cost pressures, however, we anticipate a changing of internal roles within those departments, with fewer paralegal and junior roles as the tasks those roles usually handle become the first to get automated.
Corporate legal departments are also increasingly likely to expect lower costs from their outside providers in turn, particularly for low-stakes work — which in some cases means replacing current panel firms with lower-cost alternatives, including alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) or technology firms, meaning that these entities must embrace AI or risk losing out on work. And across the board, this client emphasis on costs could lead to a rise in alternative fee arrangements and a further diminishing of the billable hour.
This shift towards cost-cutting and a change of roles is likely to be mirrored across law firms of all sizes. Large law firms generally have greater technological capability and access to larger datasets, and many also have already established new law or internal innovation teams. Niche data could become a key law firm differentiator in the age of AI. Larger firms also may leverage their economies of scale to enable Gen AI-powered technology products that capture work that would not have been profitable without automation.


This shift towards cost-cutting and a change of roles is likely to be mirrored across law firms of all sizes.


Among midsize law firms, the same technology could be used to capture bigger-ticket work. By using AI to automate repeatable, labor-intensive tasks, midsize law firms should be able to take on more clients, including more complex clients, or perhaps cover more practice areas through an expanded scope. In this way, midsize law firms can bill themselves as low-cost alternatives for plain vanilla transactions or disputes.
At small law firms, Gen AI will be similarly used to automate some processes in order to win new business. This could impact small firms’ headcount — particularly the hiring of new paralegals and junior associates — as small law firms lawyers leverage Gen AI to automate processes that previously fell to these new hires. With time and cost saved, this would allow some smaller firms to take on more cases or even expand their practice into new areas, enabling these firms to grow their book of business without hiring additional staff. This could also help alleviate the access to justice problem that many consumers currently face.
All in all, there remains a lot of speculation around when and how Gen AI will influence the legal profession. Between the technology’s development, the industry’s reaction, and outside economic forces, there are a lot of different paths in legal that Gen AI could take.
Regardless of the exact path, it would be smart for law firms, corporate legal departments, ALSPs, and other legal industry players to begin plans for a potential future now, because it’s reasonable to believe that a Gen AI-impacted future will lead to profound change in the way people work.


In coming weeks, this series from the Thomson Reuters strategy team and the Thomson Reuters Institute will take a closer look at some of the individual practice and subject-area facets of those changes and what those professionals in the legal sphere should expect.

There is much fear that artificial intelligence will steal human jobs. Many human capabilities are being delegated to machines and abilities such as memory, attention, accuracy and manual precision could be undermined. But humans have a unique type of intelligence that AI can’t match. Chiara Succi describes three levels of (irreplaceable) human contribution to the workplace: intelligent hand, intelligent mind and intelligent heart. 

The heated debate about artificial intelligence (AI) and its “extraordinary potential” is surprisingly leading to a rediscovery of humans’ contribution to work. If robots can bring speed, precision, and strength, we still need fantasy, intuition and affection. It is important to debunk the belief that machines will steal the jobs of human beings, unless they are asked to repeat only one single task. In fact, we will not see the elimination of our occupations, but artificial intelligence applications will certainly impact and modify them deeply.
Weakening human capabilities
Automation will change workers’ behaviours and the risk is that some abilities could be undermined, such as memory, attention, accuracy, manual precision, and many others. How can we leverage new technologies without diminishing our competencies? Which human assets are in danger and in need of protection?
It is not easy to describe the magnificence of human intelligence (HI) and the literature has not yet presented an exhaustive taxonomy of relevant human capabilities in the digital age. As a starting point, I propose a description structured over three levels:
The intelligent hand
Some manual skills cannot be replaced by machines while keeping the same versatility and level of quality. In every organisation, we can identify some activities that require a particular know-how and a great amount of knowledge that is transferred over time, through on-the-job training. Several lines of manual work require the ability to solve complex changing problems that are always slightly different because the raw material, temperature or context is different. It would make no sense to program a robot to solve a problem that occurs differently almost every time.
The world of luxury, in particular, strives for authenticity and values artisanal processes, which make some handmade goods unique. Contemporary research finds that products, services and organisations perceived as authentic carry value that consumers are willing to pay for.
As a side effect, if we push to replace manual work with AI, we might miss some parts of the work experience such as technical mastery, dedication to the job, experimentation, apprenticeship, concentration, and caring about excellence, with possible implications and impacts difficult to assess for the workplace.
The intelligent mind
Matthew Crawford warns us of the risk of “learned helplessness” as an effect of automation and digitalisation. People display a lower level of individual agency and a higher level of dissatisfaction. Office jobs often don’t allow us to experience the direct effects of our actions and to see tangible results.
In fact, we have a greater amount of data at our disposal, but an inferior capacity to read them, and probably at a lower speed in comparison with an algorithm. It appears natural to delegate complex tasks and difficult decisions to machines, the danger being that we will lose critical thinking. This might weaken our exercise of judgment and we may face issues more superficially and impulsively, without going in-depth and without analysing root causes.
This might represent a problem, considering that cognitive skills such as problem-solving, creativity, innovativeness, and learning to learn are becoming increasingly important in the workplace. Decisions are taken by managers largely based on their intuition and not based on a mere analysis of data.
AI doesn’t have the sensitivity to manage unexpected events or crises. A self-driving car cannot enter a complex roundabout, as it cannot identify a zero-risk condition. Human drivers, instead, find the courage to travel adapting to the flow and moderating their speed to avoid accidents, as a robot will (probably) never be able to do.
We must acquire higher awareness of the potentiality of our mind and its ability to find mental shortcuts, the so-called heuristics, which allow us to source daily experience to survive and overcome obstacles.
The intelligent heart
Communication among human beings is becoming more complex and more frequent; it can be supported, facilitated, “augmented” by technologies, but never fully substituted by a remote system. Mysteriously, the hormone oxytocin, which is essential for the development of trust and emotional engagement, is produced only when we interact in presence.
Emotional intelligence and even a sense of humour can be extremely powerful, especially in the workplace. Only real interactions and laughing together release ‘feel-good’ hormones, such as endorphins, dopamine and oxytocin.
Finally, the moral question, distinguishing between good and bad, is central when we discuss artificial intelligence. Computers alone are not able to work ethically and, consequently, discrimination and injustice might be automated.
Augmented by machines
If Steve Jobs said that “computers are like a bicycle for the mind”, AI represents its racing car. In fact, there are several areas in which AI can effectively support human intelligence, such as offering new paths for exploration, enhancing the creative process, saving time and focusing attention on relevant tasks.
In organisations, AI can facilitate the imagination process in the development of new products or new ideas. The exploratory phase typically requires access to information, multiple experiences, time, and space to take place. AI can accelerate this phase, removing several roadblocks and quickly testing new directions.
AI and technological developments have begun to transform and aid creative and complex processes, as well as challenge what we believe to be advanced reasoning ability. After losing to a computer program for the first time, the Go world champion declared “I’m learning new moves and I’m becoming a better player thanks to AlphaGo…”
The complexity of the context is forcing companies to redesign their organisational model and to clarify the contribution of employees, in particular of managers. This can represent an opportunity to develop human potential and to increase people’s effectiveness and satisfaction.
It is necessary to acquire a higher awareness of human capabilities and personal talents. organisations and educational institutions play a crucial role in developing it. They have to create environments in which people can express themselves, make mistakes, restart, create and innovate and not just execute tasks or process information (like robots).

I am skeptical of the article’s optimistic stance on the survival of enough jobs with artificial intelligence. The swift advancements in robotics, deep learning, and emotion simulation will quickly bridge gaps that were once considered uniquely human and would replace many more intelligent hands, minds, and hearts in my view. Mass human contributions will be increasingly replaceable, and only a number of geniuses and artisans will survive.
The only frontiers to human existence are meaning, a sense of purpose, and free will. “What is the purpose of it all?” I invoke the metaphors of Sisyphus eternally rolling his stone uphill and a mouse trapped in its wheel, tirelessly running. We are in an existential quandary and our future roles are less than certain with AI and loose ethics.

I believe the argument the author makes in this blog-entry ignores the empirical evidence AI systems have just delivered over the course of the past year.
I am not convinced that AI won’t be able to imitate these purported three “human” traits, at least not sufficiently well or much better than human average. There is large variation in how different persons’ strength in these three, e.g. many are definitely very awkward and rather unsuccessful in their attempts to adjust their tone to the specific interaction and relationship at hand. On the other hand I believe that the past year has shown that – if anything – AI is frighteningly well able to internally mirror even very complex workings of systems such as our internal compass for whom to trust and how to interact, our hormonal systems. In fact I believe it’s plausible that this is exactly what would happen if I had a sufficiently powerful AI being trained by tagging along with me in the office for several months and observing all my interactions and decisions.
Now, one may be inclined to reply that this all may be true but that it is the very combination of individuals bringing these traits in differently strong and faceted versions to the table that makes humans superior. But we already know that systems with several separate agentic AI systems do develop complex interactions, collaborations and story-lines in which different systems develop different characteristics.
The necessity of (human) presence may be the strongest argument in this article, since in an iron-man version of it we can accept that this may be something an AI is categorically unable to imitate. To do that, we have to put aside the deceptive effects human-like robots and “emotional companion” products have had on probands in experiments. But while the argument may be sound, it is not a necessary condition for saving jobs: if all co-workers in the office are robots/AIs equipped with an internal mirroring of trust-guiding hormonal systems, none of them will really need the presence of a human around. They may be joking around to figure out their standing among each other and potentially this could work for them to identify “odd” colleagues who they don’t trust – without needing any human presence in the room.
Finally, the author reveals a fundamental misunderstanding in the conclusion which serves to substantiate why the article in its entirety seems mistaken: the success of today’s robots, the fundamental breakthrough leading to the capabilities that we can see today, was to turn robots from machines that execute tasks into machines that “create environments, can express themselves, make mistakes, restart, create and [this remains for philosophers to argue], innovate.”

Yet the dramatic shifts in the pandemic-era workplace have turned this once unfathomable idea into a reality for some workers. And as more global data emerges, an increasing number of companies are courting the approach after positive trial-run results across countries including the UK, Iceland, Portugal and more.Now, as pilots continue – in Germany, a trial of 45 companies has just begun, for instance – another factor has entered the mix. Artificial intelligence (AI) is gathering pace in the workplace, and some experts believe it could accelerate the adoption of the four-day workweek.Data from London-based news-and-events resource Tech.co collected in late 2023 lends credence to this idea. For their 2024 Impact of Technology on the Workplace, the company surveyed more than 1,000 US business leaders. The researchers found 29% of organisations with four-day workweeks use AI extensively in their firms' operations, implementing generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as well as other programmes to streamline operations. In comparison, only 8% of five-day working week organisations use AI to this extent. And 93% of businesses using AI are open to a four-day work week, whereas for those who don't, fewer than half are open to working shorter weeks.By handing over simple tasks to AI tools, we gain invaluable time previously lost to slow aspects of the process – Abb-d TaiyoAt London-based digital design agency Driftime, adopting AI technology has been crucial to enable the business to operate a flexible four-day work week. ""By handing over simple tasks to AI tools, we gain invaluable time previously lost to slow aspects of the process,"" says co-founder Abb-d Taiyo. ""With tools like Modyfi, the graphics are all live and modifiable, making it so much easier and quicker for our designers to create concepts and ideas.""Taiyo believes it makes sense for both his employees and his bottom line to work the condensed week. ""Instead of a dip in the quantity of work created over just four days, we've seen a remarkably high quality of work matched by a high staff satisfaction return. The health and happiness of our team is in direct correlation to the high standard of work produced,"" he says.AlamyThe mainstreaming of AI tech may mean workers get an extra day off (Credit: Alamy)Shayne Simpson, group managing director of UK-based TechNET IT Recruitment, also believes AI has been fundamental to the success of the company's four-day work week policy. The firm has found AI tools save each of their recruitment consultants 21 hours per week, primarily by automating previously manual tasks like data input, confirmation emails, resume screening and candidate outreach. This has reduced the time to fill permanent roles at the company by an average of 10 days. ""This timesaving allows our team to achieve their weekly goals earlier in the week and the flexibility liberates our consultants from being tethered to their desks, enabling them to enjoy a well-deserved Friday off,"" says Simpson.Not only has the company's abridged workweek boosted productivity and morale, Simpson says it's also been key to attracting talent to work within the company itself. ""Seasoned recruitment professionals are enticed by our streamlined processes while entry-level talent is eager to embrace new tools."" It's lifted the entire business, he adds.Rather than becoming mere caretakers or servants of machines, human workers need to develop new skills that can leverage, complement and lead AI, achieving the enhanced outcomes – Na FuWhile AI tools are certainly paving the way for a four-day work week within some industries, the technology can't usher in the change alone. Organisational culture within a business is also fundamental, says Na Fu, a professor in human resource management at Trinity Business School, Ireland. ""An openness to innovative work structures, an experimental mindset and, importantly, a culture grounded in high levels of trust are all important for the four-day work week to be successfully adopted,"" she says.As the digital transformation with AI progresses, employees themselves also must be willing to level up, she adds: ""Rather than becoming mere caretakers or servants of machines, human workers need to develop new skills that can leverage, complement and lead AI, achieving the enhanced outcomes.""Some industries will benefit from AI more than others, however – notably those who are able to use generative AI tools for such tasks including software development, content creation, marketing and legal services, says Fu. Plus, artificial intelligence development still has a way to go if it is to substantially reduce human working hours across the board.What may drive the shift to a four-day workweek in an AI-powered business landscape may not ultimately be up to the robots, however. Executive buy-in is required, and whether leaders will embrace the unconventional concept will vary depending on a firm's overarching purpose and values, says Fu. Instead of letting AI supplement the work of humans, for instance, some businesses could use it to automate certain tasks while piling other work on employees to fill newly open hours.Still, despite some reservation, an increasing number of business leaders – including those from some of the world's highest-earning companies – see a technology-driven shortened workweek as an inevitable future. In October 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg TV: ""Your children are going to live to 100, and they'll probably be working three-and-a-half days a week.""

Computer Weekly: Authorised access only – biometrics in the workplace

More staff are experimenting with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in the workplace, but adoption may be being held back by a lack of guidance from managers.
In its latest survey of more than 10,000 desk workers around the globe, the Workforce Lab from Slack found that experimentation with AI tools in the office continues to grow.
It found that one in four desk workers reported having tried AI tools for work as of January 2024, compared with one in five in September last year. One in three desk workers said they had used automation tools – such as automated workflows – in their job.
The survey from Slack – which was acquired by Salesforce in 2021 – also found that, outside of work, another 19% had used GenAI and 8% had used automation. That still means, of course, that about half of desk workers haven’t tried either.







Of the respondents who had used AI and automation tools for work, around 80% said the technology was already improving their productivity.
The top tasks where desk workers said they were seeing the most value from AI tools included in writing assistance, automating workflows and summarising content. Writing summaries has replaced “research” as a top value-add for respondents since Slack’s September 2023 survey.
It’s still early days for generative AI in the workplace, and so it’s perhaps unsurprising that attitudes towards the new technology vary. While enthusiasts for GenAI argue that it will enhance jobs by automating away the tedious busy-work and giving them a chance to focus on more creative work, others warn that managers will more likely use the opportunity of generative AI to cut staff levels instead.
While the largest proportion of those surveyed (42%) said they were excited about the idea of AI handling tasks from their current job, another 27% said they were concerned about these tools handling common workplace tasks, with the remaining 31% in “wait-and-see” mode.



“Lack of instruction may be preventing employees from experimenting with AI. Desk workers at companies that have defined AI guidelines are nearly six times more likely to have tried AI tools, compared with desk workers whose companies have no guidelines around AI usage”


Slack research




If workers are split on the introduction of AI tools, bosses seem far more bullish. The survey found that the majority (81%) of executives feel “some urgency” to incorporate generative AI into their organisations, with 50% of leaders reporting a high degree of urgency.
However, the survey found that almost half of staff had received no guidance from their leaders or organisation on how to use AI tools at work.
“Lack of instruction may be preventing employees from experimenting with AI,” the Slack research said. “Desk workers at companies that have defined AI guidelines are nearly six times more likely to have tried AI tools, compared with desk workers whose companies have no guidelines around AI usage.”
Workers at companies where the usage guidelines limit the use of AI are still more likely to have experimented with AI tools than those at companies with no rules around AI usage.
The results are in line with a survey by Isaca in October last year, which found that only 28% of organisations expressly permitted the use of generative AI and only 10% had a formal comprehensive policy in place. While setting up guidance around generative AI might be a new area, without it, there is the risk that staff will use these tools in ways the organisations might not want – something that is known as “shadow AI”.
As a result, some organisations, especially in the public sector, have started to put in place guidelines for what staff can – and cannot – do with generative AI technologies. Much of this has focused on making sure that all content is checked to prevent any chance of AI hallucination and ensuring that humans are always involved in key decision-making.
For example, US city San Francisco published its own generative AI guidelines in December 2023 which included rules around always disclosing the use of these tools and never putting sensitive information into public tools. New York also has a set of guidelines in place.
“The vast majority of people who are using AI and automation are already starting to experience productivity gains,” said Christina Janzer, senior vice-president of research and analytics at Slack and head of Slack’s Workforce Lab.
“But the data indicates that failing to provide guidance or instruction on AI may be inhibiting your employees from giving it a try. If you’re looking to ready your workforce for the AI revolution, you can start by providing guidelines for how AI can be used at work.”
The research found the top business benefits that executives are most looking forward to from integrating AI into business operations include increased efficiency and productivity of employees (38%), the ability to make data-driven decision-making (35%), innovation in products and services (34%) and cost reductions (33%). Managers are also hoping for an increased focus on strategy over rote tasks (27%) and enhanced customer experience (18%).
In terms of what is stopping executives from fully embracing AI, data security and privacy topped the list at (44%), followed by worries about AI reliability and accuracy (36%). A lack of expertise and a skills gap among staff was cited by one in four (25%), while broader ethical and compliance issues were blamed by (17%). Customer trust and acceptance was mentioned by 17%, while 16% said the cost of implementation and maintenance was an issue.
The research suggests that desk workers report spend as much as 41% of their time at work on tasks that are low value and don’t contribute much to their core job functions. The more time desk workers spend on low-value work, the “more excitement they express for AI and automation to handle tasks from their current job”, the Slack report said.
“We all have tasks to complete that aren’t part of our job description but are necessary to keep things running smoothly. But if the average desk worker is spending two full days each week on this ‘work of work’, that’s a problem – and an opportunity,” said Janzer.
“In this pivotal moment, implementing AI and automation tools that are trusted, intuitive and embedded in the flow of work is key to recalibrating energy at work toward the activities that will move the needle,” she added.

Every tech company you can think of is jumping on the generative AI bandwagon and touting new features promising to make our lives easier, increase productivity, and unlock some dormant cache of hidden potential within all of us. But ""promise"" is the operative word here. Despite all the AI hype and billions of dollars of investment, generative AI is still very new to the average person and has yet to transform from being a fascinating novelty into an indispensable mainstay. Even as someone who writes about AI for a living, I use generative AI tools somewhat sporadically. That mostly involves testing out and experimenting with new AI models and apps that are available. I might get excited about a certain app or tool only to forget about it and fall back into my normal habits.Also, I generally don't trust generative AI. Since truth and accuracy is pretty important to what I do, bringing ChatGPT and other tools into the fold seems not only counterproductive to me, but also potentially disastrous for my employment. But what if there are ways of using AI tools that don't replace my livelihood, but empower me to do it better? Isn't that what Big Tech is promising us anyway? That's why I decided to give it the old college try and spend some time using AI tools in earnest to test out what's useful, and more importantly what actually sticks. The experiment I spent a little over a week using generative AI tools that fit within my daily life and work schedule. To do this, I made an outline of what my typical week looks like and identified ways where generative AI could help and which tools to use. Since several AI tools require a subscription, programming knowledge, or aren't widely available yet, I narrowed it down to services that are free or readily available to the average person. That excludes tools like Slack's AI add-on, Microsoft's full access to Copilot, and Zoom's AI companion which requires a paid subscription.The experiment isn't intended to use as many generative AI tools as possible, but to experiment with the popular ones deemed the most useful for my life. Here's what I came up with: ChatGPT PlusGoogle Gemini Google Docs and Gmail ""Help me Write"" featureThe standalone Copilot siteOtter's AI features for transcriptsTasty's Botatouille appIt's important to note that I have a paid subscription to ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus), and Mashable paid for a subscription to Otter. But I used all of the other apps with my free personal accounts.First, a disclaimerBeing a reporter, using generative AI tools for work comes with unique ethical challenges. That's why I pledged to use these tools only for brainstorming and writing help, but never to actually write something for me.Anytime I used generative AI to help with drafting or brainstorming, I did it for the purposes of understanding whether it was actually useful and accurate. So you'll see examples of me asking for writing-related help but I didn't actually publish or post any of its responses verbatim. Also, when using ChatGPT for any unpublished or sensitive information I had my chat history turned off. This was to ensure that what I shared wasn't used to train the model. I didn't use Gemini or Copilot in these instances because there's no way to protect your data from being used, unless you have a paid enterprise account. With expectations firmly set, let's begin!Spinning my tangled to-do list into efficiency goldOrganization and time management are not my strong suit. I seem to be missing that gene that accurately budgets time, plans ahead, and efficiently doles out my time and energy instead of obsessing over mundane details and doing everything at the last minute. Here's where I was most excited to lean on AI tools. Every morning, I started my day by brain dumping all the things I needed and wanted to accomplish that day. This included work tasks related to story ideas and assignments and life tasks like walking my dog, doing laundry, and doing yoga.

On the first day, I fed my to-do list with specifications around my work hours, any imminent deadlines, and appointments into ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to see which one gave me the most helpful response. It became immediately clear that ChatGPT was to become my go-to for the rest of the week. Even though I told Gemini I worked from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., it had me doing work tasks before 9 a.m. and working up until 9 p.m., without any specifics on when to accomplish certain tasks, only suggesting I should ""swap the yoga and writing session in the evening if that works better for you."" That might be how the workday goes in Silicon Valley, but I keep pretty strict work hours to stay sane, especially when working remotely. 




I think Gemini needs to learn more about work/life balance.

Copilot was better at actually blocking out my time, but since it kept encouraging internet browsing by offering me links to various articles about where to find yoga studios or links to articles about AI tools (since I explained what I was working on.)

ChatGPT, on the other hand, gave me a genuinely useful schedule based on how to best use my creative energy. After tackling a news story to start the day, it suggested a concrete time block for my longer term story in the early afternoon, since ""It's a good period to focus deeply on research, outlining, or writing without the fatigue that can come later in the day."" It even recommended getting the laundry going before I work in my longterm story since it can run in the background. I was going to do this anyway, but it was interesting to see ChatGPT picking up on that efficiency.

Toward the end of the day, ChatGPT suggested less energy-consuming tasks like reaching out to new sources. With my ChatGPT-planned schedule in place every morning, I felt more organized and relaxed about the day. Some things definitely took longer than ChatGPT budgeted time for, but it was useful to have something to stick to instead of my usual vague to-do list. Good with recaps, bad with headlinesThroughout the workday, I looked for ways to incorporate generative AI into my work. Since I definitely wasn't asking it to write for me, I had to get creative about how else to use it. That's how I ended up using ChatGPT for its summarization skills.When struggling with a headline, I pasted a draft of the story into ChatGPT and asked it what the story was about. This helped me make sure what I was trying to communicate lined up with what I wrote, and determine certain keywords to use in a headline.

Just as an experiment, I also asked ChatGPT to give me headline ideas using stories I'd previously written to see what it came up with. It accurately captured the gist of the story, but ChatGPT's headlines were predictably sterile and robotic. For my story regarding, OpenAI's lack of transparency around training data for its AI video generator Sora, ChatGPT suggested headlines like ""OpenAI's Sora: Breakthrough Video AI Sparks Copyright Controversy"" and ""Sora Unveiled: OpenAI's Latest Leap Forward Amid Ethical Quandaries."" Putting aside the fact that ChatGPT loves a dramatic colon, it sounds like a poor imitation of a New York Times article. 




None of these headlines were particularly inspiring.

While Gemini's headline ideas were either very generic like ""The Legal and Ethical Issues of Training AI Models on Public Data"" or in a clickbait-y style that makes me dread the future of the internet, like ""Is OpenAI Stealing Data to Train its AI Models?"" I also pasted the same story into Copilot for headline ideas, but it was cut off because there's a 2,000-word limit.

4 ways AI can boost your productivity at work



Encountering the trust issueNow onto the next chapter of my day. This week involved reading through transcripts of interviews for a longer term story I'm working on. For journalists, Otter is a lifesaver. It uses AI to transcribe audio files so you can review your interviews within minutes instead of tediously transcribing them yourself. That's nothing new, but this year, Otter released an AI chatbot, which also provides transcript summaries, tells you if you were mentioned, and outlines any specific takeaways. This is mostly geared towards workers who use Otter for meetings, not for journalists interviewing sources, but I decided to try it out and see if it helped for my purposes, since transcripts can be burdensome to comb through for salient points. In the Otter Chat for a long interview, I asked ""what are the takeaways from this conversation?"" The results helpfully showed a brief bulleted list of the major points of the conversation. The AI-generated takeaways seemed valid, but I still felt like I needed to read through the transcript and double-check, since we all know at this point, generative AI can sometimes get it wrong. Everything ultimately was correct, but this is an example of where generative AI might not be the time-saver it's cracked up to be if everything needs to be fact-checked. Nonetheless, I liked having the list of takeaways as a reference when going back to the transcript instead of having to scroll through all of it. Wrangling customer service is an AI solution I can get behindI wanted to try out Google's AI tools for Gmail (formerly Duet AI, now rolled into the umbrella Gemini brand) but only had access to it with my personal email through Google Labs. During my lunch break one day, I discovered something beautiful that I will definitely be using in the future: emailing customer service. As a Soda Stream devotee, I'm a big fan of their CO2 exchange, which lets me ship back used canisters in the same box that delivered the new ones, all with a prepaid label. Yet, when I ordered new canisters, the delivery date came and went, with no new canisters to make my water delightfully carbonated. The tracking status said they were delivered, but nothing ever arrived.

These are the kinds of mundane tasks I despise. Every time I remembered to reach out to Soda Stream, something else would come up and it would slip my mind. I also debated whether it would be better to email them or call, which would mean sitting on hold, and then would I have to somehow prove my canisters never arrived? Welcome to my neurotic brain. Bolstered by the spirit of my experiment, I turned to Gmail's ""Help me write."" In the chat, I prompted ""draft an email to Soda Stream explaining how my CO2 canisters never arrived, even though it said they were delivered on January 9."" The result was a perfectly adequate email, and subject line that explained all the necessary details. All I did was add in the order number, since I didn't specify that in the original prompt. 




Now this is helpful.

By the way, Soda Stream was very responsive and sent me new canisters right away, no questions asked. All in all, it was a pain-free experience, and now I'm back to drinking carbonated water by the gallon. Half-baked recipe ideasAfter my workday, I put generative AI tools to the test while cooking dinner. Tasty's Botatouille app is a chatbot from the popular recipe app that helps you brainstorm meals and find recipes. At the end of most days when my creativity is tapped, I struggle with making sense of the contents of my fridge, let alone how to cook something. So I started out by asking Botatouille for ideas based on the ingredients I had. In terms of generating meals, Botatouille had some good ideas. One night, I made a soup with kale, white beans, and sausage, and another night, I threw together a stir fry with leftover veggies and chicken. However, Botatouille was better as a jumping off point for finding ideas rather than executing the recipe. I often had to follow up to get the recipe, and even then I ended up reworking it based on my own needs and ideas. I tend to improvise or add my own flair to recipes when cooking anyways (which is why I'm a terrible baker). But that was the extent of its usefulness. One major reason is because Botatouille doesn't save your chat history, so I couldn't go back and revisit ideas. I was also disappointed when looking for recipes using ground beef and shiitake mushrooms, since it kept giving me ideas for other types of meat, which I did not have in my refrigerator. Maybe if you're planning on cooking a meal for a dinner party and going out to buy ingredients, it might be more helpful, but for a hungry person who just wants to eat and relax, the best way to use it is as a brainstorming shortcut. 




Botatouille gave me one recipe idea with ground beef, but the other two used different types of meat.

In conclusion...My week with AI tools was a bit of a mixed bag. Having committed to using them as much as possible throughout my day, there are a few tools I could see myself coming back to and some that don't have the stickiness to earn a spot on my tech roster. I'll likely keep using ChatGPT for planning my workday and summarizing information, and brainstorming headlines. I will also be relying more on Gmail's ""Help me write"" feature for tackling any sort of mindless email-related tasks that just need to get done. But some of the other tools felt a bit redundant or required more effort than they were worth. Otter's AI companion tools didn't save me much time since I felt the need to double-check its responses. With Tasty's Botatouille, I could have just googled recipe ideas or browsed through the app, rather than go through the extra step of writing out a prompt. Ultimately, many of the AI tools for work are geared towards workers in non-creative industries. I could see a project manager or consultant, whose days are jam-packed with meetings and involve lots of logistics and task-juggling, relying on generative AI to catch them up on meetings, put together recaps of strategic conversations, and design proposals and presentations. But, since most of what I do involves teasing words out of the old brainbox, there's only so much ChatGPT and the like can help with, and I'm pretty okay with that.

This is the prediction of a report published on Monday 26 February by Randstad Research on the impact that AI will have on the Spanish labour market after carrying out an analysis based on extrapolations from international methodologies.According to the report, almost 10% of jobs in Spain, equivalent to around two million, are at risk of being automated and will disappear due to the implementation of artificial intelligence. However, the expansion of this technology in business activity will also generate new opportunities over the next decade and create more than 1.6 million new jobs that do not exist today, according to calculations made by Randstad. The net effect on the labour market will, therefore, be the potential loss of some 400,000 jobs.But the positive effect of AI is not only in terms of the new positions; it will also increase productivity in 3.24 million existing jobs, 15.9% of the total, which will in turn boost the Spanish economy. And, no significant adverse effects are expected for three quarters of workers, more than 15.1 million individuals.Logically, the impact that AI penetration will have on different sectors will vary. Some professions will benefit from an increase in jobs, while others will see their share of the labour market decline with the advent of these technologies. Commerce and administrative activities will be the worst affected sectors, as they will experience a reduction in employment of 158,415 and 147,915 jobs respectively over the next decade, followed by hotels and catering and logistics, with losses of 112,770 and 47,440 jobs respectively.In contrast, sectors or activities with a more positive impact on job creation include programming and consultancy; telecommunications; media and publishing; and professional, scientific and technical activities. Finally, there is a group of sectors that will generally experience a limited impact with the arrival of AI, such as agriculture, livestock and fishing; associative activities; extractive industries; and construction.Higher productivityThe greatest increase in productivity with the consolidation of artificial intelligence will also be concentrated in these sectors: programming and consultancy, 40%; insurance, 37%; financial services, 36%; and media and publishing, 33%.Valentín Bote, director of Randstad Research, said that globally 18% of work could be more or less affected by automation and global GDP could increase by 7% as a result of the boost to labour productivity.Low implementationAt present, companies are still in the early stages of adopting artificial intelligence. In Spain, 54.5% of companies said that they still do not use it. The remaining 45.5% that do so use the technology mainly for data analysis (49.2%), optimisation of administrative tasks, or process automation (36.1%).Furthermore, the degree of use differs greatly according to the size of the company: it is still very incipient in small companies, while its degree of use is much more widespread in large companies, which have a greater investment capacity and opportunities for using this type of technology.""It already seems clear that AI will become a technological breakthrough and will eventually change the way work is done and the content of work as it is incorporated by companies,"" Bote added.",Madrid,https://www.surinenglish.com/compromisos-periodisticos.html,"[{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Grupo Vocento', 'logo': 'https://www.vocento.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/09/Logo_Vocento-HD.png', 'url': 'https://www.vocento.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/VocentoSocial/', 'https://twitter.com/Vocento', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/vocento']}]",https://www.surinenglish.com/condiciones-uso.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract
The question of how artificial intelligence will affect jobs, skills, and the future of work is open-ended, and answers have been uncertain and contradictory. As AI has advanced, forecasts of labor market impacts have increasingly emphasized AI’s potential to automate tasks that require skills—including creativity, writing, and social and emotional learning—previously believed to be beyond the technology’s reach. In the face of these advances and the uncertainties they generate, students and incumbent workers should focus on developing balanced skill “portfolios” that support flexibility and adaptation, and policymakers should empower them to do so.

Introduction
In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, artificial intelligence has emerged as a so-called general-purpose technology, akin to the steam engine, electricity, and the transistor, with the potential to reshape all aspects of our economy and lives. Much of AI’s transformative potential is due to recent developments in the field—particularly the rise of generative AI, which can create novel text, images, and audio. According to a recent report published by McKinsey & Company, this new wave of technology could add $2.6–$4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, with an outsized impact in industries such as banking, software and tech, and the life sciences (Chui, Hazan, et al. 2023). According to Goldman Sachs (2023), AI could raise the global gross domestic product (GDP) by 7 percent over 10 years.
Changes of this scale in growth and GDP will likely affect businesses and workers profoundly. The question is what those changes will be and how we can prepare for them. In this report, we review over a decade of research on AI’s potential and actual impacts on employment trends and demand for skills in the labor market. We then explore this research’s implications for skill development and worker training and offer recommendations for workers and policymakers.
As we stand on the threshold of an AI-driven economy, the future of work is at stake. Will work still be an important human activity, or will human labor be rendered surplus to requirements? While machine-based intelligence has loomed over human imagination for centuries, the modern idea of AI emerged in the mid-20th century with the development of digital computers. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, while references to artificial intelligence in popular literature rose sharply in the late 20th century, peaking between 1985 and 1990, mentions of the term in academic literature remained relatively low until 2010. As the topic gained ground in scientific circles, references to it in popular literature also began to climb.
AI’s growing role in the public consciousness coincided with revolutionary change in fields such as image recognition and natural language processing, setting the stage for AI’s prominence in public discourse today (Roser 2022).
Between 2010 and today, AI development can be broken into three major periods. From 2010 to 2016, breakthroughs in neural-network design transformed AI. Powered by these new systems, AI made rapid gains in image recognition and deep learning, especially through models such as AlexNet and AlphaGo, a program that shocked scientists and other observers by defeating a world champion Go player (Albrecht 2023; Google DeepMind n.d.).
AI’s advances in 2016–22 built on earlier development with the introduction of highly influential neural-network models including Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and OpenAI’s GPT (Albrecht 2023). These models set new benchmarks in natural language processing, helping rapidly improve AI reading comprehension and language understanding, as noted in Figure 3.
The third era, from around 2022 to the present, has featured the maturation of generative AI and the proliferation of generative AI tools for broad public use. In this brief period, tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, DALL·E, Midjourney, and a host of other tools have become widely available, spurring debate about the impacts of AI on work (Chui, Hazan, et al. 2023). Below, we examine the key research voices and trends in each of the three major periods of development outlined above.

  Artificial intelligence creates tremendous opportunities that benefit society. But how does it impact jobs? In this chapter, we take a step back and look at how AI can change our daily lives at work, and how we can best prepare ourselves to make it an ally rather than a threat.Is Artificial Intelligence Human's Ultimate Competitor?It’s nothing new: whenever disruptive technologies appear, changes in the job market follow, as organizations embrace new advances to improve productivity and reduce costs (i.e., acquiring new machines that take over part or all of a task usually performed by humans). One example is sorting fruits and vegetables on a production line to determine whether they are ripe enough to be sold.But how will my job be affected by this transformation?Artificial intelligence is not just about automating tasks. It aims to automate our cognitive abilities, such as perception and decision-making. This raises even more questions about its impact on jobs.With the rise of automation and computerisation, some economists have even argued that work will disappear, as Jeremy Rifkin did back in 1995. These theories have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years with the advent of artificial intelligence. Leading figures such as Elon Musk and Richard Branson have backed the idea of a ""universal"" basic income to counterbalance the potential loss of jobs.So you may be asking yourself if your job will be impacted by this transformation. You are not alone! In 2013, an Oxford University study made the news when it predicted that artificial intelligence could replace nearly half of all jobs within 10 to 20 years. Several years later, this prediction is far from coming true; it has even been revised downward.Since then, the results of other studies have been less definite. The OECD, for example, has analyzed the trend toward automation. The upshot? As highlighted in their 2021 report, economists believe that 14% of jobs face a strong likelihood of being automated over the next two decades, while 32% of jobs could be deeply transformed.While these figures are somewhat less alarming, it’s clear that certain existing roles are already changing. In any case, we should bear in mind that it is very difficult to make precise estimates. It is entirely possible that AI will have a transformative impact beyond expectations. Let’s look at how AI is already changing the world of work!The Future Landscape of JobsAlthough recent studies have been reassuring regarding job losses, some tasks may be automated, even if the job itself remains.Attorneys could use an AI tool to locate legal information without spending hours looking for it. Accountants could use an AI tool to interpret invoices and record them in a software program automatically. Photographers could use AI software to correct all of the slides of a presentation automatically. In all of these examples, AI does not replace the profession; it merely provides a new tool.Artificial intelligence is also a source of job creation, particularly in the IT and digital realms. Although the new “marquee” job of the artificial intelligence revolution is that of a data scientist, many other skills are required to carry out AI projects, such as computer programming, research, and design. Many jobs will be created in this vein, including database administrator, cybersecurity officer, SEO engineer (search engine optimization), and more. This Forbes article mentions some new and enhanced roles AI could create.As we have seen, the driving force behind the AI revolution is data. In order to use this data, it needs to be meticulously collected, cleaned and fine-tuned. By whom? Researcher Antonio A. Casilli talks about ""click workers"", scattered around the world. Often invisible, on the other side of the world, living in precarious conditions, they carry out micro-tasks such as annotating photos or videos, sorting tweets, moderating the content of social platforms, transcribing audio recordings, etc.The Importance of Continuing EducationWhether the arrival of these new technologies does away with your job entirely or fundamentally alters it, there are actions you can take. You are already taking one by taking this course. The key to survival, both today and tomorrow, is lifelong learning. Options will be a matter of government and corporate policy and individual choice. More and more types of training are being offered online (on the OpenClassrooms platform, for example 😊 ), in the classroom, and on the job, with customized learning platforms that allow users to progress at their own pace.Let's Recap!The AI technological revolution has shifted the employment market, with certain jobs disappearing and new ones being created. AI is good at helping us to perform certain tasks, making us quicker, more efficient, and more accurate in our work. Humans need to adapt to these technological changes and ensure that they continue to undertake training throughout their working lives. Now that you have learned more about the challenges and opportunities associated with AI, test your knowledge by answering a few questions!

It has been a year since the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot that became a global phenomenon overnight, ushering in an era of rapid technological innovation driven by generative AI. The series of AI advancements that followed unlocked a global competition for AI dominance and forced governments, businesses, and consumers to rethink what our world will look like in the era of generative AI.This technology will have a profound impact on the future of work. While generative AI offers great potential to accelerate productivity and innovation, it poses new challenges to business leaders. For instance, how do organizations prepare their workforce for a future where humans and AI work together to make critical decisions and complete complex tasks? How can they adopt generative AI safely across the business? How do they make sure that no one is left behind?Susan CharnauxSocial Links NavigationChief People Officer at Appian.Business leaders and front-line workers have different views of AIOne concern related to generative AI is that it will create new knowledge divides within organizations. Recent data from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggests that these divisions are most conspicuous at the hierarchical layers of the business. According to the research, 80% of leaders use generative AI regularly, versus just 20% of frontline employees. Business leaders also tend to be more optimistic about the potential of the technology, with 62% of senior decision-makers expressing this sentiment compared to 42% of frontline employees.These disparities in attitudes towards AI could align with people's understanding of the technology. The research indicates that 44% of leaders have received training on generative AI to sharpen their skills and stay relevant, while only 14% of frontline employees have received similar training. Familiarity with the technology, or lack thereof, seems to be causing further ruptures across the different generations within the workforce. Organizations must act quickly to bridge the generational divide.LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

Generational differences in AI use in the workplace are another area of concern, with research showing that over half of workers above 35 are not using AI in the workplace, while 71% of younger employees are utilizing these tools. This could create a rift between generations, leaving behind older workers who don’t have a good grasp of the technology. However, one of the most transformative attributes of generative AI is that it is very user-friendly, meaning new users can easily learn to work with the technology and use it to enhance their productivity and performance.Earlier this year, researchers from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) conducted the world’s first large-scale empirical study of the impact of generative AI on workers. The data showed that lower-skilled workers saw the biggest increase in productivity because of generative AI. This early data on the impact of the technology indicates that generative AI offers huge opportunities for organizations to improve productivity and level the playing field for all employees by freeing up more time for them to focus on more meaningful work. But to benefit from this, businesses must act quickly to bridge the AI divide and equip all employees with the right skills to make the most of generative AI.Building a safe AI environment and fostering an AI-friendly cultureTo realize the full benefits of generative AI, business leaders must empower everyone within their workforce to use the technology safely and effectively. This means building a culture of knowledge, understanding and responsibility towards AI. Before rolling out formal training, businesses should consider how they can protect their intellectual property and their employees from the risks associated with generative AI.Are you a pro?

To mitigate those risks, organizations should consider a private AI model, which means all the data, AI algorithms, and IT infrastructure are fully controlled within the business.In this scenario, AI models are trained exclusively on data the organization owns or has access to. Training data in a private AI environment allows the organization to gain more control over the data and the outcome. By going private, AI models remain with the organization. Therefore, unique algorithms and trade secrets remain protected for competitive advantage. This approach creates a safer environment where employees can use generative AI without exposing their organization to security risks. Most importantly, this protects data privacy of employees, customers, and business partners.Once you have created a safe AI environment, it is essential to establish clear policies and guidelines for its use across the business and roll out a comprehensive training program that touches every part of your organization, tailored to different technical skills and levels of experience. This strategy will enable you to empower your workforce to make the most of AI and create an AI-friendly culture that nurtures a deeper understanding of the technology and an exponential increase of its benefits for the business.We've featured the best online collaboration tool.This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Every technology introduces paradoxes. But AI seems to have more than its share — it giveth, it taketh away — all at once. Of course, this makes it harder and more confusing for business and IT leaders to make decisions on AI in their organizations, especially since it involves considerable budgets, convincing everyone, and shifting of resources.


Here are some prominent AI paradoxes:

1. AI reduces labor requirements. AI increases skill requirements. Putting together AI-driven capabilities requires skills to do so — and this is one of its greatest challenges. For example, AI replaces tasks formerly performed by humans, with 62% of respondents to a Rackspace Technology survey saying that it has led to reduced headcounts within their organization. At the same time, the issue or obstacle most often faced is a shortage of skilled talent to make AI happen, cited by 67%.

2. AI is complicated to develop and deploy. AI makes it easier to develop and deploy applications. The people seeing the most benefits from AI technologies to date are technologists themselves — automating their operations and quality assurance, enabling faster application development, greater network optimization, and eliminating manual task work. artificial intelligence, a survey from IBM’s Watson Group finds.

PROMOTED
3. AI is expensive to implement. AI helps manage and reduce IT costs. For example, the rising practice of FinOps — which encourages intelligently controlling technology spending — may benefit from AI and machine learning, an analysis out of the FinOps Foundation predicts. At the same time, FinOps and other cost mitigation efforts may be needed to manage and build AI capabilities.
4. AI automates and mechanizes work. AI demands greater creativity in work. Authors of the future jobs report out of the World Economic Forum estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years, and cognitive skills are reported to be growing in importance most quickly, “reflecting the increasing importance of complex problem-solving in the workplace.”

5. AI won’t help companies that really, really need it the most. There’s a tendency to assume by taking the latest and greatest technology, dropping tons of money on solutions and associated consulting, and, presto! Miraculous growth and happy customers overnight. The slow and inefficient organizations that would benefit the most from AI are less like to embrace it in a productive way. The organizations with forward-looking cultures that would succeed without AI are its biggest proponents.

6. AI requires huge data sets. AI can alleviate data management requirements. AI requires the highest-quality data. AI can assure greater data quality. While AI is a data resource hog, it can be instrumental in identifying and preparing the data needed for analytics-driven systems.
7. AI brings incredible intelligence, but is really dumb. AI may be able to crack quantum physics, but cannot be taught the simplest of tasks. This is Moravec's paradox, coined by Hans Peter Moravec of Carnegie-Mellon University, who observed that ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.”
AI is extremely promising technology for many business problems and opportunities. But the trade-offs are interesting — and will certainly perplex us for some time to come.

Despite the broad range of artificial intelligence technologies and the flurry of new laws regulating them, virtually all laws regulating how these technologies process data follow the same basic framework.
This means employers can follow a relatively straightforward checklist around the world to work through the major data protection issues.
This Insight walks through the checklist and identifies significant variations between regions and countries.





As employment-related artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools proliferate, multinational employers feel increasing pressure to deploy AI across their global offices.  These tools can provide great value and efficiency across the employment life cycle.  For example, recruiters request AI screening services that can save them days of time by quickly reviewing thousands of applications.  Business partners want performance-monitoring tools that can save time on supervision. Employees may insist on generative AI tools to help them create reports, presentations, and trainings. The HR Department might request a chatbot that can answer common workforce questions.  The list of requests may go on and on.
At the same time, the compliance challenge of rolling out AI tools in global offices may seem overwhelming.  AI tools implicate a myriad of legal concerns in the workplace—including labor, discrimination, intellectual property, and data protection. Not only does every country have its own laws in these areas, but legislatures are rapidly developing laws specific to AI.  The good news for multinational employers is that the laws with the most comprehensive restrictions on AI—data protection laws—follow a similar framework all over the world.  As a result, multinational employers can follow a relatively straightforward checklist to work through the major data protection issues.  This checklist may assist employers in creating a global data protection framework for their AI programs, which they can then vary as needed by jurisdiction.
Overview of the Legal Framework Regulating AI Tools
Most countries have data protection laws that comprehensively regulate the use of personal data, and these laws apply to the use of personal data by AI tools and the use of automated decision-making tools.  One of the most prominent of these laws is the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (“GDPR”),1 but virtually every major trading partner of the United States has a data protection law. These countries include: our neighbors, Canada and Mexico; global powerhouses, such as Brazil, China, the European Economic Area, India, Japan, and the UK; as well as many smaller economies. Increasingly, data protection laws include provisions that govern AI or automated decision-making.  Moreover, new laws specific to AI build on the framework of the existing data protection laws.
While the United States lacks a comprehensive data protection law at the federal level, a complex patchwork of privacy and data security laws throughout the United States collectively add up to protections similar to a comprehensive data protection law. Additionally, more than one quarter of all states have adopted comprehensive data protection laws that layer on top of the existing laws. For now, at least, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, (collectively, the “CCPA”) is the only such law that applies to the data of applicants, employees, independent contractors and others in a human resources relationship to a company (“HR data”).2 In addition, a growing body of legislation specifically regulates AI.
Despite this complexity, virtually all data protection laws follow the same basic framework.  This provides employers with a checklist of issues to consider. Although there are other elements of these laws, key items for employers to evaluate are the following:

Legal basis for processing
Notice
Proportionality and data protection impact assessments
Cross-border data transfer restrictions
Data-related rights
Data minimization and retention
Accuracy
Data security
Contracting

This article will explore each of these items in more depth and discuss some of the variations between countries.

Legal Basis for Processing Data

Before considering how to implement a particular AI tool, employers should first consider whether there is a legal basis for collecting and processing the information. Most data protection laws around the world permit the collection and processing of personal data only on limited grounds, such as the individual’s consent or as required by law. In those countries, an employer may only process data if there is a legal basis for doing so. In other words, in reverse of the United States – where an employer can use personal data for any purpose as long as it is not explicitly prohibited – in most countries, an employer cannot use personal data unless an explicitly permitted legal basis applies.  Typical legal bases for processing personal data in the employment context are consent, performance of a contract, legitimate interest of the company, and compliance with a legal requirement.3
Many countries rely heavily on an individual’s consent for the legal basis. At one extreme, in South Korea, employers must obtain separate consents to use personal data, to use certain categories of sensitive personal data, to disclose personal data to a third party, and to transfer personal data to another country.4 At the other extreme, a growing number of countries permit data processing on the looser concept of the employer’s legitimate interests. Some countries, like European Union (EU) Member States, strongly disfavor reliance on consent as a lawful basis for processing in the employment context.
Publicly Available Data
The issue of legal basis poses a particular hurdle when publicly available personal data is scraped from the internet.  For example, a popular subset of AI tools gathers information about people on the internet – LinkedIn profiles, professional bio web pages, and the like – to identify potential candidates for recruiters or headhunters to contact for hard-to-fill jobs.  In principle, a tool like this might collect information about thousands of individuals.
In countries that generally rely on consent as the legal basis for processing, gathering information about hundreds of candidates from publicly available information online might be impractical due to the difficulty of obtaining consent from each individual. Other countries, such as Brazil, the UK, and members of the EEA, permit data processing based on the company's ""legitimate interests"" to the extent that the individual's rights and freedoms do not outweigh the company's legitimate interests.5 
Whether a company can rely on the basis of its “legitimate” interests may be quite dependent on context.  For public profiles in professional social networks, the balancing of interests generally should favor the employer, particularly where the profile demonstrates the individual’s interest in finding a job. However, where the individual clearly did not post the profile for potential employers, where the terms of use prohibit scraping, and other factors indicate that the individual did not intend for the profile to be used to evaluate them for employment, then the balance of interests most likely weighs against the employer. Consequently, before implementing AI tools that rely heavily on information scraped from the Internet, global employers should conduct sufficient due diligence to assess the risk of whether the data may not have been collected in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Privately Available Data
The question of legal basis also raises challenges when collecting personal data in other contexts.  For example, an employer may have a legitimate interest in collecting personal data about employees’ activity on the company’s computer system so that an AI tool can analyze it for productivity.  However, as noted above, legitimate interest typically must be weighed against the privacy rights of the individual.  This includes considering not only the information that will be collected, but the method of collecting the data.  For example, a German court held that an employer’s legitimate interest in monitoring employees through the use of keylogger software was outweighed by the employees’ privacy rights.  The court found that the use of keylogger software, which records all keystrokes on a work computer to covertly monitor and control employees, requires a suspicion of a criminal offense or other serious breach of duty based on concrete facts.6
In principle, the employee’s consent could be an alternative to legitimate interest as the legal basis for collecting surveillance data about employees. Most data protection laws permit the processing of personal data based on consent.  However, in the EEA, Brazil, and the UK, at least, consent generally will not be a feasible alternative in the employment context. In those countries, authorities take the position that employees, and in some cases even applicants, generally cannot “freely give” consent for data processing due to the imbalance of power between employees and employers.
Data Collection Restrictions in the United States and Elsewhere 
As noted above, U.S. data protection law by and large has not adopted the concept of a legal basis for processing personal data.  Instead, the common law in many states protects personal information in which individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Collecting information that invades this reasonable expectation, such as surreptitious video recording in private offices, may amount to a tort under the common law. In addition, various U.S. laws require consent to collect sensitive information such as audio recordings, biometric data, and location data.  Other U.S. laws prohibit the collection of certain information about applicants and employees except in very limited situations, for example, health and genetic data.
Similarly, other countries have laws separate from their national data protection laws that limit the collection of information.  For example, many states in Australia have surveillance laws specific to the workplace that limit the types of information that may be collected.7
Key Factors to Consider in Data Collection
As this brief discussion illustrates, the question of whether an employer has a legal basis to collect personal data and process it with AI generally will depend on four factors:

The type of personal data and the employee’s privacy interests in that data;
Where the information is collected and processed, including whether the data is publicly available;
The context of collection and processing, including the invasiveness of the technology; and
The purposes of use. 

Considering whether the employer has a legal basis for collection and use of personal data should be the first step in assessing how to use an AI tool because the analysis may show that the employer simply cannot collect and/or process the necessary personal data in some jurisdictions.

Notice

After a company has determined that it can legally collect and use personal information, it must consider how it will provide notice to individuals about the practices. Virtually all data protection laws require a company to provide a notice regarding how it processes personal data. Most statutes require that the notices include what data is processed, the purposes of using the personal data, the parties to which the data is disclosed, and information about how to exercise data rights.  Other required disclosures may include the legal basis for using the personal data, details about data transfers to other countries, and contact information for the company’s data protection officer.
Notice in Existing Data Protection Laws
Increasingly, data protection laws require additional disclosures in certain circumstances about how artificial intelligence will process personal data.  Since it became effective in mid-2018, the GDPR has required notice if the data controller makes decisions solely based on automated processing that “produces legal effects” or “similarly significantly affects” the individual. This likely includes most employment decisions based solely on automated processing.8 In that case, the notice must describe the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the individual.
Additional Notice Requirements in New AI Laws
The EU’s upcoming AI Act supplements the GDPR’s notice requirement for AI tools that operate as biometric categorization systems and emotional recognition systems.9 Although the meaning of this latter term is not yet entirely clear, it potentially could encompass some of the new AI tools that attempt to gauge the emotional state of employees, for example, the emotional state of a call center employee based on analyzing their behavior during calls.
U.S. regulatory agencies and new U.S. laws have progressed in a similar vein.  For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) has recommended that employers using AI tools provide notice at least about which traits or characteristics the tool is designed to measure, the methods by which those traits or characteristics are to be measured, and the disabilities, if any, that potentially might lower the assessment results or cause the individual to be screened out.10
New York City’s groundbreaking law on using artificial intelligence to assess employees and candidates requires that companies subject to the law provide notices explaining that the company will use automated employment decision tools in connection with the assessment or evaluation of such employee or candidate and the job qualifications and characteristics used in the assessment.11
The EU and the United States are at the forefront in passing laws specific to AI.  However, many countries have proposed such legislation.  For example, under Brazil’s LGPD, notice to individuals should include the data subject’s right to request the review of fully automated decisions.12 Brazil’s proposed AI Law goes further, requiring that notice to individuals include a statement that AI will be used and an explanation of the individuals’ rights.13 These rights would include the right to an explanation of the AI’s decision, the right to contest the decision, the right to information about the participation of a human in the decision, and the right to request correction of discriminatory biases.
Given these trends, we expect that many jurisdictions will pass laws requiring notice to individuals stating at least that the employer uses an artificial intelligence tool and, most likely, the purposes of use, the traits assessed by the tool, and some explanation of the methods used by the tool. Global employers, therefore, will need to check for new AI-specific notice requirements that supplement the general requirements of applicable data protection laws before implementing AI tools for purposes of human resources administration.

Proportionality and Data Protection Impact Assessments

Data protection laws generally require that data controllers process personal data in a proportionate manner by balancing the controller’s interests against risks to the individual.  To reduce these risks, most data protection laws require a formalized data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”) for high-risk forms of data processing.
Due to the potential impact on an individual’s livelihood, using AI to assess applicants or employees most likely requires a DPIA under data protection laws.  However, existing data protection laws can be ambiguous as to whether they require a DPIA because the criteria to determine whether a DPIA is legally required depends on a list of factors. In apparent response to this ambiguity, a growing number of AI laws and proposed legislation would explicitly mandate DPIAs for AI used in the HR context.
In particular, the EU’s upcoming AI law builds on the GDPR by requiring an employer to conduct the GDPR’s DPIA when using an AI system to process personal data to recruit or select employees, to make decisions about hiring, termination, and task allocation, or to monitor and evaluate workers.14 Brazil’s proposed AI Law would take a similar approach.  Like the GDPR, Brazil’s general data protection law, the LGPD, requires DPIAs in certain high-risk scenarios. Brazil’s proposed AI Law classifies the use of AI for selection of candidates and employment as high-risk. Accordingly, the proposed law requires a type of DPIA, as well as detailed documentation regarding the functioning of the system and the decisions involved in its construction, implementation and use.15 In the United States, an early draft of regulations for the California Consumer Privacy Act would require a risk assessment covering almost 50 factors if the employer uses “Automated Decision-Making Technology” to make decisions about applicants, employees, or independent contractors.16
China has taken a particularly protective approach. China’s Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) requires that a personal information handler conduct a personal information protection impact assessment prior to using personal information to conduct automated decision-making and record the handling activities. The PIPL defines “automated decision-making” as the activity of using computer programs to automatically analyze or assess personal behaviors, habits, interests, or hobbies, or financial, health, credit, or other status, and making decisions thereupon. The requirement for such an assessment also applies under other circumstances mentioned under the PIPL, such as handling sensitive personal information or transferring personal information abroad. The assessment must address items including: whether the purposes and methods of the handling are lawful, legitimate, and necessary; the impact on the data subjects’ rights and interests, security risks; and whether the protective measures undertaken are lawful, effective, and appropriate based on the degree of risk.17
Accordingly, before implementing a new AI tool in the workplace, multinational employers should consider whether they must conduct a DPIA. Increasingly, the answer will be “yes,” and the employer should ensure that the DPIA considers the factors prescribed in all relevant jurisdictions.  Even when a DPIA is not legally required, global employers still should consider some type of evaluation of the risks of implementing the AI tool in the HR context. Identifying risks in advance of implementation will allow the company also to consider how to mitigate those risks and whether the mitigation measures reduce the risks to a level that is tolerable for the particular employer.

Cross-border data transfer restrictions

Most data protection laws prohibit the transfer of personal data to another country except in limited circumstances. This poses a hurdle to multinational employers because, if they centralize their HR processes in one office, then handling HR data involves transferring personal data across national borders.  For example, if an employer uses an AI tool that operates on a service provider’s server located in the United States to evaluate applications from applicants in another country, the applicants’ personal data most likely would cross international borders in the process of the AI review. 
Consent Required
Many jurisdictions require consent from the individual for cross-border data transfers.  Depending on the context, obtaining consent can be impractical, but, increasingly, countries permit cross-border data transfers without consent if the sending and receiving legal entities sign data transfer agreements that apply protections equivalent to the origin countries’ data protection laws.
EU, UK, Brazil, and China: Other Mechanisms
Conversely, in China, the EU, the UK, and likely Brazil, employers effectively cannot rely on consent for data transfers, at least in the employment context. The EU offers several options for data transfers, including model data transfer contracts, binding corporate rules, and, with respect to transfers to the United States, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Brazil’s National Authority for Data Protection is in the process of developing standard contractual clauses modules, which will be required for cross-border transfers, as no other country has yet been named as providing adequate data protection and consent can be impractical or risky. China’s current data protection legal framework makes it a burdensome exercise on the part of the personal data exporter to essentially seek government approval by filing a number of materials in order to transfer personal data outside of China.18
The United States is quite unusual in that it does not impose restrictions on transferring personal data to other countries. There are export controls on certain types of technology, but not on personal data per se.
In sum, multinationals that use centralized AI tools or otherwise transfer personal data across national borders may need a compliance strategy involving consent in many countries, as well as intra-company data transfer agreements compliant with multiple laws, and filings with some local governments. If the multinational employer already has implemented a cross-border data transfer strategy for other types of HR related activity, the cross-border transfer of personal data for use in centralized AI tool could be “wrapped into” this broader data transfer solution.

Data-Related Rights

Data protection laws invariably provide some form of data rights.  These include rights applicable to all data processing, as well as rights specific to automated decision-making and other forms of AI.  Global employers need to be aware of these rights, so they can be prepared for rights requests in relation to their use of AI tools.
General Data Rights Relevant to AI
The traditional data rights particularly relevant to AI are the right to know how data is processed, the right to object, the right to delete, and the right to revoke consent, where the company processes personal data on the basis of consent.  For example, in the EEA, employees generally have a right to demand that the employer stop processing their personal data for purposes of monitoring their performance or for surveillance, unless the employer demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.19
Automated Decision-making Rights in Existing Data Protection Laws
In addition, many data protection laws have, for years, included rights specific to automated decision-making.  These typically include rights to object to automated decision-making, to request human intervention, and to receive information about how the automated decision-making works.  For example, the GDPR provides, in effect, a right not to be subject to an employment decision based solely on automated processing.20 The Philippines data protection law grants a right to request information about automated processes that form the sole basis for any decision “significantly affecting” the individual.21 In close parallel, when Chinese individuals consider the automated decision-making to have a significant impact on their interests, they are entitled to request that the data handler explain the situation, and the individual has the right to refuse the use of these automated means.22  
Rights in New AI-Specific Laws
New AI-specific laws have followed these approaches.  In the United States, NYC’s AI Ordinance provides employment candidates or employees the right to obtain information on the data collected, data source, and data retention policy. The ordinance also provides candidates with the right to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.23 Outside the United States, South Korea has amended its data protection law to give individuals a right to reject entirely automated decisions that materially affect the rights of the individual.24  This likely includes many entirely automated decisions about employment.  Further, South Koreans will have a right to obtain an explanation about a decision made through automated means.  Many jurisdictions have proposed similar legislation.
Workers’ Collective Rights, Including Works Councils
Although not precisely a data right, workers’ organizations may have rights to notice or approval about data processing of the employees represented by them.  In particular, in the EU, employees in some countries have a right to create works councils at their employer.25 These works councils have rights to information, consultation with management and depending on the country, the employer may need works councils’ consent to implement new monitoring and technical systems.  This may mean that an employer must provide prior notice to, or reach agreement with, a works council before the employer can start implementing an AI system since otherwise the works council could try to take legal action to block implementation. Further, in many countries, unions may obtain contractual rights, via collective bargaining agreements, to review or approve AI tools in the workplace. Indeed, issues surrounding the use of AI were integral to resolution of disputes between U.S. production companies and both screenwriters and actors.

Data Minimization and Retention

Virtually all comprehensive data protection laws adopt data minimization principles on the front end and the back end of the data life cycle.26  These principles require that data controllers collect only the minimum personal data necessary to achieve the purpose for which the personal data was collected.  Once that purpose has been accomplished, the personal data generally must be permanently deleted subject to any legal obligation to retain the personal data for a longer period.
While these principles can be stated simply, they generally are difficult to apply, in practice, especially in the context of AI tools used for HR administration purposes.  In many circumstances, AI tools function more effectively as the volume of information, including personal data, in the underlying database (a/k/a large learning model) increases.  While the data minimization principle does allow for the data controller to exercise discretion in evaluating the business necessity for collecting personal data, that principle likewise imposes an obligation on data controllers not to over-collect personal data.  Consequently, when evaluating the use of AI tools for HR purposes, employers must carefully consider both the necessity of specific data inputs as well as the relevance to the employer’s business purposes of the AI tool’s outputs. 
After the AI tool has been used to process personal data, employers will have to balance multiple considerations in determining how long to retain both the input personal data and output personal data.  On the side favoring data retention, employers may wish to retain both input and output data to assess the consistency, accuracy, and possibly biases of the AI tool over time.  In addition, retaining this data may help the employer defend itself against claims of disparate impact against minority groups.  
On the side favoring prompt data destruction, retaining the personal data of any one individual longer than needed to assess that individual may violate the proportionality principles in data protection laws.  Also, keeping data generally heightens data security risks simply because the possibility of a security incident increases over time.  Finally, retaining data may increase the cost and administrative burden of responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights to access, correct, or delete personal data maintained about them by the company because the company likely will need to search for data in more storage locations and, with respect to an access request, manage the production of a larger quantity of personal data. 
Moreover, the balance of risks in retaining personal data versus destroying it may vary by jurisdiction. Consequently, the employer may decide to set different retention periods by country or region.
Finally, employers should not lose sight when evaluating whether to use an AI tool in the first place of the potential, practical challenges of permanently purging personal data once the purpose of collection has been accomplished.  For example, many large language models appear to have been built on the premise that personal data may be stored in them indefinitely. Consequently, the practical challenges of removing specific data points from such models may be insurmountable, creating risk for the organization.  While outputs may be easier to isolate and purge, if the employer allows the outputs of AI tools to be proliferated across numerous storage locations (e.g., e-mail, local hard drives, centralized human resources information systems), the practical challenges of purging those outputs could become daunting.  Nonetheless, with some inquiry early in the implementation process and advance planning, employers should be able to mitigate the risks of over-collection and the practical challenges of permanent deletion.

Accuracy

Data protection laws generally impose an obligation to ensure that personal data is accurate and kept up to date where necessary.  As a practical matter, this means that both personal data entering into an AI tool and the personal data output must be accurate.  Regarding input data, ensuring accurate personal data may not pose challenges particular to AI if the employer provides the input data, but some AI tools may provide their own input data, for example, scraping it from publicly available sources.  Employers usually have an obligation to make sure this data is accurate too but effectively have limited means for doing so.  As a result, employers should evaluate the risk that AI tools which process publicly available data may not comply with the accuracy requirement contained in many data protection laws.
Ensuring the accuracy of the output data can be even more difficult because the algorithms and processes used by the AI tool may be hard to understand.  Moreover, to protect their methods from competitors, AI vendors may not provide full information about these algorithms and processes.  Inaccuracy and bias can lead to some of the biggest risks of using AI tools, for example, unlawful discrimination.

Data Security 

With few exceptions, data protection laws require reasonable safeguards for personal data, but generally do not spell out precisely what those safeguards entail.  Typically, data protection laws clarify that safeguards must include: (a) technical measures, e.g., passwords, firewalls, etc.; (b) administrative measures, e.g., policies, procedures, and training; and (c) physical measures, e.g., locked doors, security guards, etc. Beyond this, employers must look to regulatory guidance and industry standards. 
A growing international consensus lays out basic standards, for example, the 27001 cybersecurity standards published by the International Organization for Standardization and the recommended technical and organizational measures for AI systems published by the German Data Protection Commission.  However, authorities emphasize that companies should conduct risk assessments specific to their systems and threats to develop reasonable safeguards for their circumstances.

Contracting 

Finally, employers cannot outsource their responsibilities for compliance with data protection laws.  As the data controller, the employer remains responsible for the personal data of its applicants and workers processed on its behalf by vendors.  This is a key issue for employers because employers typically use AI tools provided by third-party service providers who process personal data on their own servers (“Software as a Service” or “SaaS”) rather than purchasing licensed software and running it on the employer’s own information systems.
Virtually all data protection laws require that the data controller obtain some contractual assurances from these vendors.  At minimum, the contractual assurances include the requirement that the vendor provide reasonable safeguards for the data. Increasingly, data protection laws specify detailed vendor contract provisions. The GDPR’s Article 28, for example requires about a dozen points in data processor contracts, including that the data processor only process personal data on the controller’s documented instructions and impose the same data protection obligations that apply to the vendor on any sub-processor.27  The California Privacy Rights Act requires a similar number of provisions, many of which are quite distinct from the GDPR.28  In addition, as discussed above in the cross-border data transfers section, if the vendor stores personal data in a country, other than where the applicant or employee is located, the employer may be required to include country-specific data transfer provisions in the contract.
Finally, employers should consider including supplemental language to protect their interests. These might include, for example, indemnification provisions, mitigation and reporting provisions for data breaches, and requirements for accurate representations about how the AI works so that the employer can meet its obligations to provide notice. 
Practical Implications and Takeaways
This article provides a checklist of key data protection points to consider in adopting AI tools across multiple countries. Of course, the real challenge is developing a compliance program for AI that works in practice across multiple jurisdictions.  This requires thinking through the data protection implications at each step of the process.  In rough chronological order, this likely will include:

Vendor vetting;
Conducting DPIAs and determining feasible jurisdictions for deployment;
Vendor contracting;
Implementing policies to address risks, such as accuracy, and compliance steps, such as responding to data rights requests;
Distributing notices, obtaining consent, and communicating with the workforce;
Handling requests to exercise data rights; and
Retention and disposal of personal data.

In this process, employers can use the basic data protection framework as a guide and then adapt as needed to local variations.

Nearly half of employees in the United States aren't using artificial intelligence at work, according to a new report, while leadership takes the initiative in utilising the developing tech.
Findings from The Quantum Workplace found that 49% have never used AI to help them with their job. According to the report, 17% said they only used it a ""few times."" Others said:

Daily (8%)
Weekly (12%)
Monthly (9%)
Quarterly (5%)

Usage of AI was mostly focused on higher-level positions, the report noted, which found that directors had the highest number of AI users in the workforce with 41%. For other positions:










Executive (37%)
Manager (23%)
Individual contributor (20%)

Confidence in AI strategy
The findings come as only 25% of employees are confident in their organisation's AI strategy, with leadership more confident than other employees. By position, agreement rates showed:

Executive (29%)
Director (29%)
Manager (20%)
Individual contributor (26%)

""Most employees, including executives, are not confident in their organisation's strategy for implementing new technologies like AI. This is not surprising,"" said lead researcher Shane McFeely in a statement.
Employers have long been encouraged to develop robust frameworks to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI in workplaces.
""Organisations must leverage the competitive benefits of AI while mitigating current and future risks,"" McFeely said.
Offering AI-related training
Despite the relatively low usage of AI in workplaces, the report found that 45% of employees want more training about AI in the workplaces.

This comes as 35% said AI will ""significantly change the nature"" of their job in the next five years.
McFeely agreed that nothing has the potential to impact the workplace more than AI.
""Though adoption is not yet widespread, it is predicted that AI will replace some jobs and make others more productive,"" he said. ""AI has the potential to automate tedious tasks and free employees for critical thinking and creativity.""
The problem with training, however, is that only 16% said their manager encourages the use of AI at work.
""Leaders should foster an open culture of learning and innovation while providing guidelines on strategic AI use,"" McFeely said. ""Because of this, HR needs to be at the forefront of your organisation's AI strategy.""









The Quantum Workplace's findings were sourced from ""one of the largest databases on employee experience"" in the US, which included over 700,000 voices from more than 8,000 organisations.

In this article:Learn why America needs an Artificial Intelligence-ready workforceFind AI learning and workforce training opportunities




America needs an AI-ready workforce. The U.S. government supports thousands of AI learning and training opportunities across the country.




An artificial intelligence (AI)-ready workforce is essential for the United States to fully realize AI’s potential to advance scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security. In 2023, the White House released the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence(link is external) (“AI EO”) to harness the power of AI for good while mitigating its substantial risks. The EO calls for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in coordination with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), to ""establish(link is external) a pilot program to enhance existing successful training programs for scientists, with the goal of training 500 new researchers by 2025 capable of meeting the rising demand for AI talent.”




DOE has been preparing future scientists to be AI research leaders by leveraging decades of sustained R&D investments in high-performance computing (HPC) that have led to significant advances in both fundamental studies and world-leading supercomputing tools. By planting the seeds of curiosity through discovery learning, over the decades, DOE national laboratories have introduced basic AI concepts and skills to hundreds of thousands of students and educators at all levels. Training programs at DOE national laboratories deliver opportunities for best-in-class hands-on research experiences, including through access to leading AI research expertise, world-class supercomputing facilities, and a science-driven approach. These training opportunities complement AI education and training offered through other pathways, such as AI education and training supported by both DOE and NSF at institutions of higher education and various other settings for learning.











The unparalleled research and innovation environment at DOE national laboratories attracts talent from all over the world to strengthen America's AI workforce. DOE will continue its investments in a highly skilled talent pool - encompassing K-12 educators and students, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty and professionals looking to add to their skillsets - to grow and sustain America's AI-ready workforce of tomorrow.




NSF is supporting the development of an AI-ready workforce through the creation of educational tools, materials, fellowships, and curricula to enhance learning and foster training opportunities open to all communities. NSF-funded efforts reach across the country, from K-12 classrooms to experiential learning opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate levels to workforce development efforts in community colleges, building AI skills and understanding at all levels needed to responsibly harness the opportunities of AI for scientific discovery and other critical societal challenges. 











NSF’s AI training and education programs support AI research experiences for undergraduates, seasonal internships, and full-time graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. Through its Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, NSF has built a nationwide ecosystem of advanced computing and data capabilities alongside training programs that empower researchers to use those systems. In addition, NSF supports AI and data science training programs at the regional level, including with community colleges, minority serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities.   




By 2025, the education and workforce opportunities provided by the DOE and NSF pilot program will add to the national AI workforce by training more than 500 new researchers at all career stages in a variety of critical basic research and enabling technology development areas.




DOE, in coordination with NSF, is creating a vibrant training and workforce ecosystem by advancing secure, trustworthy, and equitable AI for all Americans. This web portal highlights a non-exhaustive collection of DOE and NSF AI education, training, and workforce opportunities. This is a part of a larger effort to increase connectivity between government-supported AI learning and training programs and elevate the accessibility of these opportunities to people interested in accruing AI knowledge and skills.

While the age of sentient robot assistants isn't quite here yet, AI is fast making a bid to be your next co-worker. More than half of U.S. workers are now using some form of AI in their jobs. According to an international survey of 5,000 employees by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), around 80 percent of AI users reported that AI had improved their performance at work, largely pointing to increased automation. For some, the ethical integration of AI is the top workplace concern of 2024. But while proponents note how much potential there is for AI technologies to improve and streamline more equitable workplaces — and there's probably examples of AI already at play in your job, as well — that doesn't mean we should all rush to bring AI into our work.

The era of the AI-generated internet is already here



That same OECD survey also documented continued fear of job loss and wage decrease as AI digs its heels deeper into the employment landscape. A different survey of U.S. workers by CNBC and SurveyMonkey reported 42 percent of employees were concerned about AI's impact on their job, skewing higher for those with lower incomes and for workers of color. And with the rise of AI-based scams, ongoing debate over government regulation, and worries about online privacy (not to mention the sheer over-saturation of ""new"" AI releases), there's still a lot of unknowns when it comes to AI's future. It's best to tread into the world of AI at work with a bit of trepidation — or at least with some questions in your back pocket. What kind of AI are we talking about, exactly?First step: Familiarize yourself with artificial intelligence at large. As the term has grown in popular use, ""Artificial Intelligence"" has evolved into a catchall phrase referring more to a variety of technologies and services than a specific noun. Mashable's Cecily Mauran defines artificial intelligence as a ""blanket term for technology that can automate or execute certain tasks designed by a human."" She notes that what many are now referring to as AI is actually something more specific, known as generative AI or artificial general intelligence. Generative AI, Mauran explains, is able to ""create text, images, video, audio, and code based on prompts from a user."" This use has recently come under fire for producing hallucinations (or made up facts), spreading misinformation, and facilitating scams and deep fakes.

4 ways AI can boost your productivity at work



Other forms of AI include simple recommendation algorithms, more complex algorithms known as neural networks, and broader machine learning. As Saira Meuller reports for Mashable, AI has already integrated itself into the workplace (and your life) in a multitude of ways, including Gmail's predictive features, LinkedIn's recommendation system, and Microsoft 's range of Office tools. Things as simple as live transcripts or captions turned on during video meetings rely on AI. You could also encounter it in the form of algorithms that facilitate data gathering, within voice assistants on your personal devices or office software, or even as machine learning that offers spelling suggestions or language translations.Does your company have an AI policy?Once you've established that the AI tool falls outside of a use case already employed in your day-to-day work, and thus might need some further oversight, it's time to reach out to management. Better safe than sorry! Your company will hopefully have guidelines in place for exactly what kind of AI services can be pulled into your work and how they should be used, but there's a high chance it won't — a 2023 survey from The Conference Board found that three-quarters of companies still lacked organizational AI policy. If there are no rules, get clarity from your manager, and potentially even legal or human resources teams, depending on what tech you're using. Only use generative AI tools pre-approved by your place of work. In a global survey of workers by business management platform Salesforce, 28 percent of workers said they were incorporating generative AI tools in their work, but only 30 percent had received any training on using the tool appropriately and ethically. A startling 64 percent of the 7,000 workers reported passing off generative AI work as their own.

Based on the response rate of unsupervised use, the survey team recommended that employees only use company-approved generative AI tools and programs, and that they never use confidential company data or personally identifiable customer data in prompts for generative AI.Even big companies like Apple and Google have banned generative AI use in the past. Things to consider before using a generative AI tool:Data privacy. If you are using generative AI, what kind of information are you plugging into the tool, such as a chatbot or other LLM? Is this information sensitive to individuals you work with or proprietary to your work? Is the data encrypted or protected in any way when it is used by the AI?Copyright issues. If you are using a generative AI system to design creative concepts, where is the tech sourcing the artistic data needed to train its model? Do you have a legal right to use the images, video, or audio the AI generates? Accuracy. Have you fact-checked the information provided by the AI tool or spotted any hallucinations? Does the tech have a reputation for inaccuracy?

Who would the AI serve?It's also important to distinguish where AI fits in your daily work-flow, and who will be interacting with any generative AI outputs. There is a difference between incorporating AI tools like chatbots or assistants within your own daily tasks, and replacing an entire job task with it. Who will be affected by your use of AI, and could it be a risk to you or your clients? The disclosure of AI use is a question even law firms lack clear answers to, but a majority of Americans believe companies should be mandated to do so.Thing to consider:Are you using an AI tool to generate ideas solely for your own brainstorming process?Does your use of AI result in any decision-making for you, your coworkers, or your clients? Is it used to track, monitor, or evaluate employees?Will the AI-generated content be seen by clients or anyone outside of the company? Should that be disclosed to them, and how?Who is in charge of the AI? You've gotten the go-ahead from your company and you understand the type of AI you're using, but now you've got some larger ethical matters to consider. Many AI watchdogs point out that the quick rush to innovate in the field has led to the conglomeration of a few Big Tech players funding and controlling the majority of AI development. AI policy and research institute AI Now points out that this could be a problem when those companies have their own conflicts and controversies. ""Large-scale AI models are still largely controlled by Big Tech firms because of the enormous computing and data resources they require, and also present well-documented concerns around discrimination, privacy and security vulnerabilities, and negative environmental impacts,"" the institute wrote in an April 2023 report. AI Now also notes that a lot of so-called open source generative AI products — a designation that means the source code of a software program is available and free to be used or modified by the public — actually operate more like black boxes, which means that users and third-party developers are blocked from seeing the actual inner workings of the AI and its algorithms. AI Now calls this a conflation of open-source programs with open-access policies.

At the same time, a lack of federal regulation and unclear data privacy policies have prompted worries about unmonitored AI development. Following an executive order on AI from President Joe Biden, several software companies have agreed to submit safety tests for federal oversight before release, part of a push to monitor foreign influence. But standard regulatory guidelines are still in development. So you may want to take into account what line of your work you're in, your company's partnerships (and even its mission statement), and any conflicts of interest that may overlap with using products made by specific AI developers. Things to consider:Who built the AI?Does it source from another company's work or utilize an API, such as OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs)?Does your company have any conflicting business with the AI's owner?Do you know the company's privacy policies and how it stores data given to generative AI tools?Is the AI developer agreeing to any kind of oversight?


Could the AI have any relevant biases?Even the smartest AI's can reflect the inherent biases of their creators, the algorithms they build, and the data they source from. In the same April report, AI Now reports that intentional human oversight often reiterates this trend, rather than preventing it.   ""There is no clear definition of what would constitute 'meaningful' oversight, and research indicates that people presented with the advice of automated tools tend to exhibit automation bias, or deference to automated systems without scrutiny,"" the organization has found. In an article for The Conversation, technology ethics and education researcher Casey Fielder writes that many tech companies are ignoring the social repercussions of AI's utilization in favor of a technological revolution. Rather than a ""technical debt"" — a phrase used in software development to refer to the future costs of rushing solutions and thus releases — AI solutions may come with what she calls an ""ethical debt."" Fielder explains that wariness about AI systems focuses less on bugs and more on its potential to amplify ""harmful biases and stereotypes and students using AI deceptively. We hear about privacy concerns, people being fooled by misinformation, labor exploitation and fears about how quickly human jobs may be replaced, to name a few. These problems are not software glitches. Realizing that a technology reinforces oppression or bias is very different from learning that a button on a website doesn’t work.""Some companies that have automated services using AI systems, like health insurance providers who use algorithms to determine care or coverage for patients, have dealt with both social and legal ramifications. Responding to patient-led lawsuits alleging that the use of an AI system constituted a scam, the federal government clarified that the technology couldn't be used to determine coverage without human oversight. In educational settings, both students and teachers have been accused of utilizing AI in ethically-gray ways, either to plagiarize assignments or to unfairly punish students based on algorithmic biases. These mistakes have professional consequences, as well. ""Just as technical debt can result from limited testing during the development process, ethical debt results from not considering possible negative consequences or societal harm,"" Fielder writes. ""And with ethical debt in particular, the people who incur it are rarely the people who pay for it in the end.""While your workplace might appear to be much lower stakes than a federal health insurance schema or the education of future generations, it still matters what ethical debt you may be taking on when using AI.

At the same time, Klarna says the tool has a similar customer satisfaction score and even resolves errands more efficiently, at two minutes versus the human average of 11 minutes.At the financial level, Klarna anticipates a $40 million profit increase this year with the AI tool performing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents.While Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, said the AI would lead to higher returns for investors and potentially better prices for customers, there are still many looming questions about how such an efficient AI could disrupt the workforce and society as a whole.""We are incredibly excited about this launch, but it also underscores the profound impact on society that AI will have,"" Siemiatkowski said in a statement to Newsweek. ""We want to reemphasize and encourage society and politicians to consider this carefully and believe a considerate, informed and steady stewardship will be critical to navigate through this transformation of our societies.""For Klarna's customers, however, they can now expect a 24/7 customer service operation for all sorts of questions, including refunds, returns and payment issues. The AI tool also features multilingual support for more than 35 languages.Will AI Take Away More Jobs?The biggest question many employees have regarding AI concerns their job security.According to Viputheshwar Sitaraman, a tech consultant for several Fortune 500 companies and a Tedx talk AI speaker, artificial intelligence generally is most effective when it works in conjunction with humans.""AI likely won't eliminate jobs as much as it will entirely change the job description,"" Sitaraman told Newsweek.For engineers, that will mean less code writing and more debugging and deployments. For doctors, the initial diagnosis could come from AI, but the doctor will work with the technology to correlate symptoms with a diagnosis and treatment plans.Lawyers, too, could see immense benefits, likely skipping the process of writing legal documents from scratch and instead revising and building upon the initial AI written contracts. It's already being seen in ChatGPT and Github Copilot today, Sitaraman said.Still, the vast majority of AI tools are not ready to take over the roles of hundreds of human workers without any human correction, he added.""This is why today's 'AI agents' are not yet useful to businesses because they seldom can complete a task without getting stuck or running in circles,"" Sitaraman said, adding they face a range of copyright and IP theft concerns.When it comes to Klarna's AI performing the equivalent of 700 human jobs, Sitaraman is skeptical.""'Bot' customer service tools have been around for a long time, and consumers universally find them frustrating timewasters,"" Sitaraman said.Despite the current problems facing current AI technology, many leaders think the tools available to companies could quickly merge into something far more advanced.""With generative AI, we are only at the start of an irreversible platform change,"" Ryan Valles, the co-founder at tech AI skill platform Interview Kickstart, told Newsweek. ""This is a general purpose technology akin to electricity, and so it will bring about massive changes in both the way we work and our productivity. What we are seeing today is only the beginning.""Valles echoed Sitaraman's perspective that AI will fundamentally change jobs but more so in how workers perform the tasks before them. Those who are reluctant to embrace the new ways of work could likely become less in demand by companies, he added.""Every working professional has a clear choice, to get AI-enabled or to risk being left behind,"" Valles said. ""We increasingly see the world getting polarized between the AI-haves and the AI-have-nots. Disproportionate value is likely to accrue to the AI-haves.""And the changes are coming quicker than some might anticipate. A recent McKinsey report found that 70 percent of companies will adopt at least one type of AI technology by 2030.President Joe Biden expressed his concerns around allowing AI to continue to advance with little oversight in an executive order last October.Biden called AI the ""most consequential technology of our time."" He also said he anticipated Americans would see more developments in technology over the next decade than in the past 50 years.""One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology,"" Biden said. ""And there's no other way around it, in my view. It must be governed.""",,,,,AI has taken over hundreds of jobs,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Tech Boss Fears for Future Of Work As AI Takes On 700 Human Jobs', 'description': 'The CEO of e-commerce site Klarna expressed concerns about how artificial intelligence could impact the future of work as its new AI tool takes on the jobs of 700 humans.', 'thumbnailUrl': ['https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2354710/ai.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;q=88&amp;f=c6f4fab89a1b8a92eff218c6728d5004'], 'uploadDate': '2024-02-27T21:48:27-05:00', 'duration': 'PT0M57S', 'contentUrl': 'https://video.newsweek.com/transcoder/480p/2910/1709087281-8682666-1709088153.m3u8'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OpenAI has seen the future, and it involves imbuing a humanoid robot with the silicon spark of artificial intelligence.The developer of ChatGPT, the generative AI technology that has set the world abuzz, said it's investing in Figure, a California company that makes robots for the workplace. OpenAI and Figure will also join forces to develop AI technology aimed at helping robots ""process and reason from language,"" the companies announced in a news release.  Launched in 2022, Figure is building what it calls ""general purpose humanoids"" that can labor alongside people, as well as do dangerous or unpleasant work. ""There are over 10 million unsafe or undesirable jobs in the U.S. alone, and an aging population will only make it increasingly difficult for companies to scale their workforces,"" the company says on its website.   






Other blue-chip players joining OpenAI to invest in Figure include Jeff Bezos (through Bezos Expeditions, his family office), Intel, Microsoft and Nvidia, with the $675 million venture round announced Thursday valuing the robotics company at $2.6 billion. Figure is one of a growing number of companies developing robots to work in warehouses, factories and other industrial settings. The company announced in January that it had signed a deal with BMW to deploy robots in the German automaker's plants, including the German company's facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

""Our vision at Figure is to bring humanoid robots into commercial operations as soon as possible,"" said Brett Adcock, the startup's founder and CEO, in a statement on its latest funding round. ""This investment, combined with our partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft, ensures that we are well-prepared to bring embodied AI into the world to make a transformative impact on humanity.""

Technology experts and the U.S. public share serious concerns about the future of privacy, job opportunities, politics and democracy, civility and many other aspects of life, according to a new report from Elon University outlining the potential future impact of artificial intelligence.
This report, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence by 2040,” finds both the general public and experts believe enormous upheavals are on the horizon as AI spreads. Many experts go so far as to say that we will have to reimagine what it means to be human and that societies must restructure, reinvent or replace existing institutions and systems. At the same time, they embrace the idea that important benefits will also result from the spread of AI.
This is the first report released by Elon’s expanded Imagining the Digital Future Center under the leadership of Lee Rainie, who joined the university after a 24-year career directing Pew Research Center’s Internet and Technology research. The Center works to discover and broadly share a diverse range of opinions, ideas and original research about the impact of digital change, informing important conversations and policy formation.
The new study combines a national public opinion poll with a canvassing of hundreds of technology experts, the hallmark of the 48 previous research reports produced by Elon in partnership with Pew Research Center since 2004.
“This special two-pronged research into public and elite opinion shows how disruptive many think AI will be to essential dimensions of life,” Rainie said. “Both groups expressed concerns over the future of privacy, wealth inequalities, politics and elections, employment opportunities, the level of civility in society and personal relationships with others. At the same time, there are more hopeful views about AI making life easier, more efficient and safer in some important respects. Virtually everyone agrees this is a pivotal moment for how the future plays out with AI.”
Rainie noted that the rapid development of ChatGPT and other AI tools has raised public awareness and caused considerable worry as well as great optimism about the ways AI tools may make life easier, more efficient and potentially safer.
“This special two-pronged research into public and elite opinion shows how disruptive many think AI will be to essential dimensions of life.”
Lee Rainie
Director, The Imagining the Digital Future Center

The public opinion poll was designed to focus on the expected impact of AI on a variety of dimensions of personal lives and on the structures of society. The separate canvassing of more than 300 technology experts provided an opportunity for technology developers, business and policy leaders, researchers, analysts and academics to contribute essays about the potential coming impact of AI.
Some envision a future when economies and work are overhauled, people have personal digital assistants and diminished skills in making their own choices, when AI-created deepfakes and disinformation create alternate definitions of “truth,” and when there are major advances in medical diagnostics and treatment.

The National Public Opinion Poll
Two-thirds of Americans believe AI may have a negative impact on their personal privacy and more than half believe there will be negative consequences for their employment opportunities, according to the national public opinion poll conducted by the center.
Those are among the findings of a national public opinion survey sponsored by Elon’s Imagining the Digital Future Center and conducted in partnership with the Elon University Poll, and Ipsos, an international marketing research and polling firm.

More than half of Americans expect negative impacts on politics and elections and 40% look for worsening level of civility in society. The most positive outlook is for the impact of AI on healthcare systems and the quality of medical treatment.
There is no prevailing viewpoint about the overall impact of AI. Asked how the increased use of AI will affect people’s daily lives, 31% say it will be equally positive and negative; 29% said it will be more negative than positive; 17% say it will be more positive than negative; and 23% say they don’t know. On a broad question about AI ethics, 31% say it is possible for AI programs to be designed that can consistently make decisions in people’s best interest in complex situations, while the exact same share say that is not possible. Some 38% say they are not sure.

The poll of 1,021 Americans was conducted Oct. 20-22, 2023, and designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of error is +/- 3.2%.
Comparing expert opinions with the general public’s views
When answering a similar set of questions, the experts agreed with the general public that the impact of AI on privacy is the biggest concern. The experts were far more concerned than the public about a growing wealth inequality in society but somewhat less concerned than the public about the impact on employment opportunities.


The 17th “Future of Digital Life” Experts Canvassing
In addition to answering the quantitative questions, the experts wrote thoughtful essay responses in which they described the challenges and opportunities they see in the digital future. Some said we will have to reimagine what it means to be human and that societies must restructure, reinvent or replace existing institutions and systems. They also spelled out their concerns that AI could greatly enfeeble people in the coming years, while at the same time embracing the idea that seemingly miraculous benefits could result from the spread of AI.
A few of the most intriguing ideas from the experts include the following:

A new meaning of life will arise in a “self-actualized economy:” Massive AI-generated economic efficiencies that improve work and the way basic infrastructure performs will be combined with medical and other scientific advances that will fundamentally alter the way people act, connect and care for each other.
There will be a shifting boundary between what’s human and what’s a machine: As AI applications become normalized and ordinary, the things that are considered controversial and dangerous will change from year to year.
Adjunct intelligence will be everywhere: This will dramatically affect individuals’ sense of identity, perception and even consciousness itself.
Personal avatars with “self-sovereign identities” will represent us: Individuals will possess 3D, photo-realistic avatars to carry out tasks for them utilizing their comprehensive personal data.
Digital assistants will have far more influence over their person than their human analogues have over themselves: Engagements with AI provide their creators with intimate insights about users that can be exploited
People will form intimate and meaningful relationships with their bots: Some will focus most of their human affection, desires and attention on digital products.
“Truths will be modified”: The AI-abetted spread of deepfakes, disinformation and post-truth content will broaden, and masses of electronic documents will be modified in hindsight to fit special interests’ points of view.
Shared benefits will transform humanity: The application of AI to achieve long-needed widespread economic change will lead to a more-equitable, sustainable society that relies less on consumption as a driver of productivity and instead evaluates productivity based on “human-flourishing metrics.”
Creativity will be democratized but may also be homogenized: Those with ideas but not much technical skill will have the tools to create and promote their concepts; this could create a monoculture of outputs.
An abundance mindset might replace a scarcity mindset: A sufficient combination of intelligence (via AI), matter (via asteroid mining) and energy (from various clean sources) could provide for effectively unlimited material abundance and enable humanity to overcome much of its reason for struggle.
AI could enable transparency of corporations and governments and expose now-hidden processes: AI systems to aid fact-checking and enable critical inquiry into government and corporate databases might empower citizens and bring suspect or shady practices to light.

“A large share of these global experts and analysts briefly mentioned the great gains they expect, but focused their responses mostly on expressing worries over the potential losses they fear,” said Professor Janna Anderson, founding director of Elon’s Imagining the Internet Center, who has been a co-author of the “Future of Digital Life” reports since they began in 2004. “Their concerns are reflected in the five overall themes we found in our analysis of their responses.”
An analysis of the experts’ responses surfaced five major themes:
Theme 1 – We will have to reimagine what it means to be human
As AI tools integrate into most aspects of life, some experts predict the very definition of a “human,” “person” or “individual” will be changed. Among the issues they addressed: What will happen when we begin to count on AIs as equivalent to – or better than – people? How will we react when technologies assist, educate, and maybe share a laugh with us? Will a human/AI symbiosis emerge into a pleasing partnership? Will AI become part of our consciousness
Theme 2 – Societies must restructure, reinvent or replace entrenched systems
These experts urge that societies fundamentally change long-established institutions and systems – political, economic, social, digital, and physical. They believe there should be major moves toward a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. They also argue that the spread of AI requires new multistakeholder governance from diverse sectors of society.
Theme 3 – Humanity could be greatly enfeebled by AI
A share of these experts focused on the ways people’s uses of AI could diminish human agency and skills. Some worry it will nearly eliminate critical thinking, reading and decision-making abilities and healthy, in-person connectedness, and lead to more mental health problems. Some said they fear the impact of mass unemployment on people’s psyches and behaviors due to a loss of identity, structure and purpose. Some warned these factors combined with a deepening of inequities may prompt violence.
Theme 4 – Don’t fear the tech; people are the problem and the solution
A large share of these experts say their first concern isn’t that AI will “go rogue.” They mostly worry that advanced AI is likely to significantly magnify the dangers already evident today due to people’s uses and abuses of digital tools. They fear a rise in problems tied to extractive capitalism, menacing and manipulative tactics exercised by bad actors, and autocratic governments’ violations of human rights.
Theme 5 – Key benefits from AI will arise
While most of these experts wrote primarily about the challenges of AI, many described likely gains to be seen as AI diffuses through society. They expect that most people will enjoy and benefit from AI’s assistance across all sectors, especially in education, business, research and medicine/health. They expect it will boost innovation and reconfigure and liberate people’s use of time.

Paid Post:JetroAdvertising partnerPublished: 12:00pm, 29 Feb 2024Why you can trust SCMPListen to this article [The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]Japan is offering new opportunities in digital technology, using groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) tools as it seeks to counter the issues of a shrinking workforce arising from an ageing population. For foreign companies, this provides an opportunity to work with domestic partners in this new “industrial revolution” to help transform Japanese society.AI is one of the most important technological developments in modern history. However, to take advantage of it, there is a need for entrepreneurs to bring about breakthrough innovations, companies to provide financial resources and infrastructure, and for government policies that provide the appropriate environment for innovation.Japan provides these three elements. When the nation transformed itself into an economic powerhouse it was driven by the belief that industry and government should work together as partners, rather than viewing each other as adversaries. The country’s breakthroughs in innovation have demonstrated the value of this approach, and Japan continues to be a global leader in major industries.Japanese market is uniqueSega Cheng, co-founder and CEO of iKala, a Taiwan-based firm that helps companies implement AI solutions, sees plenty of reasons for optimism: “The customers in Japan are willing to pay the right price and are seeking long-term relationships with their suppliers,” he says. “This kind of business practice is invaluable for any company seeking to enter the Japanese market.”iKala CEO Sega Cheng says Japanese firms are seeking long-term relationships with foreign companies.With its shrinking workforce, Japan aims to be a leader in demonstrating the benefits of higher productivity made possible by AI. Healthcare, which is facing critical staff shortages – the ageing population requires higher levels of medical care – is seen by industry experts as a key target area.Perceptions of AI in Japan are changing. A survey by the consulting group PwC found that in the spring of 2023, just 10 per cent of respondents said they had used generative AI in applications such as Chat GPT. Just six months later, the number had jumped to 73 per cent. NEC, a Japanese multinational information technology and electronics company, has developed its own enterprise-focused generative AI system called cotomi, with plans for additional versions for specific industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Japanese start-up Preferred Networks is designing customised chips destined for machines that will power generative AI.In the public sector, the city of Yokosuka (in the Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo) became the first municipality in the country to run a trial of ChatGPT for administrative operations last year.Global companies play a key roleGlobal players are also looking at the opportunities in Japan. United States company Nvidia, which has played a major role in the realisation of AI, has announced plans to work with Japanese partners to build an AI tech-related ecosystem in the country. As part of its efforts, Nvidia will establish a research lab and invest in local start-ups. Sakana AI, established in Tokyo by former Google research scientist David Ha and engineer Llion Jones, is engaged in the development of generative AI with telecommunications company NTT, among others. Sakana AI is also a member of the AI Alliance, an international group created by IBM and Meta that has more than 50 companies, universities and scientific organisations to help foster open-software programmes to develop generative AI. The alliance, whose members also include major Japanese organisations including Keio University (one of the country’s oldest research institutions), Sony and the University of Tokyo, aims to improve the capabilities, safety, security and trustworthiness of AI.Saturday

These include plans to introduce a national institute to ensure the safety of AI technologies.Given the potential of generative AI, it is essential for companies to use it not only as a tool to improve operational efficiency and productivity but also to gain a competitive advantage by transforming their products, business models and corporate organisations, according to a report last year on digital promotion in Japan by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.In addition, the leaders of the G7 nations launched the Hiroshima AI Process last year, which aims to create a common vision and goal of safe, secure and trustworthy AI. The group agreed on the International Guiding Principles for AI at the online G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ meeting in December.Leaders of the G7 nations at the Hiroshima AI summit in Japan last year.Japan’s AI initiatives are also built on the concept that no single company or nation can supply all the answers needed in this fast-changing technology. Therefore, key parts of the government’s policies are to work with countries, corporations and entrepreneurs from around the world to bring this new industrial revolution into reality.“Whether in terms of regulation compliance or in terms of research funding, the Japanese government is moving really fast,” Cheng says.Further SupportGovernment support for AI is just a part of its broader initiatives to attract international talent and investment to one of the world’s leading economies. There is a wide range of programmes in place to help firms ease their way into and expand operations in Japan. These include start-up visas, research and development assistance for small and medium-sized companies, and tax credits for businesses. The programmes can be accessed through the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), a government-related organisation that works to promote mutual trade and investments between Japan and the rest of the world. The organisation acts as a one-stop centre to help companies establish or expand their business in Japan.Find out more about Japan’s innovation ecosystem here, and Jetro's business support services here.AdvertisementConversations Advertising partnerThis content has been created under the direction of an advertiser.

Japan is offering new opportunities in digital technology, using groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) tools as it seeks to counter the issues of a shrinking workforce arising from an ageing population. For foreign companies, this provides an opportunity to work with domestic partners in this new “industrial revolution” to help transform Japanese society.
AI is one of the most important technological developments in modern history. However, to take advantage of it, there is a need for entrepreneurs to bring about breakthrough innovations, companies to provide financial resources and infrastructure, and for government policies that provide the appropriate environment for innovation.
Japan provides these three elements. When the nation transformed itself into an economic powerhouse it was driven by the belief that industry and government should work together as partners, rather than viewing each other as adversaries. The country’s breakthroughs in innovation have demonstrated the value of this approach, and Japan continues to be a global leader in major industries.
Japanese market is unique
Sega Cheng, co-founder and CEO of iKala, a Taiwan-based firm that helps companies implement AI solutions, sees plenty of reasons for optimism: “The customers in Japan are willing to pay the right price and are seeking long-term relationships with their suppliers,” he says. “This kind of business practice is invaluable for any company seeking to enter the Japanese market.”

With its shrinking workforce, Japan aims to be a leader in demonstrating the benefits of higher productivity made possible by AI. Healthcare, which is facing critical staff shortages – the ageing population requires higher levels of medical care – is seen by industry experts as a key target area.
Perceptions of AI in Japan are changing. A survey by the consulting group PwC found that in the spring of 2023, just 10 per cent of respondents said they had used generative AI in applications such as Chat GPT. Just six months later, the number had jumped to 73 per cent. NEC, a Japanese multinational information technology and electronics company, has developed its own enterprise-focused generative AI system called cotomi, with plans for additional versions for specific industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Japanese start-up Preferred Networks is designing customised chips destined for machines that will power generative AI.
In the public sector, the city of Yokosuka (in the Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo) became the first municipality in the country to run a trial of ChatGPT for administrative operations last year.
Global companies play a key role
Global players are also looking at the opportunities in Japan. United States company Nvidia, which has played a major role in the realisation of AI, has announced plans to work with Japanese partners to build an AI tech-related ecosystem in the country. As part of its efforts, Nvidia will establish a research lab and invest in local start-ups. Sakana AI, established in Tokyo by former Google research scientist David Ha and engineer Llion Jones, is engaged in the development of generative AI with telecommunications company NTT, among others. Sakana AI is also a member of the AI Alliance, an international group created by IBM and Meta that has more than 50 companies, universities and scientific organisations to help foster open-software programmes to develop generative AI. The alliance, whose members also include major Japanese organisations including Keio University (one of the country’s oldest research institutions), Sony and the University of Tokyo, aims to improve the capabilities, safety, security and trustworthiness of AI.
Japanese government programmes are helping foster an AI environment, working to ensure the nation has the resources required for this digital transformation (known as DX in Japan). These include plans to introduce a national institute to ensure the safety of AI technologies.
Given the potential of generative AI, it is essential for companies to use it not only as a tool to improve operational efficiency and productivity but also to gain a competitive advantage by transforming their products, business models and corporate organisations, according to a report last year on digital promotion in Japan by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
In addition, the leaders of the G7 nations launched the Hiroshima AI Process last year, which aims to create a common vision and goal of safe, secure and trustworthy AI. The group agreed on the International Guiding Principles for AI at the online G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ meeting in December.

Japan’s AI initiatives are also built on the concept that no single company or nation can supply all the answers needed in this fast-changing technology. Therefore, key parts of the government’s policies are to work with countries, corporations and entrepreneurs from around the world to bring this new industrial revolution into reality.
“Whether in terms of regulation compliance or in terms of research funding, the Japanese government is moving really fast,” Cheng says.
Further Support
Government support for AI is just a part of its broader initiatives to attract international talent and investment to one of the world’s leading economies. There is a wide range of programmes in place to help firms ease their way into and expand operations in Japan. These include start-up visas, research and development assistance for small and medium-sized companies, and tax credits for businesses. The programmes can be accessed through the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), a government-related organisation that works to promote mutual trade and investments between Japan and the rest of the world. The organisation acts as a one-stop centre to help companies establish or expand their business in Japan.

Artificial Intelligence 
AI in Australia: 60% of execs rush for adoption but only 35% of employees are guided

Recent research from Slack’s Workforce Lab underscores a significant artificial intelligence (AI) trend that is specific to Australian workplaces. While Australia leads in global AI adoption rates at 35% — matching Japan — a deeper dive into the statistics reveals nuanced challenges, including gaps in leadership guidance and gender disparities in AI trust and usage.
The study was released alongside this week’s Salesforce World Tour in Sydney and included feedback from 1,000 Australian workers out of more than 10,000 respondents worldwide. The study shows that 60% of Australian executives report a high degree of urgency to implement AI. This is 10% higher than the global average.
However, only 35% of Australian employees have received guidance from their leaders when it comes to navigating AI integration. This figure is notably lower than the global average of 43%, highlighting a gap in direct support and communication from leadership.
And this is a problem considering just how many workers are using AI. The report showed that Australian desk workers spend nearly half of their time (47%) on low-value or repetitive tasks. However, 48% express optimism about AI’s potential to alleviate these burdens, suggesting a readiness to embrace AI for more meaningful work.
Having this enthusiasm met with a lack of guidance from leaders is a problem. Talking about its integration is great, but it’s not particularly helpful without any follow-through or guidance from the top. It also poses potential security issues.
A Deloitte survey from September 2023 found that 66% of Australian workers using generative AI in the workplace were doing so secretly. Combining this without instructions or proper implementation from leadership in such a high proportion of Australian businesses is a potential recipe for disaster.
Christina Janzer, head of Slack’s workforce lab and SVP of research & analytics at Salesforce, points out that users are already witnessing productivity gains from AI and automation tools. Yet, the study brings to light the importance of bridging the gap between executive urgency for AI adoption and the practical support provided to employees, as well as addressing the gender disparities in AI trust and usage.
“The findings show the benefits for top executives to be increasing effectiveness and productivity, innovation of products and services, and cost reduction. However, despite this, there is also an evident disparity between the feeling of importance around AI, versus how desk workers feel it’s being integrated into their working roles,” Janzer said.
Gender disparity with AI trust
Separately, further data from Salesforce released this week revealed that generative AI adoption among Australian office professionals stands at 53%. But, while 61% of men report using or experimenting with generative AI at work, only 40% of women do the same.
This disparity extends to trust levels in generative AI, with 70% of men expressing trust compared to just 43% of women.
This data echoes research that Roy Morgan released last year, which showed that 67% of people who believe that AI causes more problems were women.
But as we reported at the time, that isn’t always the case. In fact, despite the continued  — and incredibly valid — conversations around AI bias, some women were more willing to trust AI than human beings.
A 2023 white paper titled Does Artificial Intelligence Help or Hurt Gender Diversity? revealed that women were 30% more likely to complete an application compared to men if AI was involved in the recruitment process.
“Complementary evidence from two surveys suggests that the gender treatment effect is driven by applicants’ perceptions of the relative bias they experience from AI vs human evaluators,” the white paper says.



This data wasn’t just based on a perception of human bias. It also found that human recruiters were more likely to score women “substantially lower” than men when gender-revealing names are attached to job applications.
So when it comes to Australian businesses, it looks like there are two gaping trust gaps that urgently need to be addressed.

Apple cancels EV, to work on generative AI projects

Posted in Cars, International News				 / By Mick Chan				 / February 28 2024 12:40 pm








The Apple Car project is no more, as the company has decided to pivot towards development of artificial intelligence (AI) projects, Bloomberg has reported. 
According to Bloomberg sources, Apple made the announcement internally, to the surprise of the nearly 2,000 staff who had been on the Apple Car project. The decision was announced to Apple staff by chief operating officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, according to sources. 
Many staff from the Apple Car team, known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG, will be moved to the artificial intelligence division led by Apple executive John Giannandrea, and these employees will focus on generative AI projects which are an increasingly key priority for the company, according to the report. 

Also employed under the Apple Car team are ‘several hundred’ hardware engineers and vehicle designers, who will possibly be able to apply for jobs on other teams within Apple. There will be layoffs, Bloomberg wrote, however the number of those involved is unclear at this time. 
            






The Bloomberg report also noted that Apple had recently imagined the Apple Car to be priced around US$100,000 (RM476,100), which is well into luxury car territory. In the United States, the Standard Range variant of Tesla Model S was announced last August to start from US$78,490 (RM373,690). 
Apple executives were however reportedly concerned about the car’s ability to bring the profit margins typically enjoyed by Apple from its products, and its board was concerned that “hundreds of millions” were spent annually on a project that may not see completion. 

Also known as Project Titan, the Apple Car project came to be known as far back as 2015, when a selection of automobile designers were revealed to be on board the project, including Marc Newson who designed the Ford 021C concept, Julian Hönig who was responsible for the Audi RSQ concept, and Aaron Von Minden who penned the BMW Gina concept.
The Apple Car was initially planned to be a fully autonomous, SAE Level 5 vehicle, though this was scaled back a year later in 2016 to use a Level 4 autonomous driving suite, or conditional full automation. 
In January this year, the project was reported to have been delayed yet again, to 2028, and its self-driving capabilities further reduced to “Level 2+”, which is not an official SAE classification, but is understood to be a more advanced version of Level 2.
