Why don’t the teams that work on them get along?by  Kelsey PiperAug 10, 2022, 7:30 AM EDTFacebookLinkArtificial intelligence systems are getting more and more impressive. The people who work on ensuring they have good effects are beset by internal squabbling. Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.There are teams of researchers in academia and at major AI labs these days working on the problem of AI ethics, or the moral concerns raised by AI systems. These efforts tend to be especially focused on data privacy concerns and on what is known as AI bias — AI systems that, using training data with bias often built in, produce racist or sexist results, such as refusing women credit card limits they’d grant a man with identical qualifications.There are also teams of researchers in academia and at some (though fewer) AI labs that are working on the problem of AI alignment. This is the risk that, as our AI systems become more powerful, our oversight methods and training approaches will be more and more meaningless for the task of getting them to do what we actually want. Ultimately, we’ll have handed humanity’s future over to systems with goals and priorities we don’t understand and can no longer influence. Today, that often means that AI ethicists and those in AI alignment are working on similar problems. Improving the understanding of the internal workings of today’s AI systems is one approach to solving AI alignment, and is crucial for understanding when and where models are being misleading or discriminatory. And in some ways, AI alignment is just the problem of AI bias writ (terrifyingly) large: We are assigning more societal decision-making power to systems that we don’t fully understand and can’t always audit, and that lawmakers don’t know nearly well enough to effectively regulate. As impressive as modern artificial intelligence can seem, right now those AI systems are, in a sense, “stupid.” They tend to have very narrow scope and limited computing power. To the extent they can cause harm, they mostly do so either by replicating the harms in the data sets used to train them or through deliberate misuse by bad actors.But AI won’t stay stupid forever, because lots of people are working diligently to make it as smart as possible. Part of what makes current AI systems limited in the dangers they pose is that they don’t have a good model of the world. Yet teams are working to train models that do have a good understanding of the world. The other reason current systems are limited is that they aren’t integrated with the levers of power in our world — but other teams are trying very hard to build AI-powered drones, bombs, factories, and precision manufacturing tools.That dynamic — where we’re pushing ahead to make AI systems smarter and smarter, without really understanding their goals or having a good way to audit or monitor them — sets us up for disaster.And not in the distant future, but as soon as a few decades from now. That’s why it’s crucial to have AI ethics research focused on managing the implications of modern AI, and AI alignment research focused on preparing for powerful future systems.Not just two sides of the same coinSo do these two groups of experts charged with making AI safe actually get along?Hahaha, no. These are two camps, and they’re two camps that sometimes stridently dislike each other. From the perspective of people working on AI ethics, experts focusing on alignment are ignoring real problems we already experience today in favor of obsessing over future problems that might never come to be. Often, the alignment camp doesn’t even know what problems the ethics people are working on. “Some people who work on longterm/AGI-style policy tend to ignore, minimize, or just not consider the immediate problems of AI deployment/harms,” Jack Clark, co-founder of the AI safety research lab Anthropic and former policy director at OpenAI, wrote this weekend.From the perspective of many AI alignment people, however, lots of “ethics” work at top AI labs is basically just glorified public relations, chiefly designed so tech companies can say they’re concerned about ethics and avoid embarrassing PR snafus — but doing nothing to change the big-picture trajectory of AI development. In surveys of AI ethics experts, most say they don’t expect development practices at top companies to change to prioritize moral and societal concerns.(To be clear, many AI alignment people also direct this complaint at others in the alignment camp. Lots of people are working on making AI systems more powerful and more dangerous, with various justifications for how this helps learn how to make them safer. From a more pessimistic perspective, nearly all AI ethics, AI safety, and AI alignment work is really just work on building more powerful AIs — but with better PR.)Many AI ethics researchers, for their part, say they’d love to do more but are stymied by corporate cultures that don’t take them very seriously and don’t treat their work as a key technical priority, as former Google AI ethics researcher Meredith Whittaker noted in a tweet:A healthier AI ecosystemThe AI ethics/AI alignment battle doesn’t have to exist. After all, climate researchers studying the present-day effects of warming don’t tend to bitterly condemn climate researchers studying long-term effects, and researchers working on projecting the worst-case scenarios don’t tend to claim that anyone working on heat waves today is wasting time. You could easily imagine a world where the AI field was similar — and much healthier for it. Why isn’t that the world we’re in? My instinct is that the AI infighting is related to the very limited public understanding of what’s happening with artificial intelligence. When public attention and resources feel scarce, people find wrongheaded projects threatening — after all, those other projects are getting engagement that comes at the expense of their own. Lots of people — even lots of AI researchers — do not take concerns about the safety impacts of their work very seriously. Sometimes leaders dismiss long-term safety concerns out of a sincere conviction that AI will be very good for the world, so the moral thing to do is to speed full ahead on development. Sometimes it’s out of the conviction that AI isn’t going to be transformative at all, at least not in our lifetimes, and so there’s no need for all this fuss.Sometimes, though, it’s out of cynicism — experts know how powerful AI is likely to be, and they don’t want oversight or accountability because they think they’re superior to any institution that would hold them accountable. The public is only dimly aware that experts have serious safety concerns about advanced AI systems, and most people have no idea which projects are priorities for long-term AI alignment success, which are concerns related to AI bias, and what exactly AI ethicists do all day, anyway. Internally, AI ethics people are often siloed and isolated at the organizations where they work, and have to battle just to get their colleagues to take their work seriously. It’s these big-picture gaps with AI as a field that, in my view, drive most of the divides between short-term and long-term AI safety researchers. In a healthy field, there’s plenty of room for people to work on different problems.But in a field struggling to define itself and fearing it’s not positioned to achieve anything at all? Not so much.A version of this story was initially published in the Future Perfect newsletter.

AbstractThis study examined the potential effects of artificial intelligence on Turkish education. A qualitative research approach was employed by posing an open-ended question to academics in order to attain this objective thanks to built-in capabilities for conducting complicated computer operations, cloud-based services, and conciliatory accession for agile network connections. This study emphasizes that Turkey is highly fragmented and consists of various business organizations at both the municipal and regional levels. The two main policy documents produced by the Turkish government suggest that colleges play a strong role in national and regional Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for workforce growth, with substantial consequences for AI adoption strategies. These documents include information on three well-known educational entities: The new oriental workgroups, recurrent neural networks, and classroom clustering. Significant aspects of Turkey’s educational AI growth include a strong private education industry and a growing international interest. The investigation results revealed a decline in the level of understanding regarding the methods of using artificial intelligence, indicating the necessity for additional awareness-raising in Turkey.

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is a machine-based technology that uses algorithms to deliver predictions, diagnoses, suggestions, and evaluations. Recently, the educational community has recognized AI’s potential to facilitate learning in various contexts (Hwang et al., 2020). Scientific and technical advances affect not only the evolution of teaching materials and methods but also education, educational models, and the kinds of educational systems and organizations (Onder, 2002). Little is known at this time regarding the implementation of modern educational technology, the management of instructional technology issues, the utilization of existing educational technology results, the maximization of educational resource applications, and the improvement of educational efficacy through a comprehensive educational reconstruction (Arslan, 2020). Therefore, educational technology research is vital.Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is primarily concerned with the development of computers that perform cognitive tasks, typically associated with human minds, especially learning and problem-solving education for all ages should prepare society for the future and help humans achieve self-fulfillment (Sucu, 2019). In the age of artificial intelligence, education is both difficult and an opportunity (Ocaña-Fernández et al., 2019). New learning channels, including learning management systems based on digital textbooks, tailored learning via big data learning analysis, interactive technologies based on voice recognition and speech synthesis, and chatbots driven by natural language processing (NLP), are being created (Ekin, 2022). The majority of AI technologies have educational and instructional uses. Education is necessary for a person’s complete growth (Sulak, 2021). Theoretically, technology, particularly AI, in contemporary education enhances educational material, transforms educational perspectives, and disrupts old educational paradigms.Given that education is required for advancement in many fields, the real influence of AI on education would be substantial. AIEd applications include responding to student inquiries, presenting questions and offering remarks, and evaluating narrative responses (Dogan and Kubat, 2008). According to Kanejiya (2019), AI will alter schooling in the next 4–5 years. Indian firms are using AI to enhance school quality with notable results. A method of feedback and individualized suggestions offered by an AI platform may be utilized to assist students in correcting past errors based on student data (Dalal et al., 2020).Consequently, children’s performance improves with time. It also addresses the teachers’ failure to offer pupils individualized attention and the discrepancies in student learning rates. Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) approaches to offer instructors feedback. For instance, the platform might assist instructors in optimizing their information delivery and correcting knowledge gaps by identifying areas where pupils lack understanding. By emulating their teaching technique, robotic teaching assistants linked to the cloud may make skilled knowledge practitioners in outlying areas more accessible on their own or in real-time cooperation with human instructors (Faggella-Luby et al., 2017).Government support for research and development (R&D), and innovation efforts is vital. Most wealthy nations, as well as a few emerging nations, are spending extensively on R&D and innovation connected to AI. This article demonstrates how education contributes to Turkey’s growing interest in AI and why universities must play a crucial role in this regard. In addition to traditional pedagogy and learning issues, this study focuses on geopolitics as a factor in technological growth (Ma and Siau, 2018). This paper’s concept is founded on three essential principles: interdependence, interconnection, and contention. The crucial connection within the identified networks is the impact of global governance on global education levels.Recent research, particularly in the United States, has addressed the commercialization and purifying of conventional classrooms, schools, and university lecture halls (Kim and Park, 2017). According to this perspective, educational AI might be seen as a component of a wider learning marketplace based on political principles and prioritizing product creation and consumption as a commercial strategy. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the rise of AI in Turkey is facilitated by many factors, such as the convergence of educational policies and geopolitics and the incorporation of learning activities into the corporate practices of the IT sector (Khare et al., 2018). Government and private sector partnerships might be a rivalry (Waltzman et al., 2020). Their work distinguishes between the broad conceptions of ‘politics’ and ‘polarity’—in this instance, the effort to explain human equality in terms of logical and natural social equality.Study questionsNumerous theories have attempted to explain AI as a controversial topic, and it is frequently portrayed negatively; others may describe it as a convincing boon for businesses; and still, others believe it is a technology that threatens the very existence of the human race because it may be able to control and manipulate man; however, AI has directly or indirectly affected our lifestyle and is shaping the future. This has inspired many scholars to consider the intriguing subject of how far technology may disrupt the education business. As a result, this study investigates the future of higher education if AI is accepted, as well as the preparedness of Turkish education to implement AI applications. The following are some of the most pressing inquiries:

What is the recent situation in education in the light of AI?


What is the most probable future scenario for Academic Instruction in Education in the light of AI?


What are the correct actions and measures that must be undertaken in education to make the most possible benefits of AI?

Justification and objectivesThis study focuses on examining the significance and potential applications of AI in education in Turkey. As far as we know, no scientific mapping of the word in issue has been performed in a study using the knowledge at hand. Therefore, it was decided to do this exploratory work to deliver new results in this area of knowledge, eliminate the gap in the literature related to this discipline, and present the results provided here as a starting point for AI-focused researchers. Consequently, this study focuses on the following objectives:

To determine the performance of scientific production indexed in Web of Science (WoS) on “AI and Education”;


To concretize the scientific evolution of “AI and Education” in WoS;


To determine the most significant issues and authors on “AI and Education” in WoS.

Literature reviewWhen AI studies in education are examined today, knowledge-based and data and logic-based AI and its applications can be seen in almost every field. These include personalized education or dialog education systems, exploratory education, data mining in education, article analysis of students, smart agents, chatbots, education for children with special needs, child-assist bot interaction, AI-based evaluation systems, and automatic test creation systems (Velik, 2012). Note that these fields are mostly related to the support of learning. However, AIEd also supports schools and universities in administrative aspects. For example, curricula, staff programs, exam management, cybersecurity, facility management, and security are areas where AI contributes directly to school management and indirectly to teaching (Holmes et al., 2019). With the investments made and technological developments, AI applications are increasing daily in terms of performance and awareness, while costs decrease day by day. Although these applications sometimes remain in the background of our daily lives, they have been integrated, widespread, and inevitable in terms of their effects (Groff, 2013). And this technology is being used effectively in a wide range of fields, from Siri to digital journalism, from stock movement prediction to crime prediction, and from face recognition to medical diagnostics (Holmes et al., 2019). However, the purpose of this study is to reveal how AI, which has already entered the classroom in different ways, contributes to education and within which applications it is used (Luckin et al., 2016). While many people perceive AIEd as the involvement of “robot teachers,” the reality is a little different than what was predicted. AI can be grouped under three headings in terms of its areas of interest. These are data-based, logic-based, and knowledge-based AI approaches. From the 1980s to the 2000s, educational applications of AI were mostly based on a knowledge-based approach (Long et al., 2020). The research areas are mostly under intelligent education systems in the specified period, consisting of three modules: domain, learner, and pedagogical (Woolf, 1990). In a typical learning management system for that day, the domain module has defined the area to be learned, the learner module has defined the knowledge and learning situation of the learner, and finally, the pedagogical module has defined how the learning materials to present the learner with a pedagogical approach which has an adaptable and interactive interface (Fryer et al., 2019).Intelligent Educational Systems (IES), which can be considered the second generation of computer-aided teaching, are among the most used in AIEd. In general, IESs provide personalized learning environments appropriately and are carried out step by step for each student through well-structured subjects such as medicine, mathematics, or physics (Alkhatlan and Kalita, 2018). Virtual teaching is computer-based teaching systems that have separate databases or knowledge structures for determining teaching content, namely what to teach, and teaching strategies, that is, how to teach, and make inferences based on the student’s mastery of the subject in teaching dynamically (Woolf, 1990). The system determines a step-by-step path for the student, using the relevant learning materials and activities according to the student’s success or mistakes. This path is constantly updated regarding difficulty level, tips, or explanations in line with the feedback and adjusted according to the student’s needs. The aim is to enable the student to learn effectively on the specified subject.The Turkish context of artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence in educationDue to its vast power to modify our thinking, behavior, and interactions, AI-enhanced digital technology has become a crucial component of our everyday life. Since its origin, AI has thrived and expanded, especially with the advent of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning (DL) (Chan and Zary, 2019). Intelligent machines and AI date back to the 14th century (Hrastinski et al., 2019). However, the notion of AIEd has existed for around 25 years, with AI being incorporated into the education sector through several routes and ways (Bayne, 2015; Heffernan and Heffernan, 2014; Humble and Mozelius, 2019; Koedinger and Corbett, 2006). Instructors and students in K-12 and higher education use AI-powered apps and resources, such as intelligent robots and adaptive learning systems. AI technologies enable the implementation of individualized learning to meet the unique needs of each learner (Della Ventura, 2018). Since each person is unique and has various learning styles, talents, and demands, it may be difficult to meet the needs of each student using standard educational practices.However, with AI, instructors may respond to the unique demands of each student (Della Ventura, 2018). Consequently, students may be more engaged, independent, and motivated throughout the learning process (Della Ventura, 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Moreover, AI technologies provide chances to boost student engagement in learning challenges.With the increased usage of AI technologies for teaching and learning, instructors may eliminate time-consuming and repetitive duties and deliver rapid replies to students, promoting adaptive and personalized learning (Chan and Zary, 2019). Specifically, hardware developments, such as high-speed graphics processing units and the availability of software libraries have enhanced AI technologies, particularly with the expansion of deep learning research and data analysis methods. In addition, the future development of education will be intimately linked to the future expansion of AI. Future education will become more innovative and thrive as new technologies, and the computing capacities of intelligent computers continue to grow. AIEd research covers several sub-disciplines. Coledam et al. (2014), for example, provided a formative assessment system for learners that was able to produce and evaluate examinations and track their learning progress. Comparing the results of the suggested system to those manually graded revealed that the strategy was successful for grading exams. Eguchi (2016) presented RoboCupJunior and evaluated its efficacy in fostering youngsters’ STEM content and skill development. Lan et al. (2014) developed a unique method for ML-driven learning analytics based on assessing the subject-matter knowledge of learners. Due to the increasing amount of AIEd research publications, it is essential to define and logically debate important points. As noted before, we encounter news or information about AI almost daily. For instance, news articles such as “AI defeated the world champion in a difficult strategic game” are highly intriguing to fans of digital games. Similarly, for sci-fi fans brought into our life by Hollywood productions, at least one film every term, “The Matrix: Reloaded,” is forthcoming. Followed the news with keen curiosity. Alternatively, the news of “Elon Musk’s new smart vehicle” may be seen on every news channel, even local ones, for the new generation of technology enthusiasts who believe that entirely autonomous—electric automobiles will join our lives and pique the curiosity of almost everyone. Lastly, “education by expert systems tailored to our learning pace and style” is highly exciting news for students and instructors who want to study from home, whenever and whatever they like, without attending school.Analysis of artificial intelligence in the context of education in TurkeyThe unique thing about AI, which is found in the international political and business sense rather than the design and creation of the technologies, is the younger population and much of AI usage in the lessons. Indeed, the fast creation and high adoption of Turkish educational features, such as facial recognition, have drawn international attention rather than simply their novelty. This is why the paper examines how governmental policy affects commercial growth by focusing on various educational technologies in Turkey. A review of the subjects mentioned above offers additional value in breaking new ground, particularly because it highlights some of the common assumptions that go along with discussions about new technology. International AI creation is greatly aided by the Turkish specialist who is best known, not as an isolated initiative, or national undertaking, but rather as an interconnected part of many international actors. Similarly, Anderson et al. (2018) believe that Turkey is at the forefront of AI because highly creative and technologically sophisticated countries lead in foreign affairs. A better grasp of contemporary geopolitics appears to be growing regarding national capabilities for AI growth, which helps reinforce Turkey’s status as the world’s leading economic force. Others recommend that the United States and Turkey return to their status before Turkish AI creation to combat this perceived threat. At present, an Istanbul-based research team has unveiled an AI that can predict global trends, international events and offers automated forecasts for foreign policy choices. Not only is Turkey’s invention of AI seen as a threat to strategic stability, but it is also seen. In recent years, a narrative of a worrying Turkey has seen to develop in the media regarding Turkish technological growth. The stronger inclination to conceive Turkish technology as being very different from Western notions increases the perception of the risk to the perceived problem.Numerous nations engage in advancing AI in light of the advantages supplied by applications of AI. In this approach, the implementation of artificial AIEd is anticipated to grow significantly in the future, with worldwide expenditures reaching $6 billion by 2025 (URL-10). China and the United States spend more than half of the world’s education on AI. SquirrelAI, a China-based AI-supported adaptive education provider, develops and continues to work so that each student may be counted as an AI super instructor.Similarly, US-based McGraw-Hil developed ALEKS, an adaptive AI training software. The AI software dubbed Watson, developed by IBM in the United States was implemented in 2010 and began to be utilized not only in schools but also in many commercial domains. In addition to providing students with tailored learning opportunities, this software enhances efficiency by disclosing each student’s learning potential. Similarly, the UK-based AI initiative “third space learning” allows students to teach online alongside an instructor. This saves time and decreases the instructor’s burden. In addition, owing to the program’s feedback, the learning rates of each student can be assessed, and classes may be tailored to each student’s learning level.Similarly, the UTIFEN software, which was developed with learning in mind, was created using adaptive learning concepts. Adaptive learning systems use AI to customize learning to an individual’s specific features, abilities, or requirements. Additionally, since the software is built for mobile education, it gives instruction whenever and wherever it is needed. Examining the research, it is shown that educational outcomes are higher in situations where instructors are less engaged, i.e., in environments where students study online at their own pace and level using an expanded curriculum (URL-1). Sana Labs, a firm established in Sweden, continues to work on individualized education in school. Unlike other organizations, Sana labs continue to work on various subjects, including mathematics, language teaching, and vocational education, instead of focusing on a single topic. Programs that provide individualized learning use the principle of dividing the material to be learned into discrete chunks. Information to be learned in a mathematics course, for instance, is split into a given number of information points (e.g., 2000–5000–1000, etc.). The software identifies weaknesses in key information points and, based on these shortcomings, offers individualized education programs to enhance pupils’ understanding. When a student regularly offers accurate responses, the next missing information point is relocated to the next missing information point, and the student’s knowledge map is updated to ensure that the teaching is completely realized (URL-13).Considering the work of these nations and organizations, it is possible to predict the future efficacy of AIEd. In this respect, discussing AI research undertaken in Turkey’s education sector would be beneficial. In Turkey, education-related AI applications and training are the subjects of several seminars and conferences. Six times, the Education Industry and Technology Institute hosted a workshop on AIEd. In the sixth workshop’s final report, it was said that “Smart Classroom Behavior Management” might be implemented using image processing technology. Due to this system, pupils’ facial expressions and emotional conditions throughout the session may be identified using classroom-mounted cameras that can collect photos at 30-s intervals. These emotional states of the kids might be studied and communicated to the instructor. Consequently, the instructors indicated that due to this feedback, they could determine which portion of the class the pupils were engaged in and which portion of the lecture failed to capture their attention. This system may benefit instructors in finding the optimal instructional teaching.In the same session, it was suggested that attendance control might be implemented by installing image processing technology at school entrances and exits (URL-7). In addition to workshops, the Ministry of National Education seeks to create AI-based educational tools. In this regard, they cooperated with Istanbul Technical University to promote students’ individual growth by creating individualized instructional material. ITU has also provided instructors with advice services by arranging pieces of training on AI (URL-12). In addition, the Ministry of National Education’s General Directorate of Innovation and Educational Technologies has said that different topics would be produced for schools and instructors to use AI applications in education from the beginning of elementary school. The “Artificial Intelligence Education for Children” project has been established in this context. Under the supervision of Manisa Celal Bayar University, research has been planned to give pupils AI training. In addition, it was said that within this project’s scope, several applications would be developed via various games and visualizations, and manuals on AI would be compiled. The Cambridge Professional Education Academy from England, CCS and Pobalscoil Neasain school from Ireland, and IBM Watson will assist the initiative, which has been revealed (URL-5).Artificial intelligence and Learner EvaluationIn sports research, mathematics, and computer science, there is a growing consensus that self-learning algorithms for performance analysis offer exciting applications. Typical applications of these algorithms include research examining the actions of athletes in golf, baseball, soccer, and basketball. Furthermore, it has been shown that self-learning algorithm maps are successful. These examples demonstrate the clear use of AI in developing monitoring systems, including categorization algorithms for real-time analysis and feedback output in each sport. For measuring a student’s physical activity performance, an AI-based learner evaluation might prioritize pattern recognition methods (Chen et al., 2020). Sensors attached to the learner’s body and exercise equipment can collect data from which significant characteristics for each physical activity can be deduced, enabling evaluation of measured physical activity and additional characteristics based on a general pattern recognition methodology incorporating automatic classification algorithms.Unique systems using cutting-edge information and communication technology and sophisticated control techniques enable the quick gathering, transmission, storage, and analysis of sensor data acquired from physical activity. The data collected by these sensors is utilized to develop intelligent procedures based on current machine learning techniques, enabling the independent evaluation of pupils’ motor skills and providing useful feedback (Munir et al., 2022). With the evolution of measuring technologies, the integration of sensors into equipment and instruments is growing. This data might be utilized to automate the analysis of physical activity using machine learning and sophisticated algorithms.Closely monitoring children’s physical activity is enabled by a self-learning system that employs pattern analysis for various school sports activities. Feedback based on objective data enables students to increase their physical activity while avoiding damage (Chiu and Tseng, 2021). In addition, by objectively measuring the physical potential of young athletes, these AI-based evaluations and measures may aid in identifying and selecting talent.Artificial Intelligence Policy of TurkeyTurkey has launched a national AI plan in recent years, garnering international interest. The study document is regularly recognized in the media, particularly geopolitically and commercially, as the primary catalyst for Turkey’s AI advancement. This year, Turkey hopes to become a global innovation powerhouse by being the center of AI. The business strategy’s fundamental objective is to reduce interdependencies and reliance on external technologies to attain AI autonomy (Orman and Sebetci, 2022).Education status within Turkish policy and educational institutions and activities has been accorded a far lower priority, and fewer resources have been allocated to it. Despite many references to the need for foundational training in The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for AI Growth, Turkey’s use of AI is fundamentally dependent on an education system geared toward developing particularly AI. A 2019 action plan supports the focus on AI in Turkey’s strategy for AI Colleges and Universities, which aims to accelerate the use of artistic and creative intelligence in teaching, encourage the training of talent models, strengthen educational governance, and create an artificial networked and lifelong structure. The political platform includes three primary objectives that must be prioritized. The scope of university infrastructures and curricula by 2020, elevating AI research and development to a national priority by 2025 and making Turkey a world-renowned AI destination by 2030, seems particularly important to AI’s overall growth, given the private sector’s specific preference for entrepreneurship and disruption. AI has the potential to be incorporated into both schools and universities. Such organizations are tasked with expanding their support for the study, creating new knowledge, and staff training. All educational institutions are increasingly related to an AI-infused economy, not just in terms of research and growth but also in training certifications, new and innovative initiatives, and the competencies of the future generation. The initiative to enhance the nation’s AI training systems for entrepreneurship, plus construction, education, and cultural interchange’ is more concentrated. We believe that this integrated creativity and education will inspire the future generation of artificial bits of intelligence. The goal of promoting AI as a core subject for all universities and colleges and the designation of the best AI program in Turkey as “first-level” are particularly important. This can be viewed as an endeavor by Turkey’s educators to include AI in more advanced disciplines such as computer science and statistics. Turkish institutions are rising to the challenge by announcing over 50 new AI-related programs. The degree program includes the purpose of defining subjects, often known as “TUBAI” (Cifci, 2021): merging disciplines to focus on an applied field while incorporating “mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, sociology, and psychology.” In addition, the policy advocates a “universal education” that combines training and development possibilities with existing education techniques. The Turkish Research and Technology Foundation (2020) stated at a recent policy conference that developing its own “natural AI capabilities” and getting a ranking of Turkey’s current purpose is “to develop the world’s best natural talent”.In addition, many Turkish nationals who conduct AI research abroad tend to work on development teams. While the Turkish government has recognized national and numerous local “talent programs” schemes to attract AI researchers to the country, it has also supported numerous programs to cultivate Turkish researchers at the local level (Tamer and Övgün, 2020). Incentives, such as “The 10,000 Talents Initiative,” provide academics with substantial incentives to return to Turkey.Innovations in Artificial intelligence and educationIntelligent schooling methodsBefore discussing smart instructional systems, it is important to discuss computer-assisted education, which may be considered an earlier step in the evolution of AI. In terms of applications, we might argue that the 1960s and 1970s were the golden periods of BDI. PLATO, developed by the University of Illinois, is among the most well-known instances of CDI during this period. While accessing the university’s conventional course materials, thousands of students were provided with interactive course materials. This system, created in the 1970s, included relatively new educational technology capabilities, such as user forms, e-mails, instant messaging, remote desktop connections, and multiplayer games, which are still developed efficiently today. Nonetheless, the instructional material and the operation were identical for each student. In other words, he assumed that all students were at the same academic level.In addition, this prompted John Self and William Clancey to work on new strategies for adapting CBL methods to match the unique requirements of each student and for using AI techniques. In his dissertation, Ph.D. student Jaime Carbonell proposed the scholar system, perhaps the first use of intelligent instructional systems. This marked the beginning of the next phase of the project. Intelligent Instructional Systems, regarded as the second generation of computer-assisted instruction, is one of the most popular uses of artificial intelligence in education. Through well-structured disciplines such as medicine, mathematics, and physics, EOSs create tailored learning environments that are suitable and sequential for each student. According to Murray, LESs are computer-based instructional systems with distinct databases or knowledge structures for instructional material (stating what is to be taught) and teaching methodologies, drawing inferences based on the student’s topic competence to give dynamic education. Here, the system generates a step-by-step route for the student, employing the appropriate learning materials and activities based on the student’s successes and failures. This route is continuously updated regarding difficulty level, clues, and explanations based on student input and customized to meet their specific requirements. The objective is to facilitate the student’s mastery of the topic at hand.Variations were expanding a radically new perspective and dimension. The emphasis of the study is precisely on thinking outside the box to add additional previously undiscovered dimensions (Cifci, 2021). It emphasized problem-solving abilities. The cognitive components involve understanding rules, methods, and concepts in terms of problem-solving. Social work students graduating this year participated in a “critical reflection” assignment that utilized a “deep learning” method. Regardless of how they accomplished this, their talent has mostly gone unappreciated in an environment where high curriculum achievement expectations. Teachers are hesitant to assist other teachers in the learning process due to content and evaluation concerns. Bouanna and colleagues (2020) evaluated student data and categorized strategies for keeping them in school. Bayesian Network Classifiers: The J48, Random Forest, and WEKA algorithms were utilized. Sheikh (2020) states that the student dataset has the greatest impact on a continuous assessment in the final semester. The classifiers displayed a substantial advantage over random forests in terms of accuracy and error rates. It was questioned if it is possible to predict the final grade based on forum participation and examined whether the suggested classification technique achieves the same level of accuracy as other traditional classifiers (Ryu and Han, 2017).In contrast to the idea that the Turkish government is attempting to centralize AI development for political reasons, the article describes Turkish policy as hands-off, enabling the private sector to flourish. On the one hand, Turkish AI enterprises have performed rather well on the global stage in terms of product development. On the other side, they have garnered attention for their quick expansion in commercial sectors, such as government use. According to several assessments, it is the most valuable AI startup globally (Ali et al., 2019).MethodologyDataset descriptionThe dataset was collected from two different sources: Istinye University and Yildiz Technical University. There were 7950 records with 10 attributes.We acquired data by using two methods: the first is interviews and focus groups, including speaking with subjects face-to-face on a particular problem or topic. Interviews are normally conducted one-on-one, but focus groups often consist of many people. Both methods may be used to gather qualitative and quantitative data. The data collecting processes are shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Methods of data collecting in qualitative research.Full size imageBy recording student and instructor perspectives on the AI learning process throughout the course of a protracted educational program, AI systems may give students and instructors useful feedback. In addition, the data are used in an ML environment to improve the user experience, which is measured by the length of time people spend interacting with the system. Student interactions with systems throughout the contact process are now included in creating and updating recommendations. As learning tools provided by AI automate procedures and instructors give direct assistance to students in person, teaching will become simpler. AI is seen as a “neutral” tool for the trial-and-error learning technique.We gathered input from students in the target group through interviews and focus groups. Observing their real-time data with our product and documenting their reactions and replies to questions may give important information on which product features to pursue.The second method is surveying which are physical or digital surveys that gather qualitative and quantitative data from students. After that, we chose to run a survey to get feedback from attendees. This gave insight into what attendees liked, what they wished was different, and areas where we improved our research.Data mining in educationThe conventional approach to data analysis is hypothesis-driven, which means it starts with a query and then analyzes the data to find answers (see Fig. 2). First, it can start by knowing the subject’s interests. On the other hand, the question-driven process is valuable in detecting the information when variables are justifiable, but complicated details participate.Fig. 2Main architecture of the proposed system.Full size imageInstead of using standard data analysis, data mining methods analyze previously unknown trends to discover destination relevance and profitability. Data mining is a means of acquiring data, as well as an analytical method for finding models. As of this time, the principles and techniques of data mining are the cutting edges in the database, and as new database technologies emerge, the technology is experiencing a golden age. These are considered valuable uses of data mining techniques as defined in Fig. 3.Fig. 3The architecture process – systematic creation of a system.Full size imageComputer-based educationComputer-based education (CBE) uses computers to teach students the use of computers in education. CBE systems were the first independent applications that ran on a local computer without using AI to address student modeling, flexibility, and personalization. With the broad use of the Internet, new web-based educational systems, including e-learning systems, have evolved. In addition, the expanding usage of AI technologies has spurred the development of innovative adaptive and intelligent educational systems. Numerous prominent CBE systems, such as ITS, a learning management system (Romero et al., 2008), an adaptive hypermedia and multimedia system, and a test and quiz system, are also AIEd systems; hence, there are parallels between CBE and AIEd.Deep learning and recurrent neural networkSeveral learning algorithms have been applied to the spectrum of neural networks in light of the increasing development. Neural networks imitate the operation. A categorization system that employs parallel processing, for instance, utilizes deductions based on deduction rather than experience, similar to the human brain. There are several approaches to discovering neural networks, all too complex for the human mind to comprehend. Cooperation between nodes varies, such as between direct and reverse cooperation. As humans do, these nodes were linked like neurons are, enabling them to communicate information through dendrites and axons. Recurrent neural networks control the information flow in neural networks.Figure 3 shows how the proposed architecture works.Deep learning (DL), which has recently made state-of-the-art progress in advanced science engineering and medical diagnoses, has shown significant potential in text mining and education. DL has become popular in several fields, mainly in processing information, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and control system, and is also widely in classification and segmentation. As a result, DL will not function if there is explicit text included. The DL has shown great results so far. Education researchers have been attempting to extract relevant information from large datasets for many years for a successful mapping of knowledge to predictions that increases the value of the deep learning system (Kim et al., 2020; Tezci, 2009).Due to the recent proliferation of neural networks, several learning algorithms have been applied to the spectrum of neural networks. Neural networks mimic the workings. For example, a classification that uses parallel processing uses deductions based on deduction rather than experience, like the human brain. Neural networks can be found in many ways, all too difficult for the human mind to understand. The cooperation of nodes varies, such as between straightforward and backward cooperation (sequential or convolution) (Lee, 2019). These nodes were interconnected as the neurons would, thereby allowing them to share information as we do through dendrites and axons (Chavlis and Poirazi, 2021). Recurrent neural networks manage the flow of information in the neural networks. Recurrent Neural Networks are related to the tasks such as long-term learning and multi-input transformations that must be held up for a long time while the network is learning and mathematically repeated for computational purposes. This diagram illustrates the Recurrent Neural Networks, which compute a sequence of hidden vectors by feeding a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The system how Machine Learning is enhancing the Future of Education.Full size imageLearner, instructor, and educational work are used to describe AI-based education. AI helps students gather data, evaluate the fundamentals, and visualize, allowing them to devote more time to high-level physical activities, practical and virtual experiences, and educator–student interactions. AI facilitates instructors’ decision-making by providing real-time updates on class status and proposing various solutions to learners’ challenges. It also supports instructors with assessment and efficiently learning management. AI assists instructors by lowering the time they spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to enhancing the quality of work and learning.Educational data mining (EDM) analyzes several forms of educational data using statistical, machine learning, and data mining approach. It focuses on developing tools for evaluating unique educational data to understand how students learn and discover the circumstances in which they obtain superior learning outcomes and a deeper understanding of educational phenomena. There are two forms of EDM research: statistics and visualization and web mining using clustering, classification, association rule mining, and text mining technologies. Concerning the study of models, a method prevalent in cognitive modeling and bioinformatics research but unusual in education research, new kinds of EDM studies would emerge. Thus, EDM approaches may impact education and its significant transdisciplinary sectors, such as AIEd. Numerous universities and other educational institutions have already adopted a variety of AIEd-driven applications, many of which integrate AIEd and EDM techniques to “track” students’ behaviors, such as identifying students at risk of dropping out in order to provide timely support by analyzing data regarding class attendance and assignment submission.Experiments evaluationThe classification was conducted using deep learning. The neural model and the Adam algorithm were implemented sequentially. With this formulation, the loss function was binary cross-entropy. The first two rectification layers began with the use of the activation function. The activation feature was chosen to be sigmoid in the output layer (Zheng et al., 2022). It took 24 neural cells and nine input (variables) to build the first level. The secret units had eight neurons, and the resulting class predicted value had one element. The TensorFlow machine learning library was used to deploy the implementation. The sample set was set at 70–30%; additionally, classifications were carried out in various ways. The table provides a detailed comparison of all of the various approaches. Ten generations of the artificial immune classifiers were performed using the Adaboost Algorithm, cross-generation classifier was used. For this application, it was required that the number of epochs was 300, and the batch size was 28. Parameters may be set to 256, while classifiers like deep learning, achieved a high level of accuracy.As seen in Table 1, the Ensemble model in education was achieved overall with an average of 0.93 precision, 0.95 accuracy, 0.94 F1-score, and 0.24 Kapa statistics.Table 1 Comparison of diff methods.Full size tableThe ultimate conclusion we reached on the current status of Academic Instruction in Education in light of AI developments tends to confirm that there is total satisfaction with what technology has achieved and trust in its possibilities. Moreover, most faculty members have a positive view of technological progress. The final expert judgment on the second study question indicates that the most likely future scenario for Academic Instruction in Education in light of AI breakthroughs is the optimistic scenario. The experts noted that AI tools could actively contribute to a variety of academic aspects, such as improving academic education and students’ learning, promoting academic guidance, enhancing the student assessment and scoring process, activating university and student activities, enhancing programs and quality assurance, providing virtual reality learning, providing additional student support, and making error-based learning less frustrating. Experts recommend equipping faculty members to implement AI products effectively via training courses, conferences, seminars, and internships so that education may get the possible benefits from AI developments. In Fig. 5, distributions of internal assessment percentage of the students concerning results are shown as seen two types of pf uncertainty are studied and illustrated.Fig. 5Distributions of internal assessment percentage of the students concerning results.Full size imageClassifier evaluation techniques metricsThe device’s performance is calculated based on AUC precision, precision, recall, and F1 accuracy. The evaluation metrics are shown mathematically below. Instances of breast cancer that have been successfully detected are referred to as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), mistakenly identified as Breast cancer, False Positive (FP), incorrectly identified as pneumonia or frequent cases, and incorrectly identified as False Negative (FN). Evaluation metrics used in health check systems.Different performance metrics are often used to investigate different models’ performance, such as specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity (Table 2).Table 2 Metrics used for evaluation.Full size tableConclusionFinally, Turkey’s AI strategy is distinguished by the contrast between a statist and a market-based approach; tensions of this sort define and legitimize the educational space. As policy discussions have shown, institutions are crucial in both pieces of research and in producing new generations of technology specialists to maintain an economy focused on AI. Governments around the country or especially in the United States, fund AI initiatives, institutions, and the private sector, all of which follow set pathways. AI policies should be seen in the context of Turkey’s recent history with the government, science, and technology since they are a new concept. However, throughout this period, there is a major interaction between private and governmental groups seeking expansion.Furthermore, in the lack of enabling government regulation, privately owned schools have devised creative approaches to incorporating AI into their non-new education sectors. Claims for ostensibly advanced AI applications focus on a pedagogical commercial growth strategy rather than any specific educational goal. AI development influences the Turkish educational system on two fronts: national and regional governments, who want to make educational institutions more strategic and concerned with the private sector’s bottom line. Higher education research contributes to the advancement of educational research. This method improves the company’s ability to track students’ development. This method also benefits the educational system. Using the experiment, we were able to estimate the candidate’s internal properties precisely. As a result, candidates who score badly on internal assessments will be able to dedicate more time to complete their final exams. Students with a bad academic record are likely to fail. While the predictive model may be used to identify candidates, who are likely to fail, it may also help them, and their parents estimate how well they will perform on exams.AI technology has been proved to assist students by making some learning tasks easier. Language translation in real-time, for example, makes information more accessible to students all across the world. It also aids understanding in students learning a second language. AI can increase efficiency, personalization, and streamline administrative tasks, giving instructors more time and freedom to give understanding and adaptability—human characteristics that robots lack. We have implemented AI techniques on the data gathered from schools and study with the data showing that AI has a promising future in the Turkish educational system.

","{'headline': 'The future of education utilizing artificial intelligence in Turkey', 'description': 'This study examined the potential effects of artificial intelligence on Turkish education. A qualitative research approach was employed by posing an open-ended question to academics in order to attain this objective thanks to built-in capabilities for conducting complicated computer operations, cloud-based services, and conciliatory accession for agile network connections. This study emphasizes that Turkey is highly fragmented and consists of various business organizations at both the municipal and regional levels. The two main policy documents produced by the Turkish government suggest that colleges play a strong role in national and regional Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for workforce growth, with substantial consequences for AI adoption strategies. These documents include information on three well-known educational entities: The new oriental workgroups, recurrent neural networks, and classroom clustering. Significant aspects of Turkey’s educational AI growth include a strong private education industry and a growing international interest. The investigation results revealed a decline in the level of understanding regarding the methods of using artificial intelligence, indicating the necessity for additional awareness-raising in Turkey.', 'datePublished': '2022-08-11T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2022-08-11T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '10', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01284-4', 'keywords': ['Cultural and media studies', 'Education', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-022-01284-4/MediaObjects/41599_2022_1284_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-022-01284-4/MediaObjects/41599_2022_1284_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-022-01284-4/MediaObjects/41599_2022_1284_Fig3_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-022-01284-4/MediaObjects/41599_2022_1284_Fig4_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-022-01284-4/MediaObjects/41599_2022_1284_Fig5_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Humanities and Social Sciences Communications', 'issn': ['2662-9992'], 'volumeNumber': '9', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Palgrave Macmillan UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Mustafa İçen', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3289-6097', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Yildiz Technical University', 'address': {'name': 'Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'micen@yildiz.edu.tr', '@type': 'Person'}], 'isAccessibleForFree': True, '@type': 'ScholarlyArticle'}",https://schema.org,WebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Using AI for business is becoming increasingly prevalent in the enterprise world, and it’s being used for many different operations and tasks. However, it has the biggest impact when used to increase business productivity.




The current generation of artificial intelligence, which is heavily supported by big data and machine learning platforms, is starting to worm its way into the average workplace. When implemented effectively, it has the potential to reduce operational costs, improve output and productivity, and boost employee satisfaction by taking over many rote and undesirable tasks.
Gartner reports that enterprise use of AI has grown over 270% during the past four years. The technology is used for many purposes, from marketing and consumer research to employee experience and staff recruitment. And yet, business productivity stands to benefit the most from its adoption.
Here are the top six reasons why.
1. Predictive Sales
With the help of AI, businesses can focus on leads with the greatest potential for success. How?
In practice, the idea is simple, but it requires the support of advanced algorithms and AI-powered solutions to sift through massive datasets. It’s no secret the average business is amassing huge stores of customer and behavioral data. Putting this information to use can mean the difference between a competitive edge and continued failures.
AI can be used to identify patterns and trends within this data, as well as for image and object recognition, all of which can be used to recognize customers who would be more willing to support the business and its products or services. Imagine knowing whether or not a customer will pull the trigger and buy before they even visit a store or online storefront.Advertisements




The systems analyze customer and market data, historical sales details, common behavioral patterns, and so on. Then, they build customer profiles that help predict, with great accuracy, what a client or consumer might do going forward. (Read also: How AR/VR Will Up the Sales Game.)
2. Reviewing and Extracting Information
A rote and undesirable side of any business involves poring over hundreds of documents, papers, and statistics to create valuable insights. In the past, for example, a business would have to collect, analyze, and notate customer invoices to find popular products.
That’s no longer necessary, as digital reporting systems present this information faster and more effectively. But AI and machine learning tools are the next steps in that evolution. They can unlock hidden insights within that digital content by reviewing and extracting critical information that the human eye might have glossed over.
Simply put, AI can be used to collect information from documents to reduce review times and improve operational efficiencies by informing future decisions and events. The technology is already being put to good use in the legal and management industries to aid in contract intelligence.
As a process, it automates the extraction of relevant information that’s often buried in documents. The result is a more effective review and deployment process with a greater quantity of actionable insights to leverage.
Through an automated document review application that Deloitte developed, one team was able to increase the scope of their contract review process by up to 150,000 documents.
3. Leveraging Smart Chatbots
Customer service solutions require a lot of back-and-forth between agents and customers, especially in the initial stages. AI, or more specifically, smart chatbots, can be deployed to handle many of those low-level communication steps, which takes the stress away from employees.
Chatbots can collect names, account details, and basic information about the problems customers are having. If the chatbot cannot provide direct assistance, that information is then relayed to a human rep, who can take over from there.
AI can also be used to create always-on support solutions that tackle simple tasks and problems after hours. A customer might need help finding a support document or tutorial, for example, and the chatbot can direct them appropriately.
Babylon Health has implemented chatbots seamlessly, using them to collect basic patient information and health symptoms, and then compare that against a database. Afterward, patients are given some information on the next steps they should take, as well as potential causes to their problems.
If the discussion needs to escalate, the chatbot will connect patients to on-call doctors and physicians. (Read also: Top 20 AI Use Cases: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.)
4. Implementing AI Tools
Offering general support through AI tools can boost employee satisfaction, which leads to higher productivity. Automation can be used to replace rote and what would otherwise be considered unproductive tasks, for example, allowing workers to spend time doing what they enjoy more.
These same AI tools can also be leveraged in many unique ways to improve the employee experience. When enmeshed with the internal culture, they can improve employee buy-in and enhance the day-to-day for workers. AI can even be utilized before an employee is hired, by implementing tools that help with the recruitment process.
One tool might recognize when an employee goes above and beyond, for instance, and flag them for a promotion or award. Another might ingest customer reviews to find employees that have been mentioned, by name, consistently.
5. Automated Call Management
AI can also be used for call management to direct calls to the right people. There’s almost no reason to have your workers sitting by the phone waiting for communications to come in.
A forward-facing system can do that, similar to chatbots, to collect basic information from clients and customers and then direct them to the appropriate department or professionals. In fact, this is one of the best examples of automating repetitive work.
It benefits your call service teams, as well, freeing them up to work with elevated concerns, as opposed to answering every call that comes in regardless of priority.
6. Real-Time Operations
Traditionally, it would take time to assess and extract insights from incoming data, especially customer reports. In the past, you would have a team dedicated to doing this, who would review invoices, sales information, and much more. When they did come up with something, it would be essentially delayed.
AI and machine learning can be used to do this much faster, and almost instantly in many cases. The data flowing in is constantly being analyzed and processed to create real-time insights and inform direct action, or creating alerts about suspicious activity or implementing cybersecurity measures. It does this without the same prejudices a human may consciously or unconsciously hold that influence decision-making, although machine bias is a problem that has been recognized and needs to be combatted.
This significantly improves business productivity by allowing you to pivot and make decisions based on contextual and performance data almost instantly. AI for IT operations, or AIOps as it’s called, can help security teams identify and react to events faster than ever. (Read also: MLOps: The Key to Success in AI Enterprise.)
Imagine this same method for dealing with supply chain issues, product and inventory shortages, customer sentiment, dealing with social media posts and strategies and much more.
AI is the Future of Business
AI has a lot to offer the business world. And there are many benefits to go along with its adoption, from more accurate, real-time operations to improved employee satisfaction and better customer service opportunities.
What’s more, the technology will only get better from here on out as more companies realize its potential and unlock new use cases.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in fleet management drastically improves how transportation businesses operate. Combined with machine learning, AI bases data on driver learning behaviors, making tailored predictions. Barrett Young, SVP, Marketing at Netradyne, shares how fleets harness the technology to improve and automate decisions, increase vehicle and driver safety, and reduce vehicle downtime.
Transportation businesses have begun to reap the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate risk in the cab and on the road, better manage costs, and improve overall compliance. The main applications of AI that help power fleet operations are the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Predictive Analytics, and Computer Vision-based automated communication.      
The use of this technology creates safer roads, improves safety culture, and modernizes the trucking industry. The data provided by AI solutions help fleet managers make streamlined decisions to improve driver safety while tracking costs and tracking fleet operations.

Prioritizing Driver and Vehicle Safety  
With an AI-powered fleet safety system in place, fleets detect risky driving behavior and common compliance violations, such as speeding, distracted driving, driver fatigue, and more. This data gives fleet managers insight into drivers’ performance and track where a driver needs to improve or be rewarded.   
Examples of risky driving behavior that are recognized by video safety systems are:




Distracted driving
Following distance to other vehicles  
Hard braking
Speeding



Fleet managers cannot accurately assess a driver’s skill without a reliable safety system giving real-time insight to identify risks. But AI-powered video safety systems learn to detect risky driving behaviors and alert drivers in real-time to make necessary corrections. In addition to alerting drivers when a correction needs to be made, the AI-powered dash cam will also reward a driver for practicing safe driving. This creates a needed balanced safety culture.     
In-cab audio alerts notify drivers to correct dangerous driving behavior and warn of potential accidents in real-time. For example, if a driver is following too close to a vehicle, the driver will be immediately notified and can correct their driving at that moment. There is no need for a fleet manager to review the video at a later time and call the driver into their office. Making it easier to communicate with a driver and track a vehicle’s usage improves a trucking business’s proof of liability and workflow.
Fleet managers need to be able to access reliable data quickly to combat insurance claims, maintain driver compliance, and support drivers when an accident occurs. Machine learning sorts through large quantities of data, so drivers and managers know the impact and cause of an event. Also, ML-based dash cams learn from drivers’ behavior and predict risks around the vehicle by identifying and monitoring road signs, following distance, pedestrians, and other outside influences. 
Improved Vehicle Maintenance Tracking  
AI-based technology utilizes data to gain insights and make predictions. These data-driven predictions help identify potential wear and tear on fleet vehicles. With the ability to access this data quickly, fleet managers can better pinpoint and correct driving behaviors that cause long-term negative effects on vehicles. 
With edge computing, dash cams respond to data in real-time with little lag time. Large amounts of data are processed quickly and can be accessed in remote locations. Edge computing also allows for data to be processed without having to fed to the cloud, adding an extra layer of security. Modern fleet vehicles feature a number of electronic parts and sensors that gather information about a variety of things, including fuel consumption, idling times, location, vehicle utilization, and driving hours, and more.
AI is able to predict issues and identify over-exertion points on a vehicle. Some examples would be AI-powered camera systems monitoring tire tread through miles driven or these systems being used as surveillance to provide evidence if parts are stolen from a vehicle. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, and predictive maintenance enhance efficiency in vehicle care. Trucking companies better manage vehicle maintenance costs by having the advantage of these systems, trucking companies better manage vehicle maintenance costs.\
The Benefits of Reliable Data 
Fleets utilize AI to improve decision-making based on diverse data types. This data is based on learning individual drivers’ behavior as they do their job. This is calculated into a score that helps determine areas the driver is improving and exhibiting risky driving behavior. An example of this would be when AI-powered technology determines that a driver turns at high speeds. Fleet managers are able to access this data and arrange for specific training for that driver. Customizable coaching also gives drivers the power to enhance their skills in their field and, in the long run, creates safer roads.   
Vehicle maintenance issues like fuel consumption can be measured through data provided by AI. Data gathered from how a driver operates a vehicle, road conditions, and how the vehicle operates during service hours can be used to better pinpoint problem areas. Much like how driver data is learned over time making it customized, vehicle data collected can help make better predictions to when and how often a vehicle needs to be serviced. This technology enhances decision-making, saving time and energy for trucking companies.    
Virtual coaching is another way AI enhances decision-making to optimize workflow. Fleet managers have easy access to driver videos and in-cab alerts analyzed by AI technology. By analyzing the driver’s safety risk alerts over the period of one work week, the AI algorithm gives drivers coaching tasks to resolve these behaviors. Since this is all done virtually, managers spend less time reviewing videos, and drivers improve safety more quickly.

Driving Safety and Efficiency
Having an AI-powered safety system empowers fleets to prioritize safety without having to risk a decrease in efficiency and an increase in costs. Remote and automated coaching through the use of AI dash cams can save a company time and increase retention with drivers. With the use of AI and Machine Learning, fleets can enhance vehicle and driver safety, better monitor vehicle maintenance, and streamline work operations. Fleet managers can have a smoother workflow without compromising what’s important for their business and drivers.

With an ageing population and a declining labour force, Japan has an urgent need to improve the efficiency of industry, making gains for sustainability along the way. Personalized manufacturing could provide a solution through the combination of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge laser technology being developed by Yohei Kobayashi and Hiroharu Tamaru, at the University of Tokyo.By using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the complex physics underlying the way lasers cut, weld or drill materials, these researchers hope to make possible internet-based control of laser production systems, so that we can manufacture the things we want, on-demand, from home.




Lasers are allowing for smart manufacturing and enabling a new industrial revolution. Credit: Thossaphol/Getty


The nineteenth-century industrial revolution, powered by water and steam, saw a giant leap forward in manufacturing and mass production. A second technological jump came through harnessing electricity, while computers and digital innovation enabled a third. The fourth industrial revolution is now underway with the combination of digital and physical technologies to allow production and control on demand: an industrial internet of things.LASER VERSATILITY A crucial component is likely to be so-called cyber-physical systems, where computation, networking, and a physical production process are integrated, with a built-in feedback mechanism allowing for fully automated control. Additive manufacturing, perhaps better known as 3D printing, is a prime example, which often uses lasers for the physical processing part. But lasers can do so much more.Since their development in the 1960s, lasers have offered exciting manufacturing possibilities. The applications are diverse and their properties are near perfect. They can focus a lot of optical energy on a small spot, generating a great deal of heat at a precise point on a target. So, unlike many conventional mechanical and chemical industrial process, laser processing is super-efficient and doesn’t require any additional chemicals.Lasers can be pulsed at extraordinary rates, and the duration of each pulse can be as short as a few tens of femtoseconds (10-15 seconds). This is faster than rate that energy can dissipate, allowing for microscopic processing of materials at scales of less than a millimetre, without causing heat damage. And with the correct choice of laser wavelength, the light can destroy one type of material, while leaving others intact.Furthermore, laser power can be used in a blunt way, such as welding parts together, cutting sheets of metal or drilling holes. Or lasers can be applied more subtly, such as to polish or texture a surface.HIGH-QUALITY DATA Because lasers are electrically driven, they are easier to integrate into computer-control systems, making them ideal for cyber-physical systems. But the array of laser properties that make this wide range of applications possible, also causes a major technical question: how to find the best parameters for a specific job?Traditionally, the solution would be user intuition based on trial and error, but optimizing a laser system in this way can take months, which is simply not viable at the scale required to realize truly useful cyber-physical systems. To complicate matters further, even when the best configuration is identified for a specific system to perform a specific task, what works well for one type of material might not work for another.Researchers at the University of Tokyo are tackling this problem using AI and machine learning. However, “due to the complexity of the laser and light-matter interactions, it wasn’t clear whether even artificial intelligence was powerful enough to offer a solution,” says Hiroharu Tamaru, a professor at the Institute for Photon Science and Technology. “But now we have seen that it can, and it relies on having good data.”High-quality data is crucial because AI machine-learning systems need to be trained.A few thousand to a few tens of thousands of data points are often required for the algorithm to start making useful predictions. “We have constructed an all-automated and autonomous data acquisition system, called the Meister Data Generator,” says Yohei Kobayashi, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Institute for Solid State Physics. “We don’t even need to go to the lab to take data: it keeps working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.”




The Meister Data Generator and smart laser system developed at the University of Tokyo.


The researchers have applied their idea to many laser production processes including, very recently, laser ablation: using a short pulse of light to remove a small amount of material from a surface. In this case, they created a high-quality dataset by firing light pulses of controllable duration at a solid target. A three-dimensional microscope then provided images for the corresponding surface changes at a rate of about one per minute, or a 1,000 data points in a day.This big-data driven approach is proving very fruitful, and the University of Tokyo collaborators at Kyushu University in Fukuoka are already exploiting the method to serve the semiconductor manufacturing industry.TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL Once the data is gathered, a deep-learning algorithm could simulate the 3D topology created after irradiation by multiple laser pulses at arbitrary positions and with arbitrary pulse energies. And the team have applied this system to a variety of materials, including dielectrics, semiconductors, and organic polymers.Currently, the Meister Data Generator system can search autonomously thorough the various laser parameters with advanced algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, which determines the next parameters to test while the experiments are running. Such a high-quality data will have the potential to further change the laser manufacturing processes.And while the practical, real-world potential of this technology is tremendous, Kobayashi and Tamaru are also excited by the implications for basic research. The interaction between light and matter at such high intensities is complex. The physics of laser ablation, for example, needs further clarification before it is completely understood. The strength of the electric field at the focus of the laser can be akin to that holding an atom together, so simple models based on melting and vaporization are of little use. Sophisticated molecular dynamic simulations offer hope, but the processing power required is immense because the physical processes that take place during laser ablation are so varied — the laser pulses are as fast as a few femtoseconds, while melting might take place over microseconds.The massive, high-quality data sets gathered by the Meister Data Generator will be useful in understanding high-intensity interactions of light and matter. And with a better understanding of the fundamental science underlying laser processing comes more control over the technology and a greater potential for it to be even more transformative.

Today, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) released The State of State AI Policy, a roundup of AI-related bills at the state and local level that were passed, introduced or failed in the 2021-2022 legislative session (EPIC gave VentureBeat permission to reprint the full roundup below). 
Within the past year, according to the document (which was compiled by summer clerk Caroline Kraczon), states and localities have passed or introduced bills “regulating artificial intelligence or establishing commissions or task forces to seek transparency about the use of AI in their state or locality.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



For example, Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and Vermont have passed bills creating a commission, task force or oversight position to evaluate the use of AI in their states and make recommendations regarding its use. Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and Mississippi have passed bills that limit the use of AI in their states. And Baltimore and New York City have passed local bills that would prohibit the use of algorithmic decision-making in a discriminatory manner. 
Ben Winters, EPIC’s counsel and leader of EPIC’s AI and Human Rights Project, said the information was something he had wanted to get in one single document for a long time. 
“State policy in general is really hard to follow, so the idea was to get a sort of zoomed-out picture of what has been introduced and what has passed, so that at the next session everyone is prepared to move the good bills along,” he said. 
Fragmented state and local AI legislation
The list of varied laws makes clear the fragmentation of legislation around the use of AI in the US – as opposed to the broad mandate of a proposed regulatory framework around the use of AI in the European Union. 
But Winters said while state laws can be confusing or frustrating – for example, if vendors have to deal with different state laws regulating AI in government contracting — the advantage is that comprehensive bills can tend to get watered down. 
“Also, when bills are passed affecting businesses in huge states such as, say, California, it basically creates a standard,” he said. “We’d love to see strong legislation passed nationwide, but from my perspective right now state-level policy could yield stronger outcomes.” 
Enterprise businesses, he added, should be aware of proposed AI regulation and that there is a rising standard overall around the transparency and explainability of AI. “To get ahead of that rising tide, I think they should try to take it upon themselves to do more testing, more documentation and do this in a way that’s understandable to consumers,” he said. “That’s what more and more places are going to require.” 
AI regulation focused on specific issues
Some limited issues, he pointed out, will have more accelerated growth in legislative focus, including facial recognition and the use of AI in hiring. “Those are sort of the ‘buckle your seat belt’ issues,’ he said. advertisement
Other issues will see a slow growth in the number of proposed bills, although Winters said that there is a lot of action around state procurement and automated decision making systems. “The Vermont bill passed last year and both California and Washington state were really close,” he said. “So I think there’s going to be more of those next year in the next legislative session.” 
In addition, he said, there might be some movement on specific bills codifying concepts around AI discrimination.  For example, Washington DC’s Stop Discrimination by Algorithms Act of 2021 “would prohibit the use of algorithmic decision-making in a discriminatory manner and would require notices to individuals whose personal information is used in certain algorithms to determine employment, housing, healthcare and financial lending.”  
“The DC bill hasn’t passed yet, but there’s a lot of interest,” he explained, adding that similar ideas are in the pending American Data Privacy and Protection Act. “I don’t think there will be a federal law or any huge avalanche of generally-applicable AI laws in commerce in the next little bit, but current state bills have passed that have requirements around certain discrimination aspects and opting out – that’s going to require more transparency.”

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Many of the top IT pain points can be assuaged by implementing the right software.




The more important tech becomes to business, the more companies rely on their IT departments. As these workers play increasingly crucial roles, they often find themselves facing new challenges as well. The modern workforce is full of pain points for IT professionals.
A 2018 report revealed that 45% of IT workers feel stressed, and that’s before a pandemic disrupted everyone’s workflows. Pressure is rising for IT teams, but there are solutions for all of these problems.
Here’s a closer look at the top 10 IT pain points and how to solve them.
1. Management Doesn’t Understand IT Needs
Perhaps the most common pain point for IT departments is a lack of understanding between them and management. As cybersecurity and digital services play a more critical role in companies, IT teams’ needs grow and shift. Management doesn’t always understand these needs, leading to shrunken budgets, time crunches, or other issues.
Work OSs can help mitigate this problem by providing insight into workloads and requests. Easy-to-navigate tables, charts, and analytics reveal when IT teams may need more time or funding in one area or if one workflow isn’t working. Management can then make more informed, helpful decisions.
2. Communication Is Challenging
Successful IT operations depend on clear communication. IT workers need to inform others about security concerns or software updates, and others need to ask IT about problems they encounter. With one in four Americans now working remotely, that communication isn’t always easy.Advertisements




To solve this problem, companies need clear and organized digital communication services. Finding a work OS that supports live chats and video calls to help aid remote conversations. Similarly, automated request forms ensure nothing gets lost in the noise, letting IT workers respond to any questions.
3. There’s Not Enough Time to Complete All Requests
With only eight hours in the standard workday, IT workers don’t always have enough time to handle everything on their plate. Other departments or management may not understand this crunch and pile requests on already-overworked IT departments. As technology needs keep rising, this becomes a more frequent issue.
With an OS that incorporates your team's projects and calendars, it’s easier for everyone to see what other workers already have on their schedule. This transparency helps distribute tasks more evenly, stopping requests from piling up. Efficiency gains from streamlined workflows also help IT workers complete more in a day.
4. Remote Workers Are Hard to Secure
Cybersecurity has been a relevant concern for years, but the work-from-home revolution has heightened these issues. Personal devices can be a security vulnerability when connected to company systems and data. They’re also harder to secure, since IT workers can’t install and update security solutions on them themselves. (Read also: Cybersecurity Concerns Rise For Remote Work.)
Using a work OS, like monday.com, which is compliant with international security standards and offers controls like session management, can mitigate these risks. Other steps, like adopting zero-trust infrastructure and requiring two-factor authentication, further improve remote worker security.
5. Everyone Thinks They’re an IT Expert
As tech becomes more prominent in work and daily life, people become more accustomed to it. As a result, IT teams often have to deal with other workers who think they’re also tech experts. This, in turn, can lead to complacency and ignorance, creating security risks. (Read also: Computer Science and Information and Communications Technology: What's the Difference?)
One way to manage this problem is to restrict controls, so everyone handles their area of expertise and nothing else. If anyone wants to make an IT-related decision, they’ll have to reach out to IT to do it. Workflow systems that enable this segmentation will prevent risks and ensure experts handle everything they should.
6. The Company Uses Too Many Different Tools
Digital disruption is a popular goal for businesses, but many companies don’t take an organized approach to it. Businesses frequently adopt a wide variety of digital tools that may or may not work together. Having to bounce between them all can slow IT teams down.
The solution here is for companies to look for tools that integrate with existing solutions. monday.com, for example, integrates with dozens of popular tools, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. The more a system supports, the less painful IT’s work will be.
7. Management’s Goals Don’t Align With Operational Goals
Company leaders often have lofty goals for their future IT operations. In many cases, these aspirations are more in line with business buzzwords than what’s relevant for the company. This disconnect can create confusion and frustration for IT teams.
The answer to this misalignment is clearer communication. Managers need a better understanding of IT operations, and IT staff need to showcase relevant and viable ways to improve. More transparent workflows and decision-making processes that involve more stakeholders can help.
8. Estimating Project Times Isn’t Always Easy
IT issues are frequently more complicated than they appear at first. Consequently, it can take far longer to complete a project than workers first thought. This can lead to inaccurate estimates, which disrupt workflows and can disappoint clients or co-workers.
Flexible, adaptive workflows mitigate the impact that unexpected changes have. When teams can see the big picture of everyone’s workload, they can shift responsibilities and projects around to account for anything running long or short. Software that enables real-time updates for these changes further lessens the disruption of these changes.
9. Onboarding New Workers Takes Too Long
Technology has the highest turnover rate of any sector, at 13.2%. With so many IT workers moving in and out of a company, many departments suffer from slow onboarding processes. Getting new workers accustomed to company systems takes time, hindering IT teams’ productivity.
The more straightforward an IT management platform is, the quicker onboarding will be. Work OSs like monday.com simplify workflows to help new hires get the hang of things faster. Performance metrics and progress tracking make it easier for managers to see where new hires are in their professional development and guide them.
10. Expectations Are Rising While Budgets Fall
Amid widespread digitization and rising cybercrime, IT teams are more important to businesses than ever. At the same time, 62% of surveyed organizations plan to tighten their IT budgets in 2021. As a result, many IT workers find themselves having to do more with less.
Outsourcing some processes can help IT teams accomplish more with reduced budgets. Similarly, automation can let smaller IT departments handle more without having to hire extra workers. Having a transparent, easy-to-understand record of all of a team’s responsibilities, accomplishments, and needs could help persuade management to increase budgets.
Better IT Management Starts With Better Software
Working in IT can be stressful, but there are many ways to alleviate that. Embracing software solutions can fix many of these common issues, letting IT teams reach their full potential. When these workers can handle their responsibilities better, the entire company benefits.
