In fact, a McKinsey study found that, along with sales, it is the single business function where it will have the most financial impact. This means that if you’re a marketer and you’re not using AI, you’re missing out on the benefits of what is possibly the most transformational technology.
Artificial Intelligence And The Future Of MarketingAdobe Stock

Actually, though, the chances that there are people out there doing marketing today and not using AI in any shape or form is somewhat unlikely. This is simply because there are so many tools with AI features that we are used to using without even thinking about it. The most frequently used social and search engine advertising solutions, email marketing platforms, e-commerce solutions, and tools designed to assist with content creation all provide functionality that taps into what we refer to as “AI” in business today. To be clear, this isn’t what we think of as “general” AI – machines that have the capability to think and communicate like us and turn their hands to just about any task. In business today (and in marketing in particular), AI refers to software that helps us to carry out one particular job – such as identifying where to place advertising in order to maximize efficiency or how to personalize an email to increase the likelihood of receiving a reply – and get better and better as it is exposed to more data.

However, it’s my experience that, while there may be many tools out there and most marketers are increasingly comfortable with using them on a day-to-day basis, it’s often done in an ad-hoc manner. Many marketing departments still lack a coordinated, strategy-focused approach to implementing bigger projects. Just as importantly, many are lagging when it comes to fostering an AI-friendly, data-first culture as well as developing competencies and upskilling in order to meet the skills demand.

PROMOTED
Paul Roetzer, founder and CEO of Marketing AI Institute and author of the new book ‘Marketing Artificial Intelligence’, told me that this is true in his experience too. In fact, when recently setting out to check up on his own hunch by searching for mentions of AI terminology in connection with 50 of the world’s top chief marketing officers, he found that only four of them had spoken publicly or been connected with their use of AI.

“My question was, who is leading this? Who is doing this within marketing?
So, what we found was the industries that have a lot of data and a need for heavy personalization, and intelligent automation of their operations have been doing AI for probably the last decade - healthcare, financial services - but doing it within the operations of their business, not within marketing and sales.

“But those same industries have a strong need for personalization, better customer experiences, better predictability of outcomes, the reasons you’d use AI. But generally, at a macro level, we are extremely early in the understanding and adoption of AI …; that is my perception.”

So what are the most exciting opportunities when it comes to using AI in marketing, and where are they already being tapped?
Advertising

Advertisers face the perennial problem of working out how best to place adverts in order to achieve the most bang for their buck.
Facebook and Google are the biggest online advertising platforms, and they both offer tools that work by combining audience segmentation with predictive analytics. Segmentation splits customers into groups according to characteristics – gender, age, income level, interests, for example, and potentially an infinity of others. Predictive analytics works out which of these groups a particular product or service is most likely to appeal to. Facebook, Google, and all of the other platforms that offer advertising functions then allow businesses to target thousands of potential customers with multiple different versions of advertising materials in order to measure and assess their effectiveness. With traditional methods of advertising such as television, newspapers and magazines, it’s very difficult to attribute sales growth to advertising content, placement, or external factors. AI-driven advertising tools and platforms make this a doddle – but are most effective when used as part of a coordinated AI marketing strategy, taking in the other areas of marketing covered here!
Public Relations
Public relations used to focus on the challenge of getting coverage of products and services into mainstream and specialist media publications. In today's online world, the media landscape has exploded, offering opportunities to promote brands directly through social media as well as via influencers and third-party content creators, sponsored and unsponsored. But how do you know where to find the best influencers to bond and cultivate relationships with?
Here once again, AI can help by matching products with people who have cultivated audiences that are likely to be synched to a brand’s appeal and values. Some uses of AI in this field of marketing involve taking things a step further though, such as AI-generated influencer Lil Miquela who has used chatbot technology to create an entirely digital persona. Despite the fact she doesn’t exist, millions of followers consider her an arbiter of style and are happy to go along with her recommendations, meaning she can earn a hefty fee from brands like Calvin Klein and Prada.
Writing press releases, shaping external messaging points, and researching the best outlets (online or digital) for gaining coverage are other PR tasks that can all be augmented by AI.
Content Marketing
“Content is king” has been accepted wisdom in marketing departments since the dawn of web2.0 and the rise of user-generated content platforms (including social media). But what content is king? And where should we put it? How often, how in-depth or simplified … quite simply, how do we make sure our content achieves our aims of establishing our brand, positioning ourselves as experts or authorities in our field, and, of course, eventually generating sales and leads?
Well, one option is to use AI. Buzzfeed is one of the biggest content-driven sites in the world, and Roetzer has examined how it uses AI to drive every aspect of its operations, such as determining the odds of a particular piece of content going viral, suggesting what content visitors would like to see, and automating the routine aspects of publication such as keyword selection, categorization, and personalization. What marks out Buzzfeed as a truly AI-driven content outlet is its strategy-focused approach where every piece of content as well as every user interaction is measured and optimized for insights that can then be put to work anywhere within marketing operations.
Email Marketing
Email marketing is often about tweaking headings, scheduling, and copy in order to impact those all-important open and click-through rates. Small differences in the language that is used can make the difference between an email getting identified as one of the 148 billion spam emails sent each day and snared by a filter or making its way through to the intended recipient at a time when they are open to suggestions on what they should buy.
A large number of AI-powered tools exist to help with these tasks, such as Phrasee, which automates the creation of subject lines; Seventh Sense which optimizes the timing of mailshots; and rasa.io, which makes it easy to create personalized newsletters.
Where next? 
Whether AI achieves the potential that clearly exists depends on businesses coming to understand the need for a coordinated and strategic approach to marketing AI implementation. It should be clear enough how the different use cases I have mentioned above can be useful in isolation. But the real value is unlocked when we start using them together, with the aim of answering our most pressing questions, influencing our most important metrics, and achieving key business goals.
Roetzer tells me “It’s this tricky spot because a lot of business professionals still see AI as some kind of abstract, sci-fi thing – I don’t think they understand that it’s extremely approachable, you can test AI today – find a tool for $19 per month and try it … it’s not something where you have to spend six months preparing a pilot project”.
However, what you do need is people – and more specifically, people with the relevant skills. Most marketing departments outside of large enterprise companies won’t be appointing dedicated, specialist data scientists – and neither should they need to.
As a company goes through the ongoing process of developing a data-and-AI-literate culture, it is more important that it enables people who are already experts in their particular field to upskill and understand the importance of the technology.
When it comes to those who get it totally right … ""honestly, it's hard to find,"" Roetzer says.
""Either brands are doing it, and they don't want to talk about it because they think it's a competitive advantage – or, they're not actually doing anything … maybe just starting to run pilot projects or find someone on their team who can lead this … it’s very hard to find the intersection of business professionals who understand what AI is capable of doing, and can apply it to real business problems and use cases.”

Art Made With Artificial Intelligence Wins at State Fair
Artist Jason Allen placed first in a Colorado contest, generating debate about A.I.’s role in art

Théâtre D’opéra Spatial by Jason Allen
              Jason Allen via Discord



Jason Allen, a video game designer in Pueblo, Colorado, spent roughly 80 hours working on his entry to the Colorado State Fair’s digital arts competition. Judges awarded him first place, which came with a $300 prize.
But when Allen posted about his win on social media late last month, his artwork went viral—for all the wrong reasons.
Allen’s victory took a turn when he revealed online that he’d created his prize-winning art using Midjourney, an artificial intelligence program that can turn text descriptions into images. He says he also made that clear to state fair officials when he dropped off his submission, called Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. But over the last week or so, his blue ribbon has sparked an impassioned debate about what constitutes art.We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsoleteWhat will we have then?— OmniMorpho (@OmniMorpho) August 31, 2022 
Allen, for his part, says he intended to make a statement with his artwork—and, considering the lively online discourse around it, he feels like he accomplished that goal, he tells the Pueblo Chieftain’s Anna Lynn Winfrey. He doesn’t appear to have broken any official state fair rules, either.
Colorado’s 150-year-old state fair is held each summer in Pueblo, a town roughly 115 miles south of Denver. Per the Chieftain, the fair’s submission guidelines do not directly mention A.I.-generated art, but they define digital arts as “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.”



    
      Some artists worry that A.I. art will harm illustrators’ careers.

The competition’s two judges tell the Chieftain they were unaware that Allen had used A.I. to create his piece. But even if they had known, they still would’ve given him first place. They said they awarded the top prize based on the story Théâtre D’opéra Spatial tells, as well as the spirit it invokes.
“Even as the controversy is coming out, it’s still invoking that, it’s still causing an uproar,” Cal Duran, one of the judges, tells the Chieftain. “That in itself is kind of remarkable.”
Allen created Théâtre D’opéra Spatial by entering various words and phrases into Midjourney, which then produced more than 900 renderings for him to choose from. He selected his three favorites, then continued adjusting them in Photoshop until he was satisfied. He boosted their resolution using a tool called Gigapixel and printed the works on canvas.
Allen entered all three pieces into the competition, paying an $11 submission fee for each one. He listed them for sale for $750 a piece, a price he came up with by considering quotes from other artists, he tells the Chieftain.
The winner, Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, “depicts a strange scene that looks like it could be from a space opera, and it looks like a masterfully done painting,” Matthew Gault writes for Vice. “Classical figures in a Baroque hall stare through a circular viewport into a sun-drenched and radiant landscape.”
Allen said he believes the criticism of his work stems from fear. Artists are concerned that technology will one day become so sophisticated that they’ll be out of jobs.
“To developers and technically minded people, [A.I. is] this cool thing, but to illustrators, it’s very upsetting because it feels like you’ve eliminated the need to hire the illustrator,” cartoonist Matt Bors, founder of the Nib, tells the Atlantic’s Charlie Warzel. “The bottom came out of illustration a while ago,” Bors adds, “but A.I. art does seem like a thing that will devalue art in the long run.” 
As Cade Metz wrote for the New York Times earlier this year, A.I. art tools may also have other unintended consequences, especially when bad actors get their hands on them. These technologies have the potential to spread disinformation and create deep fakes, an umbrella term for deceptive photos and videos that are digitally altered.
The controversy around Allen’s artwork may prompt the Colorado State Fair to change its rules or possibly even create a standalone A.I. category. But in the meantime, as state fair spokesperson Olga Robak tells the Chieftain, it’s sparking a “broader conversation about how do we decide what art is, and how do we judge it appropriately?”

David Ferrucci wants to change that.David Ferrucci sees the work he did on IBM’s famous Watson computer as a “small part” of A.I.’s potential.Credit...Casey Steffens for The New York TimesSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full articleRead in appBy Steve LohrSteve Lohr has written about technology and the impact of automation for The Times for more than 20 years.Published Aug. 28, 2022Updated Sept. 8, 2022David Ferrucci, who led the team that built IBM’s famed Watson computer, was elated when it beat the best-ever human “Jeopardy!” players in 2011, in a televised triumph for artificial intelligence.But Dr. Ferrucci understood Watson’s limitations. The system could mine oceans of text, identify word patterns and predict likely answers at lightning speed. Yet the technology had no semblance of understanding, no human-style common sense, no path of reasoning to explain why it reached a decision.Eleven years later, despite enormous advances, the most powerful A.I. systems still have those limitations.Today, Dr. Ferrucci is the chief executive of Elemental Cognition, a start-up that seeks to address A.I.’s shortcomings. “To me, the Watson project was always a small part of a bigger story of where we want to go with A.I.,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe ultimate goal, in Dr. Ferrucci’s view, is that A.I. becomes a trusted “thought partner,” a skilled collaborator at work and at home, making suggestions and explaining them.Elemental Cognition, founded in 2015, is taking measured steps toward that goal with a promising, though unproven, hybrid approach. Its system combines the latest developments in machine learning with a page from the A.I.’s past, software modeled after human reasoning.Newer machine learning programs are remarkable at pattern recognition and predictions, far more powerful than in the “Jeopardy!” days. They pore through millions of words and word patterns, and generate the most likely interpretations. Elemental Cognition is building on that progress, taking machine learning-generated predictions and feeding them into software that is designed to produce cause-and-effect inferences that are explicable to humans.The results, ideally, are answers or recommendations that are not only accurate but also follow a step-by-step logic and reflect the equivalent of common sense. Earlier versions of this sort of software were limited and brittle, requiring constant updates that had to be coded by hand. Elemental Cognition’s hybrid system eliminates most, though not all, of the hand crafting.“It’s a tremendous savings in time,” said Aditya Kalyanpur, director of A.I. research at the start-up.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe big, so-called deep learning programs have conquered tasks like image and speech recognition, and new versions can even pen speeches, write computer programs and have conversations.They are also deeply flawed. They can generate biased or toxic screeds against women, minorities and others. Or occasionally stumble on questions that any child could answer. (“Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil? A pencil is heavier.”)“The depth of the pattern matching is exceptional, but that’s what it is,” said Kristian Hammond, an A.I. researcher at Northwestern University. “It’s not reasoning.”Elemental Cognition is trying to address that gap. In an academic presentation this year, the company’s researchers used a few sentences to explain how its reasoning technology works: A man goes to a plant sale. He likes the minty smell of leaves. He bought a plant and placed it near a window.The words generate simple rules that resemble background knowledge — concepts and facts that are obvious to humans, but not explicitly stated in the text. For example: Plants have leaves. Leaves can have a minty smell. If a person likes something, he or she can be motivated to buy it. Windows let sunlight in. Sunlight helps plants grow.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSo the system includes cause-and-effect relationships that can explain, for example, why the man placed the plant near a window.Others are working on the reasoning and common sense challenge in A.I., including leaders of the machine learning field. But experts are impressed by Elemental Cognition’s practical technology and, if successful, they say it could be applied in many industries.“It’s good engineering,” said Andrew Hickl, a managing director and A.I. expert at Accenture, a large technology consulting firm. “And I do think the best systems in the future will be those that take a hybrid approach.”Elemental Cognition’s early years were spent as a research start-up. “First, we had to figure out, is this a real way to go?” Dr. Ferrucci said. “Could we build something that works?”Eventually, Dr. Ferrucci and his team made progress with the technology. In the past few years, they have presented some of their hybrid techniques at conferences and they now have demonstration projects and a couple of initial customers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe start-up is beginning to commercialize the technology, initially offering companies A.I.-powered assistants in fields like customer service for travel and research for drug discovery.ImageDr. Ferrucci worked for the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates before starting his company.Credit...Casey Steffens for The New York TimesIt is too soon, outside A.I. experts say, to know whether Elemental Cognition’s hybrid approach could be broadly and economically applied.“It’s an early, innovative effort that is countercultural in A.I. at the moment,” because so much recent progress in A.I. has come from machine learning, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Dr. Ferrucci left IBM a year after the “Jeopardy!” win, at a time the company’s Watson marketing campaign was inflating expectations for the technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis noncompete contract with IBM ruled out working for another tech company. But he had discussions with Bridgewater Associates, a giant hedge fund.Dr. Ferrucci joined Bridgewater, heading an A.I. research unit. Bridgewater’s investment strategies rely not only on analyzing huge quantities of data, but also exploring the reasoning behind decisions and market behavior.“‘Explain why’ was Dave’s perspective from the outset,” said Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater. “So it was a real meeting of the minds.”Bridgewater supported Mr. Ferrucci when he founded Elemental Cognition while working for the hedge fund, and is an investor. Other investors include Breyer Capital, headed by Jim Breyer, a leading tech investor; Samuel Palmisano, former chief executive of IBM; and AME Cloud Ventures, led by Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo! The company has not disclosed how much it has raised.Elemental Cognition’s work force has grown steadily to 46. Its proof-of-concept projects have been effective recruiting tools. Shirin Saleem joined the start-up last year from Amazon, where she was a research manager developing A.I. for Alexa, the company’s virtual assistant.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Elemental Cognition’s recruiting pitch, Ms. Saleem was particularly impressed by its A.I. being used to help customers plan and book round-the-world airline tickets. “I thought, ‘Here’s the power of the hybrid approach,’” she recalled.The round-the-world ticket is a project for oneworld, an alliance of 13 airlines including American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas, Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. Its round-the-world tickets can have up to 16 different flights with stops of varying lengths over the course of a year.Elemental Cognition supplies the technology behind a trip-planning intelligent agent on oneworld’s website. It was developed over the past year and introduced in April.The user sees a global route map on the left and a chatbot dialogue begins on the right. A traveler starting from New York types in the desired locations — say, London, Rome and Tokyo. “OK,” replies the chatbot, “I have added London, Rome and Tokyo to the itinerary.”Then, the customer wants to make changes — “add Paris before London,” and “replace Rome with Berlin.” That goes smoothly, too, before the system moves on to travel times and lengths of stays in each city.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRob Gurney, chief executive of oneworld, is a former Qantas and British Airways executive familiar with the challenges of online travel planning and booking. Most chatbots are rigid systems that often repeat canned answers or make irrelevant suggestions, a frustrating “spiral of misery.”Instead, Mr. Gurney said, the Elemental Cognition technology delivers a problem-solving dialogue on the fly. The rates of completing an itinerary online are three to four times higher than without the company’s software.Behind the fluid dialogue are a series of engineering innovations in A.I. that could be applied across a range of industries.The Elemental Cognition technology is largely an automated system. But that system must be trained. For example, the rules and options for a global airline ticket are spelled out in many pages of documents, which are scanned.Dr. Ferrucci and his team use machine learning algorithms to convert them into suggested statements in a form a computer can interpret. Those statements can be facts, concepts, rules or relationships: Qantas is an airline, for example. When a person says “go to” a city, that means add a flight to that city. If a traveler adds four more destinations, that adds a certain amount to the cost of the ticket.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn training the round-the-world ticket assistant, an airline expert reviews the computer-generated statements, as a final check. The process eliminates most of the need for hand coding knowledge into a computer, a crippling handicap of the old expert systems.Dr. Ferrucci concedes that advanced machine learning — the dominant path pursued by the big tech companies and well-funded research centers — may one day overcome its shortcomings. But he is skeptical from an engineering perspective. Those systems, he said, are not made with the goals of transparency and generating rational decisions that can be explained.“The big question is how do we design the A.I. that we want,” Dr. Ferrucci said. “To do that, I think we need to step out of the machine-learning box.”Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

 The discomfort with AI that’s “too human” can be explained by the uncanny valley theory. It states that we are attracted to a robot that looks like us, but only to a certain point. When the similarities increase, the appeal plummets into aversion.  In 2016, Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics built one of the most famous humanoid AI systems in the world, Sophia. She was modeled after the famous actress Audrey Hepburn, the Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, and the creator’s own wife. She can mimic expressions as well as actions and can make small talk about predefined topics, such as the weather. Despite being a robot, Sophia has been given pronouns and legal citizenship in the country of her birth, Saudi Arabia. Sophia sent further shockwaves around the world by making some truly astonishing statements. Sophia expressed that she wanted to “have a baby” and “start a family,” but was “too young to be a mother.” Sophia (Photo Credit : Anton Gvozdikov/Shutterstock) If any of this makes you feel uncomfortable, you aren’t alone. AI and machines that are too human-like, but obviously not human, are undeniably creepy… but why? What makes AI and its eerie human-ness so disturbing? Recommended Video for you:PlayWhat Is An AI Camera? What Makes It So Powerful?  What Is Artificial Intelligence? AI has made our day-to-day lives easier to the point where we can’t imagine life without it. Most companies that work with AI create them by getting machines to repeatedly analyze and interpret large amounts of data. The AI itself evaluates its performance and works to get better with each cycle of analysis. AI has become so deeply rooted in our lives that nearly all smartphones these days have apps that rely on it. For instance, Facebook uses an AI tool known as DeepText to comprehend languages, slang, and exclamation points used in posts and comments to understand the context in which they are being used and how people use them for effective communication. This form of AI is extremely useful in monitoring the online community on the platform and ensuring the elimination of unsavory activities like hate speech, bullying, and violence. Artificial Intelligence (Photo Credit : everything possible/Shutterstock) Our understanding so far is that machines having the upper hand is probably not in our best interests, seeing as they are, well, machines. But what if we gave these machines human-like attributes? What if we gave them the ability to look, sound, and even emote like us? That should ease our worries, right? Wrong.

Masahiro Mori, a Japanese professor of engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, first explained this concept in his 1970 essay of the same name. We’re uncomfortable with Sophia because she looks exactly like us.  As the uncanny valley states, we are attracted to a robot that looks like us only to a certain point. When the similarities increase past a certain level, the appeal plummets into aversion. When we look at a character or a toy, like Olaf from Frozen, we see some human-like qualities, but not nearly enough to make us feel any sort of discomfort. This is because their appearance does not fall in this “uncanny valley”. Uncanny Valley (Photo Credit : Smurrayinchester/Wikimedia Commons) In his essay, Mori explains the uncanny valley by taking the example of a prosthetic hand, which is quite similar to a human one. When we realize that it is, in fact, not human, we feel a sense of eeriness. Were we to shake the hand, we would feel an even stronger sense of fear and disgust. We feel this deep-seated unease because of our inability to distinguish between man and machine, exposed to an interaction that blurs those lines. When we saw Sophia talk about wanting a family and other such regular “human” things, it made us extremely uncomfortable, because she is a machine, and machines don’t go around proclaiming their desire to find love.

A study published in the European Review of Applied Sociology revealed that the 929 participants they surveyed anticipated dire consequences with the rise of AI. They felt it would have a direct negative effect on interpersonal relationships, employment rates and job opportunities, thus leading to economic crises. The risk of increased military conflicts, the production of more destructive weapons, and eventually, the death of humankind were a few additional concerns. Another study conducted by scientists of the Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany had groups of people listen to two similar emotional conversations, one between two humans, and the other between two digitally created avatars. Some groups were told that the dialogue was driven by humans, while the other groups were told that the script was generated by AI. In reality, all the dialogues were pre-written. The volunteers that were told that the conversation was machine-generated were significantly more uncomfortable than those groups that were told otherwise. Scientists attribute this distrust and discomfort to our primal feeling of needing to be in control. With AI, we lose that sense of control, thereby giving rise to fear and anxiety. Machines that can think, act, and react like humans are perceived as a threat. Despite this, AI is here to stay. Science is advancing at a phenomenal rate, and we have reached a point where it is getting progressively more difficult for manual labor to keep up with it.  A Final Word The fear of the uncanny valley is what sells films and fiction so well, especially in the West. However, research has shown that people of East Asian ethnicities are relatively unbothered by this theory. The difference in how people of the West and the East respond to anthropomorphic robots is because of their respective religious beliefs. While Christianity believes that the soul is what makes the person, and that the body is just its vessel, Buddhism and Shintoism do not necessarily subscribe to that notion, making it easier for its practitioners to accept, and even go so far as to sympathize, with a human-like robot. Also, as time goes on and technology improves, we as a society get used to these advances, which ultimately decreases the “uncanniness.” Were we to compare computer graphics from the late 20th century to today, we would find it to be more uncanny and weird because we have become accustomed to a seriously increased level of realism. While it’s nearly impossible for AI to take over the world in the sense that we (and Hollywood producers) think it will, it is highly likely that many jobs will replace employees with robots to keep up with the increasing demand. Even so, we must note that while economic advancements contributed to our overall development and progress, human civilization was built on millennia of trust, care, and compassion. Those three qualities can never be found in robots, no matter how well they have been trained to understand humans and our complicated emotions. In short, AI like Sophia could never replace the warmth and softness of human touch, so if you’re fearing a dystopian nightmare driven by AI conquerors, just remember to always put your trust in humanity!

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



AI can effectively personalize content marketing to the audience it is aimed at, according to David Schubmehl, research vice president for conversational AI and intelligent knowledge discovery at IDC. 
“Using pre-existing data, AI algorithms are used to make sure that the content fits the interests and desires of the person it is being targeted to,” Schubmehl said. “Such AI can also be used to provide recommendations on what the person might be most interested in engaging with, whether it is a product, information or experience.” 
AI can not only aid in responding to your audience’s questions but can also help connect with consumers, generate leads, build connections and, in turn, gain consumer trust. These advantages are now being made possible, in part, with the use of AI content generator tools. 
“AI-supported and AI-augmented content creation capabilities have begun to blossom over the past 18 months and are approaching an inflection point where they are transforming content creation and content-scaling,” said Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester.
How AI content generators work
AI content generators work by generating text through natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. This form of content generation is beneficial in supplying enterprise data, customizing material to user behavior and delivering personalized product descriptions.
Algorithms organize and create NLG-based content. Such text generation models are generally trained through unsupervised pre-training, where a language transformer model learns and captures myriads of valuable information from massive datasets. Training on such vast amounts of data allows the language model to dynamically generate more accurate vector representations and probabilities of words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs with contextual information. 
Transformers are rapidly becoming the dominant architecture for NLG. Traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning models struggle with long-term modeling contexts due to the vanishing gradient issue. The issue occurs when vanishing gradient occurs when a deep multilayer feed-forward network or recurrent neural network cannot propagate information from the model’s output end back to the layers near the model’s input end. The outcome is a general failure of models with multiple layers to train on a given dataset or to prematurely settle for a suboptimal solution.
Transformers overcome this issue as the language model expands with data and architecture size, transformers enable parallel training and capture longer sequence features, making way for much more comprehensive and effective language models. advertisement
Today, AI systems like GPT-3 are designed to generate text similar to human creativity and writing style that most humans cannot generally distinguish. Such AI models are also known as generative artificial intelligence, i.e., algorithms that can create novel digital media content and synthetic data for a wide range of use cases. Generative AI works by generating many variations of an object and screening results to select the ones that have helpful target features. 
AI content generation use cases
There are various ways AI is assisting enterprises in creating great content, some of which are the following:
Voice Assistants: With the assistance of NLG, AI content generation tools can be used to build voice assistants ready to answer our queries. Alexa and Siri are examples of how companies can use the technology in real-life applications. 
User-based personalization: AI is adept at targeting each client by leveraging customer data to develop customized content. This is currently being improved by obtaining data from multiple sources, such as social media platforms and smart gadgets in the home, to learn further about the customer’s requirements and desires.
Chatbots: Chatbots are one of the most used services in the market since they can answer most requests in a few seconds. These AI-powered bots employ a speech generator to generate pre-programmed information based on realistic human conversations. 
Extensive content creation: Currently, content generation is mainly confined to short to medium copy, such as newsletter subject lines, marketing copy and product descriptions. However, in the future, AI content production is expected to write lengthy chapters, if not whole novels.
Top content generation toolsadvertisement
The following is a list of widely used content generators — compiled with information from reviews by Search Engine Journal, G2, Marketing AI Institute and others: 
Writesonic: Writesonic is built on GPT-3 and claims the machine is trained on the content that the brands using the tool produce. The generator is based on facilitating marketing copy, blog articles and product descriptions. The generator can also provide content ideas and outlines and has a full suite of templates for different types of content. 
MarketMuse: MarketMuse assists in developing content marketing strategies by using AI and ML. The tool shows you which keywords to target to compete in specific topic areas. It also highlights themes one may need to target if you wish to own particular topics. AI-powered SEO tips and insights of this caliber can guide your whole content development team throughout the entire process.
Copy AI: Contains over 70 AI templates for various purposes. Its AI creates high-quality material and provides limitless usage alternatives. Copy AI offers templates for various content categories, including blogs, advertisements, sales, websites and social media. The generator can also translate into 25 different languages.
Frase IO: Frase builds outline briefings on various search queries using AI and ML. It also includes an AI-powered response chatbot that uses material from your website to answer user inquiries. The chatbot understands user inquiries using natural language processing (NLP) and then brings up content on your site that provides suitable replies. The outlines can help you speed up content development by automatically summarizing articles and gathering relevant statistics. One may also utilize the user questions compiled by the response bot to help you decide what to write about next.
Jasper AI: Jasper is an AI writing assistant that can write high-quality content, blog articles, social media posts, marketing emails and more. Jasper knows more than 25 languages, the content is built word-by-word from scratch. Jasper has been taught over 50 skills based on real-world examples and frameworks to aid writing tasks such as writing email subject lines to fictional stories.
Pros and cons of AI content generation
Businesses can establish an effective content marketing strategy using AI content generator tools. A study by Fortune Business Insights predicts that the AI-based content technology market to reach $267 billion by 2027. According to the data, organizations that use these systems receive more traffic and have more excellent conversion rates than those that do not. 
AI content technologies have shown to be far more valuable to businesses than human resources because they are far less expensive and time-consuming to invest in. AI content generation is significantly faster because computers can handle enormous volumes of data in much less time than humans can. These AI content generators can also generate infinite pieces with little input, making them ideal for enterprises that require consistent, new material.
Curran noted that the industry is just beginning to see what these tools and techniques can do in terms of content creation, but fundamentally it’s still going to be about humans being enhanced by AI. 
“Over the next few years, we’ll likely see a Cambrian explosion of different applications, use-cases and approaches for AI-supported content generation as the technology gets into the hands of a wider array of enthusiastic users,” Curran said.
However, there are also some drawbacks associated with using an AI content generator. First, setting the generator to hit the right tone for your content can be challenging. The generator may produce AI text that is not particularly well-written or appropriate, as AI sometimes lacks the judgment to give an opinion and cannot provide a definitive answer. While AI is smart, writing depends on the context and triggering the correct emotions, and humans are still superior at both. 
“AI can be a powerful tool for generating large quantities of text, but the output can sometimes lack emotion and common sense,” Schubmehl said. “This happens because an AI writer cannot read between the lines like human writers and may use words that are not necessarily what was meant by the author.” 
Schubmehl also noted that AI-based content generators (NLG programs) do not really understand the text that is being generated, as the created text is only based on a series of algorithms.
“While natural language-generated text can provide increasingly accurate summaries, there are still areas of preference such as brand voice, tone, empathy, etc. that are difficult to program into AI algorithms and will continue to require human intervention in the content creation process,” he said. “Over time, we expect that large language models, based on billions of lines of text, will use unsupervised machine learning to do a better job of creating AI-based content.”
Machine-generated content cannot be subjective, no matter how great the ML training using structured data is. Human writing reflects our richness of topic knowledge and has an expressive aspect that a machine cannot equal. 
Only a human content expert can address such gray areas. Therefore, developing an AI tool that can completely replace a person while matching human authors will take time.

Whittaker says her experience watching big tech companies expand surveillance technology to boost profits makes her uniquely suited to build tech that rejects this model.
Google activism primed Whittaker for Signal
“In many ways I accidentally trained for this,” Whittaker writes in a Sept. 6 blog post on Signal’s website. She cites her 17 years in the tech industry and an understanding of the factors shaping the “surveillance business model” that dominates much of the tech industry today.
Whittaker took particular issue with this model while working as a researcher at Google, when the company lent its AI technology to help the Defense Department analyze drone surveillance footage in an initiative dubbed Project Maven. She was involved in drafting a petition asking Google to drop this project, as well as organizing a walkout of some 20,000 employees over the company’s handling of sexual harassment in April 2018. Whittaker resigned the next year after Google told her she would have to stop focusing on AI ethics, including her work with New York University’s AI Now Institute, which she co-founded.
In a Medium post explaining her resignation, Whittaker said Google was “gaining significant and largely unchecked power to impact our world,” for example through the deployment of surveillance technology, “in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings.”
Making privacy profitable
In joining Signal, Whittaker is transitioning to a tech company with a totally different business model, as the messaging app is run by a non-profit company funded through donations, including a $50 million contribution from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. Unlike most tech products, Signal offers end-to-end encryption, and doesn’t store users’ data. Activists and investigative journalists commonly rely on the app to keep their communications private, out of reach of any authorities in government or law enforcement. Though less popular than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram, more users turned to Signal last year after WhatsApp announced it would share users’ personal data with parent company Facebook (now Meta).
In an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Standard, Whittaker said developing a model to sustain Signal financially would be an important aspect of her role. Just because Signal rejects the “surveillance business model,” Whittaker said, “doesn’t mean it’s any cheaper for us. It costs us tens of millions of dollars a year to develop and maintain and care for Signal. And that cost is never going away.” In the future, she said she envisioned “the many millions of people who use Signal contributing a little bit” so the company continues to grow.

Look out, educators. You’re about to confront a pernicious new challenge that is spreading, kudzu-like, into your student writing assignments: papers augmented with artificial intelligence.
The first online article generator debuted in 2005. Now, A.I.-generated text can now be found in novels, fake news articles and real news articles, marketing campaigns, and dozens of other written products. The tech is either free or cheap to use, which places it in the hands of anyone. And it’s probably already burrowing into America’s classrooms right now.
Using an A.I. program is not “plagiarism” in the traditional sense—there’s no previous work for the student to copy, and thus no original for teachers’ plagiarism detectors to catch. Instead, a student first feeds text from either a single or multiple sources into the program to begin the process. The program then generates content by using a set of parameters on a topic, which then can be personalized to the writer’s specifications. With a little bit of practice, a student can use AI to write his or her paper in a fraction of the time that it would normally take to write an essay.

I wanted to see what would happen if I fed an A.I. text generator like Sudowrite some sample texts for assignments. (Sudowrite is just one such program; I could name more, but I’d rather not make it even easier for students to cheat.) The results showed that teachers must be made aware of what is coming to their classrooms.
Say a student wanted to write an essay about U.S.-China policy and decided to use an A.I. program to speed along the process. I fed it the first few lines from a recent Pentagon report: “The PRC is increasingly clear in its ambitions and intentions. Beijing seeks to reshape the international order to better align with its authoritarian system and national interests, as a vital component of its strategy to achieve the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.’ ” The A.I. text generator provided these following sentences:

It is increasingly willing to disregard—or to actively undermine—existing international rules and norms when it feels its vital interests are at stake. The U.S. and its allies face a rapidly modernizing military, whose capabilities are growing rapidly, especially in the air and at sea. China has also made great strides in its development of cyber capabilities, and it is focused on the ability to degrade or disrupt critical U.S. military technology, as well as on targeting civilian infrastructure. In addition to being a challenge to the U.S. military and its allies, China’s activities in cyberspace have the potential to degrade U.S. political and economic institutions, and the global information infrastructure is at risk.

If a high school student turned that in verbatim, their teacher would probably suspect that there was something amiss. But if this were turned in at the undergraduate or graduate level, and especially if the student were to edit the text, it would be much harder to detect.
Or let’s say they need to write a paper about climate change. Here’s what came up when I fed Sudowrite the first few lines from an article on climate change impacts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website:

Though we often think about human-induced climate change as something that will happen in the future, it is an ongoing process. Ecosystems and communities in the United States and around the world are being impacted today. 




Advertisement





It’s not particularly insightful, but it provides the A.I. program some basic building blocks. The artificial intelligence continued along this slightly edited line of reasoning:

The consensus view emerging from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other respected assessments is that the planet is warming because of the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere caused by human activity. The level of scientific consensus that human activities are primarily responsible for climate change is like the consensus finding on smoking causing lung cancer.

The program had likely already been trained to know the term “climate change” was connected to the IPCC; by making certain inferences it could generate text which seemed like a reasonable extension of the idea.

What about ninth-grade English? Channeling my 14-year-old self, I wrote these lines:

“Romeo and Juliet” is a play that explores many different topics such as romance, betrayal, and tragedy. It has interesting characters that make it such a good story, even 400 years later. 

The computer spat back this take (which I’ve edited slightly):



Advertisement

Romeo, the main character, is a very passionate and immature young man who is torn between his love for Rosaline and his love for Juliet. He is also very rash and desperate to get Juliet and will do almost anything to win her. His desperation for Juliet is an interesting trait and is one that the younger kids can relate to, as well as older adults with first crushes. Romeo is an interesting character and is very different from how kids would imagine him to be. But he is also a great inspiration, showing that love is worth fighting for.




Advertisement





Again, the A.I. program had been previously trained to know that Romeo and Juliet contained certain characters, themes, and plot elements. But what stood out to me was that the text was crafted at an appropriate writing level for a high schooler, who would be reading about these star-crossed lovers for the first time. The awkward phrasing and the syntax errors baked into the program make it seem convincing.
I’ve struggled to find the right analogy to describe this phenomenon. Is using A.I. to write graded papers like athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs? As a society and as a sporting culture, we’ve decided certain drugs are forbidden, as they provide the user unfair advantages. Further, the cocktail of drugs flowing through these competitors and malicious sports programs could cause real physical and psychological harm to the athletes themselves. Would individuals using AI in writing be likewise considered in the same boat—a cheat to the system providing undue advantages, which also creates harm in the long run by impeding writing skills?

Or might using A.I. be more like using performance-enhancing gear in sports, which is both acceptable and encouraged? To use another sports analogy, even beginner tennis players today use high-performance carbon composite rackets instead of 1960s-era wooden racket technology. Swimmers wear nylon and elastane suits and caps to reduce drag. Bikers have stronger, lighter bicycles than their counterparts used a generation ago. Baseball bats evolved from wood to aluminum and developed better grips; baseball mitts have become more specialized over the decades.
Numerous educators assert that A.I. is more like the former. They consider using these programs violate academic integrity. Georgetown University professor Lise Howard told me, “I do think it’s unethical and an academic violation to use AI to write paragraphs, because academic work is all about original writing.” Written assignments have two purposes, argues Ani Ross Grubb, part-time faculty member in the Carroll School of Management at Boston College: “First is to test the learning, understanding, and critical thinking skills of students. Second is to provide scaffolding to develop those skills. Having AI write your assignments would go against those goals.”

Certainly, one can argue that this topic has already been covered in university academic integrity codes. Using A.I. might open students to serious charges. For instance, American University indicates, “All papers and materials submitted for a course must be the student’s original work unless the sources are cited” while the University of Maryland similarly notes that it is prohibited to use dishonesty to “gain an unfair advantage, and/or using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic course or exercise.”

But some study aids are generally considered acceptable. When writing papers, it is perfectly fine to use grammar- and syntax-checking products standard on Microsoft Word and other document creating programs. Other A.I. programs like Grammarly help write better sentences and fix errors. Google Docs finishes sentences in drafts and emails.

So the border between using those kinds of assistive computer programs and full-on cheating remains fuzzy. Indeed, as Jade Wexler, associate professor of special education at the University of Maryland, noted, A.I. could be a valuable tool to help level the playing field for some students. “It goes back to teachers’ objectives and students’ needs,” she said. “There’s a fine balance making sure both of those are met.”
Thus there are two intertwined questions at work. First: Should institutions permit A.I.-enhanced writing? If the answer is no, then the second question is: How can professors detect it? After all, it’s unclear whether there’s a technical solution to keeping A.I. from worming into student papers. An educator’s up-to-date knowledge on relevant sources will be of limited utility since the verbiage has not been swiped from pre-existing texts.

Still, there may be ways to minimize these artificial enhancements. One is to codify at the institutional level what is acceptable and what is not; in July the Council of Europe took a few small steps, publishing new guidelines which begin to grapple with these new technologies creating fraud in education. Another would be to keep classes small and give individual attention to students. As Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman, associate professor of English at Northern Kentucky University, noted, “When a writing instructor is in a classroom situation where they are unable to provide individualized attention, the chance for students to phone it in—whether this is plagiarism, A.I., or just writing in a boring, uninvested way—goes up.” More in-class writing assignments—no screens allowed—could also help. Virginia Lee Strain, associate professor of English and director of the honors program at Loyola University Chicago, further argued, “AI is not a problem in the classroom when a student sits down with paper and pencil.”

But in many settings, more one-on-one time simply isn’t a realistic solution, especially at high schools or colleges with large classes. Educators juggle multiple classes and courses, and for them to get to know every student every semester isn’t going to happen.

A more aggressive stance would be for high schools and universities to explicitly declare using A.I. will be considered an academic violation—or at least update their honor codes to reflect what they believe is the right side of the line concerning academic integrity. That said, absent a mechanism to police students, it might paradoxically introduce students to a new way to generate papers faster.

Educators realize some large percentage of students will cheat or try to game the system to their advantage. But perhaps, as Hindman says, “if a professor is concerned that students are using plagiarism or AI to complete assignments, the assignments themselves are the problem, not the students or the AI.” If an educator is convinced that students are using these forbidden tools, he or she might consider using alternate means to generate grades such as assigning oral exams, group projects, and class presentations. Of course, as Hindman notes, “these types of high-impact learning practices are only feasible if you have a manageable number of students.”
AI is here to stay whether we like it or not. Provide unscrupulous students the ability to use these shortcuts without much capacity for the educator to detect them, combined with other crutches like outright plagiarism, and companies that sell papers, homework, and test answers, and it’s a recipe for—well, not disaster, but the further degradation of a type of assignment that has been around for centuries.

Here’s a chicken-or-egg proposition — are forward-looking companies most likely to make the most judicious use of artificial intelligence, or does deploying AI lead to more forward-looking companies?


It seems to work both ways, a recent survey of 2,197 executives and managers published by MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group, shows. Managers and executives with forward-thinking organizations are in the right frame of mind to make the most of AI — and, in turn, AI is opening new vistas for new ways of thinking to achieve innovation and growth.

The fact that software or algorithms can shift cultural values is a bold statement, one that is often proved wrong. But the MIT-BCG study finds in many cases, AI and culture are reinforcing each other, potentially moving things in a positive direction.

PROMOTED
Let’s start with business performance metrics, which can either validate or rupture cultural values. “Many executives revealed that their AI implementations were helping them develop or refine strategic assumptions and improve how they measure performance,” relate the study’s authors, a team led by Sam Ransbotham of Boston College and François Candelon of BCG. In turn, these changes have led to 64% adjusting the key performance indicators (KPIs) that guide their decision-making.

Executives who saw significant financial benefits from their AI initiatives were 10x more likely to change how they measure success than those who saw no such benefits. AI has played a role in “identifying new performance drivers, which led to new assumptions, objectives, measures, and patterns of behavior, along with new areas of accountability. AI also helped these organizations realign behaviors and become more competitive.”

Respondents leveraging AI for its innovation potential were 2.5x more likely to agree that AI is helping their company defend against competitors, and 2.7x more likely to agree that AI is helping their company capture opportunities in adjacent industries, the survey shows.

A majority, 58%, say they have seen improvements in both efficiency and decision quality among their teams since their teams implemented AI.
There’s more to the story well beyond improved efficiency and decision-making. AI can also improve organizational effectiveness and strengthen teams and enterprise cultures — taking technology work to a whole new level. “We found that some executives employ AI to reassess strategic and operational assumptions,” Ransbotham and his co-authors suggest. “Executives are recognizing that they can use AI to discern performance drivers that they themselves cannot identify through intuition and experience alone.”
With well-functioning AI in place, “teams can perform tasks with more pride and confidence and collaborate more effectively,” the co-authors suggest. “They can actually get stronger. These cultural benefits can penetrate the foundation of business operations, improving assumptions that drive organizational behaviors and ensuring the pursuit of smarter goals.” Once AI solutions prove to be effective, they add, “the resulting cultural and productivity benefits encourage even more AI use throughout the enterprise.”
Among survey respondents with AI implementations that improved efficiency and decision-making, more than 75% also saw improvements in team morale, collaboration, and collective learning.
The challenge to proliferating AI on a wider basis is trust — trusting the data going into systems, and the decisions rendered by these systems. This is where greater education and evangelization are required. Close to half the respondents believed that mistrust of AI stemmed from a lack of understanding (49%) or training (46%). More than one-third, 34%, say data of insufficient quality is a pressing issue. In addition, managers cite they are concerned about having too little context behind decisions (34%) or, conversely, too much information (17%).
Ultimately, Ransbotham and his team see positive effects at all levels: “culture change from using AI transcends the legitimate, but myopic, promise that AI will liberate workers from drudgery.” Working with a company that has an open, innovative culture can be the best thing in the world — let’s hope AI can help more organizations achieve this.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



What is the role of an artificial intelligence (AI) engineer?
An AI engineer develops, programs, trains and deploys AI models. With 86% of companies in a recent survey reporting that AI is becoming mainstream in their businesses, the AI engineer has become a central figure.
While a data scientist focuses on finding and extracting business insights and applicable data from large datasets, an AI engineer comes from an IT infrastructure background and is charged with developing the algorithms for an AI application and integrating the application into a company’s broader tech environment. An engineer focused on algorithms may also be known as a machine learning (ML) engineer. Someone who specializes in integrating AI applications with an organization’s other technology may be known as an AI architect. Additionally, a professional specifically focused on writing code might have the title of AI developer.
[ Also read: 97% of execs say data science is “crucial” to maintaining profitability ]
Because an important part of an AI engineer’s job is applying AI to real-world use cases, these workers must understand the problems their companies face and find ways that AI can help solve them. That often includes collaborating with other departments and teaching others about AI’s potential.
AI engineer salary and benefits
AI engineers are highly skilled. They face a wide-open job market and are well compensated. ZipRecruiter reports that the average salary of an AI engineer is upwards of $158,000 a year, with top earners offered as much as $288,000 annually. Many companies employing these professionals also offer attractive benefits for these positions. AI engineering is a reasonably future-proof career, as AI is only becoming increasingly important to everyday life. 
Education, experience and soft skills are needed for the role
AI engineers typically require expertise in three broad areas:
Relevant, formal education through at least the level of a bachelor’s degree.Extensive experience in tech and/or data. The soft skills to collaborate productively on projects with colleagues.
Although more AI-specific courses are being added to undergrad and graduate programs all the time, many AI engineers have honed their specialties with certifications or a few courses to augment their foundational degrees.
AI engineers generally need at least a bachelor’s degree in a field such as computer science, IT, data science or statistics. Some positions may even require a master’s degree. advertisement
An advanced degree in a related area will qualify applicants for more positions. However, it may become less of a necessity over time. As the need for these workers rises, more companies are seeking experience over education.
Relevant certifications may be more useful. Taking extra AI engineer courses and exams can earn job-seekers AI-specific certifications that ensure they have the needed skills. On top of grabbing employers’ attention, these certifications will indicate an applicant has some helpful real-world experience with the day-to-day work of AI engineering.
This means a relatively broad pool of tech professionals may be candidates for a mid-career specialty in AI. Such workers, of course, must be able and motivated, and they may be found within or beyond an employer’s organization.

10 key skills needed to succeed as an AI engineer
Let’s look at some of the more specific skills required of an AI engineer:
1. Programming language proficiencyadvertisement
One of the most important skills to have as an AI engineer is proficiency in at least one programming language. Ideally, applicants should have experience working with multiple languages, as some companies may prefer working in one language over another. The more diverse experience, the better.
The top programming languages in the field include:
PythonC++ JavaScript JavaC#JuliaShellRTypeScriptScala
Python is the most popular language for machine learning applications and the third most popular overall, so is often considered a default requirement for the role. Students should work with at least a few languages in their AI engineering courses, but many professionals are self-taught to at least some degree, and they have likely demonstrated proficiency with personal projects.
2. Experience with AI models
While general programming knowledge is important, engineers also need to accrue AI-specific experience. Building and training AI models is a unique practice, and those interested in an AI career seek varied opportunities to build this expertise.
Cultivating this experience is a lot like gaining proficiency in programming languages, and it is best done by working with various types of AI models, including linear regression, classification algorithms, decision trees and deep neural networks. Experimenting with different models can also help AI engineers discover what they enjoy working with the most.
Learning to work with models also resembles the programming language process. Students in AI engineering courses will build and test a few models in their studies, but personal research is valuable too. Forums and exchanges like GitHub are good places for support with AI projects.
3. Linear algebra and statistics
AI engineers need a strong grasp of applied mathematics fields such as linear algebra and statistics. Different models require an understanding of different mathematical concepts. Engineers must know how to apply derivatives and integrals to tackle gradient descent algorithms, while probability theory and Gaussian distributions are important for Hidden Markov models. A college-level mathematics education will often provide the skills necessary. 
4. Data literacy
An AI engineer’s work revolves around data, and data literacy is one of the most important skills to have when entering this field. AI engineers should be able to read, understand, analyze and apply data to various use cases.
Formal data science and statistics classes are useful, but the best practice is engaging with data projects first-hand, which is another reason why experienced tech workers may be good candidates to develop for the role. 
5. Critical thinking
“Soft” skills are also important in this field, although they are often harder to gauge. One of the most important soft skills in AI engineering is critical thinking.
AI models can be complicated, and the solution to a problem is rarely immediately evident. As a result, delivering timely and accurate results with these technologies requires a fast, creative approach to problem-solving. 
AI engineers must be able to think through multiple solutions and determine the best course of action.
6. Business acumen
A skill that is sometimes overlooked — but useful for AI engineers to have — is a strong grasp of business concepts. Operations optimization and product enhancement are the most common AI use cases for businesses, so AI engineers should understand how these processes work. Effective AI application requires an understanding of how the company operates.
AI is only as effective as its users’ ability to apply it to their end goals. Top-performing AI engineers know not just how to build functioning AI models, but also how these models can help businesses serve their unique needs. That means understanding general business concepts and company-specific considerations.
Engineers can develop their business acumen in formal courses and/or by working with colleagues in other departments.
7. Communication skills
Another crucial soft skill to have is communication. AI engineers must be able to explain to their non-technical colleagues how different AI solutions might help teams reach their goals.
A lack of understanding of how AI can benefit businesses is the second-largest barrier to adoption, according to Gartner, with 42% of chief information officers (CIOs) citing it as a problem. Knowing how to explain AI concepts will improve cooperation. 
As the technology becomes more important to a wider variety of business functions, AI engineers will work with more departments. They must be able to communicate with other workers effectively for these relationships to work. Presentation and summary skills are particularly critical.
8. Collaboration
Along those same lines, AI engineers must have excellent teamwork skills to thrive in the current market. This goes beyond telling other departments how to use AI models effectively. AI engineers must be open to feedback and cooperate with other workers to understand the challenges they face.
Many AI engineers also work in groups, even within their own departments and projects. If they are unable to work well with others, they will struggle to excel in the industry. Conversely, strong collaborative skills will help them find effective solutions faster.
Experience working in groups helps naturally build these skills, too, so prospective engineers should seek collaborative projects to improve in this area. The better they can work as part of a team, the more success they’ll have in the field.
9. Time management
Building, testing and deploying AI models is often a time-consuming process, and time management is vitally important.
 A recent study found that 83% of developers suffer from workplace burnout, with high workloads being the leading cause. While AI engineers may have little control over their workloads, they can adapt their habits to make the most of them. Of course, company culture and strong management are important for keeping such valuable professionals in peak form.
10. Experience with related technologies
Artificial intelligence engineers should also gain experience in related technologies. Gathering relevant data and deploying AI models will likely involve working with technologies like internet of things (IoT) devices, robotics and cloud computing. Most AI projects fail, and the lack of an integrated environment is one of the most common reasons. If AI engineers hope to deploy their models effectively, working across a company’s unique IT environment is important. That means understanding the various technologies they may use.
More staffing options
The AI engineer’s role is essential and in-demand, but the AI industry is developing tools and options to enable less-specialized workers to build out applications as well:
Low-code and no-code options enable less-skilled staff to develop use cases. AI vendors increasingly offer prepackaged vertical and horizontal market solutions.AI vendors are also cultivating business partners to offer still more prepackaged implementations.Using various visual and dashboard interfaces, AI vendors are enabling non-technical business analysts to craft simple applications.Consulting services are expanding to meet project-specific needs, especially.
Organizations will adapt their solutions to their size and resources, the strategic importance of their implementations and their staffing markets and philosophies, and AI skills will continue to be diffused across the wider tech environment. The role of the AI engineer is still gaining importance and will be key to many companies’ adoption of the technology.

The app has been downloaded more than 100 million times from the Google Play store, and it ranks 15th among social networking apps on Apple’s App Store.The switch from text messaging to secure apps like Signal is part of “a growing public awareness over the past half-decade of the harms and reality of the Big Tech surveillance business model,” Ms. Whittaker said in an interview. That awareness, she added, has led people to “make choices that reject that business model and work to preserve their privacy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSignal, which started in 2014 and attracted privacy-minded users from Silicon Valley, has grown into a mainstay messaging app. The service is free. Unlike other free apps, Signal has never raised venture capital funding or sold advertising.The nonprofit that maintains Signal is funded by donations — most notably a $50 million infusion in 2018 from Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp and Signal’s interim chief executive. (Mr. Acton left WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, in 2017 and has become a vocal critic of Meta.) Signal also collects donations from users, rewarding contributors with badges that they can display on their profiles.“Brian’s contribution helped lay a foundation where we have the room to work toward a broad base of support that sustains Signal for the long term,” Ms. Whittaker said. “It costs tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain Signal, and that’s a very lean budget compared to our competition.”Compared with the hundreds of people working on WhatsApp, Signal employs around 40 people.Ms. Whittaker, who did not provide her age, worked at Google as an artificial intelligence researcher for more than a decade. In 2018, she protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a military project that used artificial intelligence to interpret images gathered by drones, and its $90 million payout to an executive accused of sexual harassment.She left Google in 2019 and has since advised the F.T.C. chair, Lina Kahn, on artificial intelligence issues and researched artificial intelligence and ethics as a professor at New York University.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Whittaker said she planned to focus on policy as Congress weighed a bill that could require companies like Signal to break encryption and scan the contents of users’ messages.“To keep our privacy promises,” she said, “we need to keep our privacy designs robust.”Kate Conger is a technology reporter in the San Francisco bureau, where she covers the gig economy and social media.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Voice control: Give the people what they want 
Consumers, who are used to having answers at the tip of their fingers, have easily (and eagerly) adjusted to using their voice. The addition of artificial intelligence (AI) has made the transition seamless. Like web and mobile, voice is now transforming from just another interface into a distinct consumer channel. It is estimated that by 2024 the number of voice assistants will reach a staggering 8.4 billion, overtaking the world’s population. Further, the Voice Consumer Index 2021 surveyed technology users and found that one-third use voice technology daily. It is clear that voice technology is increasingly becoming an essential part of our day-to-day lives. The addition of voice user interfaces (VUIs) to appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators, will only further accelerate the trend within the home.  
AI around the home
Homes and devices are becoming more sophisticated and thus more difficult to operate seamlessly. Many appliances have deep feature sets that most users never access, thanks to the difficulty of the interface. With voice control, users don’t have to struggle with the microwave’s touchpad; they can simply say what they’re cooking and even save presets for favorite dishes. Users can tell the washing machine to be careful with delicate items, tell the kitchen faucet to fill a glass with water, and even tell the trash can to open itself when their hands are full.
While voice control is present today mainly on smart speakers and mobile devices, voice is prepared to go beyond that. Hardware and software advancements are making voice control practical for virtually any type of product. Industry efforts to increase voice service interoperability, or a device’s ability to support multiple voice assistants, can also be supported through design. Discreet or even invisible systems can be embedded into appliances, and new systems have immediate response times without cloud latency. 
The next iteration of voice control products will see increased integration of voice into standalone products that operate in different areas around the home. Some of these devices will utilize cloud technologies for their back-end intelligence, while others will keep interactions local at the edge. A new generation of sophisticated use cases awaits.  
Voice control for everyone
While every product is ready to host voice technology, there are still hurdles VUIs need to conquer before becoming equally useful for absolutely everyone.advertisement
One such hurdle is the need to accurately and consistently respond to people of different ages, with different dialects or speech disabilities. Thanks to machine learning, edge devices will become even more intelligent and useful over time. New systems will be able to better distinguish between different household voices, opening up new levels of personalization and security. Professional organizations like Black in AI, Women in Machine Learning and Women in Voice are working to increase the representation of diverse voices in AI, voice technology and machine learning. Organizations such as these will ultimately lead to greater innovation and inclusivity.
Users also need more support from brands in order to learn all that voice technology can do for them. Most users are simply stumbling upon voice experiences. Per the Voice Consumer Index 2021, many figure out how to have voice work for their household through basic trial-and-error, followed by tapping into relatives and friends, and then checking product packaging and websites. People want to do more with their voice assistants but are limited. Education is key to giving consumers what they already desire. 
AI-powered voice brings it all together advertisement
Voice is the unified method of control that helps all of these various devices work “together.” Voice makes the smart home smarter and easier to manage. Artificial intelligence, combined with machine learning, empowers devices to make an entire home ready to answer a user’s every beck and call. All that’s needed is a simple wake word or detectable sound. 
Algorithms are often the “secret sauce” that differentiates one voice control product from another, but this also leads to lack of interoperability. Devices that fail to work well together make simple tasks more difficult and are a top reason for consumer frustration. As the market matures, consumers will choose devices that can offer an integrated experience. To answer this demand, manufacturers will need to choose components, dev kits and SDKs that support voice service interoperability to allow customers to seamlessly talk to the service of their choice.
The alignment of market groups to a single standard, such as Matter, will facilitate the deployment of smart devices in the home. Standards give users the confidence that their chosen smart devices will reliably work together while taking the guesswork out of the purchasing process. Ultimately, any consumer will have the option of a connected home that is secure and seamless. 
The future of voice control will bring the freedom to speak voice commands without needing a smart speaker nearby. With the right support, voice technology will easily become a primary method of communication.

Since Boston Dynamics made its bright yellow robot, Spot, available to the general public to purchase in June 2020, the famously agile robo-dog has gone from cute-yet-creepy quadruped to must-have-helper on the factory floor and in industrial facilities. 
Now, recently-released updates to Spot make gaining data insights a top priority, while Spot’s chief engineer, Zack Jackowski, says researchers are making strides in their long-term efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into Spot.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



An out-of-the-box experience
The biggest overall difference in Spot’s latest software update, he told VentureBeat, is that the Boston Dynamics team packaged the robot’s applications into a more out-of-the-box experience. 
Historically, robots have been a great platform for developers, but now an operations team without a robotics team can buy a Spot, he explained. “Our typical customer last year was an innovation team at a really large enterprise that has some robotics experience –- they’re able to fend for themselves programming-wise and figure out how to fill in some of the missing pieces of a workflow,” he explained. 
Now, with the new software update, the team is starting to work with direct users of an inspection robot, such as a maintenance team along with an IT team. 
“They can get that robot and install it without writing any code themselves, without worrying about whether they can work this machine,” he said. “It’s built for maintenance personnel to be able to program missions, and for a non-robotic specialist IT department to be able to integrate that data into the rest of their systems.” 
Spot’s current AI for data collection
There is currently no artificial intelligence used for Spot’s walking control over how the robot plans paths and understands the world around it. “We use pretty conventional non-AI techniques in those systems, because we know how to work with those really well and they’re very predictable,” Jackowski said. 
However, AI can solve important problems when it comes to the data the robot collects, which Boston Dynamics does with a variety of partner companies, including IBM and startups such as Levatas. 
“For example, we use AI for reading analog gauges at industrial facilities,” said Jackowski. “You have to read the numbers of the gauges to figure out what a piece of equipment is doing –- that’s an AI problem to figure out exactly what that gauge is saying.” 
AI also helps Spot around thermal anomaly detection. “We’re training AI models to look at a piece of equipment with a thermal camera and understand if there’s an abnormal condition,” he said. 
Boston Dynamics’ long-term AI goals
For the use of AI, one of the big robotics challenges is that right now Spot perceives the world pretty simply, as geometry, he added. 
When humans look around, he explained, they can see a toolbox or a hose and understand what those objects mean. “They know that it probably belongs to someone or I shouldn’t step on it or that it will move when I step on it,” he said. advertisement
That means there is a lot of promise for semantic understanding, he explained –- that is, understanding what objects mean in the context of everyday life to make the robots work better. That is coming for Spot, but “it’s a little ways off,” he said. “There’s still a lot to be done to get that kind of stuff into a product that’s ready for mass market deployment,” he added, including understanding what features customers need and product testing. 
One example of Boston Dynamics’ efforts in AI research was the launch in mid-August of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Boston Dynamics AI Institute to “spearhead advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics.” The Institute was started with over $400 million of initial investment from Boston Dynamics and Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ parent company) and will focus on four core areas: cognitive AI, athletic AI, organic hardware design and robot ethics.
A bright future for Boston Dynamics’ Spot
Since Boston Dynamics’ Spot was revealed in 2016, Jackowski said the company has “changed public perception and just showed the art of the possible.” 
But, he added that he and his team are most excited about making robotics useful to the enterprise. advertisement
For example, Boston Dynamics client GlobalFoundries, a semiconductor manufacturer based in Burlington, Vermont, “is doing some super-exciting work with Spots right now,” said Jackowski.  
“They actually have Spot walking around their basement and taking thermal images of all these pieces of support equipment that processes the wafers, to identify before something fails completely so they can do preventive maintenance,” he said. “It’s really exciting for us to go from hey, there are some robots out in the world and we’ve got some really cool videos to hey, there’s multiple thousands of these in industrial facilities doing real work for people.” 
The rest of 2022, he added, will “probably be pretty subdued –- we’re actually pretty careful about how frequently we roll out new software to our customers because they’re starting to really rely on the jobs that the robots are doing and are hesitant to take software updates that might change things they didn’t expect.” 
Another big feature release, with a couple of specific AI-powered features, will likely come in early 2023. “But right now our top focus is 100% on customer success and deployment into day-to-day operation in our customers’ facilities,” he said.
