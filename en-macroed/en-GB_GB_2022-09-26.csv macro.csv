The ramifications of advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) are being felt further afield than anyone expected. A.I. perhaps entered the public consciousness in the 1990s thanks to chess competitions, but it's now infiltrating art competitions and, soon, the written word. Some commercial offerings can provide paragraphs of text based on brief prompts, keywords, and tone parameters. Users of Google's email service have, of course, been microdosing on A.I. since 2018, when Gmail rolled out Smart Compose. What these developments bring home is that people in the so-called ""creative class"" are now facing the first-person reckoning that automation has long presented to blue-collar workers: Technology is going to radically change the way we work. As an analyst at a think tank, my job consists of processing policy trends, formulating new ideas to tackle economic and social problems, and advancing them through the written word. If programs like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Voyager can already captivate human audiences, I haven't the slightest doubt that my modest ability to metabolize the policy landscape, reason my way to novel solutions, and manipulate language in provocative, engaging ways will soon be matched—and then surpassed—by A.I. programs designed for the task.  Powered By                         00:00/00:5010 Sec      AP Top Stories July 19 A         NextStay    


While I am under no illusion that my work merits any blue ribbons, putting thoughts into words that persuade or stir emotion entails a certain artistry. It's an engrossing and gratifying process, one from which I derive identity. When I contemplate that a computer could soon do it better, I, like the Lancashire handloom weavers of the early 19th century, feel more than a bit threatened.  Garry Kasparov dealt with this conundrum two decades ago and has had a head start in managing the prospect of obsolescence. Kasparov, an all-time great chess player, had the distinction of holding the world title just at the same moment that computer chess programs ramped up their prowess. In 1996, Kasparov beat what was then the strongest chess engine ever created, IBM's Deep Blue. But as he recounts in his memoir, Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins, he knew then that his reign would soon end. Indeed, in a 1997 rematch for which Kasparov was handsomely compensated, an updated Deep Blue brought the age of A.I. to global attention, dealing the champion a stunning defeat in the match's decisive sixth game. In Deep Thinking, published in 2017, Kasparov explains how his perspective on A.I. has evolved and why. Despite the anguish the 1997 loss caused him, he views A.I. as one of the greatest opportunities for humanity to advance its well-being. The reason is that Kasparov has observed in the intervening years that the highest level of performance, on the chessboard and elsewhere, is reached when humans work with smart machines. After Deep Blue's programmers established that it could see deeper into the game than the human mind, Kasparov and a group of partners came up with a new concept: What if instead of human vs. machine, people played against one another but with the assistance of chess software? They called the new style of play ""advanced chess,"" and the outcomes surprised Kasparov. It wasn't the player with the best chess software that necessarily won, nor was it the best human player. Rather, the top performers were the players who were able to use the machines most effectively, those who were able to get the most out of the chess engines and their own creative abilities. Operating on the premise of Moravec's Paradox, i.e., where machines are strong is where humans are weak and vice versa, what Kasparov took away from the advanced chess experiment is that a clever working process beats both superior human talent and superior technological horsepower. The same insight can be leveraged by artists, composers, writers, designers, and the like. Rather than viewing A.I. as the end of our livelihoods, we ought to see the opportunities it presents for better work. For the creative class, the answer to the A.I. challenge is to make the most of the programs available to us. Is artistry lost because of A.I., or is it unlocked, as we are freed from some of the more formulaic structuring processes that drain energy? By delegating these aspects of creation to A.I., I anticipate having more mental space available to generate the rhetorical flourishes and the witty bits of embroidery that make writing enjoyable. Yes, people deploying A.I. in the writing world, art competitions, and elsewhere will likely face scorn. But while a level playing field is appropriate in defined competitions, in open-ended fields to accuse a rival of cheating would be no more meaningful than in that of the textile industry. For the intrepid writer, A.I. will create opportunities to produce better work at a faster clip, just as the power loom did for the weavers of Lancashire. Rather than fear, and certainly rather than Luddite suppression, this ought to be a moment of optimism. A.I. is coming for our jobs. Its arrival, however, will not be a harbinger of obsolescence but a catalyst for greater achievement.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is fuelling a new revolution in medicine and in the health care sector, primarily for image analysis and disease modelling, but its impact on people’s health is still limited, according to a new study by the Universitat Politècnica de València and WHO in the International Journal of Medical Informatics. AI is used in several ways in health care, from molecular and genetics testing to medical imaging, diagnostic codes analysis, and in infectious disease outbreak predictions as part of health emergencies protection programmes. However, its application remains limited and is used most often only in laboratories and testing, the study says, noting, “Despite the great advances and the high level of maturity of AI in certain clinical domains, the review of systematic reviews concludes that the use of AI is still scarce in clinical practice.”Dr Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Director of the Division of Country Health Policies and Systems at WHO/Europe, and Dr David Novillo-Ortiz, Regional Advisor on Data and Digital Health, are among the authors of the paper, together with experts from the Universitat Politècnica de València in Spain. The paper reviewed 129 studies and systematic reviews to reach its conclusions. Digital data interventions can enhance population health AI can provide powerful tools to automate tasks and support and inform clinicians, epidemiologists and policy-makers on the most efficient strategies to promote health at a population and individual level, the paper says.Looking ahead, the paper also notes that the use of digital data has the potential to improve people’s health and well-being and to protect them better from emergencies. At the same time, it says digital data should be boosted by the use of “machine learning algorithms in population-based, clinical decision-making with the use of big data and new communication technologies”.Many of the reviews concluded that AI and machine learning “will play an important role helping clinicians to identify specific indicators”, leading to better diagnosis, treatment and outcomes, but methodological aspects should be duly considered to make real progress in benefitting science and, therefore, universal health care. Health care systems will be able to improve the quality of universal health coverage and better respond to emergencies in the future through AI modelling, the authors note. In a related development, WHO/Europe reported earlier this year that “advances in big data and artificial intelligence have opened new opportunities for monitoring health and fighting noncommunicable diseases, or NCDs”.

Concerns over copyright and artists’ livelihoods have caused photography agencies to remove images created by artificial intelligence models from their databases.
The worries come from the fact that the AIs hoover up vast amounts of human-generated art to train themselves and use this database of knowledge to generate photorealistic images related to almost any text prompt. This has led to ethical debate and highlighted the legislative grey area about who owns the…

By now you’ve seen at least one headline about how Artificial Intelligence will do away with all our jobs. And to some degree it’s true. The change has already been happening for years now and will continue to do so. But the job loss we’ll see due to these emerging technologies is not the biggest threat to our jobs and what we consider “normal” employment. The very nature of work is changing, and that’s what we must prepare for. That’s the real threat.
And really, will we lose that many jobs that aren’t replaced with new ones? Gartner predicts 2020 will be a big year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), with 2.3 million jobs created while 1.8 million are eliminated. But we’re still 500,000 ahead, and the jobs created will be higher-value, skilled jobs while those eliminated will be repetitive, low-skill tasks. That should make AI a little less scary.
Even when we see the math, however, we’re still nervous because it’s a big unknown. One in four Americans believes their job will be eliminated in the next 20 years. One in eight believes it will happen in the next 5 years.
Is AI all Bad? 
Although it’s scary, AI is not all doom and gloom. AI will make life better, and not just for the many businesses that will streamline processes, decrease errors and reduce costs by implementing AI technology. We already enjoy some of the benefits of AI in our personal lives when we rely on our smartphones and smart homes. Our world is now a safer place with AI used in aviation and for security. In the future, AI will improve the efficiencies of our cities, our healthcare, and maybe even the health of the environment. It promises to do away with drudgery and make more meaningful work possible, and that in and of itself is huge.
Speaking of work, AI is also creating jobs and will create more, as Gartner predicted. One study found jobs were created at the majority of companies that had implemented AI. As smart as AI might be, the technology still needs people to make it work. In fact, we already have a shortage of skilled employees: every year we have more AI jobs posted—and not enough qualified applicants to fill on the roles.
If AI Isn’t Scary, What Is? 
Despite all this good news, we’re still nervous. AI is scary to us because we fear the job loss, but AI isn’t the big threat. What’s really scary is the speed at which everything is changing, the unknowns that loom on the horizon, and that permanent full-time jobs will no longer be the norm. The very nature of work is changing. That’s what is so scary.
As technology evolves, the rate at which it involves increases. In 2001, the futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that we will experience 20,000 years of progress during this century as the result of the accelerating rate of change. It can be near impossible for us to know then what the future holds, including what jobs might be available to us. The World Economic Forum predicts 65 percent of our children will have jobs that don’t yet exist when they grow up.
One thing that’s for sure: We won’t have the kinds of jobs we have now—at least not in the way we have them now. One article flat out states, “In the future, employees won’t exist.” As the article points out, it’s not just the businesses like Uber that have business models built on contractors; even big companies like Microsoft use huge numbers of contractors—with almost as many contractors as regular full-time employees.
Contract work is already normal. Call it the 1099 economy, the freelance economy, the gig economy—whatever you call it, it means we already have more than one-third of people in the U.S. (36 percent) working at jobs other than the norm. That’s 57 million people. By 2027, over half the U.S. population of working age will be freelancing. Ironically, some companies are currently hiring more IT freelancers to keep up with the AI demand, and using AI to do it.
Part of this is by choice. The younger generation that now makes up the majority of the workforce in the U.S. places a higher value on autonomy than pay. They would rather be able to work remotely with flexible schedules than give up freedom in exchange for a salary. That makes a contractor-based workforce appealing to them.
But part of it is driven by economics and the money businesses save by using contracted rather than full-time permanent employees. Gallup distinguishes between independent gig workers who have work autonomy and control—what you would consider the true freelancer who is doing this by choice—and the second group known as the contingent gig workers. They are the ones working side-by-side with regular employees but without the benefits and pay, like at this Nissan plant where some “temporary” workers have been employed for years without the benefits their permanent colleagues enjoy.
These are not anomalies, but trends illustrating what the future will be like. And it’s clear that work as we know it is going away.
4 Ways to Prepare Yourself for a World Without Work as We Know It
If the world of work as we currently know it is going to change and we can’t be sure how, what can we do? We can assume there’s a good chance we’re going to work as contractors and freelancers, and prepare ourselves accordingly. We can choose to be proactive. These four steps should help:
1. Keep learning.
Learning is going to be key to future success. One pundit goes so far as to say, if you’re not spending 5 hours per week learning, you’re being irresponsible. What should you learn? You could focus your learning on the need for AI professionals, and decide to pursue a career in AI to safeguard yourself. Or learn about other technologies with a shortage of qualified applicants, such as data science and cybersecurity. Note also that soft skills such as communication and problem-solving will continue to be in demand, so you could also improve in those areas to be ready for whatever the future brings. It matters less what you’re learning and more that you’re constantly expanding your skillset and knowledge, to be ready for what might lie ahead.
2. Manage your finances.
As one Forbes contributor puts it in an article titled “How To Build A Successful Career In A Future Without Jobs,” you must be your own money manager when permanent, full-time employment is no longer an option. You’ll need money saved to cover the dry spells when work is sparse, and a solid budget for managing money when work is abundant. You might be in charge of your own health insurance, and chances are you’ll be responsible for your own retirement too. Already we see fewer companies offer pension plans and we can expect that number to keep decreasing.  
3. Build your brand.
Build your personal brand, because that’s going to be much more important than your résumé in the new working world. Be online. Have a strong LinkedIn profile. Be visible and involved, definitely online and in person if you can. The stronger your brand, the more easily you find work later.
4. Actively build and maintain your network.
While you’re building your personal brand, also be building your network. You’d be surprised to discover how many people you’re already connected to. Expand upon that to connect to other people who might be good resources for job leads in the future, should you find yourself working as part of the freelance economy.
AI will transform our world in many ways, but it won’t be the main reason we’re likely to go without the permanent, full-time jobs our parents had. The very nature of work is changing. That is what we must be ready for, and the sooner, the better.

With IT spending projected to total $4.5 trillion in 2022, it’s clear that cutting-edge technology is on every IT executive’s wish list this year. However, while investing in emerging technology is essential, businesses can’t beat the competition by simply increasing tech spending. IT leaders must create foolproof strategies that consider what these new technologies will do and how they will upskill workers to use them.
Additionally, inflation will severely impact IT budgets as vendors adjust prices for the current market. Consequently, CIOs must be selective when choosing digital solutions.
So which technologies will win in 2022 and beyond? Those that empower businesses to capitalize on existing technology infrastructure. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and a hybrid intelligence (HI) approach can bridge skills gaps in a workforce and help workers fundamentally change how they work and interact with technology.
The skills gap is wider than ever
IT skills gaps continue to threaten industry resilience. According to Salesforce, nearly 75 percent of employees feel ill-equipped to learn the digital skills necessary for the future of work. Yet despite these concerns, only 28 percent are involved in digital skills learning and training programs.

This gap is concerning, but there is an opportunity to address this issue, grow employee skill sets, and make day-to-day tasks more meaningful and productive.
CIOs now face a dual challenge: They need to upskill their workforces while meeting increased demand for innovation and keep the organization competitive by implementing advanced technologies into key business functions while dealing with aging and cumbersome legacy systems.
These challenges are closely related, and CIOs should consider them together. Start by asking: What will the reimagined workforce look like when they have access to the full potential of AI and IoT?
Hybrid intelligence and the reimagined workforce
AI is evolving, as is its pivotal role in reshaping the technology workforce as we know it. As technology advances, so do the expectations of employees’ skill sets. To remain competitive, employees must focus on driving strategic changes in the enterprise rather than busy work.
 There is great potential in combining AI with human intelligence to create a hybrid approach that can dramatically increase the accuracy and efficiency of decisions across the enterprise.
Luckily, there is great potential in combining AI with human intelligence to create a hybrid approach that can dramatically increase the accuracy and efficiency of decisions across the enterprise.
By introducing AI to the workforce, IT leaders can provide a new partner to assist workers in ways that were not previously possible. For example, AI unlocks new types of insights that a human with linear optimization would not be able to create. Therefore, AI steps in as a digital mentor and prompts workers to adopt new processes and ways of thinking.

In addition, AI can empower executives by creating autonomy for decision-making to solve complex problems through analytics and optimization. AI also frees up workers’ and managers’ time, enabling them to focus on the higher-value, strategic tasks that C-level executives expect from their teams.
Finally, AI requires training and interaction with human workers to become increasingly efficient. Therefore, in a hybrid intelligence environment, workers do not only use AI tools but also participate in training them.
Building hybrid intelligence
Many people misunderstand AI as a technology that will replace jobs – but instead, AI will transform existing roles in incredible ways. As a result, leaders will need to develop new roles for those who work with AI, such as teachers, collaborators, and innovators.

Workers interacting with AI will not do so in a silo; these teams will be cross-functional and empowered to think quickly, innovate better, and work together to achieve various goals. These roles reflect the business advantages of AI: It enables leaders and employees to collaborate more effectively, transforming and reshaping work as we know it.
One of the most critical skills employees will need to develop is teaching AI if it is to reach its full potential as an equal partner in the hybrid intelligence environment. The teaching process can be simple and will not always require workers to develop special skills. But managing complex use cases and creating opportunities to enhance productivity will require employees to upskill considerably.
For example, leaders must recognize the importance of repeatedly performing, verifying, and documenting actions to improve AI tools. In this way, AI can become even more helpful by creating more accurate diagnostic results and predictive insights necessary for business functionality.
As human experts and AI become increasingly active in the hybrid intelligence environment, the scope and nature of the work AI can perform will become more diverse and advanced. IT hiring, in turn, will become more tied to more sophisticated, knowledge-based work.
But first, leaders must equip teams with the right mindset to help AI reach its full potential. Only then will AI be capable of creating opportunities for more dynamic roles that will rapidly transform organizations and help them to stay relevant and resilient for years to come.

Mayo Clinic and nference have expanded their artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaboration with the launch of a new platform that will leverage de-identified EHR data to increase access to data-derived insights.







The platform, known as nSights, aims to advance research, drug discovery, and clinical care. Developed by nference, it provides biopharma, medical device companies, and diagnostic firms with de-identified EHR data across a wide range of disease states, according to the press release.
The platform represents an expansion of Mayo Clinic's 12-year relationship with nference. The company's partners and customers will gain access to Mayo Clinic Platform's de-identified data across various specialties, such as cardiology, oncology, and immunology, through nSights. 
The platform offers data exploration, analytics, and data science capabilities, including algorithm development. It combines various types of patient data, such as clinical notes, electrocardiograms, and radiology images. The data is collected in real time and anonymously, which helps limit bias and recall mistakes, the press release notes.
Further, the platform includes a data dictionary, enabling users to create new patient-level features for analysis.
New versions of the nSights platform will include digital pathology and genomics, the press release states.
“The potential of electronic health data remains locked at medical centers and is frequently under-leveraged due to data complexity, privacy, and security concerns,” said Mike Koenig, chief commercial officer at nference, in a press release. ""Our expanded collaboration with Mayo Clinic Platform provides the framework for nference’s deployment of nSights and enables our customers to access de-identified ‘patient-level’ data to drive research and development of new therapeutics. I look forward to continuing to build and fortify our partnership with the Mayo Clinic team as we work together to improve healthcare through data-derived insights and knowledge.""
Further, nference has built a Mayo Clinic-branded version of nSights, called Mayo Clinic Platform_Discover.
“Over the past year, our collaboration with nference, leveraging nSights, has accelerated clinical decision support and care in significant ways,"" said Maneesh Goyal, chief operating officer, Mayo Clinic Platform, in a press release. ""Data-derived insights and knowledge help us accelerate and enhance innovation and meet the unmet needs of patients everywhere.”
Several healthcare organizations are applying AI solutions to the treatment process for various conditions.
In August, researchers from the UT Southwestern Medical Center created an AI algorithm that could predict the role of the regulatory elements of DNA. Researchers noted that this information might help combat genetic diseases.
University of California-San Diego researchers created an AI-based machine-learning algorithm to differentiate between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and Kawasaki Disease, which share similar underlying molecular patterns, to enable early detection of the diseases.

“There are some amazing sides to the use of the internet and social media: never before have we had access to so much information and culture. I think it’s important not only to control how many hours we spend using technological devices but, above all, to be discerning about what kind of content we look at,” says Castellanos, photographed here.
Nazareth Castellanos has a degree in theoretical physics and a PhD in neuroscience from the Faculty of Medicine at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) and has spent over 20 years researching brain activity at prestigious universities such as King’s College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany. In recent years, she has focused on what happens in the brain when we meditate and the relationship between the brain and the rest of the body. Aside from publishing the results of her laboratory research in scientific journals, she also widely shares her work through her social media networks, lectures, courses and books, such as El espejo del cerebro (The Mirror of the Brain) published by La Huerta Grande in 2021. We talked to her about all this, and much more, via videoconference.
Your outreach work establishes a dialogue between scientific knowledge, Eastern philosophy and the spiritual realm, challenging binary conceptions and scientific dogma – already superseded by physics – that radically separates mind and body. This has many ramifications, such as analysing the link between the brain and other parts of the body, particularly the heart and the intestine.
It is important for us to understand that this binary view, which categorically separates body and mind, is actually quite new. In a few months, a book of mine will be published in which I review the history of scientific medicine, which began in Ancient Greece. And if we look back at Hippocrates or Galen, the fathers of this medicine, we see that they already have the idea that mind and body are related, that the mind is not only the brain. Hippocrates considers the brain to be a privileged organ, but he does not exclude the rest of the body from psychology. The fragmented view emerged in the 17th century, with René Descartes, and although it brought with it a number of major benefits, such as the consolidation of the scientific method, what we cannot do is deny the other. What I was seeing is that accessing our mental states is often very difficult: it is easier to enter through the body, to start meditating by paying attention to the breath and bodily sensations. It is easier to change everyday habits than to change mindsets. It makes no sense to sit and meditate for hours and then have a terrible diet, a sedentary lifestyle or habits that punish the body. We have to find a balance between mind and body; it is not about unification but dialogue.
You cite an experiment in which a group of diabetics are given drinks: some are labelled ‘sugar-free’ and some are labelled ‘with sugar’. None of the drinks, in fact, have sugar in them, but the blood sugar levels varied according to what was written on the label. So, what we think has an impact on our organism and, similarly, our diet influences how we think, and even how we behave. 
Absolutely. As Saint Augustine said, we are made of soil that is hard to cultivate. If we do not feed it properly, we cannot expect much fruit. Hildegard von Bingen, a physician from the Middle Ages who practised medicine in a holistic way, using music and plants, pointed to the error of sacrificing the body, through flagellation, to reach ascension. How can we hope for a calm mindset if we cultivate that soil with fertilisers that only bring out weeds? I often tell of how, when I lived in Madrid, I used to see people having breakfast on the metro in the morning and I would think: ‘My goodness, these people are going to have a hard time getting through the day’. There is ample scientific evidence of the link between the gut-brain axis and how it influences our behaviour, our relationships with others and learning mechanisms: that is why nutrition during pregnancy and childhood is so important. Without going to extremes, of course: as with everything, balance is best.
Talking of bad habits, there are those who warn of our misuse of new technologies, especially social media and other applications that scatter our attention. What’s more, some scientists are already talking about the internet soon being connected to our brains, generating something like cyborgs, a hybrid of machine and organism. What is your view on this?
Regarding the first part of your question, I think that the press often gives too negative a view. There are some amazing sides to the use of the internet and social media: never before have we had access to so much information and culture. I think it’s important not only to control how many hours we spend using technological devices but, above all, to be discerning about what kind of content we look at. I do not, however, agree with the technological invasion of the human body that you spoke of; that’s posthumanism. I believe we should invest less in artificial intelligence and more in natural intelligence. The advantage, I believe, is that we are likely to see a humanism emerge in response to that posthumanism, and it will be very enriching.
Another fundamental idea is that the brain does not forget, but substitutes. We cannot force ourselves to stop thinking about something; it has the opposite effect. As a journalist, this makes me think about the mistakes that can be made when writing about concepts such as climate change and the ecological crisis: very negative approaches can reinforce what they are trying to combat.
I think that, as journalists, you have a huge social role that you sometimes neglect. I fully understand when someone tells me that they would rather watch gossip shows than a news programme that constantly tells us how horrible humankind is. Because what happens is that the news is exceptional; it wouldn’t be news, otherwise. So, something terrible happens and, as it is the only thing that is shown, our internal representation of reality is based solely on this information. It would be different if you gave that news but also made it clear that a huge part of humankind is good. To give an example: studies show that the most successful smoking cessation campaigns are those with positive messages; instead of ‘Smoking kills’, for example, ‘You will be fitter if you stop smoking’. The image we have of ourselves is important; if it is too defeatist, change is difficult.
Similarly, it would be interesting if our education system were to teach us how the brain and emotions work...
Absolutely. In Greece, but also in other cultures, the maxim is ‘Know thyself’. I have studied for 30 years and no one has ever told me: observe how you are, how your body reacts, how you regulate your emotions. The education system should be more open to the intimacy of the self; and great contemporary philosophers are already emphasising this.
Meditation is a fundamental part of your research. What does it show us about consciousness, about how the division between the conscious and the unconscious works?
It shows us that almost everything is a constant waltz between the voluntary and the involuntary, between the conscious and the unconscious. When I meditate, I look at myself; it’s not about analysing, it’s about observing. Neuroscience shows us what happens in the brain and how inner observation modifies brain activity, certain areas age more slowly and there is a correlation with certain mental health and psychological wellbeing indicators. In conclusion: let’s stop for a while and, instead of operating so many machines, let’s dedicate some time to that inner observation. What the ancients knew is now proven by science: a mind that wanders is an unhappy mind.
Finally, I would like to talk about the differences in the brains of men and women: how much gender bias and how much scientific evidence underlies these differences?
I am doing research on this at the moment, and what science shows is that there are differences between men and women. Brain activity is pretty much the same until the start of the hormonal processes during adolescence, and as of then, there are many differences. On a cognitive level, we have the same capacities for memory, attention and learning; but the fact that we can do the same things does not mean that we have the same brain: we arrive at the same result with neural networks that are different. This difference gives rise to nuances that enrich humankind in general: there are things that seem to evolve more optimally in men and others in women. Although we are very similar in cognitive terms, men have greater capacities for coordination and movement, while women are more capable in the areas of social cognition and empathy. There are studies that show brain activity in reaction to images of people experiencing different emotions: in men, two areas of the brain are activated; in women, nine. Moreover, what science is showing is that these differences are not just cultural but phylogenetic and ontogenetic. Obviously, I am talking about averages but, in any case, these are differences that enrich the human species and should not be hidden in the name of equality. Equality should not destroy diversity: equality yes, but of rights. If women are better able to predict and understand the state of another person, this is fundamental at leadership level. Louann Brizendine, a pioneer in research on gender differences in the brain, puts it like this: as women, we are here to keep social harmony. I find that mission an honour and, I believe, now that women are increasingly present in the world of work, that’s a place we can contribute from too.

A Critic's Notebook
The Voyage Begins: Using Midjourney in Architecture
Aaron Betsky on artificial intelligence-driven software and the game-changing work of architect Cesare Battelli.

“This will be the year of AI,” one of my colleagues at Virginia Tech proclaimed rather grandly as we assembled for the new school year a few weeks ago. “And I am not sure we are equipped for it.” What he meant was that a host of new artificial intelligence-driven software programs and apps, most prominently Midjourney and Dall-E, are now so widely available that our students will be—and, as became evident very quickly, already are—producing images with a lushness, range of references, and sophistication that indeed threaten some of the basic tenets of teaching. What does it mean that students can create images in a few hours that on the surface are so much more accomplished than anything their teachers have ever made? Is it even their work or that of an algorithm? How do we judge what we see?In some ways, the debate is an extension of the discussions that ensued way back in the First Silicon Age of the early 1990s (akin to the Stone Age in modern time reckoning) when students began unleashing their blobs and meshes on virtual drafting tables, often with far more skill than their fuddy-duddy professors. In other ways, though, something new is indeed here for us to reckon with: The images produced by Midjourney and Dall-E have a degree of realism, a range of painterly effects, and a way of plugging into the history and traditions of architecture that cloaks their novel mode of production with disarming familiarity. The images also often beat those arguing for hand-drawing and modeling techniques at their own game. The work looks more hand-made, more realistic and more crafted, more knowing in its references, and grander in its ambitions than the collection of swoops and swerves we have come to understand as the marks of computer technology.To get a sense of the possibilities, you need only turn to the recent work of the Madrid-based Italian architect Cesare Battelli. A former collaborator of Enric Miralles, who was trained at Frankfurt’s Städelschule when that school was a hotbed of both technological and image innovation under Peter Cook, he has for the last decade concentrated on being a “visionary architect,” as he says. Six months ago, he began using Midjourney and posting some of the results on social media. They are some of the most sophisticated architectural images I have seen in the last few years.

The best of them, like the series that ensued from Battelli prompting the software to render the “Tower of Babel under construction,” show a world in which scaffolding and the fragments of finished forms wrap around each other to produce buildings that change from solid objects to ephemera as they rise up into the sky. The scenes Battelli produces almost always consist of such unfinished structures, all loosely connected and spreading out across the virtual page in a sepia-tinted continuum. Small and indistinct figures toil away at the structures or admire them from below. Bits and pieces of machines push out of parts of the buildings. In other series, where Battelli combined prompts for a particular building type with animals such as sea horses or tigers, curved covers that might be roofs or walls turn into shapes that evoke the fauna before your eyes—all without ever being distinct enough to be completely recognizable. Diving into Battelli’s images, you concentrate on elements you think you know, from construction pieces to walls to hides, only to watch them melt into something else before you can focus on the particular properties of a part.

The images produced by Midjourney and Dall-E have a degree of realism, a range of painterly effects, and a way of plugging into the history and traditions of architecture that cloaks their novel mode of production with disarming familiarity.

What binds these fragments together is not only how the algorithms do not respect the finished and distinct aspect of any of the inputs, instead continually developing or fading them together but also the atmospherics (a kind of romantic sauce) that makes Midjourney both more fairy tale in its appearance and more sophisticated than most of the other readily available software. Battelli incorporates phrases such as “in the manner of” and “in the style of” in his prompts and has a penchant for a particular range of early Renaissance Italian painters, including Giotto and Botticelli. He adds the hazy skies and attenuated forms of Tintoretto and Veronese to the mix but also calls on compendiums of scientific data produced during that period as reference material. These references give the images their sense of emerging out of a Western art history tradition that removes the science fiction or romance novel aspect that overwhelms most of the other Midjourney work.Battelli is particularly fond of the obscure artist Monsù Desiderio, a painter working in Naples during the early 17th century. Virtually nothing about him is known, and the name might even indicate the work of three different artists originally from Germany and France. “He is a ghost,” Battelli says, “whose work is also spectral.” A proto-surreal collection of ruins and construction sites, explosions, fires, and refined structures, Desiderio’s images indeed presage the collage-like sensibility that AI programs generate.So what is it that Battelli does? He uses a palette that consists not of paint or pixels but rather of references. He is becoming increasingly skilled at choosing sources to create the effects he wants. It is, he says, a way of “alchemically creating something unexpected,” made possible because he works “on the threshold” where images and ideas solidify. He calls the result a product of imagination, distinguishing that evocation from utopian or dystopian visions because it works on and with existing images and forms. It is thus an advanced mode of collage that takes pre-formed materials and assembles them into a snapshot of intensified relations and compacted juxtaposition. Through the unifying tendencies of Midjourney, that collage, which is the Western tradition would usually remain a collection of distinct elements, is smoothed into something that denies its own fragmentary origins.

Recently Battelli has also been able to have Midjourney produce what appear to be wood models of some of his drawings. Now he is imagining that he might take these artifacts and continue them in balsa wood and glue, extending what currently exists only on the screen into the three-dimensional world. The models might then, he hopes, become part of a collage we can inhabit in the mode of an art installation. I can easily imagine one of my students taking a photograph or a video of that work and asking Midjourney to produce an image of their thesis project in the style of Cesare Battelli. Or an architect asking his computer to produce an image of the office building he is designing in the style of Battelli channeling Desiderio. The possibilities are endless, and, I for one, am pretty excited by the extension of architecture that artificial intelligence is opening.This article has been updated.The views and conclusions from this author are not necessarily those of ARCHITECT magazine or of The American Institute of Architects.Read more: The latest from Aaron Betsky includes walking the streets of the Postmodern ""theme park"" that is Portmeirion, exploring Assemble's neighborhood activism in Liverpool, and weighing in on an addition to a Neo-Brutalist monument in Boston.

Almost every industry in today's world, including healthcare, education, business, and automobiles, is growing rapidly. Thanks to AI. Smartphones and other home equipment, it has even made their way into our homes, simplifying our lives. Due to the increase in demand for AI, professional opportunities have increased as well, with most of them providing excellent compensation.But, before we proceed to Career Paths in Artificial Intelligence, let’s have a brief understanding of AI and what is its scope and future in India.What is meant by Artificial Intelligence?In simple words, Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with intelligent beings. It is basically a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI is often used interchangeably with its subfields, Machine Learning and Deep Learning but they are not the same though closely related.Scope and Future of Artificial Intelligence:Although AI is still in its infancy in India, the future seems quite bright. Organizations are searching for employees with AI expertise as it is rapidly expanding its wings across every industry.It is anticipated that over the next few years, there would hardly be any industry in India which is left untouched by this technological innovation. That is why the country has a great deal of potential for AI as a career.Career Paths in Artificial Intelligence:1. Big Data Analyst:The role of a Big Data Analyst is to find meaningful patterns in data by looking at the past and making predictions about the future. As a Data Analyst, he/she should be familiar with a variety of tools and Programming languages and must possess Data mining and Data auditing skills. 2. Research Scientist: A research scientist is an expert in applied mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, and computational statistics and conducts lab-based trials and experiments. He/she is expected to have an advanced degree in Computer Science or an advanced degree in a related field. 3. Business Intelligence (BI) Developer: The primary role of Business Intelligence Developers is to employ data analytics and technology to recognize different business and market trends. They also create and maintain company software tools used to guide business strategies. BI Developer is one of the fastest growing roles as almost every company with data needs at least one person who understands Business Intelligence. 4. Robotics Engineer: With the emergence of robotics in the field of AI, there will be an incessant demand for Robotics Engineers by major industries for programming their machines. They are in charge of creating, constructing, and testing robots or robotics systems that carry out tasks that people are either unable to accomplish or would prefer not to. 5. Software Engineer:A software engineer is the one who is responsible for developing programs in which AI tools functions. He/she has extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems. They apply their engineering principles to creating software. Although a job in artificial intelligence offers a vast range of potential applications and tremendous growth opportunities, it is also very competitive. The positions in this field are quite specialized and call for a high level of technical training in addition to a lot of practical experience.",,,,,,,,en,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/94510631'}"

A bill that would require federal officials involved with procuring artificial intelligence to receive training on the emerging technology’s capabilities and risks has reached President Biden’s desk, after passing the House on Thursday.
If the AI Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act is signed into law, the Office of Management and Budget would have one year to establish a 10-year training program within executive agencies managing AI programs and logistics.
While Biden hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the bill, his administration has implemented key provisions of the National AI Initiative Act and the executive order on trustworthy AI, enacted by the Trump administration, in an effort to maintain U.S. global leadership in the technology and oppose China.
“In order to use artificial intelligence properly and in a way that ensures our nation can compete with our foreign adversaries, federal workers need to understand the technical and ethical implications of these technologies for the safety, security and freedoms of Americans,” said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who authored the legislation with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in a statement. “This important bill will help our government better understand artificial intelligence and ensure we are using it in a manner that is consistent with American values and our democracy.”

The bill wouldn’t fund the program but directs OMB to work with the General Services Administration to develop a curriculum covering the science behind AI, how it works, basic technological features, benefits for agencies, bias and privacy risks, trustworthy AI, and trends in national security and innovation. Technologists; academics; and public, private and nonprofit sector experts would train AI program managers, research and development employees, procurement and contracting officials, and logistics and cost estimation personnel. 
OMB would need to update the program at least every two years to address new technology developments, measure participation and solicit feedback.
The National Security Commission on AI raised the need to train federal officials procuring the technology, in particular, on the harms it poses to citizens and national security if used improperly. 
“This bipartisan legislation will train our procurement professionals about the ins and outs of AI so they can discern which AI systems are useful to the government and which are not,” Portman said in a statement.
