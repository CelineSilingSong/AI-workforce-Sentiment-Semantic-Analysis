So are movies. In Yesterday’s Future, we revisit a movie about the future and consider the things it tells us about today, tomorrow, and yesterday.The movie: A.I. Artificial IntelligenceThe future: A.I. begins with a brief summary of the sorry state of the world: climate change has melted the polar ice caps, wiping out coastal cities and severely reducing the human population. With regulations in place for reproduction on a resource-starved planet, corporations developed Mecha — androids that appear human but lack emotions. They’re seen as objects — useful for labor or sex work, just human enough to not be strange but machine enough to not mistake them for people. The story kicks into gear when Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt) pitches taking Mecha to the next level: a machine that can love. That Mecha becomes David (Haley Joel Osment), an experimental Mecha designed to imprint on his owners and love them unconditionally, forever. And it works — David is given to a grieving couple whose son is in suspended animation due to a rare disease. After some hijinks, he’s accepted, until Martin, the boy he’s filling in for, comes back. Unfortunately Martin is cruel, and thanks to his manipulation, David is forced from home into a Pinocchio-esque journey to find a “Blue Fairy” and become a real boy. Through his eyes, we see a nihilistic theme-park vision of the future, where little is done to solve the still-looming climate apocalypse but neon cities and their pleasures boom. The past: A.I. was released in 2001, but was originally going to come out long before that. Based on Brian Aldiss’ 1969 short story “Supertoys Last All Summer Long,” the film began as a Stanley Kubrick project in the ’70s, languishing in development hell until the famed director’s death in 1999. Steven Spielberg then took over, reportedly hewing closely to the plans Kubrick had for the film. This meant that, at the time, the critical reception of A.I. largely revolved around its status as a strange hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg’s sensibilities, the last work of an idiosyncratic master carried out by one of his most prominent — and stylistically different — admirers. Most, like Roger Ebert, felt that the result was a frustrating film, attempting to parse where one man’s vision ended and the other’s began. But A.I. was an extremely fitting film for 2001, a year characterized by cinematic restlessness. Unsettling arthouse classics Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive premiered. Shrek, which skewered Disney-style fairy tales with pop culture cynicism, also arrived, unwittingly laying the groundwork for surreal internet memes a decade later. Films that would spawn, extend, or hope to begin franchises floundered in every direction, with understated hits like Ocean’s Eleven arriving alongside strange blockbusters like Jurassic Park III and showstoppers like The Fellowship of the Ring. No one knew what the 21st century would mean for movies, and a sad sci-fi fairytale about a robot boy created to stand in the void between a bleak future and an idyllic past could not have been a better match for the times.The present: At first glance, the hedonistic carnival of A.I.’s cities do not seem to hew terribly close to our current moment. Like a lot of cinematic futures, this one seems too loud, too garish, to ever be real. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe? The horrific robot bloodsport of the Flesh Fair, where obsolete robots battle to the “death?” We don’t really have anything like that yet, right?Only we do. The seeds of this future have already bloomed in our present. Its subtext is our subtext, a world formed by people with all the power afforded them by technology but none of the will to dream or love. The former would demand a clear-eyed response to shared crises looming ahead both at home and abroad; the latter would lead us to wield our innovations compassionately. Instead we have a world where algorithms reinforce biases and outrage is commodified, where every innovation is part and parcel with a new indignity. A lack of humanity that at every turn denies the option of a better future for all in favor of a more extravagant present for a few. In A.I.’s final 20 minutes, it’s revealed that this is the end of the world. In 2,000 more years, climate change will claim the last habitable portion of the Earth, and David will be the only one left who remembers humanity. Still a child, all David wants to remember is the human mother he imprinted on, but the viewer remembers everything else — that the world was doomed by rage at the pending self-imposed disaster that humanity refused to face and instead directed toward the Mecha they created, the Mecha that would outlast them. “They made us too smart, too quick, and too many,” Gigolo Joe, the Mecha sexbot that becomes David’s unlikely companion, says in one of his final scenes. “In the end, all that will be left is us. That’s why they hate us”A.I. is refreshing because it is not interested in the question of whether or not we should create self-aware synthetic life, but instead asks what our responsibility toward it would be. If you can create a robot to love a human, one character asks early in the film, how do you get a human to love them back? In the end it doesn’t matter. Humanity doesn’t even love itself enough to ensure its own survival.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart devices are gaining more and more traction in the manufacturing market. 
AI can be used to automate multiple things, and the technologies behind it keep getting better, and smarter. And combining AI with the IoT means fewer people will be required to take decisions and to execute those decisions.
If things keep evolving as they have been so far, one thing is certain: the manufacturing industry will never be the same.
But, how can AI and IoT affect the manufacturing job market? How can they improve it? Will we run out of manufacturing jobs?
5 Ways AI and IoT Can Revolutionize Manufacturing Jobs
Here’s how AI and IoT are already revolutionizing manufacturing jobs:

Cost Optimization

Cost optimization is one of the main benefits that AI and IoT offer, starting with fewer human hours. AI can organize machines that work all day, every day. 
And it’s not just about machines. Through predictive analysis, AI can forecast the amount of resources needed according to the amount of sales expected. AI and IoT can also work together through sensors to keep track of the manufacturing process as well as finding, solving and preventing bottlenecks.
Once everything is set up, these machines can work independently, without any need of continuous human input.

Predictive maintenance

Predictive maintenance is another way an AI’s predictive analysis directly impacts manufacturing jobs. Through complex machine learning, AI can predict when and how a part may fail. The more data you feed to it, the better it’ll become at predicting failure.
This doesn’t just immediately reduce costs by preventing larger failures through maintenance, it also reduces losses caused by unexpected failures. You don’t need to stop a machine for days (or weeks) due to a failure, because your AI would’ve already prepared you for it. 
This also increases the effectiveness of your repairs team, since they can focus on preventive, scheduled repairs instead of fixing machines as they fail.
Predictive maintenance is so lucrative that it not only pays for itself, but has been shown to have up to a 545% ROI.

Production Optimization

With production optimization, you can optimize production and increase efficiency. You can use it with both IoT and human operators.
This is achieved through machine learning algorithms, that learn both from your operators and your machines’ sensors to establish relations between them and identify production improvements. 
Through this insight, AI can give your operators recommendations in real-time to improve production.

Robots

Industrial robots have been a part of the manufacturing industry long before they became part of the Internet of Things. Although they can be a huge investment, industrial robots can do more than any human can, and usually work along them to optimize production. 
Nowadays, we have collaborative robots, or cobots, to work along with humans or even fully replace them in repetitive tasks. These robots aren’t as huge of an investment as industrial robots, and are more flexible and adaptable too.
With AI, cobots can easily be supervised and easily reprogrammed. Due to the repetitive nature of the production line, cobots are usually a great option to replace humans, preventing injuries and increasing production speed.

Machine vision

Computer vision is one of the most futuristic-looking ways AI and IoT can directly impact manufacturing jobs. And it’s one of the cheapest ways too!
HD cameras can be used with punch-in systems to validate employee work time. Through machine vision, your AI can spot machine defects, handle quality control and keep track of production.
Machine vision can also be used to prevent health and safety issues. It can identify workers without the right safety equipment and prevent contamination risks. When it identifies an issue, the AI can block access to individuals, and even stop production altogether.
You can also use machine vision to read text and barcodes and keep track of your parts and raw materials. This can help you in multiple ways, from automating your warehouse inventory, to helping your operators use the right parts and guide them through complex processes.
Are AI and IoT Creating Jobs Or Destroying Them?
While AI and IoT are replacing humans in the manufacturing job market, they’re also creating new jobs in their production, supervision and maintenance. So, which way is the scale tipping?
During the sixties, over 10% of the United States population worked in factories. Today, that number is down to 4%. Through AI and IoT, factories are slowly but systematically replacing humans with machines, and this trend will continue going up.
According to a study done by McKinsey & Co., up to 45% of tasks done by humans today could be done by machines. A survey done at Oxford found that 20 million jobs will be lost to robots in the next ten years alone.
So, how does that translate to the job market?
There’s still a long way to go to make the Internet of Things effective. There’s a lot of code to be written, data to be scraped and programs to be designed so IoT becomes as usable as it can be. And then we need humans to design and build the robots. In the UK alone, robotics specialists are expected to double jobs in the next five years. And while the items that form part of the IoT may be increasingly produced by machines, it will be IT professionals, like developers and scrapers, who will need to build the frame for both AI and IoT.
Conclusion
As we’ve seen, AI and IoT will create more jobs than they destroy in the manufacturing market. However, these jobs will be very different from the jobs people hold today.
Through automation, goods will become cheaper and better produced, which will allow companies to hire more people for areas where AI and IoT can’t be used. These jobs will focus on high-skilled people in design, marketing, and, most importantly, in IT.
That’s why you shouldn’t be worried about losing your job to robots. You should instead be preparing for the future by expanding your skillset, improving your money management and betting on companies rather than working for them.
The future of the manufacturing job market isn’t in production, but in the creation and automation of the IoT and AI.

Experts warn that testing, experimentation and human understanding are critical to creating trustworthy systems.",N/A,http://schema.org,,IT and Networks,N/A,"The Pentagon’s primary artificial intelligence hub is already studying how to aim a laser at the correct spot on an enemy vehicle, pinpointing which area to target to inflict the most damage, and identifying the most important messages headed to commanders, officials said June 16.But as part of that work, the Department of Defense needs to carefully implement checks and balances into the development process, experts urged June 16.“Fundamentally I would say there’s a requirement … that there’s going to be a mixture of measures taken to ensure the governability of the system from the first stage of the design of the system all the way up through the operations of the system in a combat scenario,” said Greg Allen, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center’s chief of strategy and communications at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, at the Defense One Tech Summit June 16.The JAIC is working on several lethality projects through its new joint warfighting initiative, boosted by a new contract award to Booz Allen potentially worth $800 million.“With this new contract vehicle, we have the potential to do even more this next year than we did in the past,” Allen said.Meanwhile, the Army’s Artificial Intelligence Task Force is working on an advanced threat recognition project. DARPA is exploring complementing AI systems that would identify available combat support assets and quickly plan their route to the area.Throughout all of the development work, experts from the military and from academia stressed that human involvement and experimentation was critical to ensuring that artificial intelligence assets are trustworthy. The department has released a document of five artificial intelligence ethical principles, but the challenge remains implementing those principles into projects across a department with disparate services working on separate artificial intelligence projects.“We want safe, reliable and robust systems deployed to our warfighters,” said Heather Roff, senior research analyst at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. “We want to be able to trust those systems. We want to have some sort of measure of predictability even if those systems act unpredictably.”Brig. Gen. Matt Easley, director of the artificial intelligence task force at Army Futures Command, said the service is grappling with those exact challenges, trying to understand how the service can insert “checks and balances” as it trains systems and soldiers.Easley added that the unmanned systems under development by the Army will have to be adaptable to different environments, such as an urban or desert scenarios. In order to ensure that the systems and soldiers are ready for those scenarios, the Army has to complete a series of tests, just like the autonomous vehicle industry.“We don’t think these systems are going to be 100 percent capable right out of the box,” Easley said on the webinar. “If you look at a lot of the evolution of the self-driving cars throughout our society today, they’re doing a lot of experimentation. They’re doing lots of testing, lots of learning every day. We in the Army have to learn how to go from doing one to two to three vehicle experiments to have many experiments going on every day across all our camp posts and stations.”Increasingly autonomous systems also mean that there needs to a cultural shift in among all levels of military personnel who will need to better understand how artificial intelligence is used. Roff said that operators, commanders and judge advocate generals will need to better understand how systems are supposed “to ensure that the human responsibility and governability is there.”“We need to make sure that we have training, tactics, procedures, as well as policies, ensuring where we know the human decision maker is,” Roff said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

Artificial intelligence makes it workable for us to open our cell phones with our faces, ask our virtual assistant's questions and get vocalized answers, and have our undesirable emails sifted to a spam folder while never addressing them..The effect of AI and machine learning doesn't stop at the capability to make the lives of people simpler, however. These programs have been created to decidedly affect pretty much every industry through the streamlining of business procedures, the improving of customer experience, and the completion of tasks that have never been conceivable..As per the job site Indeed, the demand for AI aptitudes has dramatically increased in recent years and the number of job postings is up by 119%. However, job-seeker interest in AI careers appears to have leveled off. This recommends businesses are going to battle to fill these positions for a long time..Data Scientist.A data scientist is liable for gathering data and analyzing it. Data scientists have foundations in cutting edge math and statistics, advanced analytics, and machine learning and AI. In an organization, data scientists extract helpful data from an ocean of information. In analyzing the information, they make inferences and accumulate insights and use them to support the business..In recent years, the requirement for data scientists has increased by 35%. This unexpected increment in the demand of data scientists has prompted the talent crunch that we're seeing across numerous companies and enterprises. Shockingly, however, the needs are clear (i.e., a computer science degree, good experience in coding), the job of a data scientist is approximately characterized across the job market and sets of responsibilities can change broadly. Those keen on turning into a data scientist at any association will require experience and backgrounds in statistics, probability, mathematics, and algorithms as a base level of qualifications..Machine Learning Engineer.They're generally responsible for building and managing platforms for machine learning projects. The job of a machine learning engineer is at the core of AI projects and is appropriate for the individuals who hail from a foundation in applied research and data science. Notwithstanding, it's additionally important to be an AI software engineer and show an intensive comprehension of different programming languages..Machine learning engineers ought to likewise be able to apply predictive models and leverage natural language processing when working with colossal datasets. To get recruited, it will help if candidates are profoundly knowledgeable about agile development practices and acquainted with leading software development IDE tools like Eclipse and IntelliJ..If you examine leading workplaces, you'll see that many hiring organizations incline toward people who have a master's or doctoral degree in computer science or mathematics. Preference is frequently given to technology experts with solid mathematical abilities. Most job postings additionally expect applicants to be specialists in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks, with solid computer programming skills, analytical skills, and experience with cloud applications..AI Architect.The job of an AI architect is different from that of the machine learning engineer and data scientist, and companies hope to enlist AI architects notwithstanding these different jobs. Artificial intelligence architects are answerable for the overall needs of artificial intelligence projects. This job is answerable for making and keeping up architecture utilizing leading AI technology frameworks. This job has parts of data science, solutions specialist, and technology expert all wrapped into one position..Artificial intelligence architects need to take a look at the 10,000-foot view of an AI deployment project to comprehend overall mission objectives, realize the various ways to deal with applying AI to those objectives and organize teams to achieve those objectives. They additionally need to perceive how the AI is utilized in a company that requires a profound comprehension of the different AI patterns, capabilities of AI platforms, and the state of data in the company. On account of these prerequisites, an AI architect isn't an entry-level position, but instead one that requires long years of involvement in the field..Business Intelligence Developer.Professions in artificial intelligence likewise incorporate the position of business intelligence (BI) developer. The essential objective of this job is to analyze complex data sets to recognize business and market patterns. Business intelligence developers are normally responsible for structuring, modeling, and keeping up complex data in highly accessible cloud-based data platforms..The individuals who are keen on this job need to have solid technical and analytical abilities. Applicants ought to be able to speak with non-technical partners and show strong critical thinking aptitudes..Not at all like other artificial intelligence careers on this rundown, business intelligence developers customarily just have been required to have a bachelor's degree education in engineering, computer science, or a related field. However, a blend of hands-on understanding and certifications is exceptionally wanted. This implies the perfect applicant will have extensive involvement in data warehouse design, data mining, SQL queries, SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, and BI technologies..Big Data Engineer.As big data engineers and architects play a crucial job in building up an environment that empowers business frameworks to speak with one another and examine information, most organizations incline toward experts who have finished a Ph.D. in mathematics, computer science, or a related field..Unlike data scientists, this job can feel increasingly involved, big data engineers regularly are entrusted with designing, planning, and building up the big data environment on Hadoop and Spark systems. Applicants additionally need to exhibit significant programming experience with C++, Java, Python, and Scala. They likewise need to have in-depth information and experience taking part in data mining, data visualization, and data migration..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

But will the job market, in general, provide more jobs if you have these skills? While we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in not just education but also the type of jobs, will the future be driven by AI and the likes? Dr K L Vasudev an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, and Dr A Padmavathi, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science Engineering at the institute answer our questions with insight and patience..Excerpts:So we have been hearing these terms Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Machine Learning for a while now. But we don't exactly know what courses students should do to get into doing these fields? Could you elaborate on that?KLV: Essentially, there is no particular stream of engineering students have to follow to study Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences and Big Data. A choice-based credit system encourages everyone to opt for courses from different streams like electives. Universities are also encouraging interdisciplinary research activities, for example, a person who is working with medical robotics should also know the human anatomy very well. Computer science and IT students will have an advantage in these subjects.AP: Any person with computer knowledge and some mathematical skills can go into these fields. They must have some degree. It might not be an engineering degree, it might be a BCA or it might be an MCA or BSC Computer Science. If they want to have a career in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, A master's degree is preferred..In the current pandemic scenario, AI and ML have been helping a lot. We have seen solutions like drones, robots that are being used. How can it help even more?KLV: There are many ways robots can help combat the Coronavirus disease. Spraying robots can be used to disinfect places and drones can monitor people during a lockdown. AI-based robots have the potential to be developed to deliver essential goods like food items and medicines. In the containment zones where people are not allowed to trespass, it's always better to have a robot serving the people. Such robots are available in the market.AP: By using a deep learning algorithm and a machine learning algorithm, they can diagnose a patient, they can identify the spread of the virus and they can map who is the most susceptible patient and so on. Also, one of the applications of artificial intelligence is a chatbot. It can be used to create awareness among the people about the virus spread and how they must be careful at home or at workplaces..A recent healthcare report says that there's a 50 per cent increase in the use of Robotics for medical and healthcare delivery services. Where do you think India will be by 2030 in terms of robotics in healthcare?KLV: I think even before 2030, we will be making a mark in the industry. For example, you can see that many hospitals like AIIMS in Delhi, Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Hospitals and Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi already utilising this Da Vinci Surgery machine robots. Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences has already conducted 1300 operations with the assistance of these Da Vinci robots. If you consider the whole of India, it might be significantly more..What are the future job opportunities like for prospective students?.KLV: The transformation to AI-based Industries is undisputable. It is going to create a transformation in each and every industry. There are a number of fields from software to even mechanical engineering and manufacturing where automation is required these days. Robotics is already in each and every field of our day-to-day life. We can do jobs using these robots and that is going to be the future.AP: They can become data analysts, software developers, machine learning analysts, cloud content managers, robot engineers, manufacturing engineers, machine learning engineers, people who can handle the drones, electricians who can work with the aviation control and military.We came across a study that was done in the US which showed that a lot of robotic engineering positions are in the pipeline. Do you think India can also match up to that?KLV: India is a country with the youngest population and stands in third place with regard to AI research. With regard to the COVID situation, our IT strengths are going to go up. Our Indian brains that had migrated to other countries may return to the homeland and bring plenty of applications in the job market for providing remote services..We came across another study conducted by Oxford University, which says that 47 per cent of the US jobs can be automated by the next 20 years. Which sectors in India do you think will have more jobs?AP: In India, by 2030, around 9-13 per cent of the human workforce will be replaced by robots or automated machines. So, the Oxford Economic Report says most of the 20 million manufacturing jobs will be replaced by a robot. Another study by McKinsey says that by 2030, 44 million jobs will be replaced with robots. There will be more job opportunities in the health sector like doctors, physiotherapists, nurses, drug developers and so on. By 2030, there will be no outdoor games, almost everyone will sit inside their homes and there is a possibility that people will develop a lot of diseases. So healthcare will have a lot more opportunities, as will logistics and automation specialists.KLV:  In all fields, manufacturing included, AI and robotics will leave its mark and the whole world is going to look towards India.What do you think are good online courses that can be taken up by students who want to learn machine learning, artificial intelligence?KLV: Basic mathematical knowledge is a must along with coding knowledge. Basic linear algebra and calculus also help.AP: Any student with some computer knowledge and mathematical knowledge can go for the Python Programming. If they want to specialise in Machine Language, they have to go for R programming. If they want to write some ML or Deep Learning algorithms, either they can go for a Java or Python course..We have seen a lot of online learning courses coming up right now on several digital platforms like Udemy and Unacademy. Will these courses act as an advantage for students when they apply for a degree?KLV: These courses are going to differentiate them from the rest. A majority of people attending these courses are working professionals and they join to enhance their skills and find themselves suitable for a job change or a hike. We in Amrita encourage students to take up online courses, and we provide credits to students who have done extra courses.After the lockdown ends how will the college follow social distancing norms inside the classroom and also while on transport?AP: Our Chennai campus has limited students around 150 students in the first year. Only 11 students are travelling on the college bus. We can make them sit away from each other and insist that they wear a mask and use sanitisers. With that, we can maintain social distancing on transport and also we can split the classes. Common canteen rules have to change.KLV: Social distancing in class is the most difficult task which needs to be very keenly addressed with utmost care and precautions. Our management is very sensitive to this issue. We abide by the government advisory from MHRD, UGC, AICTE and other regulatory bodies. We are already using smartboards on our campus and online learning platforms to supplement classroom teaching. So I think we will try new strategies, which is giving us fruitful results based upon that will go for a choice..Do you think digital learning is the way to go?AP: Before COVID-19, we were already conducting online learning classes and quiz assignments on Google classroom. But after the pandemic hit us it has become mandatory. So nowadays, we are able to complete our portions on time. We are more confident and handling online classes pretty well. Students are also gaining more interest in digital learning platforms..KLV: Actually COVID-19 has given us an opportunity to get rid of the fear of poor quality online teaching and teachers' hesitation to use online portals. It is heartening to know that teachers have taken up online teaching with great interest digitally proficient students are going for online learning with great excitement. Even before COVID-19 in 2019, if you see the statistical data, approximately 19 billion dollars has been spent on education technology with online education and it is going to be 350 billion dollars by 2025. That is the expectation. Online learning apps have seen a significant surge in usage since COVID-19. So I think this is going to last and now every person needs to learn new things and keep updating themselves. .Careers After Corona is a series that has been curated and produced by EdexLive in partnership with Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and Amrita School of Engineering",,,,News,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.edexlive.com'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'News', 'item': 'https://www.edexlive.com/news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': ""Will AI, Big Data dominate the job market in 2030?

Professor Giselle Rampersad undertook the study to investigate key factors that drive innovation among Worker Integrated Learning students. Professor Rampersad says that “while there is some fear that robots and artificial intelligence may replace some occupations, workers will remain relevant in a fast-changing career landscape if they are innovative, able to spot opportunities that can transform industries and provide creative solutions to meet global challenges”. To develop such capabilities, Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has emerged as an important approach, which Professor Rampersad has investigated with a quantitative, longitudinal study that measures student capabilities before and after participation in a WIL placement at a business. The study found that critical thinking, problem solving, communication and teamwork have significant impacts on the development of innovation, which is the “vital ingredient for workers in the era of artificial intelligence”. The study also identifies which areas of WIL programs have been most beneficial, and what areas need more attention to nurture greater innovation. “Reaping the benefits of industry 4.0 requires a focus on the human factors,” says Professor Rampersad. “Innovation is needed to transition the workforce effectively. This will not only ensure that workers can effectively and confidently use the new technologies but also that they survive and thrive in a quickly changing workplace.” To measure the effectiveness of current upskilling of workers, Professor Rampersad analysed responses to a questionnaire of more than 100 students (both before and after their placement), who participated in the WIL program. The paper - &#039;Robot will take your job: Innovation for an era of artificial intelligence&#039; - has been published in the Journal of Business Research. The study was funded by the Australian Collaborative Education Network (ACEN) in collaboration with Dr Vlatka Zivotic-Kukolj. The University says Professor Rampersad is pleased that the study has been able to produce a validated tool that quantitatively measures the development of innovation and its drivers. “Results from this tool can feed back into WIL program development to enhance student preparation and support for skill development,” she says. “It will also be useful in offering feedback to students on their career progression, self-awareness and empowerment for their development. “For industry and a community looking for innovative solutions to address challenges facing the areas of health, food, environment, manufacturing and the economy, the interaction of talented students with industries and businesses will prove highly beneficial. “The well-researched and well-developed tool to measure the development of innovation provided by this study can be used to enhance collaboration and innovation between university and industry. “In an era increasingly characterized by artificial intelligence, rather than fearing the robot, attention is needed on equipping the workforce with innovation skills for the future of work,” Professor Rampersad concluded.",,,,https://itwire.com/education.html,,

Building talent for a complex future.














The future of work is changing. Artificial intelligence, robots, automation, the ‘gig’ economy, climate change and social/political movements are just some factors that will influence and shape the world of work. And in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, jobs are going to continue to change in a fundamental way.
Preparing for this shift is critical. Our future is in our hands, and we must harness our potential to contribute positively to society.







Students

must be able to identify, articulate and apply skills gained through courses and work experiences to solve problems within a complex world



Employers

must know how to identify, recruit and retain candidates with the right skills to help their organization navigate uncertain futures



Educators

must help students to develop skills for a changing world through continuously adapting programming to create future-ready graduates








Students    Employers    Educators








Waterloo's Future Ready Talent Framework


So how can you prepare for this future we can’t yet predict? What skills are essential to be “future ready”?
Enter the University of Waterloo’s Future Ready Talent Framework (FRTF). The FRTF is a research-backed tool to help students, employers and educators understand the key competencies we all need to navigate the future of work and learning.
Waterloo has programs to support all learners, at any stage of a lifelong-learning journey. Our programs are designed to build resilience and adaptability. We help learners acknowledge what they’re good at and what kinds of challenges they want to solve, all within a richly-supported environment.
How do we know what skills are essential?
We developed this competency framework through conducting extensive research into existing frameworks, studies and reports, and validated our findings with our network of employers, students and fellow educators.
The FRTF profiles four clusters of competencies with a total of 12 competencies that are expected to be in demand in the emerging global workplace. By understanding these competencies and how to cultivate them, you can take a fresh look at your career direction, hiring practices, management structures and educational programs through a future-oriented lens.

Expand and transfer expertise
Expanding field-specific knowledge and skills is critical for success in the future workplace, especially in the midst of a world where technology is predicted to become smarter than it ever has before. From academic programming, self-directed learning, workplace and extra-curricular experiences, all workers will need to continually expand their expertise.

























DISCIPLINE AND CONTEXT-SPECIFIC SKILLS


The future of work will require individuals and organizations to develop knowledge and competencies relevant to work contexts we can’t yet imagine. Being able to integrate ideas from multiple settings will be crucial to address the problems of tomorrow.






A person with context-specific skills can:
develop knowledge and skills relevant to the work context
actively integrate ideas from across contexts
























INFORMATION AND DATA LITERACY


In today’s world, big data is bigger than ever. No matter your industry, it’s what drives decisions and bottom lines. The future of work will require individuals and organizations to identify and synthesize “good” data to form meaningful conclusions.






A person with information and data literacy can:
identify data relevant to the work at hand
synthesize data from multiple sources into meaningful information
























TECHNOLOGICAL AGILITY


With artificial intelligence, robots and automation on the rise, grasping and adapting to new technologies will be increasingly important in our future workplaces. Advocating for the use of new tech and incorporating it into our daily work can help individuals and organizations stay one step ahead.






A person with technological agility can:
grasp new technologies with ease
apply technology to achieve better results
advocate for the use of innovative technologies











Develop self
The ability to develop one’s self has always been essential to success but we’re expecting it to take on even more importance in the future of work. All of us will need to be lifelong learners – constantly upskilling and reskilling. And we’ll need to know how those competencies translate from one context to another as we navigate our careers.



























SELF - MANAGEMENT
With the rise of the gig economy and increased options for independent and remote contracts, the future of work will undoubtedly see changes to traditional workplace structures. Individuals and organizations must foster self-management techniques to help cope with the pressures of tomorrow’s workplace.






A person that can successfully self-manage can:
approach workplace situations with a positive attitude
manage their own reactions/emotions
cope with workplace pressures
incorporate feedback into workplace performance
demonstrate integrity and ethics in the workplace


























SELF - ASSESSMENT
The future of work may be uncertain, but one thing we can rely on in a world of flux is our own self-knowledge. Being able to effectively evaluate personal strengths, weaknesses and values can help individuals adapt to shifting landscapes.






A person that practices self-assessment can:
acknowledge the limits of their own knowledge, skills and abilities
seek feedback on performance
have an accurate sense of what they contribute


























LIFELONG LEARNING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT
With all the uncertainty lying ahead, one thing is for sure: the future of work will require individuals, organizations and institutions to constantly adapt to shifting priorities, expectations and systems. Individuals will seek purpose. They’ll need to develop and evolve their career identity and sense of purpose to help feel rooted and stable in the face of dynamic labour markets. Organizations will need to support and invest in the growth of their employees in order to retain and nurture personnel into valuable leadership positions.






A person focused on lifelong learning and career development can:
make plans to achieve learning goals
explore how personal values and interests align with occupational demands, tasks, goals and environments
seek learning opportunities, both formal and informal
take the initiative to connect with others about career opportunities











Build relationships
Working effectively with others has always been imperative. The future of work will require cross-cultural agility to work effectively and build positive relationships - especially in an increasingly diverse and globalized context.



























COMMUNICATION
We all know that good communication is essential to forming relationships and sharing knowledge. But in a world of artificial intelligence, remote work and digital contexts, communication will take on a whole new meaning. Individuals and organizations must have an in-depth understanding of their audiences and know how to communicate effectively across multiple platforms.






A person with strong communication can:
communicate ideas effectively for audience and circumstances
use clear and concise language
listen attentively to others


























COLLABORATION
Despite the increasing automation of our workplace, collaboration amongst people will always be needed to drive projects forward. Knowing how to foster collaboration and work effectively with others will ensure that multiple perspectives, ideas and strengths are brought to the table.






A person that is strong in collaboration can:
work effectively with others
proactively seek the opinions, ideas and expertise of others
give credit to others for their ideas, strengths and contributions
seek to improve working relationships


























INTERCULTURAL EFFECTIVENESS
As our workplaces and learning spaces become increasingly diverse, individuals and organizations will need to understand how to appreciate and navigate differences in order to connect with their communities. With globalization and increasing social and economic divides, the ability to engage with human empathy and integrity will be in high demand.






A person with intercultural effectiveness can:
develop knowledge about values and social interaction norms of others
respect diversity and inclusion
adjust cultural assumptions based on experiences
adapt to culturally diverse situations











Design and deliver solutions
Diverse experiences are considered by some to be the seeding ground for innovation and effective problem solving. A complex world filled with “wicked problems” requires people who can recognize incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements and develop innovative approaches to resolve them.



























INNOVATION MINDSET
In our rapidly-changing world, innovation is everywhere around us. Individuals and organizations will need to have the curiosity and courage to dream up new ways of tackling problems in a world that doesn’t exist yet.






A person with an innovation mindset can:
demonstrate curiosity in the workplace
identify opportunities for improvement
take measured risks


























CRITICAL THINKING
With the world becoming increasingly complex, critical thinking will be needed to solve problems both thoughtfully and creatively in a way that considers multiple perspectives and potential implications. Individuals and organizations will need to understand the “big picture” to make sustainable, evidence-based recommendations in a world laden with synapses.






A person with critical thinking can:
identify multiple feasible options or solutions to problems
make evidence-based decisions and/or recommendations
seek to understand the “big picture” root problem or purpose for actions
explore the implications of proposed solutions to problems


























IMPLEMENTATION
An idea is just an idea without thoughtful execution. Can you design, adapt and implement solutions in a way that gets work done and builds trust with the people around you?






A person that practices implementation can:
identify concrete steps necessary to complete projects
manage their own deadlines
fulfill responsibilities



























Students
