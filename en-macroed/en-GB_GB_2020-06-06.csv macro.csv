    <li>an estimated 2,500 places will be available on new government funded <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> or data science conversion courses, with 1,000 scholarships offered to students from underrepresented backgrounds</li>
    <li>funding has been awarded to 18 universities who are working with partner providers to deliver courses in 28 universities and colleges across England</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Graduates will have the opportunity to <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/joinyouraifuture/"" class=""govuk-link"">apply</a> for a place on new artificial intelligence (<abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>) and data science masters courses starting in autumn 2020, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden announced today (Wednesday 10 June). .</p>

<p>The move will enable 2,500 people to develop new digital skills or retrain to help find new employment in the UK’s cutting-edge <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science sectors.</p>

<p>Backed by £13.5 million of government funding, the government has joined forces with the Office for Students, universities and industry partners to increase the number of highly-skilled workers in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science roles. The cash will provide places for graduates from a range of backgrounds - both those that have  a degree in science, technology, engineering, maths or social sciences and those that have studied other subjects to date.</p>

<p>Scholarships will also be made available to support applications from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Courses are open to anyone who meets a participating university’s entry requirements and details of how to apply are available on the universities’ websites. Eligible applicants can apply for a scholarship through their university. Please visit the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/planning-to-study/study-artificial-intelligence-and-data-science-as-a-postgraduate/"" class=""govuk-link"">Office for Student’s website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Applicants could include people returning to work after a career break and looking to retrain in a new profession, under-represented groups in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and digital workforce. 1000 scholarships will specifically target the female, black and disabled demographics.</p>

<p>Statistics from a Tech Nation and Royal Society report reveal women make up only 19 per cent of the tech workforce and people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (<abbr title=""black, Asian and minority ethnic"">BAME</abbr>) background represent just 4 per cent of the UK tech industry.</p>

<p>Successful students can use flexible and part time study options so they can fit their studies around their daily lives. Students can also undertake paid work placements to help maximise their employment opportunities at the end of their course which could see them land roles as machine learning engineers, data scientists, research scientists or <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> architects.</p>

<p>The announcement is part of the government’s commitment to increase R&amp;D investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.</p>

<p>Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is vital we increase diversity across our tech sector and give everyone with the aptitude and talent the opportunity to build a successful career.</p>

  <p>This will help make sure artificial intelligence developed in the UK reflects the needs and make-up of society as a whole which will also  help mitigate the risk of biased technologies being developed.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Through these new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science conversion courses we are working with industry and academia to develop and maintain the best <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> workforce in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science Minister Amanda Solloway said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From disease diagnosis to driverless vehicles, demand for a diverse new pipeline of talent in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and digital workforce has never been greater.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">By working with our leading universities and industry partners, I am delighted that we are providing students from all backgrounds the chance to upskill and help tackle some of the most complex challenges of our time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a more diverse future workforce will help with the design of new technology that has the potential to help tackle some of the greatest social challenges of our time - from protecting our environment to transforming the way we live and work and also saving lives by detecting signs of diseases earlier.</p>

<p>Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the Office for Students, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent years we have seen significant and increasing demand for digital skills in a range of fields. From healthcare and biosciences, to industry and transport – harnessing artificial intelligence and data science will be crucial in tackling significant global challenges for years to come.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It is also critical that graduates from all backgrounds have equal opportunities to gain the skills that employers need. With new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science conversion courses across the country, and scholarships available to students from underrepresented backgrounds, this programme will both help tackle skills gaps and increase choice and opportunities for all students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Skills Champion Dame Wendy Hall quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">It is imperative that we continue to grow the pathways that supply good <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and Data Science jobs. Introducing new and diverse talent will continue to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and Innovation. These conversion courses and the scholarships attached demonstrate the importance we place on diversity and talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Martin <abbr title=""Member of the Order of the British Empire"">MBE</abbr>, co-founder of UK BlackTech said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science courses and scholarships will help boost uptake of these technologies across the country and prepare the next generation to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and social injustices.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It’s important we encourage more homegrown talent from different backgrounds to access these opportunities so we can develop better tech tools, services and organisations that truly reflects our nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to these new conversion courses,  the Government is also supporting industry-funded <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Masters, prestigious Alan Turing Institute <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> research fellowships and 16 dedicated Centres at universities across the country to train 1000 extra <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> PhDs.</p>

<p>To boost the use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the public sector the World Economic Forum has published new guidelines to help the public sector embrace the technology to help drive efficiencies and prepare for future risks.</p>

<p>The guidance will also help established companies, start-ups and new entrants to the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> sector compete on a level playing field for government contracts and drive adoption of ethical practices by tech companies.</p>

Accountants and lawyers to use AI to cannibalise their business – before someone else does
When you hear the word “automation...”, does your mind skip straight to “…destroys jobs”? If so, there should be a few stops in between. Automation is about removing friction, driving down costs, speeding processes up, and generally improving efficiency. Making goods and services better and cheaper is a good thing: it makes us all richer.


There is scope to do this in all walks of life, and not least in professional services, such as accountancy and the law. Much of the work done by the firms in these sectors is searching for and compiling data. Their work would be greatly improved and speeded up if data retrieval could be automated, if databases were compatible, and if multiple databases could be interrogated simultaneously.

Traditional databases don’t talk to each other. The questions that can be asked of each of them are fixed - designed in at the start. Big companies have thousands of them. In the 1990s, companies began installing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems which bring together all the data about a particular business process in one master database. But large companies still have many ERPs – often as many as 300. And guess what, these don’t usually talk to each other.

PROMOTED
Knowledge graphs
A newer type of database called a “knowledge graph” is more flexible. Google introduced this concept to its search operations in 2012 (coincidentally, the same year as the Big Bang in artificial intelligence, when machine learning began to make AI so powerful). Knowledge graphs link triplets of information – subject, object, and the relationship between them. This allows you to get precise answers to rich and complex questions.

The problem with knowledge graphs is that they are time-consuming and expensive to populate. This problem is being mitigated by the rapid improvements in an aspect of AI called natural language processing. NLP systems such as Google’s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, since you asked) enable knowledge graphs to be populated automatically, by furtling around in giant corpuses of text and tables, hunting down and extracting relevant but unstructured data.

Using BERT to populate knowledge graphs in professional services
A startup called Engine B is looking to capitalise on this emerging capability in the professional services industry. It employs only nine people today, and has only raised £3.5m so far. But founder and CEO Shamus Rae says that the company’s partners and backers are what makes it promising: they include all four large accountancy firms, plus several of the next tier and challenger firms. Plus the accountants’ UK trade body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). It is also working with a number of leading law firms.

The company is building and populating its models with input from academics at Imperial College and Birmingham University, and is hosted on Microsoft’s Azure platform, because unlike Google, for instance, Microsoft forswears going into industry verticals to compete with incumbents.

If Engine B succeeds, it will operate as a platform, charging users micro-payments as they process data. The data belongs to the customer, and it stays where it is – inside the company’s servers (whether in a cloud service, or owner-hosted). Engine B’s knowledge graphs will be applied to the data in the form of an API. Shamus Rae says that “we will not anonymise anyone’s data and resell insights from it, and our code is open source”.
A single source of truth
The result, Rae claims, is a “single source of truth”, where questions can be asked of a company’s knowledge base which were never envisaged when the data was collected. For instance, the knowledge graph for a property company could be interrogated to find out which buildings in the portfolio have the kind of cladding which caused the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and which of those were installed by the same contractor. It becomes much easier to check the integrity of a company’s data lakes, and to check for fraud and defend against cyber attacks.
If this approach is successful, it will automate a lot of the work which is currently done by accounting firms. The big firms employ thousands of people to do “ticking and bashing” - obtaining financial information about the client’s activities, and checking it for consistency against other sources. This work will increasingly be automated, which means less boredom for junior accountants - but probably also means fewer junior accountants. The same goes for lawyers and their disclosure and discover processes. Due diligence - the investigation and evaluation of a target company - will become much easier and faster, and mergers, acquisitions, and investment should be speeded up dramatically.
""Enabling people to do what they know good would look like, if only it were possible""
Dan Wright, a partner at international law firm, Osborne Clarke, shares Rae’s hopes for the initiative. “By systemically unearthing the connections between data, we open up entirely new ways of executing legal processes. The knowledge graph approach is all about technology enabling people to do what they know good would look like, if only it were possible. We'll hopefully show it is possible.""
Since knowledge graphs will eliminate a lot of the work that accountants and lawyers do today – and charge for – you might think they would resist it rather than back it. But the people running these firms recognise that automation is coming. They know that if they do not cannibalise their own businesses and adopt the coming business models, then someone else will. They are using this sort of initiative to force through the digitisation of their businesses, and retain a degree of control over the process as it happens.
As Rae puts it, “In reality jobs will go and jobs will change. The firms that prosper will be the ones that grab the opportunity first to re-skill their technology and their people. The future is not about number-crunching transactions, but about judgement and wisdom.”

ENISA working group on Artificial Intelligence cybersecurity kick-off
Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is kicking off the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, marking another milestone in the Agency’s work on emerging technologies.

    Published on June 10, 2020
  






Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer in the realm of science fiction and futuristic scenarios. It is already changing everyday life, improving the provision of services by automating procedures and systems, and rapidly processing large amounts of data. AI has the potential to lead the digital transformation paradigm shift, and, in many ways, is already doing so.
The benefits of Artificial Intelligence may only be attained if AI itself can be trustworthy and cybersecure. We are already witnessing attacks against AI systems that aim to negatively manipulate their behaviour and lead to unintentional operations by adversaries. The European Commission has highlighted the importance of AI in society and the economy; and, most recently, in its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, the Commission has underlined the need for AI to be secure. This white paper is the frontrunner to forthcoming policy initiatives in the area that will shape the future of AI deployment and its wide adoption by the public.
Recognizing the significance of cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, ENISA has set up an Ad-Hoc Working Group in line with the European Commission’s directions and policies.
The main objectives of the group include:

Advise ENISA in matters related to AI cybersecurity.
Assist ENISA in the development of an AI Threat Landscape.
Support ENISA in providing risk-proportionate cybersecurity guidelines for AI.

The working group is composed of 15 members, representing stakeholders from small and large companies, the public sector, academia, associations, and more, as well as seven observers from European bodies, including the DG for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, the DG Joint Research Centre, Europol, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
The list of members and observers is available on the webpage of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial Intelligence cybersecurity.

       In this talk, Daniel will explore the future of work in the Age of Covid-19. Drawing on his best-selling books, The Future of the Professions (OUP, 2015), and A World Without Work (Allen Lane, 2020), he will explore the relationship between the Covid-19 crisis and the challenge of automation, set out the five stages that individuals and companies are likely to go through in recovering from this crisis, and provide advice on how to think about the months ahead.
      

       Dr Daniel Susskind explores the impact of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, on work and society and is a Fellow in Economics at Balliol College, Oxford University, where he teaches and researches. Previously he worked in the British Government – as a policy adviser in the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit, as a policy analyst in the Policy Unit in 10 Downing Street, and as a senior policy adviser in the Cabinet Office. He was a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard University.
      

       WSI Executive Director and WFRC Founding Director, Professor Pauline Leonard says:
       
        “I’m very excited that Daniel Susskind has agreed to be the first speaker to give a WSI Distinguished Lecture online. As a leading commentator on the impact of technology on working lives, this couldn’t be more fitting, or timely. I encourage everyone interested in the impacts of Covid19, technology, and how the world of work will move on from these challenging times, to ‘join the debate.”

Today, technology is unlocking the power to help us tell stories, better than we've ever before. With the rise of virtual and augmented reality, technologies are being given a new opportunity to bridge those communication gaps, even further, through direct experience. We are experiencing a change, which futurist long theorized about a coming age where creativity and imagination will become the primary creator of economic value.Working culture and trends have witnessed a pragmatic shift over a time. What seemed to be the &ldquo;Future of Work&rdquo; has turned out to be the &ldquo;Present for Work&rdquo; due to these unavoidable and unprecedented times. What used to be perceived as a job eater is now being used to augment the day-to-day operational tasks for work, worker and workplace.While AI can handle mundane tasks freeing up people to focus more on gaining competitive advantage, being innovative and think out of the box; it&rsquo;s the VR which is turning out to be game changer by creating a virtual world which is no degree less than the real world. These two technology terms now seem to be inevitable at work &amp; workplace and the worker&rsquo;s life is visualized revolving around them. Let&rsquo;s try to uncover what this paradigm shift holds in for the work, worker and workplace:Work (Anywhere Anytime Accessibility)Collaboration is a key to virtual connect: VR can give a boost to remote-working trend in the current scenario as virtual connect has been the prime focus. Telepresence and telecommunication are something that organizations need to look at for fuelling up collaboration. Meetings with showcase of product/service can be simulated virtually thereby leading to an enhanced experience.Virtual Chum @ Work: Chatbots are the buzzword in the market today. Imagine them as your friend and taking care of you from the time you start your day. Bots can increase the happiness index by driving balance between both personal and professional lives of the employee. During late working hours, the bot ensures that you are being taken care of by nudging you for your meals, cab booking, or even delivering necessity items at destination, etc.WorkerEmpathy &ndash; a skill to be acquired: VR &amp; AR can help inculcate empathy in employees by helping them synthesize the customer expectations by evaluating them in a closed environment surrounded by real-life situation thereby developing a solution centric approach.Skill enrichment: VR along with AI can sharpen the learning curves of employees by offering them an opportunity to explore and experience the real-life situations. VR can help employees to upskill themselves and fly high just like pilots during their simulation trainings.Personalized experience: Who wants to step out of home amidst the heat of COVID? Time isn&rsquo;t far when people can experience the same with the help of virtual &amp; augmented reality which will enhance the shopping experience in a different space altogether with AI assisting in appropriate suggestions knowing your likes and d&eacute;cor.WorkplaceTransformed recruitment &amp; onboarding: AI &amp; VR can anytime stimulate the hiring &amp; onboarding process. AI powered profile matching and screening can help in creating a pool of potential candidates and enhance the probability of job fitment. Assessment centres can be converted into virtual cohorts to gauge the performance of the candidate along with gauging the body language to augment the hiring decision. Onboarding &amp; induction will be about creating an unbeatable experience for the new hire. AI-enabled chatbots will be the talk of the town to help new hire settle in the new role. With the introduction of VR, virtual tours can be created to make the incumbent familiar with the workplace and thereby boosting up the morale.Creating smarter workplace: How about creating a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor for people visiting your workplace by easing out their entry process? Employees no longer need to go to the reception to receive the visitor and yet the visitor would be guided for his way. Meeting notes are automatically getting converted into transcripts and sent to the attendees; language is no longer a barrier as the chat bot manages the translation and life becomes easy.Fast paced development cycle: Organizations can significantly reduce their cycle time by leveraging the cognitive model of virtual reality which is less costly as you do not have to spent hefty amount on developing prototypes. One can experience and experiment the exact model via virtual designs.Security Workplace: AI &amp; VR act as security shields by installing stronger access control points. AI &amp; VR together can help us in analysing the entry &amp; exit patterns by uncovering the mood of an employee or a visitor, which can again help us in developing insights about any potential physical or emotional threat.AI &amp; VR have already changed the way we consume information around us, and we are increasingly getting dependent on our virtual friends in our personal lives. As one of the corners in our homes turns out to be our workstation, virtual reality has become an inexorable part of our lives. &ldquo;Future of work&rdquo; is about creating happy organizations by helping employees integrate their personal priorities with professional priorities. Thus it&rsquo;s of high importance that we embrace this change wholeheartedly, instead of being sceptical about it. We need to &ldquo;get comfortable with experimentation.&rdquo;(Dakshdeep Singh is Associate Vice President - Customer Onboarding at PeopleStrong.

In Estonia, there are around 30 Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions deployed in the Estonian public sector that were identified as active as of the beginning of June 2020. The Baltic nation aims to have at least 50 AI use cases by the end of 2020.
And that is just the beginning. Estonia’s AI strategy is the next stage of digital public services, all part of e-Estonia. What is most interesting about it, is that its vision sounds as if it was taken from a science fiction script. Yet, it is all almost around the corner. In 2020, Estonia is working toward realizing its AI Strategy vision, called KrattAI. 
Estonian companies widely use AI solutions in several business areas for optimizing business processes, automating customer service, in product quality control, and in risk mitigation to name just a few. 
Indeed, Estonia’s efficient, secure, and transparent ecosystem has earned the nation the title of the world’s most advanced digital society.
But, how did Estonia, a small Baltic nation in Northern Europe, led by a female president, managed to be recognized as the most advanced digital society on the planet?

Estonia borders the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland. Estonia includes more than 1,500 islands featuring a diverse terrain which spans rocky beaches, old-growth forests, and many lakes. 
Formerly part of the Soviet Union (officially The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR), also referred to as Soviet Russia, and today The Russian Federation), Estonia is dotted with beautiful medieval castles, old churches, and hilltop fortresses. 
The capital city, Tallinn, is known for its well preserved Old Town, museums, and the 314-meter-high Tallinn TV Tower, which has an observation deck.

Estonia creates the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy
In 2019, the Estonian government outlined the current and future usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government and private services. The main challenge was to create the legal and strategic framework for accelerating AI development and making Estonia a trailblazer in this emerging field. 
The creation of Estonia’s National AI Strategy resulted in a detailed strategic plan for promoting the implementation of AI solutions in both public and private sectors. 
Following its successful plan, Estonia has become the world’s most digital society. Artificial Intelligence constitutes a fundamental pillar in instituting digital technologies into government and throughout the Estonian society, which Estonia refers to as e-Governance. 
The Estonian government is investing at least 10 million euros over the course of 2019 to 2021 in order to push further the full implementation of its National AI Strategy. 
From Kratt to KrattAI: How a mythological creature becomes Estonia’s AI National Strategy 
Unless you are Estonian, or are familiar with old Estonian mythology, you are probably wondering what a Kratt is. Like its Nordic neighbors, Estonia has a rich culture and some picturesque mythological creatures. Such is the case of the Kratt, pictured here below.
The Kratt is a mythological creature from old Estonian folklore. Pictured here is a version of how people view the Kratt in Estonia; the Kratt could be made of tools and metal objects, too. The Kratt was the inspiration for naming Estonia’s National AI Strategy, called KrattAI, Source: Anita/Flickr  
In Estonian mythology, a Kratt is a magical creature. A Kratt is a creature brought to life from hay or metal household objects, and it is animated by a human soul. Essentially, the Kratt was a servant made by its maker out of hay or old household items to help with tasks. The Estonian government uses this character as a metaphor for Artificial Intelligence and its complexities.
I asked Florian Marcus, Digital Transformation Adviser at the e-Estonia Briefing Centre, why the Estonian government chose the mythological Kratt to refer to its AI strategy. 
“A Kratt is a living being consisting of various objects. An interesting caveat is that you have to keep the Kratt busy. If you don’t keep it occupied, it will focus all of its ability on attacking its owner. So, giving the Kratt lots of tasks is essential, the harder the better. And to complete the parallels with reality, the only way to get rid of the Kratt in its entirety is to give it impossible tasks. A very nice series of analogies for technology, if you ask me,” Florian Marcus told me. 
To better illustrate why the Kratt needs to be fed with work, watch the short video below. It is a clip from the award-winning 2017 Estonian film November, featuring a Kratt. According to the folk stories, if the Kratt’s maker doesn’t keep the Kratt busy with work, the Kratt will kill its maker, or owner. 

KrattAI: Estonia’s National Strategy for AI implementation 
KrattAI is the vision of how public services should digitally work in the age of Artificial Intelligence. KrattAI will let people in Estonia use public information services by voice-based interaction with AI-based virtual assistants. 
The concept of KrattAI would allow people to get things done such as ordering a new passport from any device, and in the future, also from any majorly used virtual assistant. 
In the Estonian IT-sector, the Kratt is a metaphor for Artificial Intelligence. “KrattAI is the name of the overarching strategy to implement AI solutions within the public sector, usually providing services for citizens, but occasionally also making the lives of government workers easier. There are around 30 AI solutions in use right now,” Florian Marcus told me. 
Some of the AI solutions are used as both a citizen-side service and a government-side service. Marcus gives some examples: 
“For citizens and residents alike, we have Suve, a chatbot that was created in response to Covid-19. Already, Suve can interact with regular human speech (meaning, you can converse with Suve in free form). Still, the more data we input for AI systems, the better they get – so Suve will only become more helpful over time,” he said.
Suve’s main task is to make sure that everyone living in or visiting Estonia gets all their questions answered accurately and from official sources. Suve is integrated to many official public Websites. Suve is multilingual, providing information in English, Estonian, and Russian.  
“One niche solution that I like very much is the AI analysis of satellite data done by the Ministry of Agriculture,” says Marcus. “In order for farmers to receive some EU structural funds, they need to tend to their fields and cut them a certain number of times per year. In most countries (and, up until rather recently, also in Estonia) people from the ministry have to personally drive around the country to check whether farmers mow their fields with the frequency to actually qualify for those funds. This is now being done by AI image analysis. The accuracy of the AI solution lies at around 90 percent.”
Suve: The Estonian chatbot for digital public services
The Suve chatbot is a relatively new addition to Estonia’s digital services. Suve was an idea that came from the Hack the Crisis hackathon, which was organized by Garage48 and Accelerate Estonia.
The hackathon was organized to beat the global pandemic affecting Estonia. “Startup-government collaboration is in the DNA of our Estonian digital society,” President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid said. 
Hack the Crisis is a global community that centralizes all the local events and information to participate in the online hackathons. The startups believe that the power of community has the power to fight and beat the pandemic. To achieve this, and after their local success, they also organize events to help countries around the world.
Estonia counts with approximately 1,000 startups, which positions the country among the top countries with more startups per capita. According to a study by Index Ventures in late 2018, Estonia is the best in the world in terms of startup regulation.
Legal perspective: Who is responsible for AI fails? 

To answer this question, first we need to bring to our attention a basic classification of Artificial Intelligence, and understand the three different types of Artificial Intelligence.


Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), focused on one single narrow task


Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system capable of human thinking. This kind of AGI, also called the Singularity, implies machine consciousness. According to multiple experts, AGI or the Singularity, is not expected to emerge until 2050 or 2060. Regardless of whether it is conscious or not, though, such AI could continuously improve itself, therefore, reaching far beyond human capabilities and becoming a super-intelligence 


Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI), more capable than human


Even though most of the currently used Artificial Intelligence applications are not very complex yet, the Estonian government can already clearly see that significant changes in advancement and complexity will take place over the next few years.
According to multiple experts, AGI or the Singularity, is not expected to emerge until 2050 or 2060.
So, for now, there is no need for substantial changes in the basics of the legal system. Both now and in the foreseeable future, Kratts are and will be human tools, meaning that they perform tasks determined by humans and express the intention of humans directly or indirectly. There is always a human behind any existing AI form.  
Even if the human has granted seemingly large freedom to the Kratt, today, there are no known so-called super agents that are able to operate independently and have intentions independent of humans. This basically means that the subjects of the legal regulations are humans. 
However, Artificial Intelligence is rapidly evolving. Artificial Super Intelligence could be here sooner than expected. Yet, there is definitely no rise of the machines here. Artificial Super Intelligence is not going to take over the world simply because it does not yet exist. And it will not exist any time soon. 
The Estonian government makes it clear stating that for the sake of legal clarity, it should be ensured that when exercising public powers or performing other public tasks, the actions of a Kratt will be attributed to the state through the company or body that used the Kratt in the meaning of state liability. 
In private relationships, for both natural and legal persons, the Kratt’s actions should be considered the actions of the Kratt’s user. Matters related to criminal liability need to be expanded, for instance, to include Kratts and their use by expanding the definition of instrumental execution. 
Benefits of implementing AI and automation 
Artificial Intelligence is something that many still fear. However, mass implementation of Artificial Intelligence represents various benefits for Estonia. In the public sector, more implementation of AI would allow the government to increase the user-centric services, improve the process of data analysis, and make the country work more efficiently by achieving the goals of developing the e-Government.
Artificial Intelligence can also play an important role in the digital revolution of the industry as well as opening up the possibility to attract new investments and a plethora of innovation activity to Estonia; developers of technology are actively searching for a development and test environment that favours Artificial Intelligence solutions.
“Estonian quality of life is already very high thanks, in part, to digital solutions that mean we don’t have to ever visit a government office,” says Florian Marcus. In five years living in Estonia, Marcus explains, he has never had the need to do it. 
“That is already something that most people can currently only dream of. But there is more on the horizon: Implementing more and increasingly sophisticated AI solutions means that we can create a wholly new level of convenience for both society and government authorities. Interestingly, I believe that these solutions will compound – snowball-like – so that the benefits we draw from these solutions will grow exponentially,” Marcus says.
In Estonia, paramedics can access a person’s medical data while they’re on their way to the scene of the accident. “Another solution the government provides is a proactive service that is triggered when a child is born, so that you get an automatic notification asking you to which bank account you want the child benefits paid – no parent has to apply for these things ever again. Still, neither of these two services I described have anything to do with AI. If we bring AI into the picture, we could imagine a service that works based on the voice assistant you already have on your phone.”
Of course, Estonia is in the first place a socially advanced society. It counts with a state-of-the-art healthcare system, a system which already provided such benefits to all its citizens before Estonia reached the current level of digital transformation. What AI and digital implementation are doing is, as Marcus pointed out, facilitating and improving citizens’ life by providing added agile solutions to everyday situations. 
“Imagine you’re in a foreign country, pregnant, and you feel you’re about to go into labour. Wouldn’t it be great to just tell Siri or your Google Assistant that you’re about to have a baby, and in the background, the AI calls an ambulance to your location, forwards your medical data to the nearest hospital, alerts the Estonian embassy in that country, creates a new electronic ID for your baby, and also starts child benefit payments? Then, the voice assistant calmly informs you that everything has been sorted out and that the ambulance will reach your location in two minutes. This is amazing,” says Marcus. 
If you are thinking that the above has been taken from a science fiction book or movie, think again. Because it is exactly what the Estonian government is working on right now as you are reading this.
“As you can see,” Marcus continues, “all of the digital solutions that we have built up over the last twenty years will be revolutionized as holistic services thanks to the implementation of AI. It is very hard to overstate how beneficial this will be for the country.”RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Mike Murray, commander of Army Futures Command, said during a June 10 webinar hosted by the Association of the United States Army that the task force has moved forward on the projects through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, launched in late 2018 .First, the team is working on programs dedicated to unmanned-unmanned teaming, or developing the ability of air and ground unmanned vehicles to talk to one other.The other effort underway is on a DevSecOps environment to develop future algorithms to work with other Army systems, Murray said. He did not offer further detail.The task force force has fewer than 15 people, Murray said, and fiscal 2021 will be the first year that it receives appropriated funds from Congress. Much of the work the task force has done so far as been building the team.In response to an audience question, Murray said that the task force is not yet working on defending against adversarial machine learning, but added that leaders recognize that’s an area the team will need to focus on.“We’re going to have to work on how do we defend our algorithms and really, how do we defend our training data that we’re using for our algorithms,"" Murray said.In order to train effective artificial intelligence, the team needs significant amounts of data. One of the first projects for the task force was collecting data to develop advanced target recognition capabilities. For example, Murray said, being able to identify different types of combat vehicles. When the work started, the training data for target recognition didn’t exist.“If you’re training an algorithm to recognize cats, you can get on the internet and pull up hundreds of thousands of pictures of cats,” Murray said. “You can’t do that for a T-72 [a Russian tank]. You can get a bunch of pictures, but are they at the right angles, lighting conditions, vehicle sitting camouflaged to vehicle sitting open desert?”Murray also said he recognizes the Army needs to train more soldiers in data science and artificial intelligence. He told reporters in late May that the Army and CMU have created a masters program in data science that will begin in the fall. He also said that the “software factory,” a six- to 12-week course to teach soldiers basic software skills. That factory will be based in Austin, where Futures Command is located, and will work with industry’s local tech industry.“We have got to get this talent identified I’m convinced we have it in our formations,” Murray said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET. He previously reported on federal IT and cybersecurity for Federal Times and Fifth Domain, and worked as a congressional reporting fellow for the Texas Tribune. He was also a Washington intern for the Durango Herald.

They are also called Knowledge-based Systems. I hope to write about what is an expert system, features of expert systems, applications of expert systems and many more things here. The importance of this topic is Expert Systems are one of the major areas of Artificial Intelligence. Expert systems come under cognitive systems. If you have not an idea about it please go through this article.What is an Expert System?In AI, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human experts. Human experts may be doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, scientists, carpenters, musicians and so on. The purpose of an expert system is to solve the most complex issues in a specific domain. Expert systems were the predecessor of the current day artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning systems.The problem solving skills of experts is based on two knowledge areas. They are subject specific knowledge(domain knowledge) and problem solving knowledge. When two medical doctors are considered their subject specific knowledge or domain knowledge are similar. But their problem solving strategies may be different. That is the reason for two doctors are not same.Features of Expert SystemsConsider a scenario when you meet a medical doctor and understand features of an expert system.Expert asks more questions than the clients — When you go to meet a doctor, he/she asks questions more than you.Experts can work on incomplete information — Doctors can predict and decide our disease before we tell everything.Experts can give not only the answers but also reasons for the answers — If we ask from doctor, what is the reason/ what are the reasons for this disease, doctor can explain it.Experts can give more than one solution(alternative solutions) — If a patient says doctor I have an allergy on this tablet, doctor can give another one.Experts know the level of assurance of their answers — Doctor can tell assurance of medicine as 80% assurance for amoxicillin and 60% assurance for penicillin.Experts operate on specific areas — There are specialist doctors in different areas such as Dermatologists, Endocrinologists, Gastroenterologists and so on.Experts give recommendations than exact answers — There is no exact medicine separate as this medicine is only given for this disease.Experts use heuristics and experiences — Doctors use their common sense, past experiences when give medicine.How Expert Systems workYou can easily understand the procedure of expert systems considering the process of consultation of doctors.Start of the dialogue — When a patient goes for a doctor, the doctor starts to ask questions.Forming conflit set — After asking questions from the patient,doctor can make a conflict set according to the patient’s complains and symptoms.eg:- When a patient complains about fever and vomiting, the doctor can form a conflict set as follows.R1 Infection- fever, headache, vomitingR2 dengue- fever, diarrhea, vomitingR3 dengue- red eyes, vomitingR4 food poisoning- vomiting, headacheConflict resolution — According to the above conflict set , the doctor can selects an order of rule.eg:- R3, R4, R1Missing Information — When R3 is being considered, the doctor might ask whether you have red eyes to conclude the patient has dengue(incomplete information).Alternate solutions — Assume that the patient said no red eyes. Then doctor should go to R4, the second conflict rule. Considering R4, the doctor asks again whether he is suffering from headache. If the answer is “yes ”, then R4 concludes there is food poisoning. Sometimes the doctor might stop at that point. If he/she is a clever doctor, the doctor might consider R1 alternative solution if possible.Uncertainty handlingExplanations — If the first diagnosis(food poisoning) was rejected by the patient, doctor should give explanation referring to vomiting and headache. But if the patient tells if not having bad meal, the doctor will have to consider another rule.Architecture of Expert Systemscomponents of an Expert SystemThere are 3 main components in an Expert System.User Interface — This component helps to non-expert users to interact with the expert system and find a solution to the problem. An interface for an expert system is more complex than a interface for other systems or software solutions. Because there should be possibilities such as providing answers for asked questions, explanations, alternative solutions, capturing missing information in an expert system. In addition, Expert Systems interfaces can also handle the interaction through the natural language(voice and text). Chatbot is a good example for natural language interface for all kind of software. Today, many Expert Systems have web based interfaces. Because web interfaces can support many media such as graphic, images, voice etc.Knowledge Base — This is a container of Expert Systems. It represents facts and rules. It consists of knowledge in a particular domain as well as rules to solve a problem, procedures and intrinsic data relevant to the domain. The knowledge may be stored in databases, web servers, file servers, or cloud. The Knowledge Base should be structured depending on requirements such as dynamic information and static information.Inference Engine — This is a distinct feature on Expert Systems. All problem solving strategies or features of Expert Systems are built into Inference Engine. Basic Artificial Intelligence techniques such as search algorithms, forward chaining, backward chaining are considered as inference techniques. Inference Engine makes the Expert Systems different from classical database system.Since the Inference Engine works on the Knowledge Base, their structure should be compatible. When we say Expert Systems are intelligent, bigger credit should go to the Inference Engine. But there is no use of Inference Engine if the Knowledge Base is empty.Applications of Expert SystemsThere are many applications of Expert Systems in real world problem. Some of most popular applications have been mentioned here.Information managementHospitals and medical facilitiesHelp desks managementEmployee performance evaluationLoan analysisVirus detectionUseful for repair and maintenance projectsWarehouse optimizationPlanning and schedulingThe configuration of manufactured objectsFinancial decision making Knowledge publishingProcess monitoring and controlSupervise the operation of the plant and controllerStock market tradingAirline scheduling & cargo schedulesMedical diagnosis and adviseEngineering designFault diagnosisCounsellingCareer guidanceTravel advisory systemLogistic planning systemsExamples of Expert SystemsThere are many examples of expert system. Some of them are written here.MYCIN: One of the earliest expert systems based on backward chaining. It can identify various bacteria that can cause severe infections and can also recommend drugs based on the person’s weight.DENDRAL: It was an artificial intelligence based expert system used for chemical analysis. It used a substance’s spectrographic data to predict it’s molecular structure.R1/XCON: It could select specific software to generate a computer system wished by the user.PXDES: It could easily determine the type and the degree of lung cancer in a patient based on the data.CaDet: It is a clinical support system that could identify cancer in its early stages in patients.DXplain: It was also a clinical support system that could suggest a variety of diseases based on the findings of the doctor.Advantages of Expert SystemsLow accessibility costFast responseLow error rateCapable of explaining how they reached a solutionLess production costReducing riskSteady responseDisadvantages of Expert SystemsExpert system have no emotionsCommon sense is the main issue of the expert systemIt is developed for a specific domainIt should be updated manually. It does not learn itselfNot capable to explain the logic behind the decisionLimitations of Expert SystemsDon’t have human-like decision making power/Unable to make a creative response in an extraordinary situationCan’t possess human capabilitiesCan’t produce correct result from less amount of knowledge/Errors in the knowledge base can lead to wrong decisionRequires excessive training/The maintenance cost of an expert system is too expensiveI think you can give a brief idea about Expert Systems through the above mentioned facts. This is not an easy or short area to discuss from only one article. The intention of this article is to give a simple idea for you. After reading this article, seek and gather more information on Expert Systems. Now time is yours. If you gain something from this article, please share with your friends.Cheers…!!!References[1] https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expert-systems/[2] https://www.guru99.com/expert-systems-with-applications.html#10",https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/expert-systems-c082a596c407,Expert Systems - DataDrivenInvestor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-06T15:16:54.426Z,c082a596c407,['Sadheera Mahanama']
