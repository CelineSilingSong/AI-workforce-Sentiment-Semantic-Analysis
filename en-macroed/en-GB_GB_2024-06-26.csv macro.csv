The common theme we’ve been hearing from all quarters in recent times is artificial intelligence is the job-killer, accompanied by scary headlines. “AI is going to eliminate way more jobs than anyone realizes,” screamed a headline in Business Insider last August. “AI is replacing human tasks faster than you think,” CNN recently blared. Everywhere are lists of jobs AI is or will soon be replacing, such as this dour piece from MSN: “24 Careers AI Might Take Over: Will Your Job Survive?” “While your job may be safe for now, there’s no guarantee you’ll be set for the future,” the author gloomily predicts.


However, it appears workers didn’t get the memo — or pile of memos. In recent surveys, there is scant evidence of fear and loathing among the workers who may see their jobs shift as AI looms greater on the scene. Most workers, in fact, seem pleased that AI will be assisting them in their pursuits.

For example, a new survey of 6,000 employees by Salesforce finds 77% of today's workers trust AI, and even want AI to do almost half of their work tasks. Leading categories for trust in completely autonomous work tasks include writing code (trusted by 15%), uncovering data insights (13%), and drafting written communications (12%), and acting as a personal assistant (12%).

PROMOTED
Likewise, only five percent of 150,735 workers responding to a survey out of Boston Consulting Group expressed fear that AI would eliminate their jobs. On the other hand, 25% expected no impact on their jobs, and another 49% said AI may change some tasks.

A majority of 56,600 workers surveyed by PwC also expect a positive impact from AI as well. At least 31% anticipate that AI will increase their productivity and efficiency, while 21% expect AI to create new job opportunities.

Workers today already trust AI to do roughly 43% of their work tasks, the Salesforce survey shows. Close to eight in ten, 77%, of workers will eventually trust AI to operate autonomously. Ten percent even trust autonomous AI today, while 26% will trust autonomous AI in less than three years.

Nearly 40% of employees use generative AI tools regularly, the BCG survey observes. They do not fear generative AI, either — most say that they will need help to understand what skills to build.
Trust is the key. Workers want to be involved in the process of rolling out AI to fulfill tasks. At least 63% seek to have more say over AI implementation decisions, the Salesforce survey shows. At issue is the fact that 54% say they do not know how AI is implemented or governed in their workplace. Training may be another key to trusted autonomy: 62% of workers say more skill-building and training opportunities would build their trust in AI.
Workers who currently use generative AI do so for simple activities such as research, administration, and translation, BCG finds — “uses that are akin to replacing Google with genAI,” the survey’s authors observe.
Workers using generative AI the most frequently are leveraging it for their core work tasks, not just for general administrative work and research, the BCG authors add. “Personal GenAI applications most often involve finding facts and gaining general knowledge (40%), developing skills and learning (38%), or translating material from other languages (33%).”
Outside of the workplace, people are using generative AI a career advancement or job-search tool, using it to develop résumés and cover letters, for example.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at New York University Abu Dhabi invites applicants to apply for the open Postdoc position in the Project Collaborative Multi-Robot Swarms in Unknown Environments.</p>

<p>CAIR invites qualified applicants with a doctorate degree in the areas of electrical, or computer, or mechanical engineering, or related field to apply. A strong publication record is encouraged and previous experience in areas such as Distributed control and optimization, Swarms, Autonomous Robots, Embedded systems development, Collaborative and adversarial control, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is desired. The position is open to PhDs with background in robotics, controls, AI, and/or computer vision. The candidate is expected to work in a highly collaborative multi-disciplinary environment with other post-doctoral associates, PhD and undergraduate students, as well as faculty members. It is expected that applicants have a strong publication record in the aforementioned areas.  The applicants are also expected to have strong analytical, communication, and writing skills.</p>

<p>The successful applicant will work on several projects including development of distributed multi-agent autonomous systems and related technologies. This will include development of distributed monitoring algorithms enabling agents in a multi-agent swarm to autonomously locate other agents in its neighborhood, analyze their behavior, and probabilistically predict future motions/behaviors. As part of this work, the successful applicant will work on sensor data processing and data fusion, dynamics modeling and estimation, multi-agent collaboration algorithms, and inter-agent distributed introspection of agent behaviors to detect behavioral modifications (e.g., due to malfunctions and/or attackers). The algorithmic development will need to take into account various uncertainties and possible adversarial elements wherein some agents in a swarm have been modified by an adversary. The work will include algorithm design, prototype implementation (e.g., in Matlab/Python), deployment (to the agents’ autopilots using the Robot Operating System), and experimental testing (on unmanned vehicle swarms).</p>

<p>A solid competency with the standard implementation tools used in autonomous robots and embedded systems (e.g., C, C++, Linux, MATLAB, Python, Robot Operating System, Ardupilot, Solidworks, Gazebo Physics Engine Simulator) is required.</p>

<p>The terms of employment are very competitive and include housing and educational subsidies for children. Applications will be accepted immediately and candidates will be considered until the position is filled. For consideration, applicants need to submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae with full publication list, degree transcript, statement of research interests, and at least two letters of reference, all in PDF format. If you have any questions, please email Professor Antonios Tzes at <a href=""mailto:anthony.tzes@nyu.edu"">anthony.tzes@nyu.edu</a>, or Professor Farshad Khorrami at <a href=""mailto:khorrami@nyu.edu"">khorrami@nyu.edu</a> .</p>

Orby AI, a startup building a generative AI platform to automate repetitive and tedious enterprise work, announced today that it has raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. The company also unveiled its new “large action model” technology that powers its AI agents to learn and automate complex business processes.
“We are launching our Series A fundraise—it’s $30 million,” said Bella Liu, co-founder and CEO of Orby AI, in an interview with VentureBeat. “Alongside it, we’re also announcing our big platform technology. We call it a ‘large action model’ — if you can imagine, it’s like a GPT-type of model — it’s really, really big. The input is all the actions the model observes, and the output is the code you can use to automate the work.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Orby AI’s generative AI platform aims to differentiate itself from traditional robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. “Traditional solutions are still mostly built based on rules. In real processes, there are just so many different scenarios, especially when the process becomes complex,” explained Liu. “What we do is fundamentally different because this is using foundation models, it’s generative AI powered, and we can actually automate very complex processes that are not just based on rules.”
Generative process automation: The next frontier in AI-powered productivity
The company is coining the term “generative process automation” to describe its new paradigm. Orby AI’s platform uses multi-modal inputs like screenshots, clicks, and keystrokes to train its large action models. The AI can then generate scripts and code to automate workflows, while still involving human employees for feedback and handling edge cases.
Liu shared a customer example of Fortune 500 auditors using Orby AI to audit millions of employee expense receipts, which normally takes 10-15 minutes per receipt. “The auditor just needs to install Orby and show it what they do. With just one iteration, Orby can already create a workflow with code behind the scenes. When Orby is unsure about some really complex case, it will pop up a window to ask the human auditor for feedback.”
Investors bet big on Orby AI’s vision for enterprise generative AI adoption
The Series A funding will be used for continuous product development and go-to-market expansion. Orby AI is currently focused on serving large enterprise customers, with traction in industries like technology, insurance, consumer goods, and real estate. The company sees the most adoption in back-office functions like finance, accounting, HR and operations.
As generative AI continues to advance, solutions like Orby AI have the potential to dramatically improve efficiency and productivity for data-intensive enterprise workflows. By combining the power of large language models with grounded multi-modal inputs and human feedback, Orby’s approach points to a future where AI works closely alongside human employees to automate complex knowledge work.advertisement
However, as with any automation technology, companies will need to carefully manage the transition and potential impacts on jobs and roles. “I actually think this is going to create a lot more jobs,” said Liu. “When we automate work, it actually makes the human more valuable, because now the human has more leverage… they can do more.”
The $30 million in fresh funding suggests that investors are bullish on the enterprise applications of generative AI and Orby’s approach in particular. As more companies look to harness the technology, Orby AI aims to establish itself as a leader in AI-powered enterprise process automation.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IN A MINUTE OR LESS
Generative AI or “GenAI” is already transforming how we handle discovery in numerous ways, including:

Providing faster access to meaningful information and key documents to help quickly understand and develop critical case strategies;
Summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of data to isolate key documents and narratives without the need for review of every document; and
Generating substantive outputs like privilege logs and deposition digests in shorter amounts of time, allowing increased focus elsewhere.

As a tool designed to connect the dots in data, recognize patterns, and even reason like humans, GenAI “thinks” like you do. If you know how to ask questions, give instructions, and provide feedback, you already know how to use GenAI. In a minute or less, here is what you need to know about working with GenAI in discovery.
Cutting Through the Noise
As data volumes and sources continue to increase, tools that can help sift through data quickly and accurately—finding key documents that support the offensive and defensive narratives of the case—are invaluable. Whereas e-Discovery practitioners have been using AI for decades for just this purpose, the advent of GenAI allows a more interactive and iterative experience with data.
For example, GenAI tools embedded in document review databases can query an entire database to find very specific documents or document sets. Questions like “Are there any documents that indicate that Company A misrepresented its financial performance to investors?” or “Were there internal meetings or conversations at Company A around 1 June 2021 regarding the company’s financials?” can immediately identify key documents and data patterns without needing to rely on search terms. GenAI is designed to eliminate the so-called fishing expeditions we often go on in discovery in order to find those critical pieces of evidence that can make or break a case. 
Rapid Data Synthesis and Outputs
Similarly, a staple of GenAI tools is the ability to summarize large amounts of data—oftentimes in minutes. Whereas we used to have to rely on humans to read and review every document on a particular topic and manually create summaries, GenAI can now do it to requested outputs.
Whether requesting a high-level summary of customer service calls for a product at issue in a matter, a detailed summary of a witness’s disciplinary record and HR file within a company, or a bulleted list of a deponent’s inconsistencies during testimony, GenAI will listen to your prompting and instructions and provide the foundation necessary to build your case.
With proper guidance and input from humans, GenAI tools can generate content such as privilege logs and deposition or witness interview outlines in a fraction of the time that it would take to do it manually. For example, GenAI can use parameters for privilege descriptions and claims, apply those to the designated corpus of data, and create a log or analyze designated key data about a witness.
Practical Tips for Working With GenAI
Learn the Lingo
As with all new technology, it is important to learn key terms and concepts to ensure proper understanding and facilitate effective communication, both with the tool and with your colleagues and clients.

Large Language Models: Models trained on vast amounts of data to create the foundation of a generative AI tool.
Prompt engineering: The (typically iterative) process of designing inputs for AI tools to create the desired output.
Hallucinations: Outputs generated by an AI tool that are inaccurate or misleading but presented as correct.
Machine Learning: A form of AI in which computers and tools learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so and with minimal human intervention. 

Give it a Try
While it may be daunting, the only way to learn about GenAI is to try it out. The tools are designed to interact with users as if they are also human. You can talk to these tools like humans (even “please” and “thank you”), ask direct questions like they are humans, and provide instructions as you would a colleague. GenAI tools can tell you what else you might want to ask it or what else you might need to know that you haven’t thought of yet.
Practice
There are many GenAI tools available that are great options for honing your skills and confidence. With no need for formal training (although this is available as well), simply start asking questions or giving instructions and assess your results.
Be Bossy and Demand Satisfaction
The tool won’t mind if you’re a little demanding. A key to successful reliance on GenAI is clarity in your prompt and iteration to a satisfactory result. If you are not satisfied with the initial (or the second, third, or tenth) results, say so and ask the tool to try again based on revised instruction.
Know Its Limitations
GenAI is designed to work with human interaction and oversight. It should never replace human judgment or eliminate ethical responsibilities and considerations. Trust but verify!

Students Headed to High School Are Academically a Year Behind, COVID Study Finds

The public release of ChatGPT in April 2022 sparked a wave of fear and excitement among educators. While some expressed hesitation about the ability of generative artificial intelligence to make cheating undetectable, others pointed to its potential to provide real-time, personalized support for teachers and students, making differentiated learning finally seem possible after decades of unmet promises. 
Today, that potential has begun to come to fruition. Recent national survey data indicate 18% of teachers have used genAI, mostly to support differentiated lesson planning, and 56% of educators believe its use in schools will continue to grow. Increasingly, districts are introducing students to this technology, with products like Khanmigo — which provides individualized tutoring — already being adopted in Indiana, Florida and New Jersey. And students are experimenting with it outside the classroom as well. According to a recent survey, approximately half of 14- to 22-year-olds report having used genAI at some point.
But rapid changes in technology and the speed of adoption are far outpacing the field’s understanding of impacts on teaching and learning. Every day there is a new story about an exciting AI-related development, but given the time it takes to conduct careful evaluation, very limited evidence exists about whether any of these tools have positive benefits for students. As schools start facing hard choices about where to spend their resources in response to continued learning gaps and the ESSER funding cliff, it’s important to take a look at what we know about the impact of genAI on education and what more we need to learn. 
What we know
Educators spend about 46% percent of their time on tasks that don’t directly involve teaching, ranging from taking attendance and submitting reports to giving written feedback to students. Gen AI tools hold promise for speeding up and even automating these tasks, saving time that could be spent building meaningful relationships and deepening learning. For example, researchers from UC Irvine found that teachers in California and North Carolina who used the genAI product Merlyn Mind, which automates test question creation and lesson planning, reported spending less time on administrative tasks and more on teaching and learning after seven weeks of use compared to educators without access to the tool. And about 44% of teachers who have used genAI agree the technology has made their job easier. 
Related4 Things Districts Should Do Right Now — Before the Fiscal Cliff
To date, however, most of these findings rely on anecdotal reports. To quantify the impact of genAI on time saved, the field needs more rigorous evidence — such as through randomized controlled trials — to not only gauge the impact on administrative burden but to explore whether these tools help improve teaching quality. 
A separate body of research is finding that genAI-based coaching tools, which aim to give regular, impartial, real-time feedback in a cost-effective way, can have small effects on targeted teacher practices. For example, researchers at Stanford and the University of Maryland developed “M-Powering Teachers,” an automated coaching tool that uses natural language processing to give educators feedback. Across two randomized controlled trials, the tool was shown to reduce teacher-directed talk, increased student contributions and improved completion of assignments. Another study found that feedback provided via TeachFX, an app that uses voice AI to assess key indicators of classroom quality, increased teachers’ use of focusing questions that probe students’ thinking by 20%. 
Another randomized controlled trial found a genAI-enabled coaching tool that provided targeted feedback increased the quality of math tasks assigned to students and created a more coherent learning environment. Perhaps more impressive, the feedback resulted in a small positive improvement in students’ knowledge of ratios and proportional relationships, the area it focused on. 
These studies show early promise, but the impacts they found have been small. As AI-enabled coaching products for teachers start to expand to more classrooms, more evaluation is needed to better understand the potential of genAI to truly improve teaching and, ultimately, student learning. 
What we need to learn
Despite early evidence that AI has potential to make teachers’ jobs a bit easier and professional development more effective, the verdict is still out on whether having students interact directly with genAI can improve academic and social-emotional outcomes. These technologies, especially in education, are changing rapidly, making rigorous studies challenging. This point was recently made by the Alliance for Learning Innovation in calling on Congress to budget almost $3 billion to address the issue.
RelatedAI & Schools: 4 Ways Artificial Intelligence Can Help Students
While some tools — like Khan Academy’s Khanmigo (which has received funding from Overdeck Family Foundation) — are based on evidence that personalized learning can support better outcomes for some students, and some emerging research indicates that hybrid AI-human tutoring may boost achievement, it is not yet clear whether genAI tools themselves can strengthen and supplement student learning. As these types of products move into classrooms, there is a clear need for families, educators and policymakers to demand proof that they improve outcomes and do not unintentionally harm students most in need of effective support by providing incorrect guidance and feedback. 
This is an exciting moment for education, with transformative technology finding its way into all our lives in a way that hasn’t been seen since the introduction of smartphones. Yet much research on genAI does not consider the types of ed tech products schools are actually buying. Instead, it comes from lab-based studies and tools that are not actually used or tested in the classroom. 
RelatedAI Will Not Transform K-12 Education Without Changes to 'the Grammar of School'
Now is the time — before these technologies become pervasive — to rigorously evaluate what is being sold into and used in schools. The goal of educators should always be to ensure that students have the most effective tools for learning, not merely those with the best sales pitch.

AI Robotic Process Automation Companies
The fields of robotics and automation existed long before AI became a viable business solution. However, early uses of robotics—notably in auto factories—were merely devices programmed to perform the same task again and again. The more recently developed field of robotic process automation (RPA) makes full use of AI.
RPA vendors develop AI-based software that learns and automatically performs routine office productivity tasks. For instance, an office manager who has to gather files for a weekly report can set up an RPA automation to do that routine task so they can focus on higher-value work.
While many large companies offer RPA as part of their overall portfolio—notably SAP, ServiceNow, and IBM—the vendors in this category specialize in creating intelligent automation and RPA solutions to boost productivity.

AI Industry Organizations
These industry organizations for the AI sector play a number of roles. First and foremost, they advocate for the regulation of artificial intelligence. This is an enormously important focus, given how AI’s exponential growth will affect everything around it. To what extent can we as a society impose guidelines on AI’s growth, which has thus far been driven by pure profit?
These groups also lobby for greater diversity in AI, which is essential. We’ve already seen that AI systems embody legacy bias; this must be corrected more proactively to create inclusive systems. Additionally, these AI organizations support cross-vendor development of AI to promote the overall advancement of the technology.

Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
Founded in 1979, the AAAI is an international scientific group focused on promoting responsible AI use, improving AI education, and offering guidance about the future of AI.

Bottom Line: AI Companies
This list of AI companies is, admittedly, a partial portrait. In truth, it’s a blurry snapshot of something whizzing by too fast to completely capture. The generative AI landscape in particular changes daily, with a slew of headlines announcing new investments, fresh solutions, and surprising innovations.
The progress of artificial intelligence won’t be linear because the nature of AI technology is inherently exponential. Today’s hyper-sophisticated algorithms, devouring more and more data, learn faster as they learn. It’s this exponential pace of growth in artificial intelligence that makes the technology’s impact so impossible to predict—which, again, means this list of leading AI companies will shift quickly and without notice.
As investment pours in, the underlying technologies that fuel artificial intelligence are each seeing their own rocket blasts of innovation. Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, generative AI—legions of researchers and developers are creating a remarkable profusion of generative AI use cases. In sum, the lifecycle for these AI companies is not so much digital transformation as digital revolution, and the next version of this list is likely to look completely different.

According to a recent survey from Microsoft, 71% of business leaders said they were more willing to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. About 77% of leaders said AI will help early career workers take on more responsibilities.Yet students don't see AI as a ticket to full-time employment. According to Handshake's data, most students are still using the technology for personal tasks or fun. One recent graduate told Handshake they were ""hesitant to use generative AI because it doesn't seem 'officially' accepted or commonplace yet, and I would feel lazy and guilty for using it to do work for me.""

The corporate world, however, is rushing to use AI in part because it can take on the tasks no one else wants to do. So it's up to schools to help students embrace the technology, Valerie Capers Workman, the chief talent officer at Handshake, told Business Insider. ""I believe that in three years, every role will require tech skills, regardless of the field,"" she said. ""So it's more critical than ever that institutions and employers support upskilling and provide training opportunities.""

This includes ensuring data privacy by adhering to regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Implement measures to mitigate bias in algorithms by using diverse training data sets and employing human oversight during the decision-making process. Develop a robust ethical framework that prioritizes fairness and transparency in all AI-powered HR practices.Leading the GenAI Transformation: A Practical ApproachHR departments must take a proactive stance in leading the GenAI transformation. Here are specific actions you can take:&bull; Partnering with IT: Collaboration between HR and IT is essential. Establish a strong working relationship to ensure the selection, implementation, and maintenance of GenAI tools align with both HR and IT objectives.&bull; Data Governance: Develop robust data governance practices to ensure high-quality training data for AI algorithms. This minimizes bias and discrimination in decision-making processes. Emphasize data security and implement measures to protect sensitive employee information.&bull; Measuring Success: Define clear metrics to track the impact of GenAI on HR processes, employee experience, and business outcomes. This could include metrics around time saved during recruitment, increased employee satisfaction with learning and development programmes, or improved efficiency in performance management processes. Regularly monitor and analyse these metrics to determine the success of your GenAI implementation.Success Stories: Real-World Examples of GenAI in ActionSeveral companies are already reaping the benefits of GenAI in HR:&bull; Hilton: Hilton leverages GenAI to personalize onboarding experiences for new hires. The AI tailors content and recommendations based on individual roles and career goals, ensuring a smoother and more engaging transition into the company.&bull; PwC: PwC utilizes GenAI chatbots to answer employee questions about benefits and company policies 24/7. This frees up HR professionals to handle more complex inquiries and provide personalized support to employees.&bull; Bank of America: Bank of America uses GenAI to analyse employee performance data and identify areas for coaching and development. This data-driven approach allows HR to provide targeted interventions that can significantly boost employee performance.These examples showcase the power of GenAI to enhance the employee experience, streamline HR operations, and unlock valuable insights for talent development.The Future of HR: More Human Than EverGenAI is not a replacement for HR professionals. It's a powerful tool that can augment our capabilities. By embracing GenAI and focusing on strategic people management, HR can position itself as a vital driver of innovation and employee success in the age of artificial intelligence.ConclusionThe future of HR is one where humans and AI work together in a symbiotic relationship. By proactively preparing companies and employees for GenAI, HR can ensure a smooth transition and unlock the vast potential of this technology to create a more efficient, engaging, and future-proof workplace. In the future workforce, humans will need to leverage their creativity, empathy, and judgment alongside the efficiency and scale of AI.

Samsung is unveiling ‘AI Class’, devices that can realistically help with everyday household chores, communication and leisure, thanks to advanced features using artificial intelligence. The devices will be easy to spot thanks to the special ‘AI Class’ label, which will mainly be found on household appliances and TVs. During a special press conference summarising the launch of the entire group of AI Class products – Jowita Michalska , known online as ‘Jowita Digital’ – an expert in AI, founder and CEO of Digital University – highlighted the advantages and opportunities of using AI in our everyday life.
AI is no longer a distant vision but an integral part of our everyday life. Also the domestic one. The future of artificial intelligence development should be based on the synergy between people and technology. And that is exactly what Samsung’s new AI class is. Through the use of the latest technology in devices, we have a real help for knowledge, communication, entertainment, housework, saving water, resources or energy, and even increasing security! Increasingly, we will also be the ones teaching the AI our habits and adapting it even better to our needs. This will give us time for pleasure, relaxation and the all-important self-development of today, concludes Jowita Michalska.
Samsung started working on AI 10 years ago. Today, it introduces the ‘AI Class’ and crosses the boundary beyond which an extremely large group of devices stands out, which, thanks to artificial intelligence, will help us to better organise our work, home and improve the comfort of our lives. It is already present in 240 household appliances, all Excellence Line 8K, OLED, Neo QLED, QLED and The Frame TVs from 2023 and 2024, and Galaxy smartphones from the S24 family. It has also made its way into the Galaxy Z Flip5 and 4, Z Fold5 and 4, S23 and S22 series and Tab S9 series tablets. Samsung’s air conditioners, medical devices and memory sticks also benefit from its capabilities.
AI from behind the scenes
Preparing a shopping list, finding a unique recipe, choosing the right cooking parameters. Cooking is a pleasure, but it also involves a lot of work, time and energy. Now, thanks to AI in Samsung appliances such as ovens and fridges, for example, we have greater convenience in our daily meal preparation. We are talking here about two flagship technologies: AI Vision and AI Pro Cooking!
The intelligent ‘AI Vision’ camera in Samsung fridges can identify the freshness of up to 33 different foods, and it does so based on an extremely rich database of food images. Based on their analysis by machine learning and the algorithms created, the recognised products appear on the display and “AI Vision” automatically updates their list. Users can set the shelf life of products and receive notifications when the end of their shelf life is approaching. AI therefore not only helps them to save money, but also prevents food waste and encourages an eco-friendly lifestyle. The fridge also has a function to suggest recipes using particular ingredients.
Once we have fresh produce, we can get down to cooking. And this is where the AI Pro Cooking in Samsung ovens comes to the rescue. With the help of the camera, the oven will recognise (the Sense Inside function must be activated from the oven control panel) what is in the oven and then suggest what cooking parameters will be suitable for the dish. In addition, thanks to the SmartThings app installed on your smartphone, you won’t forget that it’s time to switch off the oven, and if a cake has baked a while earlier, you’ll get a notification that it might be burning. So you don’t have to worry about missing out on something with multiple chores. Interestingly, you can also record a ten-second video to summarise the baking process.
The cleaning revolution is coming
It could be argued that AI brings 2-in-1 benefits – it simultaneously streamlines the home management process and helps save energy. A good example in this case are selected Samsung washing machines, already equipped with AI EcoBubble™ technology. It enables efficient and energy-saving washing even at low temperatures. Thanks to an intelligent sensor, the washing machine detects the type of fabric and, based on this, improves the washing performance by dosing the right amount of water and detergent, and then creates an active foam that penetrates the fabrics, making dirt removal up to 24% more efficient. Washing at low temperatures can also reduce energy consumption by up to 70%. Another technology available on selected washing machines to make doing the laundry easier is the ‘AI Optimal Wash’ programme, which uses advanced sensors to determine the weight and type of fabrics and how dirty the load is. This information allows you to optimise the amount of water and detergent used and, as a result, do an effective wash while optimising resource consumption!
And what about vacuuming? AI also finds its applications there. The Bespoke Jet upright hoovers have an AI Vacuuming Mode built in, which recognises the type of surface being cleaned in the mode.  And the latest Samsung Jet Bot Combo AI Steam recognises 3D objects, so you don’t have to clean things off the floor before vacuuming. This model adjusts the suction power and cleaning mode according to the surface, and also allows remote control of the device, such as managing the cleaning schedule.
Save energy at home with AI
Saving energy throughout your home with the click of a button? It’s possible! And it’s all thanks to the AI Energy Mode capabilities in the SmartThings app. How does it work? Imagine a fridge or TV that learns the user’s habits, e.g. how often the door is opened or how and when they watch films, whether in movie mode or dynamic mode. Based on this, the fridge optimises the operation of the appliance through an AI algorithm that adjusts the compressor speed and defrost cycle. Such a Fridge remembers how often we open it, when we put in new products and optimises its energy consumption to consume as little as possible. Thanks to this feature, it can use up to 15% less energy – it’s like being off for seven weeks a year. But AI Energy Mode is not just for fridges. The function can be activated throughout the house, the only condition being that appliances are connected to the SmartThings app. This applies to a select few – washing machines, dryers, dishwashers or televisions, where, in AI Energy Mode, the image is adjusted to the ambient brightness for an optimal visual experience in all lighting conditions. It also adapts to the content by analysing what the user sees and selectively lowers the brightness in key parts of the scene to increase the depth and expression of blacks.

TVs and memories have entered the AI era
The progress Samsung has made in AI technology is well illustrated by the development of the processors used in TVs. The first generation of Samsung TVs to use AI algorithms, the Excellence Line series – used a Neural Quantum chip based on 20 neural networks. The latest – the Neural Quantum 8K Gen3 – already supports 512 such networks (these chips were used in the Samsung Neo QLED QN900D 2024 TV). This is a necessary advance when we want to see more and better on our TVs, as evidenced by the growing popularity of screen diagonals of 65 inches or 75 inches and larger.
AI features on Samsung TVs not only improve the quality of the picture or sound, but also automatically optimise its settings. One of the most important tasks is upscaling, i.e. improving SD, HD content to near 4K quality or, in the case of higher resolution TVs such as the QN900D, to near 8K , sharpening the image and ensuring that the full potential of the processor, resolution and algorithms is used. AI Adaptive Mode automatically adjusts the picture settings according to the type of content being watched, be it a movie, sport or general programme, ensuring the best possible visual experience. Active Voice Amplifier Pro, on the other hand, detects ambient noise and intelligently increases the volume of dialogue so that it is always clear, even when background music or special effects are dominant (a real bane of cinema goers until recently).
Meanwhile, the AI Pro Motion Smoothener function removes the typical problems associated with watching any content with dynamically changing images, such as sporting events – it automatically detects the sport and, based on deep learning algorithms, activates the corresponding moving object detection model. This ensures that the ball is always clear no matter how fast it is moving or what type of competition we are watching. With enhanced deep learning, Image Depth Enhancement Pro adds detail to fast-motion images, using artificial intelligence to precisely control the mini LEDs. By detecting the part of the scene on which the eye would naturally focus, it adds realism and three-dimensionality to images. A similar solution has been developed for gamers. Samsung also keeps gamers in mind. AI Automatic Game Mode – this technology intelligently recognises the type of game being watched and optimises picture and sound quality. With reduced input lag, this also ensures better expression of movement during gaming.
And that’s not all! In order to implement and develop artificial intelligence, it is necessary to process huge amounts of data at high speed. At Samsung, we are continuously expanding products that support AI development such as chips, processors or memory, including Data Centre products and solid-state consumer drives. These components are part of AI devices. They are also part of the drives that each of us can have. We use the same technologies that we implement in Samsung Semiconductors’ advanced processes in every product in our portfolio. This means that any Creator today who creates something working with AI can store that data on our innovative and secure media.
Galaxy AI – the power of artificial intelligence in a smartphone

What counts in the workplace is changingBeing appreciated, good relations with colleagues and, of course, a quality relationship between private and professional life. About ten years ago, these three job characteristics were the most sought after among employees. A few years later, a good relationship with a superior entered the most important factors of job satisfaction. In 2021, during the pandemic, people still valued relationships with colleagues and work-life balance the most, but financial compensation gained ground. Mainly at the expense of the fact that income has become less stable and predictable for many people. Today we can see some interesting changes.Source: BCGFor the first time since the Boston Consulting Group monitors trends, security or job security in the first place. Perhaps this data is surprising, because at the same time we are in a period of record low unemployment. When we talk about job security, we are mainly referring to events related to enormous changes in many industries and geopolitical uncertainty. BCG believes that these are not the main reasons, but job security should come first because people are concerned about long-term employability. Here, of course, we are talking about technological disruptions, currently the biggest in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Survey participants who prioritize job security were more likely to report concern about the impact of artificial intelligence.The impact of technological developments on jobs is nothing new. The fact is that generative artificial intelligence raises the level of this disruption to a higher level. The impact is thus felt not only by those who perform repetitive work, but also by others with creative and conceptual professions. Therefore, it is quite logical that other attributes, such as the opportunity for learning and career development, salary and other ""goodies"" offered by employers, are also higher on the list.The global labor market remains confident…In the past few years, the demand for talented employees has increased. Employers continue to report that there is a shortage of suitable labor and, by all accounts, the situation will not change, let alone resolve, any time soon. It is interesting, however, that most participants in the BCG survey remain positive and confident. Namely, they believe that they have strong enough arguments to keep their jobs and everything that belongs to them as part of them. Source: BCG... even in the stage of artificial intelligence developmentAccording to the results of the survey, artificial intelligence is not as much of a threat as many feared. Most employees are not afraid that artificial intelligence could replace them. On the other hand, respondents remain realistic. Most around 70% expect their jobs to change, often a lot, and they expect to have to learn new skills. Only a quarter of participants in the survey believe that artificial intelligence will not affect their jobs. People are accepting generative artificial intelligence and are ready to learn new skillsTo understand how employees think about the future of their careers, employers need to explore their attitudes towards artificial intelligence:86% has heard about generative artificial intelligenceless than 50% have experimented with it at least onceapproximately 39% use it regularly, and 10% respondents use it several times a weekSource: BCGPeople are open to learning new skills. As many as 60% respondents are ready to retrain without basic knowledge, and almost 40% are ready to retrain if necessary.Source: BCGOpenness to retraining is influenced by many factors. Respondents who live in countries where job security is one of the main factors of job satisfaction are the most open to retraining. Their main goal is, of course, to ensure long-term employability. Respondents who believe that generative artificial intelligence will have a greater impact on their jobs—perhaps as a preemptive measure that allows them to completely change job types if necessary—share similar sentiments.About the “Decoding Global Talent” research series""Decoding Global Talent” is the largest source of data on where and how people want to work. It contains almost 900,000 answers on this topic. It is a joint project of BCG, The Network and The Stepstone Group.The current report contains trends and preferences in the field of working methods, including the most valued job attributes, willingness to learn new skills and key factors that would influence the unacceptability of jobs. This year's research focuses specifically on the impact of artificial intelligence. In this year's survey, we explored a new influence on ways of working: GenAI.

WATERVILLE, Maine — If you think artificial intelligence has evolved rapidly recently, you're not wrong, but Dr. Frank Appunn said the technology is still in its infant stages. 

“[We've] got to remember that this is going to change at a tremendous rate and we’re going to find new opportunities coming through,"" the cybersecurity professor at Thomas College explained. 







Appunn has worked in the cybersecurity industry for more than 20 years in the United States and in his home country of South Africa. He also helped launch cybersecurity-related programs at schools across the country. 

He's been a professor for Thomas's Master of Science in Cybersecurity program since it launched in 2019. The program will add an ""Artificial Intelligence Implications for Cybersecurity"" course. The school also has a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in cybersecurity. 

“The cyber issue is going to continue getting bigger, we’ll get help in some places and new pains will occur,"" he said. ""So, it’s a never ending cycle of adjustment, improvement, innovation, and defense.” 

Despite the growth of technology and AI-use, and a broader understanding of them, Appunn said there is still a severe need for skilled workers to work in the industry. That's one reason why Thomas College added the new course to the online program. 

“So gaining a skilled workforce for the benefit of education for the benefit of government, business and military and the rest of it is important, and [we can't] think it’s arrived,"" the professor explained. ""It is still in its initial starting phases with many different types of AI to come down the road.""

While AI can help streamline work tasks or assist business owners, Appunn said it also arms attackers with new tools to carry out cyber attacks and internet hacks. 

In February, an apparent cyberattack compromised several of Northern Light Health's computer servers. A spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine patient records were not on the impacted servers. 

U.S. Senator Angus King, I-Maine, has pushed for legislation to expand cybersecurity safeguards within hospital systems and has also been a part of efforts to expand the cybersecurity workforce by training more veterans interested in related careers.

Just last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warned community water systems around the country about an increasing number of cyberattacks.  

“The cyber students we’re creating [at Thomas College] have the mission of reducing and removing the bad and enabling the good,"" Appunn said. “This is an on-ramp and we can develop a lot further."" 

Moving forward, Appunn said he hopes to expand cybersecurity education into other programs around campus so more students have knowledge about evolving technology and know how to protect against attacks on individuals and organizations.

Ethical Considerations 
Generative AI and traditional AI face largely similar challenges in terms of ethics, including biases built into systems, job displacement and potential environmental impact.
Bias and Fairness
AI systems can inadvertently magnify biases that were built into their training data. These biases can lead to unfair outcomes, particularly for marginalized groups. To ensure fairness in AI, whether generative or traditional AI, there needs to be meticulous scrutiny of the training data, implementation of bias mitigation strategies, and continual monitoring of AI systems for biased behavior. Techniques like algorithmic fairness reviews and bias audits are a step toward promoting equity and inclusivity in AI applications​.
Security and Privacy
The security and privacy concerns raised by the deployment of AI technologies are pervasive. AI systems often need vast amounts of data, including personal and sensitive information, to function effectively. Whether generative or traditional, ensuring robust data protection measures and maintaining privacy throughout the AI lifecycle are critical. This includes implementing strong encryption, data anonymization techniques, and complying with regulations such as GDPR. Transparency about data usage and incorporating user consent is also essential in building trust and safeguarding privacy​.
Transparency and Explainability
For the ever-increasing reach and use cases of AI, we need to be able to trust AI and hold the technology accountable–and many users do not trust AI systems. This trust is enabled by transparency in AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) practices allow users and stakeholders to understand how AI algorithms make decisions. By providing clear and understandable explanations of AI processes, organizations can enhance user trust and facilitate better decision-making. A transparent system makes it easy to identify and address any ethical issues and to ensure AI systems are used responsibly​​.
Job Displacement and Economic Impact
One of the greatest concerns about the rise of AI has been job displacement as automated systems replace human roles. Alleviating this issue calls for strategies for transitioning workforces to new or evolved roles, such as reskilling and upskilling programs to prepare employees for roles created by AI advancements. Organizations need to consider the broader social implications of deploying AI solutions and work to implement practices that strike a balance between technological progress and socioeconomic stability.
Environmental Impact
The deployment and training of large AI models, especially generative AI, requires significant computational resources, which leads to substantial energy consumption and environmental impact. Organizations using AI need to develop and implement energy-efficient AI models. They also need to optimize computational resources to minimize carbon footprints. Encouraging sustainable practices in AI development and operation is a must for reducing the environmental impact and promoting green AI technologies​.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is Conversational AI the Same as Generative AI?
No, conversational AI and generative AI are related but distinct subsets of artificial intelligence. Conversational AI is designed to interact with users through dialogue, often used in chatbots and virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. It focuses on understanding and generating human-like responses to deliver meaningful interactions. Generative AI, on the other hand, refers to AI systems that create new content based on learned patterns from existing data. While conversational AI can use generative AI techniques to give responses, generative AI covers a broader range of creative applications beyond just conversation​.
What is the Difference Between Predictive AI and Generative AI?
Predictive AI focuses on analyzing existing data to forecast future events or trends. It uses techniques like regression analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning models to predict outcomes such as stock prices, weather conditions, or customer behaviors. Generative AI, however, aims to create new data rather than predict future events. It uses models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new content that is similar to the training data.
Why Has Generative AI Taken Off So Quickly?
Generative AI has rapidly gained popularity due to several key factors. The development of sophisticated models like GPT-4, GANs, and VAEs has significantly improved the quality and realism of generated content. Increased access to high-performance computing resources such as GPUs and cloud computing has enabled the training of complex generative models. The vast amount of data available for training these models has allowed them to learn from diverse and extensive datasets, enhancing their capabilities. Plus, the wide range of applications—from creative industries like art and music to practical uses such as text generation and synthetic data creation—has driven interest and investment in generative AI.
Bottom Line: Generative AI and AI Have Separate Strengths
Generative AI and traditional AI each bring unique strengths and challenges to the table. Generative AI is geared for creativity, generating new and innovative content, and is seeing more integration into fields like art, music, and content creation. In contrast, traditional AI focuses on analyzing existing data to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making, making it invaluable in sectors that value consistency and predictability such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.

By investing in AI-driven learning and development programs, employers can attract and retain top talent, drive innovation, and future-proof their workforce to stay competitive and foster growth.
Addressing AI Integration Challenges
Since widespread use of generative AI is in its early stages, many businesses are unclear about how to implement AI solutions strategically across their workforce’s mobile devices safely and securely. It can feel like building an airplane while in flight, with the blueprints continually morphing to adopt innovations. 
Organizations want to gain efficiencies and competitive advantages now while laying the foundation to further unlock the critical thinking, innovation, and creativity of their workforces in the future. However, this must all be done while keeping pace with unpredictable advancing technologies and breakneck innovation speeds. This can seem daunting, to say the least, but the truth is AI tools have been in the workplace for years in the form of simple tools like spell and grammar checks, searching the Internet, and digital voice assistants. 
The perceived complexity and cost of integrating AI into existing IT infrastructure has caused hesitation among IT departments to formally incorporate AI tools into their mobile device strategies. The prospect of overhauling established systems and processes and needing specialized technical expertise can deter organizations from embracing AI. Moreover, concerns about data privacy and security loom, particularly in highly regulated industries like healthcare and financial services, where stringent compliance requirements must be met. There may also be skepticism around the tangible benefits of AI implementation and uncertainties about its potential impact on workforce dynamics.
Undeniably, businesses that hesitate to adopt AI solutions risk falling behind competitors, losing out on hiring talent, and missing out on the efficiency gains and cost savings they offer. They may also struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving market dynamics and fail to meet the increasing demands of customers for personalized experiences and real-time insights.

Training sessions, user guides, and online resources can help employees make the most of AI-driven applications and services and ensure they feel comfortable using new tools. Not only will this protect the business’s investment in AI-enabled mobile devices for its workforce, but it will also build trust among employees concerned about job security as AI becomes more prevalent in their workplace.
Implement security measures: Undoubtedly, robust security measures to protect AI-enabled mobile devices and the data they contain from security threats and breaches are the most vital components of the rollout. Monitoring tools and processes to track AI usage on mobile devices can ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements. It should include monitoring data access, usage patterns, and security incidents related to AI applications. Enforcing strong authentication and access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and implementing mobile device management (MDM) solutions to monitor and manage devices remotely are most critical for a sustainable, scalable IT strategy.
Monitor and evaluate performance: Any successful implementation of a workforce mobile device strategy depends on the ongoing evaluation of the benefits and impacts on the business; as you can imagine, this only increases exponentially with the addition of AI. Monitoring the performance and usage of AI-enabled mobile devices and applications allows IT departments to identify any issues or areas for improvement. Collecting employee feedback, analyzing usage metrics, and conducting regular assessments will ensure the effectiveness and success of the rollout, along with regular audits and assessments of AI implementations to identify and address security gaps, compliance issues, and performance bottlenecks.
Stay updated and adapt: Staying updated on the latest developments and advancements in AI-enabled solutions can seem daunting, so assessing and evolving strategies and approaches must be done regularly. Enterprises will benefit from continuously evaluating and refining deployment strategies, adopting new features and functionalities, and addressing emerging security threats and challenges to stay ahead of the curve.

Embracing the Future of Work
As work habits evolve amidst increasing workplace challenges, AI is paving the way for the future of enterprise device management. Forward-thinking employers recognize AI as a powerful tool to enable employees to acquire new skills, adapt to changing roles, and embrace lifelong learning. Integrating AI into workflows via mobile devices is a direct investment in their workforce.

There’s no doubt that generative AI is reshaping business, work and life as we know it. According to a recent Accenture study, ninety-seven percent of global leaders believe generative AI will be transformative to their company and industry.

Many of the business leaders I’m talking to today are experimenting with generative AI. Leaders are piloting use cases, building policies and collecting feedback. As this exploratory phase continues, one thing is abundantly clear to me: Implementing a generative AI strategy is an HR responsibility just as much as an IT responsibility. That’s because generative AI is a human challenge as much as it is a technology challenge. It’s going to revolutionize how organizations manage talent and will fundamentally change how HR gets work done. We need to embrace that.
HR’s role in generative AI
Every conversation about the benefits of generative AI—productivity, performance, personalization—also leads to important questions about job displacement, data privacy and ethics.
These are innately human issues that point to a need for trust and transparency. Successful generative AI implementation isn’t just about being first; it’s about doing it right. It’s about collaboration, sustainability and driving value—and doing so responsibly. That means being discerning about the needs you’re filling and the pain points you’re solving.
It also means taking the time to build clear policies that address these critical areas:

The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape
Ethical AI and preventing bias
Protecting employee and customer data and privacy
Implementing new org structures and operating models to support AI
Offering training, coaching and resources to teach employees how to use generative AI, and reskilling if parts of their jobs are augmented

HR leaders have a responsibility to lean in and lead, working in close partnership with other leaders across the business, to solve these key challenges and set the vision for the company.
Building a culture that embraces AI
An effective internal generative AI strategy must be clear about the purpose it serves for employees. It should set people up for success, make their jobs easier, and encourage learning and growth. Transforming a business with generative AI is impossible until employees understand how it will transform their work. This requires a relentless focus on change management, enablement and communication.
As leaders, we need to help our employees understand:

Why is generative AI central to the business and people strategy? Will it boost productivity, performance, profitability or experience?
How will generative AI change an employee’s role and how work gets done?
Who is going to be impacted by generative AI?
What are we doing to prepare employees for this transformation? Do we have training in place to help employees build the skills they need? Are we creating new roles or responsibilities for impacted employees?

By 2030, activities that account for up to 30% of hours currently worked across the U.S. economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI, according to McKinsey. This doesn’t have to mean that generative AI will put people out of work.
I like to think of generative AI as an extension of our people that augments the work we’re doing. It can accelerate resume screenings and surface candidates with the right skills so recruiters can focus on high-impact work, like relationship-building. It can personalize onboarding to improve the experience a new employee has from day one. It can summarize employee survey results so teams can easily leverage the most important feedback and act quickly without manually sifting through pages of text. These are just a few examples that show the power of generative AI to transform how organizations manage talent.

If we can build a culture with trust, transparency and training at the foundation, we can create an environment for employees to thrive in partnership with AI. We can empower our people to focus on innovation instead of tactical tasks, to turn imagination into action and to do uniquely human things like create, experiment, empathize and invent. If we can lift our people as we embrace generative AI, the outcomes will be transformative. It is clear to me that generative AI will expand what people can accomplish and vice versa.
Welcome to the generative AI era
Driving lasting impact through generative AI can only be done by investing in the potential of people. We should use technology to augment our work lives so that we can focus on what lies at the very root of being human: innovation and ingenuity.
We are only just beginning to understand generative AI’s vast potential. While the concerns are real and we must have guardrails and guidelines, I’m optimistic it will ultimately empower people and unleash creativity. Every successful transformation I have seen has been people-led and tech-enabled. In the generative AI era, talent—paired with the right technology—is what will set your organization apart.

0Sponsored ArticleWhat Does It Mean To Be Skills-First? Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

From human intelligence collection to information gathered in the open, the CIA is leveraging generative artificial intelligence for a wide swath of its intelligence-gathering mission set today, and plans to continue to expand upon that into the future, according to the agency’s AI lead.
The CIA has been using AI for things like content triage and “things in the human language technology space — translation, transcription — all the types of processing that need to happen in order to help our analysts go through that data very quickly” as far back as 2012, when the agency hired its first data scientists, Lakshmi Raman, the CIA’s director of AI, said during an on-stage keynote interview at the Amazon Web Services Summit on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. 
On top of that, AI — particularly generative AI in recent years — has been an important tool for the CIA’s mission to triage open-source intelligence collection, Raman said.
“Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage AI in order to help us to triage,” she said, adding that generative AI has been successful in helping the CIA “classify and triage open-source events to help us search and discover and do levels of natural language querying with that data.”

Raman said the CIA, despite its clandestine reputation, was not insulated from the “generative AI zeitgeist” that has captivated the world since late 2022. That has resulted in other use cases like “search and discovery assistance, writing assistance, ideation aids, helping us with brainstorming, helping us generate counter-arguments.”
In an interview with FedScoop on the Daily Scoop Podcast earlier this year, Raman described how the CIA navigates using commercial generative AI tools due to the classified, sensitive nature of its work, saying that the agency wants to “use those solutions whenever we can.” However, there are cases with classified data that the agency’s AI specialists must build what Raman called “exquisite solutions for our more bespoke problems.”
With this adoption of generative AI comes added work around creating an environment that it can thrive in and a new, evolved approach to risk, she said Wednesday. 
“In addition to the actual pointy edge-of-the-spear tools, right, we also need the foundational capabilities to help us run and deploy the models,” Raman said at the summit. “We have catalogs for our models, as well as our training data sets. So it’s really about us creating that entire ecosystem for us to be able to leverage this to advance our mission and national security.”
In thinking about risk, Raman said one of her main focuses has been: “How will our users be able to use these technologies in a safe, secure and trustworthy manner?”

“That’s about making sure that they’re able to look at the output and validate it for accuracy,” she said. “And being bias-free, right? We work very closely with our general counsel, as well as our Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, to think about those types of activities. We want to make sure that our users feel very comfortable with it, so they understand that what they’re seeing is AI-generated output.”
What’s ahead for the CIA and generative AI
Raman has a number of things on her mind as she ponders the future of generative AI within the CIA, from how it could become a normal part of each of the agency’s five directorates to the way the country’s top adversaries are also building AI capability for their advantage. But ultimately, she doesn’t see it changing the CIA’s mission beyond it serving as “another tool in our toolbox to help us drive the human-machine teaming that is now so necessary for us to do our jobs.”
“We don’t see AI or technology as anything that is going to replace our workforce. But we see it as something that is going to heavily augment our workforce, and help us accelerate our velocity in completing tasks so that we can leverage our minds for higher-order work,” she said. “So we definitely see AI as something —  and generative AI particularly — as something that can be incorporated into workflows all across the agency to help us augment our own judgment and move through our workflows faster.”
As such, Raman said she anticipates AI and AI-focused work roles to permeate functions across the CIA.

“We have a very broad mission at the CIA. We have five directorates that do everything spanning from creating objective analysis, to doing collection, to creating very unique, exquisite technical tools, to spearheading our focus on the digital landscape, but also to doing administrative and logistical functions,” she said. “So that’s a lot of opportunities for people at the agency, in the AI space particularly.”
While Raman didn’t describe her agency’s development of AI capabilities and an AI workforce as a race against adversaries like China and Russia, she did describe how those nations’ pursuit of developing AI capacity for their political, economic and military advantage ultimately impacts the CIA on its journey.
“There’s a lot for us to be thinking about with respect to, you know, how we are reacting to our adversaries’ plans, use and intentions with respect to emerging technology, more generally, and AI very specifically,” Raman said.

Advances in generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, have the potential to disrupt the practice of law for many, many lawyers — especially junior lawyers. A 2023 Thomson Reuters report on the impact of AI on lawyers forecasts an “immense” impact on junior lawyers. This blog has recently reported on an AI tool that can draft a complaint using factual inputs. In the face of the likely decrease in work such as due diligence review and drafting of routine documents that will result from the rapid adoption and increasing efficacy of AI, particularly generative AI, how can lawyers maintain and grow their careers? The answer is both simple and daunting: embrace change, level up your practice to adapt to the change, and, most importantly, listen to your clients, so that you can provide the services they want delivered the way they want them. 
The warning bells heralding the robot apocalypse have been sounded before, yet in the past 25 years, technical advances have not had a sustained negative impact on attorney hiring. This time, however, appears to be different. Earlier legal tech sped and eased processes like document review and due diligence, primarily impacting the work of legal and administrative assistants. Lawyers could look at the data generated in part by tech tools, and use them to craft their output. Now, though, technology can generate and craft that output. At this moment, the quality of tech-generated output is inconsistent, and occasionally plain wrong, but machine learning is a process, and every day the tech gets better at its job (and consequently at your job). ChatGPT has existed for less than two years, and law firms started using their own proprietary chatbots mere months ago. In less than 18 months, the way we practice has radically changed. Now envision what changes are likely with another 18 months of development.
Before starting this article, I asked ChatGPT, “What attorney tasks can ChatGPT take over?” It gave me a long list that included, in part, research, client communication, and the drafting of contracts, memoranda, briefs, and other documents. Even more concerning, the list included analyzing and evaluating case law and “providing insight into potential legal strategies.” Unsurprisingly, the initial responses of many lawyers to a list like this are skepticism and denial, when survival requires acceptance and adaptation.
Still, we have done this before. Online legal research tools disrupted the library, and law firms and lawyers adapted. Sophisticated e-discovery tools disrupted contract document review, and law firms and lawyers adapted. While different, the pandemic disrupted in-person meetings, hearings, and depositions, and through technology, law firms and lawyers adapted.
That said, simply embracing the technology, while otherwise continuing to practice law the way it has been done for the last century, will lead to obsolescence and possibly to unemployment almost as quickly as will denial. The much more significant step is identifying how we use the time that we have freed up to provide better support and counsel to our clients, and to train our new lawyers at a time when their needs are also changing in relation to advances in technology.
But mastering a changing practice is only part of the challenge. The considerations in every transaction, large or small, and the day-to-day considerations of running a functional commercial entity change with every technical advance and every change in the legal and regulatory environment around technology. Each of those considerations are made more complex by a patchwork of laws and regulations that differ wildly from country to country, and in the United States, from state to state. Lawyers do not need to become technologists or regulators, but they do need to master the subject matter they are advising on and the legal landscape around that subject matter, to guide clients on how to ethically, wisely, profitably, and legally manage their legal and business issues.
Rapidly changing technology raises a myriad of client issues that impact commercial lawyers in nearly every practice area. Mastery of those issues takes deep study, often academic study, since there is no settled law to look to. Even if you do not aspire to work in technology transactions, data privacy and innovation, blockchain, or other “tech law” practices, most lawyers must gain expertise in technology law and regulation to advise their clients well. Every client is a tech client now. Regardless of their industry, clients will have questions about how to protect their corporate information when using generative AI or advanced data analytics, how to balance employee privacy rights when using emerging AI employment tools, or how to evaluate the risk of deploying a new customer service chatbot. Every lawyer whose clients collect information must advise on steps that must be taken to keep that information safe and keep website visitors informed. Those are just a few examples, among hundreds, of why specialized tech knowledge is necessary to maintain excellence and relevance as a lawyer.
Finally, staying necessary now requires that lawyers understand how business is being done, and what clients need from their lawyers, both in-house counsel and lawyers at outside firms. Lawyers in the early part of the 20th century, and even earlier, often acted as advisors to clients in all aspects of their business. Though some lawyers still practice that way, specialization has taken over, and most lawyers are expected to only consider issues within their specialties or subspecialties. Though this article has focused on modernity, in this respect, in this new economy everything old is new again. Most businesses — not only startups or tech companies — want lawyers who understand the many business and legal issues their company faces.
Filling that role requires all the technical and legal knowledge discussed earlier in this article, but it also requires a shift in how we define the role of a lawyer, from discrete problem-solver to fundamental business advisor. The lawyer needs the knowledge and training to ask the right questions, to assess the situation, and to identify what legal and regulatory risks are present with each possible solution, in the context of the client’s specific business and operations. This means not just understanding what the company does, but also what people in the development and business units do. While it is up to the client to decide what risks to accept and what ventures and opportunities to pursue as they innovate, when they see that you understand their goals and actions, that you are listening, you will have built a relationship that allows you and them to advance shared goals.
All these pivots require reconsideration and recasting of what makes an effective and necessary lawyer. It also requires a lot of (non-billable) study and work — and for some, retraining and immersion in a tech-focused environment where they can learn what technologists and business professionals now need from their lawyers. For example, at Cornell Tech’s Master of Laws program in Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship, our Tech LLM students work on teams side by side with MBA and tech master’s students. They hear the perspectives of the people whose work will be impacted by the work of lawyers. In this way, Cornell Tech lawyers learn what clients want, and what causes frustration and chills innovation. That knowledge is a foundation from which lawyers can identify what clients need and want to know, and how to provide that information and help clients craft modern solutions.
Few lawyers have the urge to become coders or product managers, but by walking a mile in the shoes of technologists and business professionals, Cornell Tech lawyers understand their clients’ products and their businesses, and can offer the services clients need. And for those who do want to deepen their understanding of or even develop legal technology solutions, an entrepreneurial and innovative environment like Cornell Tech can offer that opportunity as well. Whatever path you choose to adapt to the changing legal environment, taking the step to address it head-on offers an exciting opportunity to be at the very edge of what is now — and what is next.

But the team was uncertain about how, so it turned to Boston Consulting Group for help.Reckitt’s request was one of hundreds that Boston Consulting Group received last year. It now earns a fifth of its revenue — from zero just two years ago — through work related to artificial intelligence.“There’s a genuine thirst to figure out what are the implications for their businesses,” said Vladimir Lukic, Boston Consulting Group’s managing director for technology.The next big boom in tech is a long-awaited gift for wonky consultants. From Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company to IBM and Accenture, sales are growing and hiring is on the rise because companies are in desperate need of technology Sherpas who can help them figure out what generative A.I. means and how it can help their businesses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile the tech industry is casting about for ways to make money off generative A.I., the consultants have begun cashing in.IBM, which has 160,000 consultants, has secured more than $1 billion in sales commitments related to generative A.I. for consulting work and its watsonx system, which can be used to build and maintain A.I. models. Accenture, which provides consulting and technology services, booked $300 million in sales last year. About 40 percent of McKinsey’s business this year will be generative A.I. related, and KPMG International, which has a global advisory division, went from making no money a year ago from generative-A.I.-related work to targeting more than $650 million in business opportunities in the United States tied to the technology over the past six months.ImageIBM has more than $1 billion in sales commitments for its work with generative A.I.Credit...Matthias Balk/picture alliance, via Getty ImagesThe demand for tech-related advice recalls the industry’s dot-com boom. Businesses stampeded consultants with requests for counsel in the 1990s. From 1992 to 2000, sales for Sapient, a digital consulting firm, went from $950,000 to $503 million. Subsequent technology shifts like the migration to mobile and cloud computing were less hurried, said Nigel Vaz, chief executive of the firm, which is now known as Publicis Sapient.“In the mid-90s, C.E.O.s would say, ‘I don’t know what a website is or what it could do for my business, but I need it,’” Mr. Vaz said. “This is similar. Companies are saying: ‘Don’t tell me what to build. Tell me what you can build.’”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTConsulting firms have been scrambling to show what they can do. In May, Boston Consulting Group hosted a one-day conference at a Boston convention center where it set up demonstration booths for OpenAI, Anthropic and other A.I. tech leaders. It also demonstrated some of its own A.I. work in robotics and programming.Generative A.I. sales are helping the industry find growth after a postpandemic lull. The management consulting industry in the United States is expected to collect $392.2 billion in sales this year, up 2 percent from a year ago, according to IBISWorld, a research firm.The work that consultants have been enlisted to do varies from business to business. Some consultancies are advising companies on regulatory compliance as regions like the European Union pass laws regulating artificial intelligence. Others are drawing up plans for A.I. customer support systems or developing guardrails to prevent A.I. systems from making errors.For businesses, the results have been mixed. Generative A.I. is prone to giving people incorrect, irrelevant or nonsensical information, known as hallucinations. It is difficult to ensure that it provides accurate information. It can also be slower to respond than a person, which can confuse customers about whether their questions will be answered.IBM, which has a $20 billion consulting business, ran into some of those issues on its work with McDonald’s. The companies developed an A.I.-powered voice system to take drive-through orders. But after customers reported that the system made mistakes, like adding nine iced teas to an order instead of the one Diet Coke requested, McDonald’s ended the project.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMcDonald’s said it remained committed to a future of digital ordering and would evaluate alternative systems. IBM said it was working with McDonald’s on other projects and was in discussions with other restaurant chains about using its voice-activated A.I.Other programs from IBM have shown more promise. The company worked with Dun & Bradstreet, a business data provider, to develop a generative A.I. system to analyze and provide advice on selecting suppliers. The tool, called Ask Procurement, will allow employees to conduct detailed searches with specific parameters. For example, it could find memory chip suppliers that are minority owned and automatically create a request for proposals for them.Gary Kotovets, chief data and analytics officer at Dun & Bradstreet, said his team of 30 people needed IBM’s help to build the system. To reassure customers that the answers that Ask Procurement provides are accurate, he insisted that customers be able to trace every answer to an original source.“Hallucinations are a real concern and in some cases a perceived concern,” Mr. Kotovets said. “You have to overcome both and convince the client it’s not hallucinating.”Over seven weeks this year, McKinsey’s A.I. group, QuantumBlack, built a customer service chatbot for ING Bank, with guardrails to prevent it from offering mortgage or investment advice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBecause the viability of the chatbot was uncertain and McKinsey had limited experience with the relatively new technology, the firm did the work as a “joint experiment” under its contract with ING, said Bahadir Yilmaz, chief analytics officer at ING. The bank paid McKinsey for the work, but Mr. Yilmaz said many consultants were willing to do speculative work with generative A.I. without pay because they wanted to demonstrate what they could do with the new technology.The project has been labor intensive. When ING’s chatbot gave incorrect information during its development, McKinsey and ING had to identify the cause. They traced the problem back to issues like outdated websites, said Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner at McKinsey working on technology.The chatbot now handles 200 of 5,000 customer inquiries daily. ING has people review every conversation to make sure that the system doesn’t use discriminatory or harmful language or hallucinate.“The difference between ChatGPT and our chatbot is our chatbot cannot be wrong,” Mr. Yilmaz said. “We have to be safe with the system we’re building, but we’re close.”Over a four-month period this year, Reckitt worked with Boston Consulting Group to develop an A.I. platform that could create local advertisements in different languages and formats. With the push of a button, the system can turn a commercial about Finish dishwashing detergent from English into Spanish.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTReckitt’s A.I. marketing system, which is being tested, can make developing local ads 30 percent faster, saving the company time and sparing it from some tedious work, said Becky Verano, vice president of global creativity and capabilities at Reckitt.Because the technology is so new, Ms. Verano said, the team is learning and adjusting its work as new tech companies release updates to the image and language models. She credited Boston Consulting Group with bringing structure to that chaos.“You’re constantly having to move to the latest trends, to the newest findings, and learning each time how the tools respond,” she said. “There’s not an exact science to it.”Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco.

Gemini is Google’s artificial intelligence ecosystem, including a chatbot that generates responses to user-provided natural language prompts. In response to a prompt, Gemini can pull information from the internet and present a response. The large language model behind Gemini delivers the response in natural language — in contrast to a standard Google search, where a result consists of a snippet of information or a list of links.
Google announced Gemini (as Bard) in February 2023 after OpenAI and Microsoft both garnered attention for AI chatbot systems. And in May 2023, AI advancements featured prominently in Google’s I/O event. On Feb. 8, 2024, Google renamed the AI products formerly named Bard to Gemini.

What is Google Gemini used for?
Google Gemini is the overarching term for an ecosystem of generative AI models and services, including natural language querying, assistants, content generation and code writing. Gemini’s prompt-response process can help you obtain answers faster than a standard Google search sequence.
A classic Google search requires you to enter a natural language query or keywords, follow links, review content and then compile the results or repeat the process with a refined search.
SEE: Check out these Google AI search prompting tips.
With Gemini, you enter a prompt, then review the response. If the response isn’t exactly what you want, you have at least three options:

View other drafts to display alternatively formatted responses.
Regenerate the response to have the system craft a new reply.
Follow-up with another prompt.

Gemini can handle all sorts of tasks, but many of the most common uses are covered by the categories of capabilities detailed below.
Google Gemini can summarize
As a generative AI assistant powered by a large language model, Gemini can adeptly summarize text. For example, provide a link to a web page and ask Gemini to summarize the contents, e.g.:
Please summarize ​​https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/.
You also can suggest a specific length if you want a particular degree of brevity, such as “Please summarize in 100 words.”
Google Gemini can compare
Gemini can compare two or more items. In many cases, when you ask Gemini to compare things, the system will display some of the data in a table. For example, if you prompt Gemini:
Compare a Pixel 7, Pixel 7a and Samsung Galaxy S23.
Similarly, you may ask Gemini to compare web pages.
Google Gemini can suggest
Gemini may serve as a suggestion engine for products, services or activities. Enter the title of books, music or movies you like, then ask Gemini to suggest others. This can be useful when you’re researching unfamiliar topics. For example, you might try:
I am interested in learning the history of machine learning. Can you recommend 10 useful and highly respected books on the topic?
Google Gemini can explain
When you want to learn about a topic or historical event, you can ask Gemini to explain it to you. If you like, you may suggest a desired level in order to guide the system toward an explanation that may be either easier to understand or more detailed. For a general overview of a core technology that helps make Gemini work, you might ask:
Can you explain the basics of how neural networks operate? Explain it to me as if I am in my first year of college.
Google Gemini can brainstorm
One of the best uses of a chatbot is to gather a long list of ideas. Ask Gemini to “Brainstorm ideas for…” followed by whatever topic you wish, such as a new project, promotional effort or paper. Encourage Gemini to provide creative, unusual or inventive ideas for additional variety in the responses.
Google Gemini can code and debug
In April 2023, Google added the ability to create and help debug code in more than 20 programming languages. When you ask for code, make sure to specify the programming language and describe in as much detail as possible the code you need. If the code generated doesn’t work, let Gemini know what exactly went awry, and ask for a suggested fix or for help interpreting an error code.

Gemini can draft text
Gemini can help you write, too. As with most prompts, provide as much detail about the topic, length, format (blog post, poem, essay, book report, etc.) and style as possible. If you have a rough outline of a blog post, you might include the desired points in your prompt. For this section of text, for example, you might prompt:
Using the following points as an outline, can you draft examples and explanatory text? ""Gemini can summarize. Gemini can compare. Gemini can suggest. Gemini can explain. Gemini can brainstorm. Gemini can draft text. Gemini can code (and debug). Gemini can search.""
The responses Gemini generated were reasonable and might have required only a little editing and correction to be usable.
Google makes it easy to move Gemini text elsewhere. Select the response export button to move content to either a new Google Doc or Gmail. Alternatively, select the More button (the three vertical dots), then choose Copy to place the response text on the system clipboard for pasting into any app of your choice. (Using Gemini in Gmail or Docs requires the Google One AI Premium plan.)
Gemini can search
Since Gemini can access internet content, many conventional keyword searches will also work in Gemini. Ask about current news topics, weather forecasts or pretty much any standard keyword search string. However, Gemini will provide responses mostly in conventional text, sometimes supplemented with images, whereas Google search may show content in custom formats (e.g., weather forecasts often display a chart). When you seek a set of links, switch out of Gemini back to a standard Google search.
As of September 2023, people who sign in to Gemini with personal Google accounts may optionally enable extensions. These extensions allow Gemini to draw data from other Google services, including Google Flights, Hotels, Maps, Workspace (Gmail, Docs and Drive) and YouTube.
Google Gemini can create images
As of Feb. 1, Google’s Imagen 2 image generation technology was interoperable with Gemini , letting users create images in Search (SGE), Ads, Duet AI in Workspace and Vertex AI.
At the same time on Feb. 1, Google announced ImageFX, a distinct image generation tool based on Imagen 2. Its prompt interface works based on a new type of prompt, “expressive chips.” Google said expressive chips “let you quickly experiment with adjacent dimensions of your creation and ideas.” ImageFX is available in Google’s AI Test Kitchen in the English language to users in US, Kenya, New Zealand and Australia.
Images created with Imagen 2 are marked with the SynthID watermark and IPTC metadata.
Gemini can be wrong
Gemini can get things wrong. Select the Double-check Response to take the generated text, search Google for it and then highlight supporting sources in light green and those not found in light orange. Never rely solely on content provided in Gemini responses without verification. When Gemini does provide an inaccurate, misleading or inappropriate response, select the thumbs down icon to convey to the system that it provided a bad response.
What are Gemini’s limitations?
Even the Double-check It with Google feature may make mistakes. As a generative AI chatbot, Gemini provides content that may seem accurate, but it should always be considered carefully, reviewed thoroughly and checked before use.
In addition, Gemini has a limited context window, which means that it may “forget” content in a long conversation.
When was Google Gemini released?
At launch in March 2023, Google limited Gemini access (known as Bard at the time) via a waitlist to people with personal Google accounts. In early May 2023, Google eliminated the waitlist and made Gemini more widely available.
How can you get access to Google Gemini?
To access Gemini, go to https://gemini.google.com in a web browser, and sign in with a Google account (Figure A).

If your account is managed by a Google Workspace administrator, such as an account for work or school, the administrator may adjust settings to either allow or prevent access to Gemini. Check with your administrator, should you have any questions.
If you are a Google Workspace administrator and wish to review or adjust the settings that affect Gemini availability for people in your organization, access the Admin console | Apps | Additional Google services | Early Access Apps, then modify the Service status and Core Data Access Permissions as desired.
As of Feb. 8, Gemini is available for mobile on Android and in the Google app on iOS.
On Feb. 21, Google added two new options for accessing Gemini: Gemini for Workspace, a subscription for Google Workspace that adds a natural language chatbot; and Gemini Enterprise, which adds language translation and will soon be able to provide automated meeting notes.
Gemini is built into Chromebook Plus laptops, accessable through updates and new features, starting May 28. With it, you can edit photos, draft written content, create wallpapers and more.
Gemini is available on Vertex AI, Google’s platform for building and scaling AI for enterprise use with Google Cloud.
What new and upcoming features does Google Gemini have?
On May 14, Google expanded Gemini’s context window to 1 million tokens with Gemini 1.5 in Gemini Advanced. In June, Gemini 1.5 Pro expanded that number to a 2 million token context window.
In the next few months, Google plans to roll out Live, a natural-sounding and interruptible voice assistant capability, to Gemini Advanced. Also upcoming are the ability for Gemini to pull information from Gmail to help craft travel plans or other itineraries, and Gems, custom AI agents for specific tasks.
What countries and languages is Google Gemini available in?
Gemini is available in more than 230 countries and territories, including all 27 European Union countries (e.g., Germany, France, Italy and Spain) as well as Brazil.

Gemini is available in more than 40 languages. And, according to Google’s support pages, Gemini supports not only seven of the most widely spoken languages — English, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali and French — but also Japanese, Korean, Bahasa Indonesia, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, German, Gujarati, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Kannada, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu and Vietnamese.
Can I manage my Gemini activity history?
Yes, Google gives you control over your Gemini activity history, much as it does your search and browsing history. To adjust the settings, select the Activity icon (a clock surrounded by a counter-clockwise pointing arrow and line) from the upper-right area. Then, you may choose whether Activity history is on or off (Figure B).

While access to previous prompts can be helpful, Google gives you full control over whether or not your Gemini Activity history is stored. Image: Andy Wolber
If on, you may choose to Auto-delete activity after three, 18 or 36 months or not at all. Additionally, you may access your activity history, which can be helpful if you wish to review or rerun a previous prompt.
Is Google Gemini free to use?
Yes, Google Gemini is available to use for free. Google Gemini is free of advertising as well. There is a higher tier called Gemini Advanced, which allows access to the larger LLM Ultra 1.0. Gemini Advanced is part of the $19.99 Google One AI Premium plan,
Gemini Business costs $20 per user per month on top of a Google Workspace subscription. A one-year commitment is required.
Gemini Enterprise costs $30 per user per month. A one-year commitment is required.
Is it safe to use Google Gemini?
Google requires you to be 18 years of age or older to use Gemini. An administrator must specifically choose to allow access to Gemini for accounts connected to a Google Workspace organization. Even if allowed, you should make sure your use of Gemini complies with your organization’s policies.
Google takes measures to make Gemini useful and helpful but also prominently notes that the system “may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn’t represent Google’s views.” To preserve privacy, do not share any personal or private information with Gemini in your prompts.
Is Google Gemini using PaLM 2?
As of December 6, Gemini services run on a proprietary Google LLM also called Gemini. The Gemini model was developed by Google DeepMind and comes in three sizes, Ultra, Pro and Nano.
Gemini uses PaLM 2 in languages other than English. On Dec. 6 Google Product Director Jack Krawczyk said Google was working on a “clearer indication in bard of which model is serving you.”

How does Google Gemini get its information?
Gemini is a large language model by Google that is built from vast data sets; Google also designed Gemini to be able to access the internet. This combination of capabilities lets Gemini devise natural language responses that include relevant current data in response to a prompt.

What are alternatives to Google Gemini?
The ability to access current internet content is a key differentiator between Google Gemini and many other chatbot AI systems. Many large language model chatbot systems were trained on older data and lack access to information about current events. This inability to browse the internet limits the usefulness of many of these systems.
Four alternatives to Gemini that can access current internet content and are worth exploring are:

Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise): Available free with a Microsoft account.
ChatGPT: ChatGPT Plus (available for $20 per month) and Enterprise accounts may access the internet as of late September 2023.
Perplexity: Available free with account signin. Optional upgrade to Perplexity Pro features are available for $20 per month.
Pi: Available free with an account.

Another alternative to Gemini that lacks access to current internet content is:

Claude: Available free with an account, with optional Claude Pro features available for $20 per month.

How Morgan Stanley (and Other Banks) Use A.I. to Eliminate the Grunt Work of Banking
A new A.I. assistant named Debrief is expected to save valuable hours for thousands of Morgan Stanley employees.

In one of the most significant embraces of generative A.I. on Wall Street to date, Morgan Stanley (MS) is rolling out a new A.I. assistant to aid its wealth management division in client meetings. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and known as “AI @ Morgan Stanley Debrief,” the tool will take notes in client meetings and draft emails to enhance the productivity of its nearly 16,000 financial advisors. Employees have already managed to dedicate more time to clients by saving half an hour of grunt work per meeting with the help of Debrief, according to the bank.

Morgan Stanley became OpenAI’s sole wealth management strategic partner in March 2023—four months after the release of ChatGPT—and has since introduced A.I. features like “AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant,” which was launched in September and currently aids 98 percent of the bank’s financial advisor teams in accessing the bank’s database of research. Morgan Stanley’s newest A.I. tool is currently being piloted and will be widely released to financial advisors next month.
“Through this rollout, financial advisors continue to see first-hand the real benefits GenAI delivers to their practices,” said Jeff McMillan, head of firmwide A.I. at Morgan Stanley, in a statement. “And we’re just getting started in unlocking the true power of this technology for all of Morgan Stanley.”
A.I. is “significantly better” at note-taking
Clients must consent to the use of Debrief, which sits in on meetings to take notes, summarize key points, surface action items, create emails for financial advisors to edit and send, and save notes into Salesforce. Employees in Morgan Stanley’s wealth management sector, which managed $5.5 trillion in assets as of the first quarter of this year, say the pilot tool has already shifted the way they engage with clients. Debrief has “saved me about half an hour per meeting just by handling all the notetaking” and “freed up my time to concentrate on making decisions during client meetings,” said Don Whitehead, a Morgan Stanley financial advisor based in Houston, Texas, in a statement.
The A.I. assistant does a significantly better job at note-taking than humans, McMillan told CNBC, adding that the industry should be prepared for “disruption in some areas.” Nearly 54 percent of jobs across banking have the potential to be displaced by the technology, according to a Citigroup report released earlier this month which also noted that A.I. could additionally boost the banking industry’s profits by 9 percent, or $170 billion, by 2028.
Major Wall Street banks are experimenting with generative A.I.
Morgan Stanley isn’t the only Wall Street player to partner up with leading A.I. companies like OpenAI. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) earlier this year unveiled IndexGPT, an A.I. tool created with the help of GPT-4 that automates thematic indexes to identify investments through emerging trends. And the bank is just getting started on its A.I. journey—as of May, all new employees are set to receive training in the generative technology.
Wells Fargo, too, has been training employees in A.I. by enrolling them in Stanford’s A.I. program. The bank last year launched the virtual assistant Fargo using a large language model from Google and is reportedly in the midst of developing several other A.I. projects. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (DB) is currently attempting to double, or even triple, its roughly 300-person A.I. team and is piloting an A.I.-powered chatbot to aid corporate and investment banking customers.
And a plethora of A.I.-related features are in development at Goldman Sachs (GS), which plans to use the technology to aid developers in generating code, summarizing and drafting documents, and performing queries on various forms and filings. “We’re talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented,” said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in April while discussing the potential to take advantage of A.I. opportunities. “We’re very, very focused on it and very engaged.”

AUSTIN, Texas — A new study ranks Austin as the sixth-highest city in the U.S. for artificial intelligence (AI) job displacement. 

The study, conducted by (un)Common Logic, says that just over 10% of all workers in Austin are at risk of AI-related automation. That's roughly 126,000 workers in the Austin area. 

The jobs facing the highest risk of being done by AI are budget analysts, loan officers, accountants, insurance sales agents and paralegals. The study said these jobs face high AI exposure as well as high risk of automation because their tasks and knowledge can be more easily learned and replicated by AI systems. These roles account for an estimate 9% of all workers nationally, the study said.

Conversely, workers who face both low AI exposure and low risk of automation include “highly hands-on professionals,” such as dancers, firefighters and plumbers. 

But even jobs that are unlikely to be significantly impacted by AI may face other types of automation risks, the study said, including farm laborers or fast food workers. The study also said professions like lawyers, CEOs and civil engineers might rely on AI to enhance decision-making but face low probabilities of being completely automated.

Compared to other types of automation, it’s predicted AI will have a greater impact on high-income workers. Five states – South Dakota, Kansas, Delaware, Florida and New York – have high concentrations of workers in the knowledge sector, making more than one in 10 vulnerable to AI-related automation. Meanwhile, states like Indiana, Arkansas and Nevada, where the workforce is more concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing or service professions, face a lower risk of AI-driven automation. 

Other Texas cities making the top 50 are Dallas-Fort Worth at No. 23 and San Antonio at No. 22, both at around 9%, and then the Houston area at just over 8% at No. 49.

Additionally, 93 per cent of those using GenAI for work in India agreed that it has significantly saved them time.A study by BCG has revealed a striking level of confidence among Indian workers in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) in the workplace.This sentiment is part of a broader trend captured in a global survey involving over 13,000 employees across 15 countries and regions.Conducted by BCG's tech build and design division, BCG X, the survey highlights a growing confidence in AI and GenAI across the board.The findings show that 42 per cent of global respondents expressed confidence in these technologies' impact on their work, a substantial increase from 26 per cent the previous year.However, this confidence is accompanied by an increase in anxiety, with 49 per cent of regular users fearing that their jobs could vanish within the next decade due to these technologies. In contrast, only 24 per cent of non-users shared this concern.The report underscores the increasing integration of GenAI in workplaces worldwide. About 64 per cent of leaders are now implementing GenAI tools, with frontline employees showing a significant uptick in usage--43 per cent regularly use these tools at work, more than double the number from last year.Sylvain Duranton, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, commented, ""Our survey exposes the double-edged nature of GenAI. Familiarity correlates with both comfort and fear. GenAI is a revolutionary technology, so these opposing reactions should not be surprising.""He added, ""By recognizing the complex ways in which humans understand and interact with GenAI, leaders can reshape their organizations to maximize the strengths and value of both their human and machine workers.""A portion of survey respondents who utilize GenAI for work, specifically 58 per cent, reported saving at least five hours per week. The time saved is often redirected towards additional tasks (41 per cent), new initiatives (39 per cent), experimentation with GenAI (38 per cent), or strategic work (38 per cent).Vinciane Beauchene, managing director and partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, said, ""We are entering a new era for GenAI which is less about optimism and curiosity and more about confidence and value realization. Adoption has increased and individuals are starting to see the benefits.""He added, ""Companies are also starting to realize that getting the value out of their investment will require them to think beyond productivity and take a more holistic and proactive approach to redirect the time saved to the most valuable and joyful activities, to reskill their employees to do so, and to reshape their organizations and operating models as a consequence.""The study highlighted a marked difference in attitudes towards GenAI between workers from the Global South and the Global North.Respondents from countries like Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa, and those in the Middle East displayed more optimism and less anxiety about GenAI compared to their counterparts in more developed economies.The Global South not only demonstrated a higher percentage of regular GenAI users among leaders, managers, and frontline employees but also a greater likelihood of having received GenAI training.Additionally, employees in these regions reported using the time saved by GenAI to focus on professional development, experimentation with the tool, and improving the quality of their work.The report concludes with key recommendations for companies aiming to harness the full potential of GenAI.Organizations are advised to establish a transformation-first mindset, continuously manage all transformation efforts to ensure cohesion and efficiency and invest in large-scale training initiatives to equip employees with the necessary skills.Emphasizing value creation and employee satisfaction, companies should prepare for evolving job roles and skills requirements and adapt their organizational structures and governance accordingly.Jeff Walters, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, noted, ""Understandable human reactions to these technologies can pose challenges to companies as they continue on their GenAI journeys.""He added, ""But as we noted in last year's report--and it still holds true this year--these are more change management challenges than technology challenges. And now is the time for organizations to double-down on their commitment to transformation built around GenAI.""PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

Editor’s note: In a recent issue of Upstream Ag Professional, agribusiness analyst Shane Thomas addresses the buzz surrounding conversations about the future of jobs in agribusiness and AI. Here’s a summary of that article:
This week, discussions focused on the future of jobs in agribusiness and AI, addressing the fear of job loss and the need for re-skilling. Historical context, like the Luddites’ resistance to mechanization in the 19th century, highlights the longstanding apprehension towards technological advancements. The Luddites feared losing their skilled jobs to mechanized looms, leading them to destructively protest against these innovations. However, mechanization was inevitable, driving economic progress and societal advancement, much like today’s AI technologies in agriculture.Advertisement
The Lump of Labor Fallacy — the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work — explains why automation doesn’t reduce jobs overall. As automation makes production cheaper and more efficient, it creates new demands and, consequently, new jobs. This phenomenon, illustrated by Jevon’s Paradox, shows that gains in efficiency lead to increased demand and new economic opportunities.

To navigate these changes, the Job to Action Framework helps understand the transformation of job roles. For example, an agronomist’s job involves various tasks and actions, some of which can be automated. Automation tends to eliminate tedious tasks, allowing professionals to focus on more valuable responsibilities. For instance, with automated field scouting by technologies like Solinftec’s Solix, agronomists can devote more time to data analysis and strategic planning.
AI, particularly in agribusiness, offers significant benefits by improving data quality and reducing errors from user input. As Matthew Pryor of Tenacious Ventures suggests, AI can overcome the “garbage-in, garbage-out” challenge by enhancing data accuracy and utility. Similarly, Patrick Walther emphasizes AI’s potential to analyze unstructured data, providing insights from customer interactions and feedback.
Furthermore, AI can improve interoperability between different agtech systems, as highlighted by the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop APIs quickly, enhancing collaboration and data synthesis.
Overall, while AI may change the nature of certain jobs, it will likely eliminate tedious tasks and empower professionals to achieve more. AI will enable agribusiness professionals to leverage their capabilities more effectively, creating a more seamless and productive user experience. Thus, AI is more likely to transform and enhance jobs rather than eliminate them.

JAKARTA - The digital economy is increasingly transforming into one of the sectors that continues to experience significant developments, especially supported by an increase in commitment to research and development, as well as planting an innovation culture.ADVERTISEMENTBased on a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Indonesia's Global Innovation Index (GII) in 2022 is ranked 75th out of 130 countries. This achievement is an increase of 10 levels compared to 2020.One of the innovations in the digital economy sector is through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI development in Indonesia itself is also driven by the large amount of internet usage and start-up growth that utilizes technology to support business activities.ADVERTISEMENTHowever, automation through the use of AI will also pose challenges related to reduced employment opportunities. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in The Future Jobs report, it is estimated that in 2025 43 percent of industry players will reduce their workforce as a consequence of technology integration.Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said that although this was a challenge, not everything regarding AI was negative as seen. Most of the work and industry are only partially affected by automation and are more likely to be equipped than replaced by AI.ADVERTISEMENT""Therefore, the biggest impact of AI technology is most likely not on the loss of employment opportunities, but the potential for changes to the quality of work, especially the intensity and autonomy of work,"" said Airlangga in his statement, Sunday, June 23.Airlangga conveyed that along with the use of AI technology, the Government has also prepared a number of policies in order to overcome various potential risks related to the use of AI, one of which is through the launch of the National Digital Economy Strategy.

Airlangga explained that the framework consisted of 6 (six) pillars, namely first Infrastructure, second Human Resources, third Business Climate and Cyber Security, fourth Research, Innovation and Business Development, fifth Funding and Investment, and six Policies or Regulations.Furthermore, the fourth pillar regarding Research, Innovation and Business Development will focus on efforts to develop and manage the AI ecosystem in Indonesia to make it better.Meanwhile, Airlangga conveyed his main focus on the pillar to improve research and development capabilities as well as innovative processes to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.""One of the initiatives taken by the Government regarding these pillars is to build and launch special innovation zones in several districts in Indonesia, with a focus on developing futuristic technology,"" he said.Airlangga said that in addition to completing the preparation of the stranas, in 2023 the Government also issued regulations regarding the ethics of using artificial intelligence as the starting point for the use of AI in the public sector.Furthermore, Airlangga said that the Government would continue to strive to develop the best practices in the use of AI.Let's take advantage of AI's potential to reshape our labor market for the better. Together, we can build a labor market that is not only resilient but also adaptive, innovative, and inclusive,"" he said.Airlangga hopes that in the future, AI will improve Indonesia's economic landscape and create new opportunities for the workforce, so that it can help in achieving sustainable growth and development.

Preparing for Generative AI in the workplace involves embracing its capabilities while nurturing human skills. It's crucial to recognize that AI enhances tasks rather than replacing jobs outright. By focusing on developing creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence, organizations can equip their teams to collaborate effectively with AI.



This approach ensures smooth integration and fosters a culture of innovation. Embracing Generative AI means adapting job roles and tasks to leverage technology's strengths, empowering employees to excel in a future where human ingenuity and technological advancements drive organizational success and growth.



The Ethical Impact of Generative AI



The impact of Generative AI raises significant ethical questions as technology continues to transform our workplaces. As AI capabilities advance, it's crucial to address concerns about fairness and equal opportunities across different professions. While fields such as finance and software development may see substantial benefits from AI, others like manual labor or caregiving roles might have fewer opportunities for enhancement. This disparity could widen existing inequalities unless steps are taken to ensure all sectors can access AI advancements fairly.



Additionally, there's a risk that essential human qualities, such as empathy in healthcare or judgment in legal matters, might be undervalued as AI takes on more routine tasks. Balancing technological progress with human-centric values is essential to ensure AI complements rather than replaces human skills. To navigate these challenges, fostering open discussions and implementing inclusive policies will be crucial. By doing so, we can harness the potential of Generative AI while preserving ethical standards and promoting societal well-being.&nbsp;



Conclusion



Generative AI is assured to redefine the future of work, ushering in a new era where human potential and technological innovation converge. This transformative technology promises efficiency and creativity by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more strategic endeavors. Partnering with an AI app development company in Houston across the USA can help you build AI apps for your business, enabling you to fully harness the potential of generative AI.



As businesses are adopting generative AI, they must also navigate its ethical implications, ensuring fairness and inclusivity across all sectors. This means safeguarding human qualities that are crucial for professions like healthcare and law, where empathy and judgment are irreplaceable. By fostering a balanced approach that values both AI capabilities and human skills, businesses can pave the way for a future where innovation thrives alongside ethical responsibility.
