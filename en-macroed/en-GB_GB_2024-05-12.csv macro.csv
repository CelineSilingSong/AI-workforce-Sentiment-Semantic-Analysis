AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm also uses the technology to crack down on fake reviews. A simple guide to help you understand AIBill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decadesWhat are AI programs like ChatGPT and Midjourney?ChatGPT and Midjourney are examples of what is called ""generative"" AI. These programs learn from vast quantities of data, such as online text and images, to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. So-called chatbots - like ChatGPT - can have text conversations.Other AI programs like Midjourney can create images from simple text instructions.Generative AI can also make videos and even produce music in the style of famous musicians.But these programs sometimes generate inaccurate answers and images, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.Many artists, writers and performers have warned that such AIs allow others to exploit and imitate their work without payment.The most recent people to add their names to these calls include Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj, who are among 200 artists calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.'Most of our friends use AI in schoolwork' Can you pass your degree using ChatGPT?Why do critics fear AI could be dangerous?Many experts are surprised by how quickly AI has developed, and fear its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted.In 2023, the UK government published a report which said AI might soon assist hackers to launch cyberattacks or help terrorists plan chemical attacks.Some experts even worry that in the future, super-intelligent AIs could make humans extinct. In May, the US-based Center for AI Safety's warning about this threat was backed by dozens of leading tech specialists.Similar fears are shared by two of the three scientists known as the godfathers of AI for their pioneering research, Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio.But the other - Yann LeCun - dismissed the idea that a super-smart AI might take over the world as ""preposterously ridiculous"".Getty ImagesUS comedian Sarah Silverman is unhappy about her writing allegedly being used to train AIsThe EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager previously told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern than futuristic fears about an AI takeover.In particular, she worries about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications.In March, a black Uber Eats driver received a payout after ""racially discriminatory"" facial-recognition checks prevented him using the app, and ultimately removed his account.Others have criticised AI's environmental impact.Powerful AI systems use a lot of electricity: by 2027, one researcher suggests that collectively, they could consume each year as much as a small country like the Netherlands.What rules are in place to govern AI? The US and UK have signed a landmark deal to work together on testing the safety of such advanced forms of AI - the first bilateral deal of its kind.US President Joe Biden has also announced measures to deal with a range of problems that AI might cause.The UK government previously ruled out setting up a dedicated AI watchdog.But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants the UK to be a leader in AI safety, and the country hosted the first global summit on AI safety in 2023. Twenty eight nations at the summit - including the UK, US, the European Union and China - signed a statement about the future of AI.This acknowledges the risks that advanced AIs could be misused - for example to spread misinformation - but says they can also be a force for good. The signatories resolved to work together to ensure AI is trustworthy and safe.Can Sunak’s big summit save us from AI nightmare? Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might thinkIn the EU, the Artificial Intelligence Act, when it becomes law, will impose strict controls on high risk systems.Which jobs are at risk because of AI?A report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe.It concluded many administrative, legal, architecture, and management roles could be affected.But it also said AI could boost the global economy by 7%.And the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) estimates that up to eight million workers in the UK could be at risk of losing their jobs as the tech develops. But the tech has also been used to support workers, such as byhelping doctors spot breast cancers, and developing new antibiotics.

Less than half of journalists say they are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard) in their work, according to a new global survey.
Some 53% of 3,016 journalists in 19 markets surveyed for Cision’s annual State of the Media report said they are not using generative AI “at all”.
Just 5% are using these tools “often”. Some 12% are using them a “moderate amount” while 28% are using them “a little”. 
 
Many publishers have taken a cautious approach to the use of generative AI for published content, advising their journalists not to do so until full guidance has been created.

Among those journalists who have used generative AI tools in their work, 23% said it was to research certain topics, 19% said it had helped create outlines or early drafts of content, and 13% said it was to brainstorm new story ideas.

Last year's report did not include comparable questions as that survey was carried out just two months after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. However, the 2023 report did feature some early concerns about AI, with one respondent saying journalists who hide from innovations like ChatGPT ""are at a disadvantage"" and another stressing the importance of being ""aware of the opportunities and pitfalls of AI"".

This year, journalists ranked the emergence of artificial intelligence as their sixth biggest challenge for the journalism industry over the past year. Just over a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said it was among their three biggest concerns for the industry.
What journalists say are the biggest challenges facing the industry
""Maintaining credibility as a trusted news source and combating accusations of 'fake news'"" remained the top-ranked challenge for the industry, with 42% of respondents choosing it as one of their three biggest issues.
It was seen as a bigger issue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) on 44% versus 41% in North America and 35% in the Asia-Pacific (APAC).
Last year, when respondents were asked to select just one biggest challenge for journalism, it was top on 27%.
In second place this year was the challenge of ""adapting to changing audience behaviours around media consumption"", narrowly behind on 41%.
In third place was a ""lack of staffing and resources"" on 36%. This was in joint second place in 2023 with 20% of respondents choosing it as their biggest challenge of the year, the same proportion as ""declining advertising and circulation revenues"".
Job cuts were a bigger concern in North America (41%) and EMEA (37%) than APAC (22%). 
In 2023 Press Gazette estimates there were more than 8,000 journalism job cuts in the UK and North America with at least a further 1,700 in 2024 so far.
In comparison the challenge of ""competing with social media influencers and digital content creators for audience attention was a much bigger concern in APAC (39%) than EMEA (27%) or North America (24%). APAC countries also struggled the most with ""verifying information and finding credible sources"", with 31% agreeing that was a concern versus 22% in EMEA and 15% in North America.

Meanwhile ""media downsizing and reduced resources"" was ranked as the biggest personal challenge for journalists in the past year with 60% citing it as one of their top three.
""Keeping up"" amid downsizing and reduced resources was similarly top last year, with 38% citing it as their single biggest challenge.
In second and third place this year were ""balancing reporting on important topics against pressure to drive business"" (42%) and ""having to compete with misinformation online"" (33%). 

Just over a fifth (22%) of journalists surveyed for the report identified as freelance or independent. They were less concerned with challenges facing journalism from a lack of staffing and resources (22% ranking it in their top three concerns for the industry versus 42% of staff journalists) but were more worried about the emergence of AI (34% versus 23% of staffers).
Which social media platforms will get more attention this year?
Over the next year, Instagram is the social media platform most targeted for growth by media outlets, according to the survey respondents.
Some 44% of the journalists who took part in the survey said their brand/media outlet planned to get more active on Instagram.
It was followed by Linkedin (39%) and Facebook (34%) - even though referral traffic to major news sites from Facebook has fallen by 50% over the past year.
Tiktok, where many publishers have seen rapid growth while seeking younger audiences despite a relatively late arrival to the platform, remains behind X (formerly Twitter) as a priority for activity over the year ahead (21% versus 24% respectively). This is despite speculation last year that a new platform like Meta's Threads or Bluesky could take its place after Elon Musk's takeover. Threads was seen as an area of growth for 10% of the journalists surveyed.
Chinese-founded Tiktok was slightly more prominent in the survey in North America (24% versus 18% in EMEA and 20% in APAC) despite the possibility it will be banned in the US within a year. But it was still behind X everywhere except APAC (27% for North America, 24% for EMEA and 17% in Asia-Pacific).
Meanwhile Whatsapp, which has seen major UK publisher Reach win multiple innovation awards for its use of the recently-launched Channels and Communities functions, was only seen as a growth area by 11%. It is much bigger in EMEA, where 18% expect increased use over the next year, versus just 4% in North America and 6% in APAC.

Lacking AI skills on your resume can lead to lower salaries and fewer job opportunities in the coming years. The good news? It's still possible to future-proof your career by developing in-demand AI skills.The fear of robots replacing humans is nothing new. Since the arrival of ChatGPT in late 2022, the conversation surrounding generative AI's impact on the workforce has taken on a new urgency and a compelling reason drives this trend.The World Economic Forum's 2023 Future of Jobs Report predicts that over 75 percent of companies plan to adopt AI and other technologies within the next five years, potentially transforming how we work.This shift will likely require a new skill set, with research from Inteliligent.com suggesting that 49 percent of business leaders believe expertise in tools like ChatGPT will become increasingly important.Further solidifying this trend, a separate study by Pluralsight found that 87 percent of organisations plan to increase AI spending next year, highlighting the urgency for skilled personnel. However, more than simply investing in AI is required.The study revealed that 95 percent of executives believe AI initiatives will only succeed with staff who can effectively utilise these tools. This concern is further amplified by Gallagher's State of the Sector report, where 71 percent of HR and Communication leaders admitted their organisations need guidance on when, where, or how to use this transformative technology.Why AI Expertise is the New Must-Have SkillAs AI adoption increases, those who don't upskill may face challenges. However, the good news is that AI isn't here to replace us but rather to augment our capabilities.Pluralsight's report also identified that 25 percent of organisations must catch up on AI deployment due to a talent gap. They need a more skilled workforce to utilise this technology effectively and are content with their current tools.

Developing AI skills opens doors to exciting and well-paying career opportunities.

This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.
Internal Testing and Development
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Giannandrea established a team that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.
For the last several months, Apple has been testing an ""Apple GPT"" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an ""Ajax"" framework for large language models.
Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.
Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are more powerful than Ajax. Apple reportedly does not have a ""clear strategy"" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with Siri enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.
Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars a day on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend more than $4 billion on AI servers in 2024.
""Ask"" for AppleCare Support Advisors
Apple is testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool with its AppleCare support employees. Called ""Ask,"" the tool is designed to generate responses to technical questions and provide information from Apple's internal knowledge base to speed up support replies.
The feature is in beta right now. Advisors can rate a provided question as helpful or unhelpful, and can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple says the Ask tool is useful for solving complex issues, and because it is pulling from Apple's internal knowledge base, Apple has told advisors that the information is factual, traceable, and useful.
AI for Siri
Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its ‌Siri‌ voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 held an AI summit and briefed employees on its large language model work.
Because of the way ‌Siri‌ is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former ‌Siri‌ engineer John Burkey told The New York Times that ‌Siri‌'s ""cumbersome design"" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the ‌Siri‌ database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.
There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to ‌Siri‌. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused ‌Siri‌ to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.
The Information suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let ‌Siri‌ automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.
According to Bloomberg, Apple is aiming for a smarter version of Siri that's deeply integrated with AI. Apple is planning to update the way that ‌Siri‌ interacts with the Messages app, allowing users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. 
Rumors suggest that Siri will have better natural conversation capabilities and improved user personalization. The new functionality will be available across device, so ‌Siri‌ may retain conversation information from one device to another.
AI for Apps
Apple is rumored to be planning to add AI to as many Apple apps as possible. In Apple Music, for example, Apple could use AI to create auto-generated playlists, while in Xcode, AI support could help developers write and troubleshoot code. 
In Pages and Keynote, AI could be used for writing and creating slide decks, while Apple's internal customer support apps could be updated with generative AI to assist with ‌AppleCare‌. 
Apple's full generative AI vision will take time to fully scale, so the complete suite of AI features that Apple has planned might not arrive until 2025.
On-Device AI
The first AI features coming to the iPhone with iOS 18 will run entirely on-device using the ‌iPhone‌'s hardware rather than relying on a cloud server. Apple may add new capabilities in the future through a potential partnership, but on-device AI will be the focus to begin with.
News and Publisher Deals
Apple wants to partner with major publishers to get permission to use their content for AI training purposes.
So far, Apple has approached Condé Nast, NBC News, and IAC about possible AI deals. Condé Nast publications include Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, Ars Technica, Glamour, The New Yorker, GQ, and more, while IAC owns publications like People, The Spruce, Serious Eats, Martha Stewart Living, Real Simple, Entertainment Weekly, and Better Homes & Gardens.
Proposed deals have been worth at least $50 million, and would allow Apple to license archives of news articles. Publishers are said to be ""lukewarm"" on Apple's offer because Apple has been vague about how generative AI will be applied to news and because Apple has been asking for terms that are ""too expansive.""
Third-Party AI Bans at Apple
Apple employees have been banned from using ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other artificial intelligence tools. Apple is concerned that AI tools could leak confidential company data.
The U.S. government, healthcare institutions, and banks have also prevented employees from using ChatGPT because of similar fears. Tech companies like Verizon, Google, Samsung, and others have banned generative AI tools too.
Possible Partnerships
Apple is in discussions with Google about integrating the Gemini AI engine into the ‌iPhone‌ in ‌iOS 18‌. Apple wants to license Google's large-language models, but terms and branding have not yet been decided on. 
Apple is developing new AI features that will run on device, but it wants a partner with large-scale hardware infrastructure to power cloud-based generative AI features like creating images and writing essays based on a prompt. Apple does not plan to develop its own ChatGPT-style chatbot at this time.
In addition to Google, Apple is also holding discussions with OpenAI. The two companies are talking about how Apple could use OpenAI technology to power features in ‌iOS 18‌, and Apple is said to be finalizing a deal to include OpenAI's ChatGPT features in ‌iOS 18‌. In China, Apple may be considering a deal with Baidu.
Apple is pursuing a deal with Photobucket to use the more than 13 billion images and videos from the Photobucket library to train AI models. Apple has already licensed millions of images from Shutterstock. 
AI Competition
Almost every major tech company has some kind of AI product in the works. In addition to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all adopted generative AI for various purposes.

Google - Google has developed Bard, a chat-based AI tool. Google has also integrated generative AI into its search products and apps, plus Bard can integrate with Google Flights, Maps, Drive, and more.
Microsoft - Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI for a version of ChatGPT that is integrated with its Bing search engine, plus Microsoft has the Copilot AI app.
Amazon - Amazon is working to enhance its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI.
Meta - Meta is incorporating generative AI into several of its apps. WhatsApp and Messenger, for example, can use generative AI to make custom stickers, while there's a Meta AI beta available for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.

Apple's Current Use of AI and Machine Learning
Apple is already using artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long list of functions in its products. AI is used for almost everything, with a small sampling below.

Photos - Apple uses machine learning to enhance photos that are taken with the ‌iPhone‌'s camera. This includes everything from Deep Fusion for cutting down on noise in images to the new iPhone 15 Portrait Mode tools that let you enable portrait images after a photo has been taken.
Spotlight Search - Spotlight search and search throughout the iOS operating system is powered by AI.
Visual Lookup - The feature that lets the ‌iPhone‌ detect the content in photos is a machine learning feature.
Crash Detection and Fall Detection - Fall Detection and Crash Detection both use machine learning to determine whether someone has been in a crash or had a fall based on the information collected by the various sensors in Apple devices.
ECG - The ECG feature on the Apple Watch looks at heart rhythm data to determine whether someone is likely to be experiencing atrial fibrillation.
Autocorrect - Apple's autocorrect system and word suggestion options are powered by machine learning.
Siri Suggestions - When your ‌iPhone‌ suggests something, such as sending someone a birthday message or adding an event in your Mail app to the Calendar, it's using machine learning algorithms.

Apple's devices have dedicated Neural Engines inside specifically for powering machine learning capabilities.
Tim Cook on AI
Back in May 2023, Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ said that the potential of artificial intelligence is ""very interesting,"" but he said there are a ""number of issues that need to be sorted"" with the technology. He explained that it is ""very important to be deliberate and thoughtful"" when deciding how and when AI should be used.
Cook has also said that AI and machine learning are ""core fundamental technologies integral to virtually every product"" that Apple has created, and that AI work is ""absolutely critical"" to the company. Cook has confirmed that Apple has been experimenting with generative AI ""for years.""
Potential Launch Date - iOS 18
Apple is widely rumored to be planning to add AI features to ‌iOS 18‌, and the update is said to be the biggest update to the iOS operating system in years. Apple hinted at AI features coming to ‌iOS 18‌ with its WWDC announcement. Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak said WWDC will be ""Absolutely Incredible,"" with the words capitalized in a play on AI.
For more on everything that we expect to see in ‌iOS 18‌, including more on the AI features coming, we have a dedicated iOS 18 roundup.

Why It Matters		



Leaders should look beyond productivity gains when evaluating where to deploy generative artificial intelligence, according to Microsoft chief scientist Jaime Teevan.

As the chief scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft, Jaime Teevan is responsible for integrating artificial intelligence into Microsoft products. She was still skeptical about the powers of generative AI when she met with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman about a year and a half ago to discuss GPT-4, the large language model that fuels ChatGPT.

Teevan, SM ’01, PhD ’07, knew the right questions to ask and how to break the model. Yet “it was really cool to sit there iterating with the model, seeing the way it maintained context and the way it was able to handle ambiguity and deal with conflicting constraints in a really nuanced way,” she said.
That was a “switch in time” as she realized the potential of the technology, Teevan said. She even found herself pulling over on her short drive home.
“I sat there, and I screamed. I didn’t think we would ever be where we are today in my lifetime, honestly,” she said.
During a keynote talk at the 2024 MIT Sloan AI & ML Conference, Teevan discussed how GPT-4 has evolved, how generative AI is changing work in the short and long terms, and the future of online search.
How AI will change work 
That eye-opening meeting began a sprint to bring LLMs to everyday workers, Teevan said.
The model itself was just the start. It also needed an infrastructure — the computing power necessary to run the model continuously, and the ability to securely input and analyze sensitive data and integrate models into the workflows of knowledge workers.
Microsoft’s research has found that generative AI helps people work faster while retaining relative consistency in quality. “People are feeling more efficient, and they’re enjoying work more,” Teevan said. One study demonstrated that generative AI can be most beneficial to workers with the least experience, helping them match the performance of colleagues with longer tenures.
Teevan said she is seeing AI change how people work in a few ways. In the short term, users are taking advantage of gains in efficiency or production, such as using ChatGPT to create content and to summarize documents, such as meeting transcripts.
“We can help you generate content to reply to an email or start a new document so you don’t have this blank-page challenge anymore,” she said.
There’s even more opportunity in the longer term, Teevan said. This includes using AI in entirely new ways.
“I don’t think we’re being imaginative enough,” she said. “We’re thinking about how it’s going to help us do our tasks better. We’re not thinking about how it’s going to help us collaborate and work together. We’re thinking about how it can do stuff that we know more efficiently and faster. We’re not thinking about how it can help us do new things or think of things in new ways.”
Teevan herself uses AI to see things in new ways and for brainstorming and collaboration. “I really like the way the model helps me see other perspectives really quickly, helps me ideate and think through new things,” she said.

It’s time to make sure everyone understands generative AI  


Looking ahead, Teevan said she expects generative AI to change online search. Instead of simply aggregating webpages, she said, a search engine could provide personalized feedback and serve a larger function. “In many ways, search is just a part of the larger task that you’re doing, and you’re seeing people go to search engines to do those larger tasks, to think things through, to get feedback, to create new content,” she said.
And it’s only a matter of time before models can turn the tables and ask users questions, Teevan said. “That ability to pull more knowledge from people and figure out what’s in your head, to help you bring more to the table, feels like a real opportunity,” she said.
A key challenge to using AI is a lack of imagination, she said — it’s hard to envision all the possibilities, given that the technology is evolving and people are still learning how to use it. “It’s a real sociotechnical problem, actually, where the way people are using the technology is going to shape the way that it evolves, and the technology is going to shape the way that we use it,” Teevan said.Watch all the sessions from the 2024 MIT AI & ML Conference

Get personalized advice61. Find inspiration for a presentationMaking a killer pitch deck is an art form, and one that usually takes hours. Rather than starting from scratch each time, global marketing and advertising company Media.Monks is using generative AI to make sure great ideas don’t go to waste. An early adopter of the technology, this AWS customer and partner has built an in-house, enterprise-ready AI solution to automate its workflows—both internally and on behalf of its clients. The platform, Monks.Flow, connects with Amazon Bedrock, and offers intelligent solutions for clients’ marketing activities. Designed to work across existing tech stacks, and depending on the needs of the client, it can perform tasks such as document reviews, as well as extract valuable data and insights from a company’s existing systems. For example, let’s say the Media.Monks team is preparing a presentation for a prospective client. Monks.Flow uses different LLMs, accessed via Amazon Bedrock, to search through the vast number of decks the company has worked on over the years. Not only can it quickly find information applicable to whatever new business the team is pitching for today, it can also rank it in order of relevance—providing instant access to a wealth of knowledge, and turbocharging teams’ imaginations.Amazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitmentAmazon’s AI Ready initiative comes as new AWS study finds strong demand for AI talent and the potential for workers with AI skills to earn up to 47% more in salaries.Read moreabout Amazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitment2. Compare product reviews in different languagesIf you’re an Amazon seller, or any other business that sells products online, customer reviews hold a treasure trove of information. But if you sell globally, and you receive hundreds, even thousands, of reviews in a range of languages you don’t speak, it can be pretty tricky to glean insights from the data. Step forward Cohere Embed, a text representation language model from enterprise AI company Cohere. Available on Amazon Bedrock, it can work across more than 100 languages. Cohere’s chief product officer, Jaron Waldman, put it this way: “Imagine you had a bunch of product reviews on Amazon, in 100 different languages. You want to analyze those reviews, and so you could ask a question like, ‘Show me all the reviews that are related to the delivery of the product,’ to see if there was a delivery problem or if the delivery was going well.’ You can do all that with Cohere Embed.”3. Streamline schedulingIt can be hard for business owners to organize staffing schedules that suit the needs of both their customers and employees. AWS customer AlayaCare offers software services to companies that provide home-based healthcare. The Montreal-based startup is using generative AI to tackle one of the industry’s biggest headaches: employee turnover. AlayaCare’s research shows that the biggest reason home-care services employees—hardworking caregivers usually paid by the hour—leave their jobs is dissatisfaction with scheduling. “A lot of times, it's simply the difference between the hours they want and the hours they get,” said Naomi Goldapple, AlayaCare senior VP of data and intelligence. Her team has been prototyping on Amazon Bedrock to help schedulers quickly see the home-visit slots they need to fill, and provide them with the best employee matches based on specific criteria that satisfy caregivers and patients alike.4. Summarize documents in a flashAlayaCare is also using generative AI to gather and then summarize what Goldapple affectionately calls “note droppings”: notes made by different caregivers and nurses who go into a patient’s home to provide care. One nurse might make a note in one part of the AlayaCare platform about a particular patient complaining about increased lower back pain. Then another nurse, visiting the same patient the following day, might make a note in a different part of the platform about that patient experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath. LLMs can read all of these notes left in different places, pull together the most important information (such as continued mentions of pain), and summarize it in a way that allows a clinician to spot trends and intervene earlier, to avoid having the patient hospitalized.5. Get personalized adviceIf you need advice or want to brainstorm, but no one’s around, why not ask your digital doppelgänger? Media.Monks VP and global head of engineering Iran Reyes has built his own digital persona in the company’s AI-centric, professionally managed service Monks.Flow. “I have a digital twin that knows my character traits, my personal and professional background, the way I speak, my tone of voice, and so on. For this interview, I asked it what I should keep in mind. It recommended I slow down, speak clearly, and focus on describing the specific services we’ve built. It was great advice.” Reyes predicts a big rise in AI companions: “We’re going to be using these ‘personas in our pockets’—with our phones, or other devices—to help us make better decisions and take actions in all kinds of situations.”Find out how to transform your business with generative AI on AWS.Learn more about the latest additions to Amazon Bedrock.Amazon Bedrock represents the middle layer of the three-layered ‘generative AI stack’.

How fast is GPT-4o?OpenAI claims GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation, according to several studies.Consequently, GPT-4o requires the use of fewer tokens in languages, the basic unit in AI that calculates the length of text and can include punctuation marks and spaces. Token counts vary from one language to another.Among the languages highlighted by OpenAI that use fewer tokens with GPT-4o are Arabic (from 53 to 26), Gujarati (145 to 33), Hindi (90 to 31), Korean (45 to 27) and Chinese (34 to 24).For perspective, we can make some comparisons to a 1968 study from Robert Miller – Response time in man-computer conversational transactions – which detailed the three magnitudes of computer mainframe responsiveness.The research revealed a response time of 100 milliseconds is perceived as instantaneous, while one second or less are fast enough for users to feel they are interacting freely with the information. A response time of more than 10 seconds would lose user attention completely.How does GPT-4o work?The simplest answer is that OpenAI, well, simplified the process of converting input into output.In OpenAI's previous AI models, Voice Mode was used to talk to ChatGPT at latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. Voice Mode used three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in and outputs text, and a third simple version converts that text back to audio.""This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information – it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion,"" OpenAI said.But with GPT-4o, OpenAI was able to merge all these functions into a single model, with end-to-end capabilities across text, vision and audio, significantly reducing the amount of time consumed and information processed.""All inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network,"" OpenAI said. A neural network is an AI technique that teaches computers to process data similarly to the human brain.Still, OpenAI said it was ""still just scratching the surface"" of GPT-4o capabilities and limitations, given that it is their first model that merges all of these modalities.What can GPT-4o not do?Speaking of limitations, OpenAI acknowledged ""several"" of them across the GPT-4o model, including inconsistencies in responses featured in a blooper reel. It even demonstrated how GPT-4o can be adept in sarcasm.In addition, OpenAI said it continues to refine the model's behaviour through post-training – which is critical in addressing safety concerns, a key sticking point in modern-day AI.The company said it has created new safety systems to serve as guardrails for voice outputs, in addition to testing the model, with more than 70 experts in the fields of social psychology, bias, fairness and misinformation to identify any risks that may seep through.""We will continue to mitigate new risks as they’re discovered. We recognise that GPT-4o’s audio modalities present a variety of novel risks,"" OpenAI said.How much does GPT-4o cost?Good news – it's free for all users, with paid users enjoying ""up to five times the capacity limits"" of their free peers, OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said in the unveiling presentation.However, if you're not a paying OpenAI user, it will set you back $5 and $15 for one million tokens of input and output, respectively.Allowing the free use of GPT-4o should serve OpenAI well, which would also complement the company's other paid offerings.READ MOREAbu Dhabi's TII unveils Falcon 2 series that aims to take on Google and MetaUAE-developed Arabic chatbot Jais Chat unveiledIn August, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Enterprise monthly plan, the price of which varies depending on user requirements. It's the third tier after its basic free service and the $20-a-month Plus plan.The company in January launched its online ChatGPT Store that gives users access to more than three million custom versions of GPTs, developed by OpenAI's partners and its community.OpenAI hopes to attract more users as competition heats up in the generative AI world – and there are a lot coming for them.How does OpenAI stack against its biggest rivals at this point?OpenAI's move to introduce a new, free and faster large language model is an indication of how it has its hands full against its competition in generative AI.Google, arguably its biggest rival in the space, has Gemini, which was the first AI model to beat human experts on massive multitask language understanding, one of the widely used methods to test the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of AI.Gemini can be accessed on the Google One AI Premium plan for $19.99 a month, which includes 2TB of storage, 10 per cent back from purchases made on the Google Store and more features across Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides and Google Meet.In February, it launched Gemma, aimed at assisting developers and researchers in “building AI responsibly” and is more for modest tasks such as basic chatbots or summarisation jobs.Anthropic, meanwhile, in March launched Claude 3 – its direct challenge at generative AI leader OpenAI.The company backed by Google itself and Amazon has three tiers – Haiku, Sonnet and Opus – each offering increasing capabilities that will suit user needs.Haiku is priced at $0.25 per million tokens (MTok) for input and $1.25 for output, while Sonnet costs $3 and $15. Opus is the most expensive at $15 and $75.For comparison, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo comes in at $10 for input and $30 for output, and also with a smaller context window of 128,000 MTok.Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest backer, charges $20 a month for its Copilot pro service, which guarantees faster performance and ""everything"" the service offers. If you're not willing to pay, there's a free Copilot tier, which, obviously, has limited functionalities.And then, there's xAI's Grok, from OpenAI's friend-turned-enemy, Elon Musk.Grok's current version, Grok-1.5, is only available to subscribers of X's Premium+ tier, which starts at $16 per month, or $168 a year.Regional entities are also taking aim at the leaders: on Monday Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute introduced the second iteration of its large language model, Falcon 2, to compete with models developed by Meta, Google and OpenAI.Also on Monday, Core42, a unit of Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence and cloud company, G42, launched a bilingual Arabic and English chatbot developed in the UAE, Jais Chat.

Consequently, GPT-4o requires the use of fewer tokens in languages, the basic unit in AI that calculates the length of text and can include punctuation marks and spaces. Token counts vary from one language to another. Among the languages highlighted by OpenAI that use fewer tokens with GPT-4o are Arabic (from 53 to 26), Gujarati (145 to 33), Hindi (90 to 31), Korean (45 to 27) and Chinese (34 to 24). For perspective, we can make some comparisons to a 1968 study from Robert Miller – <i>Response time in man-computer conversational transactions – </i>which detailed the three magnitudes of computer mainframe responsiveness. The research revealed a response time of 100 milliseconds is perceived as instantaneous, while one second or less are fast enough for users to feel they are interacting freely with the information. A response time of more than 10 seconds would lose user attention completely.  The simplest answer is that OpenAI, well, simplified the process of converting input into output. In OpenAI's previous AI models, Voice Mode was used to talk to ChatGPT at latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. Voice Mode used three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in and outputs text, and a third simple version converts that text back to audio. ""This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information – it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion,"" OpenAI said. But with GPT-4o, OpenAI was able to merge all these functions into a single model, with end-to-end capabilities across text, vision and audio, significantly reducing the amount of time consumed and information processed. ""All inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network,"" OpenAI said. A neural network is an AI technique that teaches computers to process data similarly to the human brain. Still, OpenAI said it was ""still just scratching the surface"" of GPT-4o capabilities and limitations, given that it is their first model that merges all of these modalities.  Speaking of limitations, OpenAI acknowledged ""several"" of them across the GPT-4o model, including inconsistencies in responses featured in a blooper reel. It even demonstrated how GPT-4o can be adept in sarcasm.  In addition, OpenAI said it continues to refine the model's behaviour through post-training – which is critical in addressing safety concerns, a key sticking point in modern-day AI. The company said it has created new safety systems to serve as guardrails for voice outputs, in addition to testing the model, with more than 70 experts in the fields of social psychology, bias, fairness and misinformation to identify any risks that may seep through. ""We will continue to mitigate new risks as they’re discovered. We recognise that GPT-4o’s audio modalities present a variety of novel risks,"" OpenAI said.  Good news – it's free for all users, with paid users enjoying ""up to five times the capacity limits"" of their free peers, OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said in the unveiling presentation. However, if you're not a paying OpenAI user, it will set you back $5 and $15 for one million tokens of input and output, respectively. Allowing the free use of GPT-4o should serve OpenAI well, which would also complement the company's other paid offerings.  In August, <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2023/08/29/chatgpts-new-paid-business-tier-all-you-need-to-know/"" target=""_blank"">OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Enterprise monthly plan</a>, the price of which varies depending on user requirements. It's the third tier after its basic free service and the $20-a-month Plus plan.

OpenAI hopes to attract more users as competition heats up in the generative AI world – and there are a lot coming for them.  OpenAI's move to introduce a new, free and faster large language model is an indication of how it has its hands full against its competition in generative AI. Google, arguably its biggest rival in the space, has Gemini, which was the first AI model to beat human experts on massive multitask language understanding, one of the widely used methods to test the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of AI. Gemini can be accessed on the Google One AI Premium plan for $19.99 a month, which includes 2TB of storage, 10 per cent back from purchases made on the Google Store and more features across <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/future/technology/2024/04/01/gmails-20th-anniversary-technologys-best-april-fools-prank-yet/"" target=""_blank"">Gmail</a>, Google Docs, Google Slides and Google Meet. <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2024/02/21/what-is-gemma-google-ai/"" target=""_blank"">In February, it launched Gemma</a>, aimed at assisting developers and researchers in “building AI responsibly” and is more for modest tasks such as basic chatbots or summarisation jobs.

The company backed by Google itself and Amazon has three tiers – Haiku, Sonnet and Opus – each offering increasing capabilities that will suit user needs. Haiku is priced at $0.25 per million tokens (MTok) for input and $1.25 for output, while Sonnet costs $3 and $15. Opus is the most expensive at $15 and $75. For comparison, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo comes in at $10 for input and $30 for output, and also with a smaller context window of 128,000 MTok. Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest backer, charges $20 a month for its Copilot pro service, which guarantees faster performance and ""everything"" the service offers. If you're not willing to pay, there's a free Copilot tier, which, obviously, has limited functionalities. And then, there's xAI's Grok, from <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2024/03/11/elon-musk-says-xais-grok-will-become-open-source-and-calls-openai-a-lie/"" target=""_blank"">OpenAI's friend-turned-enemy, Elon Musk</a>.

KYIV — On a sunny, balmy Tuesday in late April, a line of cars formed outside a military proving ground near Kyiv, their passengers eager to catch a glimpse of the future of warfare. As the drivers waited to enter, hosts of maybugs swarmed overhead. Above them buzzed bigger, robotic competitors: military drones crisscrossing the sky.
The grounds were full of techies and soldiers, gathering on a field scarred by Russia’s foiled assault on Kyiv to test-drive their latest innovations. Among them was a Ukrainian startup called Swarmer. Registered in Delaware and with offices in Romania and Poland, it had something special to demo: drones that use artificial intelligence to work together as a coordinated swarm.
It took about 20 minutes for Swarmer’s team of five engineers to prepare the drones for their mission: to find and destroy two targets hidden somewhere in the field. Usually, drones need pilots equipped with video-game-style controllers and goggles to see through their cameras. For this test, Yaroslav Sherstyuk, a former Ukrainian army officer, planned to run three reconnaissance drones and two larger bombers. “I will be in charge,” Sherstyuk said. “But that only takes pushing three buttons.”

He indicated the targets on a map, pushed start and leaned back in his chair. Two reconnaissance drones zoomed off. “Each of them decided on the best trajectory on their own, based on a possible terrain relief or other possible obstacles we pointed out on the map,” said Sherstyuk, watching their progress on his screen. The two bombers followed. Only the last, small drone stayed back.
The bombers found their targets. Sherstyuk approved the attack, then hopped on a phone call with his son while the drones carried out the strike. The last drone whirred forward. “It’s checking whether the bombers destroyed the target,” Sherstyuk said. “Command usually demands destruction or damage confirmation, so it’s doing that.”
Mission accomplished, the drones floated back to Sherstyuk. Swarmer’s team toasted the demo’s success with alcohol-free beer.
As its war against Russia drags on, Ukraine is emerging as a testing ground for cutting-edge warfare, including drones and other vehicles capable of carrying out parts of their mission on their own. Serhii Kuprienko, Swarmer’s 39-year-old founder and chief executive, thinks his swarms might be deployed this year. “We have already passed the first combat tests,” he said.
By allowing a single pilot to control multiple drones, Swarmer aims to alleviate the manpower shortages that have put Ukraine’s armed forces on the back foot in recent weeks. Using artificial intelligence, or AI, the company’s drones will react autonomously to changing circumstances and communicate with each other to orchestrate a sortie.
“AI-powered drones can do in seconds what would take a human several hours, simply because we are slow to process a large volume of information,” Kuprienko said. “The swarm is effective because one experienced drone pilot can work effectively with dozens of drones at the same time.”

He stressed that the decision to attack a target would always be made by a human. Still, he couldn’t resist making the Arnold Schwarzenegger-sized sci-fi reference that inevitably looms over any conversation about AI-powered combat robots.
“My goal,” he said, “is to make a proper version of the Terminator that will protect us and help our army.” 
Ukraine turns to AI to maintain its drone advantage
Technology has been the linchpin of Ukraine’s fightback from the very moment Russian tanks rolled over its borders in February 2022. Demography — Russia’s population of 144 million versus Ukraine’s 38 million — made Moscow’s preponderance in manpower and materiel unmatchable. There was no fighting fire with fire. You had to douse it with bits.
Drones — military-grade or cheap hobbyist models — epitomize that strategy. On the battlefield, they are ubiquitous, scanning the ground to spot targets with ammo-saving precision, dropping grenades or ramming kamikaze-style into Russian vehicles, gear and troops. Telegram, a laxly moderated social network popular in Russia and Ukraine, is awash with videos of Ukrainian drones rigged with explosives fluttering around Russian soldiers and tanks like angry, deadly mosquitos. Russia has also leaned heavily on drones, both imported from allies and domestically produced.

Drones have broadened the buffer zone between Ukrainian and Russian combatants from a couple of kilometers to as much as 20 km, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation Alex Bornyakov told POLITICO. “Anything you put in this ‘gray area’, it can be destroyed by drones,” he said.
Their pivotal role was officially acknowledged in February 2024, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy launched a new branch of the military: the Unmanned Systems Forces, entirely dedicated to working with aerial, ground and sea drones. Days later, his government announced that Ukraine was on track to manufacture more than a million drones by the end of 2024.

Even if the recently announced inflow of U.S. ammo helps Ukraine diversify its approach, drones are not going away. “Once additional artillery is available again, the Ukrainians will use [commercial drones] less,” said Torsten Reil, co-CEO of the pan-European AI defense company Helsing, which works with the Ukrainian government. “[But] midterm, we will see a development of much more capable drones, strike drones, that will complement and mirror artillery in terms of their effect.”
The challenge for Ukraine is that Russia has recognized the disruptive power of the technology and turned to electronic warfare — deploying vehicles covered in dish antennas to jam the radio frequencies relied on by Ukrainian drone pilots. “Russia has jamming stations every 10 kilometers at the front line, so Ukraine’s previously successful drone-based approach doesn’t work as well as it used to,” Reil said.
In addition to cutting off drones from their pilots, jamming can interfere with navigation systems like GPS. Worse, the Russian technology can work out the location of drone pilots — who in many cases need to remain within line of sight of their vehicles — and tag them for artillery strikes. Concerns about jamming and other types of electronic warfare have contributed to reluctance in Washington to providing Kyiv with American-made Reaper spy drones.
To try to maintain its edge, Ukraine has launched an effort to restyle itself as a tech accelerator in the field of drone warfare, working with local and Western companies to develop countermeasures and test them and deploy them on the battlefield. 
At the forefront is a government program called Brave1, a joint venture encompassing six ministries modeled on the U.S.’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a Department of Defense outfit tasked with facilitating military deployments of commercial technologies.   
“Everyone was like: ‘Let’s build Ukrainian DARPA’,” said Bornyakov, referring to the Department of Defense’s military research agency. “But DARPA is more about complex theoretical innovations.” Brave1 is focused on developing solutions that can be rolled out, stat.

Roughly a year after its launch, some 700 inventions that went through Brave1’s program were approved for use by the Ukrainian Armed Forces; around 40 have found their way to the front. Once a working prototype is identified, government certification can be obtained in as little as 21 days, Bornyakov said.
Brave1 supports startups working on medical technologies, logistics and cybersecurity, among other areas. But its top priority is unmanned systems. “The goal [is] that robots, not humans, should fight on the battlefield,” Bornyakov said.
Given the Russian jamming, achieving that goal often boils down to one thing: AI, the use of vast troves of data — images, text, audio, video, radio signals — to teach drones to act on their own. Reconnaissance drones use image-recognition to do away with GPS or spot and identify camouflaged military targets. Explosive kamikaze drones can be trained to forge on even if they lose contact with their pilots.

“AI can help lock in on targets and then automatically — without communication, or in conditions of suppression by the enemy’s electronic warfare systems — make it possible for the drone to hit the target,” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and technology chief Mykhailo Fedorov said in an interview in a high-security governmental building in April. He said that 10 companies active in Ukraine are developing AI technology to help drones close in on their targets.
The technology on offer may fall far short of Terminator-style robots: in Ukraine, the call to engage with a given target still lies with a human decisionmaker. But for how long? 
“If you think of AI as drones autonomously and independently making some decisions to strike or not to strike something, there is no such thing yet,” said Fedorov. “But I think that there is a certain future for it.”

In an interview with the Associated Press in 2023, he was more explicit: Autonomous killer drones, he said, are “a logical and inevitable next step.”
The future of warfare is being written in Ukraine
Just how much of a difference AI is making on the battlefield is a matter of some debate. Jim Acuna, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and the founder of the Baltic Ghost Wing Center of Excellence drone pilot school in Estonia, is skeptical. “It’s all wishful thinking, it’s not a reality,” he said.
Autonomous weapons systems still don’t make sense from a “cost-benefit analysis” perspective, said Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies think tank. “None of these platforms currently are at a stage where they can genuinely be deployed at scale, consistently, and without a huge support infrastructure.” 
Technologists, unsurprisingly, have a different take. “If you zoom in, it’ll look like pilot projects,” said Louis Mosley, vice president for Europe for the U.S. artificial intelligence giant Palantir, which works in Ukraine. “But when you zoom out, you can see that this is now the way the war is being fought.”
Peter W. Singer, a defense analyst and author of 2009 best-seller “Wired for War”, sees the war in Ukraine as playing a similar role to the Spanish Civil War, which served as a dress rehearsal for new techniques and technologies ahead of World War II. Modern tank warfare and aerial bombing — as captured in Pablo Picasso’s dramatic oeuvre Guernica — were arguably forged in the Spanish crucible.
“There’s a bit of debate in defense circles that in Ukraine, yes, you’ve got drones but also trenches and cannons, so nothing’s really changing,” Singer said. “That’s like looking at Spain in 1936 and saying, ‘They are still using rifles’ and ignoring that they are bringing together these new technologies like aerial bombing.”

As Ukraine and Russia fight, Singer said, “everyone else is watching and learning.And they’re not watching and learning about trenches, but about the use of drones and AI and how it’s being brought together,” he said.

Ukraine has attracted dozens of Western defense and technology companies eager to test — or advertise — their offerings in a live-fire situation. “If companies want to do something in the field of defense innovations, they have to be in Ukraine,” said Brave1’s Chief Operating Officer, Nataliia Kushnerska. “Ukraine is definitely the most dynamic innovation ecosystem in the world.”
One of those companies is Quantum Systems, a company that has deployed 400 reconnaissance drones in Ukraine, with a contract to deliver 800 more and eventually build a factory in the country, according to its CEO Florian Seibel, who accompanied Germany’s Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck on a mission to the country last month. 
The company has made waves as far away as Silicon Valley: German-American billionaire Peter Thiel is an investor and Seibel met emissaries from the venture capital firm Sequoia just before sitting down with POLITICO in his office, a squat, drone-filled building in an industrial park outside Munich.
Quantum Systems’ drones are expensive, at €200,000 each, but they use AI to overcome electronic warfare with preloaded maps and landmarks to navigate a GPS-denied environment, and machine vision to flag foes. “You can completely take operators out of the loop,” Seibel said.
While Quantum System’s drones only work as spotters, Seibel said the Ukrainian experience convinced him to form a new company called Stark Defense to develop autonomous weapons with full-strike capability. “If we don’t want our kids to fight Chinese war robots in the future, we have to get going and work on robots ourselves,” he said. Crucially, he added, Stark’s systems will be “capable of operating without a human in the loop.”

He acknowledged that this was a controversial approach. “We will prepare the grounds so that it is possible, but in the end, it’s not my decision,” he said. “If the decision of the German government is that we cannot have autonomous weapons with no human in the loop, well, then this will not be used.”
Stark is still, to a certain extent, in “stealth” mode — recruiting, seeking venture capital investment — but it would theoretically be able to deploy its products on short notice, he said. “We will deploy whenever we think it’s ready to be viable, and whenever the Ukrainians decide to,” he says.
Has the company already tested its drones in Ukraine?
“Maybe,”  Seibel said. 
Autonomous weapons: ‘The Oppenheimer moment of our generation’
Among the people watching what’s happening in Ukraine are those seeking to prevent the technology from ever coming to fruition. In late April, delegates from 143 countries joined activists, academics and at least one journalist in the caryatid-graced hall of the Hofburg imperial palace in Vienna to attend the biggest ever conference on autonomous weapons systems. 
Above a bust of the 19th-century Emperor Franz Joseph, a screen displayed digital images of autonomous drones devastating cities with firework-like effects. Nearby, a blueish cut-out of Austria-born Schwarzenegger’s Terminator fixed visitors with glowing red eyes and a skeletal steel grin.

“This is the ‘Oppenheimer moment’ of our generation,” Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told the assembled audience. “Autonomous weapons systems will soon fill the world’s battlefields … Technology is moving ahead with racing speed, while politics is lagging behind.”
He ceded the floor to Jaan Tallinn, an Estonian tech entrepreneur who has warned against the dangers posed by AI. The risk that comes with autonomous weapons (or killer robots, as their critics call them) is of a “suicidal arms race” to more autonomy, he said. Mass killing will become a mechanized, easy affair. AI-controlled drones will be deployed in assassinations or by terrorists targeting civilians. “When you opt for speed, you give up control,” Tallinn said. 
For Anthony Aguirre, the executive director of the Tallinn-backed think tank the Future of Life Institute, the problem is not so much what is taking place in Ukraine right now — but what will happen when powerhouses like China and the U.S. get in the game. “If you end up with half a million drones in a shipping container able to go out and kill roughly half a million people — that’s a WMD,” he said. 
The solution, Schallenberg said in an interview after the event, is “a legally binding international instrument” — a treaty banning fully autonomous weapons whose actions cannot be predicted or explained (AI algorithms are notoriously opaque) by their operators. 
Alexander Kmentt, the Austrian diplomat who organized the conference, said that the goal is to ban “weapons designed in a way that they could not be used in accordance with international humanitarian law.”
The Austrian foreign minister acknowledged that many countries, including the United States and Russia, oppose the initiative and made that clear during the conference.

Last summer, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Pentagon is seeking to build thousands of “attritable, autonomous systems” able to “overcome [China’s] biggest advantage, which is mass.” In early May, the secretary of the U.S. Air Force Frank Kendall took a ride in an AI-controlled F16, an early version of what the service hopes to be a fleet of 1,000 unmanned warplanes, with the first deployed by 2028. The U.S. Marines are reportedly testing rifle-equipped robotic dogs capable of scanning a battlefield for targets before requesting permission to attack. 
In early 2023, France’s Defense Innovation Agency put out a call for tenders for two national efforts to develop kamikaze drones, some of which will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming months. And on Thursday, the Bundestag was expected to begin discussion on a motion entitled “Building a Drone Army.”
China too is developing AI-augmented drones. Its military has test flown drones that were capable of carrying an assault to its explosive conclusion after they were cut off from their operators. On the other side of the Taiwan strait, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has said she had drawn “great inspiration” from the use of autonomous weapons in Ukraine and pledged to close the drone gap with Beijing. Iran and — of course — Russia are also working to integrate AI into their fleets.
“The fact that maybe not everybody would agree at the very beginning is maybe an obstacle, but not an excuse,” said Schallenberg. He pointed to earlier treaties on landmines and cluster munitions as examples of rules that, while not backed by everyone, including the U.S., established a baseline of decency. “Countries that do not abide by the rules — even if they’ve not ratified the treaty — now feel obliged to explain themselves,” he said. 
For Singer, the military futurist, the Rubicon on autonomous weapons has already been crossed. “Autonomy was this big red line, and we crossed it without a lot of hullabaloo,” he said. 
“If your vision of the future is using more robotic systems at the end of a long leash — a physical wire or wireless … The enemy is going to cut that wire through electronic or cyber warfare,” he added. “Then you will have the option of either doing nothing about it — or going for more autonomy.”

Ukraine’s delegation at the Vienna conference did not make a statement, but Fedorov told POLITICO he did not believe in “quick decisions to limit such technologies, because they are actively developing and there is still no stable experience of how they can have a negative impact.”
“I am sure that the question of limiting the use of AI should be resolved,” he said. “After our victory.”

AI Hitting Job Markets Like a ‘Tsunami’, Says IMF Chief



May 14, 2024

 “We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said

The International Monetary Fund chief voiced concerns this week about the impact of artificial intelligence on job markets, adding that the world has had little time to “prepare” for the technology.
AI is hitting global labour forces “like a tsunami,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told an event in Zurich on Monday.
“We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” she added.

Speaking at the Swiss Institute of International Studies, Georgieva noted that artificial intelligence was likely to impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% of jobs around the world in the next two years.
For several businesses, however, that impact has already started to manifest.
Employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. noted in a February report that AI-related job cuts were on the rise in the US since May 2023. That was because firms were either moving towards developing the tech or depending upon it to replace certain duties and roles.
Rapid advancement of AI was currently affecting jobs in media and technology, but its effect was “beginning to be felt” across other sectors, the report added.
In March, US tech giant IBM reportedly began laying off employees in non-customer-facing roles, aiming to replace them with AI.
The company’s chief had said last year that the company was planning to slow or suspend hiring in 26,000 roles which could be carried out by AI and automation, CRN magazine reported. That number accounted for about 10% of the firm’s workforce.
Meanwhile, about 40% and 26% of jobs in emerging markets and low-income countries, respectively, are at risk from AI, the IMF has previously noted.
According to accounting firm PwC, AI and related technologies could displace around 26% of existing jobs in China.
Georgieva has previously called on policymakers to manage this “troubling trend” and prevent the technology from “stoking social tensions”.
On Monday, she reiterated that call. AI “could bring a tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society.”

In March, US tech giant IBM &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/ibm-layoffs-hit-marketing-communications-staff-as-ai-charge-continues-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; began laying off employees in non-customer-facing roles, aiming to replace them with AI.

The company’s chief had said last year that the company was planning to slow or suspend hiring in 26,000 roles which could be carried out by AI and automation, CRN magazine reported. That number accounted for about 10% of the firm’s workforce.

Meanwhile, about 40% and 26% of jobs in emerging markets and low-income countries, respectively, are at risk from AI, the IMF has previously noted.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/impact-of-ai-on-jobs-in-china.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; accounting firm PwC, AI and related technologies could displace around 26% of existing jobs in China.

Georgieva has previously called on policymakers to manage this “troubling trend” and prevent the technology from “stoking social tensions”.

On Monday, she reiterated that call. AI “could bring a tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society.&quot;

Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) refers to technology that employs machine learning techniques to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, and Midjourney have gained popularity worldwide, including among teachers, due to their potential to save time and generate new ideas and resources.
Given the novelty of this technology, relatively little is known about the role of generative AI in teaching and learning. This gap is important to address to help guide policy and practice as education departments integrate generative AI into teaching and learning at schools (Commonwealth of Australia, 2023).



Because teachers will be in the front line of these practices and policies, it is vital to understand how they perceive generative AI and the ways in which they are using it in their work. In a recent study (Collie & Martin, 2024), we examined how much teachers value the usefulness of generative AI, how they were integrating generative AI in their work, and the role of school leadership practices and teachers’ own occupational experiences in supporting or thwarting these experiences.
By looking at these factors together, this research offers multipronged insights into how generative AI may be integrated into classroom and school life.
What did our research involve?
We collected data from a sample of 339 Australian school teachers in June and July 2023, approximately 6 months after the release of the first generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Many additional generative AI tools had been released by that point too (including, GPT 4, Grammarly AI, Midjourney, Bing Chat AI, and Dall-E 2). 
As indicated, we looked at teachers’ valuing of generative AI and their integration of this technology in teaching and learning. 
Generative AI valuing captures teachers’ perceptions that generative AI will play a useful and beneficial role in their work. 
Generative AI integration reflects teachers’ use of this technology for assisting with their own work tasks (such as planning, teaching, and assessing) and in student learning activities (such as by asking students to generate ideas, check work, and develop outlines). 
The factors we examined as predictors of the generative AI variables included teacher reports on their perceptions of 2 school leadership practices and 2 occupational experiences: 
Autonomy-supportive leadership practices
denote efforts by school leaders to foster teachers’ self-initiative by, for example, acknowledging their viewpoints, seeking their input, and understanding their individual needs.Autonomy-thwarting leadership practices
denote approaches by school leaders that require compliance in how teachers undertake their work tasks, or prompt feelings of guilt or shame among teachers if they conduct their work in ways that are different from the leaders.Professional growth striving
denotes teachers’ deliberate efforts to plan for their ongoing professional learning and development.Change-related stress denotes teachers’ stress from recent changes in their work and workplace. 
What did our study find?
Our findings showed that higher levels of autonomy-supportive leadership and professional growth striving were linked with greater valuing of generative AI. This means that teachers who felt their school leaders supported their self-initiative and those who were invested in their own professional development tended to value generative AI more. This makes sense and aligns with prior research showing supportive leadership and growth-oriented teachers are more likely to report greater valuing and motivation at work (Collie, 2023a).
Unexpectedly, we found that change-related stress was also associated with greater valuing of generative AI. This requires further research to unpack, but we speculate it may be that stressed teachers value generative AI because it offers the opportunity to assist with their tasks and streamline their workload. 
When it came to generative AI integration, our study showed that higher levels of generative AI valuing were associated with greater levels of generative AI integration. This finding is understandable. When we value something, we’re more likely to engage in actions related to that perception.
In addition, we found that higher levels of autonomy-thwarting leadership and professional growth striving were linked with greater generative AI integration. For the former finding, it may be that generative AI offers teachers a chance to take back some control over their work when they experience pressuring leadership. With regard to professional growth striving, we suggest that generative AI integration offers an opportunity to further build professional skills. 
What does this mean for school leaders and teachers?
Our findings suggest that leadership practices and teachers’ occupational experiences might be important to address in relation to supporting generative AI valuing and integration. 
As relevant to our study, strategies to boost autonomy-supportive leadership practices include seeking out teachers’ perspectives, providing rationales for work task assignments, and incorporating teachers’ input into decisions about how to integrate generative AI into teaching and learning (Collie, 2023b). 
At the same time, it is important to reduce autonomy-thwarting leadership practices (Collie, 2023b). Leaders can do this by avoiding pressuring practices, such as demanding how things must be done, providing teachers little choice in how they integrate generative AI, or making teachers feel guilty if they do things differently. 
Efforts to boost professional growth striving might include encouraging teachers to set goals for their learning with generative AI, giving them opportunities to engage in relevant and effective training to meet those goals, and building professional learning communities within the school to boost collective goals (Garet et al., 2001). 
Finally, to reduce change-related stress, any efforts by schools to reduce or streamline reforms might be helpful, including around expectations for integrating generative AI (Putwain et al., 2019). Autonomy-supportive leadership practices are also helpful because these ensure that teachers’ perspectives are considered (Collie, 2021), which may help teachers feel more control over decisions that impact their work.

In Rebecca Collie and Andrew Martin’s study, ‘teachers who felt their school leaders supported their self-initiative and those who were invested in their professional development tended to value generative AI more’. 
As a school leader, do you seek out teacher perspectives on integration of new programs or technologies? Is their input incorporated into decision-making? 
When introducing new technologies, do you encourage teachers to set goals for their own learning and provide opportunities for training to meet these goals? What role do professional learning communities within the school play?

Video: Can Laws Keep Up With AI’s Fast Pace?  They come amid growing concerns about how use of the technology can lead to worker displacement, intrusive employee surveillance, and unintentional discrimination based on race, sex, and other protected characteristics.“Workers must be at the heart of our nation’s approach to AI technology development and use,” Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a Thursday statement. “These principles announced today reflect the Biden-Harris administration’s belief that, in addition to complying with existing laws, artificial intelligence should also enhance the quality of work and life for all workers.”When it comes to oversight of AI systems, the principles say that companies should have “governance systems,” evaluation processes, and humans involved in monitoring the technology.Fears of “robot bosses” making hiring and firing decisions, as well as surveiling workers has also garnered the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have introduced some bills to rein in AI use in the workplace.The principles caution that any worker data collected by AI systems should be “used only to support legitimate business aims,” and that the technology cannot run afoul of workers’ labor rights and anti-discrimination protections. The White House has already secured commitments from tech companies Microsoft Corp. and Indeed Inc. to integrate the principles into their workplaces, according to the announcement. The principles aren’t an “exhaustive list,” and are meant to serve as a “guiding framework” for businesses on workplace protections and risks as artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday life, the White House said. They were requested by President Joe Biden as part of his October executive order on responsible AI use.The principles apply to all industries, the White House said, but it also noted that AI developers and employers can and should “review and customize” these practices “based on their own context and with input from workers.”The DOL is still due to issue a set of “best practices” outlining examples of how employers can apply the principles.As part of Biden’s requests under the EO, the DOL on April 29 issued an FAQ focused on federal contractors’ equal employment opportunity obligations when using AI technology, and instructions to its Wage and Hour Division offices on how the Fair Labor Standards Act still applies when AI is used to determine break periods or for timekeeping purposes, among other areas.

In a recent US survey, 30% of junior employees polled said they
use Generative AI for work - but 70% of them haven't told their
bosses! Time to do an audit, and put a policy in place for the
purchase and deployment of AI in your business.
On Wednesday, 24 April, 
Victor Timon, Head of the 
ByrneWallace LLP Technology Group, joined by John Clancy, CEO
of Galvia, and Elaine Burke, journalist and host of the podcast For
Tech's Sake, discussed the implications of Generative AI for
businesses. They explained the nuances of Generative AI, examined
the key risks and how to mitigate them. They also outlined what
should be in your own business's AI Policy and why you need
one.
With the introduction of the EU AI Act in April 2024, being
prepared and informed about Generative AI is more important than
ever.

Large Language Models (LLMs ) are everywhere, but how exactly do they work under the hood? [Miguel Grinberg] provides a great explanation of the inner workings of LLMs in simple (but not simplistic) terms that eschews the low-level mathematics of how they work in favor of laying bare what it is they do.
At their heart, LLMs are prediction machines that work on tokens (small groups of letters and punctuation) and are as a result capable of great feats of human-seeming communication. Most technical-minded people understand that LLMs have no idea what they are saying, and this peek at their inner workings will make that abundantly clear.
Be sure to also review an illustrated guide to how image-generating AIs work. And if a peek under the hood of LLMs left you hungry for more low-level details, check out our coverage of training a GPT-2 LLM using pure C code.

If your query triggers an AI Overview—and not every query will—then you might see an AI-generated summary of this very article at the top of your results. These new AI Overviews in Google Search present users with AI-generated answers to queries that are culled from information on the web, and they’re presented in a way that gives you the answer you seek without ever requiring you to click on a web link or even learn the names of the publications that the AI used as sources.Google has already released a nascent version of AI Overviews within something called the Search Generative Experience, but it was only available to users who opted in. However, at the company’s I/O developer conference this week, Google announced that the newly renamed AI Overviews is now receiving a wider launch; everyone in the US who uses Google to search the web or ask a question will now see AI Overviews at the top of their results—again, if their question can be answered by a summary.Can I Turn Off AI Overviews?What if you’d rather just see web links? Unfortunately, AI Overviews are baked into the default search results page now. You can’t opt out of seeing them in your results.

For other AI Overviews, you have to click Show more to see where the information is coming from.
Google via Reece RogersOne of my core hesitations about this feature as it rolls out is the continued potential for AI hallucinations, more commonly known as lies. When you interact with Google’s Gemini chatbot, a disclaimer at the bottom reads: “Gemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses.” There’s no such disclaimer added to the bottom of the AI Overview, which often simply reads, “Generative AI is experimental.”When asked why there’s no mention of potential hallucinations for AI Overviews, De Leon emphasizes that Google wants to still offer high-quality search results and mentions that the company did adversarial red-teaming tests to uncover potential weak points for the feature.“This implementation of generative AI is rooted in Search’s core quality and safety systems, with built-in guardrails to prevent low-quality or harmful information from surfacing,” she says. “AI Overviews are designed to highlight information that can be easily verified by the supporting information that we surface.”Knowing this, you might still want to click through the webpage links to double-check that the information is actually correct. Though it’s hard to imagine many users, who are often looking for quick answers, will spend extra time reading over the source material for Google’s AI-generated answer.Liz Reid, Google’s head of Search, recently told my colleague Lauren Goode that AI Overviews are expected to arrive for countries outside of the United States before the end of 2024, so over a billion people will likely soon encounter this new feature. As someone whose job relies on readers actually clicking links and spending time reading the articles, of course I’m apprehensive about this change—and I’m not alone.Beyond concerns from publishers, it also remains unclear what additional impacts might trickle down to users from Google’s AI Overviews. Yes, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI tools are quite popular in Silicon Valley tech circles, but this feature will likely expose billions of people, who have never used a chatbot before, to AI-generated text.

Although generative AI is a relatively new technology, it’s already enjoying an insane adoption rate: according to a new study by LinkedIn and Microsoft, some 75 percent of “global knowledge workers” are using it in some way.

LinkedIn and Microsoft’s 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report suggests this adoption (which has nearly doubled in the past six months) comes with a thorny issue for companies everywhere: rather than follow their employers’ protocols when it comes to AI use, many employees are deploying their own AI to help them complete their own tasks. Call it “BYOAI” (Bring Your Own AI), an update of “BYOD” (Bring Your Own Device) which drove IT and corporate cybersecurity professionals crazy for so many years in the 2010s. 

“This approach means missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale. It also puts company data at risk in an environment where leaders’ #1 concern for the year ahead is cybersecurity and data privacy,” the report added.

Compounding the issue: many workers are reluctant to admit they’re using AI to help them with tasks: “Fifty-three percent of people who use AI at work worry that using it on important work tasks makes them look replaceable.”

Of course, Microsoft has an interest in companies everywhere taking a top-down approach to AI adoption—it sells a growing portfolio of AI-powered services, after all. But that aside, it’s true that more workers, including tech pros, are figuring out how AI can impact their workflows, and it behooves managers and executives to figure out how to make that transition as safe and effective as possible.

If you haven’t yet begun to learn about generative AI, there are a variety of online courses that can help you learn about its intricacies, along with certifications to prove your knowledge.

Microsoft Unveils New Generative AI Features for Copilot 365 With Report Showing Everyone is Using AI at Work



Eric Hal Schwartz  on May 13, 2024 at 8:00 am

Microsoft is streamlining the process of writing good prompts for generative AI tools in an update to Copilot for Microsoft 365. The upgraded suite of AI features comes with the release of the newest Work Trend Index report from Microsoft and LinkedIn showing the growing integration of AI into daily work activities, with 75% of surveyed individuals are already using AI tools at work
365 Prompts
Copilot for Microsoft 365 augments the platform with a generative AI assistant throughout the connected Office apps. The new features are designed to streamline the process of crafting effective prompts, a crucial element in leveraging AI tools for content generation and query resolution. With the auto-complete feature, users who ask the AI to “summarize” without additional information will be presented with refined options, such as summarizing the last ten unread emails in their inbox. This addition aims to optimize the user’s interaction with AI by suggesting contextually relevant tasks based on their Office data.



Meanwhile, the new “elaborate your prompt” feature can enhance initial prompts with additional details to improve the AI’s output. This feature is intended to assist users in specifying their requests when interacting with files, ensuring they obtain the most relevant information or action from the AI. Microsoft also plans to introduce a new “Catch Up” chat interface within Copilot for Microsoft 365. This interface will highlight key information such as upcoming meetings and surface relevant documents to aid in meeting preparation, enhancing workplace productivity and efficiency. In addition to these user-facing enhancements, Microsoft will enable Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscribers to create, publish, and manage custom prompts via Copilot Lab. This feature is tailored for use within business teams, facilitating the sharing and standardization of effective AI prompts across colleagues.
“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”
AI At Work
As the Microsoft and LinkedIn Work Trend Index showed, there’s plenty of demand for AI tools in offices. In the survey of 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, LinkedIn hiring trends, and Microsoft 365 data usage, 75% of surveyed individuals are already using AI tools at work, and 78% of these users are bringing personal AI tools into their workplaces, indicating a proactive approach to leveraging AI technologies despite organizational offerings. The survey also identifies a new category of “AI power users,” employees who have fully integrated AI into their workflows to optimize their productivity, reportedly saving an average of 30 minutes per day.
This initiative comes at a crucial time for Microsoft as it seeks to demonstrate the value of its AI investments to shareholders. With a significant 31% revenue increase in its Azure and other cloud services in the recent fiscal quarter, AI services contributed seven percentage points to this growth, underscoring the expanding role of AI in Microsoft’s business strategy.
“AI is redefining work and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky.“It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
Microsoft has been keen to make its Copilot generative AI assistant as widely used as possible, both by users and third-party partners. Ongoing upgrades like implementing the more powerful Deucalion model to power Copilot, along with enhanced features from Copilot Pro, make it clear that Microsoft wants to make its generative AI service the default regardless of the environment where it’s employed.

Young employees propel generative AI adoption in Asia-Pacific

        Approximately 1.1 billion work hours are projected to be impacted annually by AI, and it is the young generation who are driving this trend.

Tech-savvy young employees, dubbed Generation AI, have been driving the adoption of generative AI technologies across Asia-Pacific, presenting new challenges and opportunities for employers.
According to a recent report from Deloitte Insights, titled Generative AI in Asia-Pacific: Young employees lead as employers play catch-up, these young employees have been leveraging AI to save work hours, develop new skills, manage workloads more sustainably, and boost productivity.
The report, which surveyed 11,900 individuals in the region, revealed that Generation AI is significantly impacting workplace dynamics. These employees are at the forefront of AI usage, although only half believe their managers are aware of their AI activities. Furthermore, generative AI is projected to affect nearly 1.1 billion work hours annually, representing 17% of total working hours.
In developing countries, the adoption rates of generative AI surpass those in developed economies by 30%, potentially disrupting traditional technology hierarchies. AI users report saving an average of 6.3 hours per week, which they can reinvest in acquiring new skills. Additionally, 41% of those who benefit from these time savings said it has improved their work-life balance.
Despite these advancements, three-quarters of organisations are reportedly lagging in AI adoption, according to their employees.

Chris Lewin, AI & Data Capability Leader at Deloitte Asia-Pacific, commented, “One of the most exciting aspects of working with generative AI is that across the globe it is happening to everything, everywhere, all at once. What we’ve experienced in the last 12 months is that the challenges faced by our clients in Indonesia or India are almost immediately relevant to teams in Italy and Ireland.”
“One key lesson is that the rapid adoption of AI won’t directly eliminate jobs, but the impact will be felt by organisations that fail to adapt. Their employees and in particular, talent new to the workforce, will be drawn to rival organisations offering AI applications that are capable of redrawing the future of modern work.”

 Now, criminals are taking advantage of AI tools to scrape for personal information and make fake job opportunities even harder to spot.TRENDING STORIES:A full litter box is not a reason to call 911, APD says2 dead, 3 injured after single car crashes at Alpharetta intersection2024 NFL schedule release: Here are the first 3 games for the Atlanta FalconsChannel 2 Consumer Investigator Justin Gray looked into how scammers use sites like Indeed, LinkedIn and Facebook to target people.Jessica Brown got an email from what she thought was Synterex, a well-known medical consulting company.The email said,“We reviewed your resume for the Junior Recruiter at Synterex. We think you could be a good fit for the opportunity.”[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]Brown filled out a few screening questions and got an offer of $30 per hour and health benefits to work from home.Brown needed the money. She has a child and her husband recently suffered a severe stroke.“I was vulnerable at that time,” Brown said. “It was hard for me.”All she had to do, according to the “recruitment” letter was cash a nearly $5,000 check to pay for a mini office, including a laptop.The letter said that if Brown was able to work for the company for a period of 12 to 16 weeks, the materials would automatically become hers.Luckily, a bank spotted the situation as a scam right away. But that’s becoming harder to do because of artificial intelligence.Eva Velasquez is the president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, which saw a 545% increase in reports in one month from December to January. Velasquez said that the quality of the fake checks and letters have gotten better because of AI.“It’s a lucrative scam. It doesn’t take any time and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles so it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those AI-generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails. Crooks use AI to scrape your personal information online, then create and send a targeted attack.The real Synterex said they have been digitally impersonated. The FTC said you should verify the job by visiting the official company website and applying there instead.Syterex issued a statement to Channel 2 Action News, writing:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.Suspected burglars use power drill to break into several Atlanta storage units ©2024 Cox Media Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, corporate risk departments are more likely to have already implemented some GenAI tools, and many more say that they plan to do so in the near future. Nonetheless, like their peers, many risk & fraud professionals are proceeding with caution and showing a bit of concern along with their enthusiasm.Not surprisingly, concerns about GenAI’s well-publicized drawbacks, such as those around inaccuracy or privacy, are what is tamping down this enthusiasm, according to the findings of the Thomson Reuters Institute report, 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services. The report surveyed legal, tax, risk, and government professionals about their feelings about the use of GenAI in their respective industries.In fact, the most focal sentiment expressed by risk & fraud professionals surveyed was hesitance about the introduction of GenAI into their industry: More than one-third of respondents (35%) said they were hesitant, and 18% said they were concerned or fearful. In general, it’s understandable that risk mitigation has become a top priority for corporations.While respondents are hopeful and excited about the future of GenAI, the majority are hesitant.For the industry as a whole, however, even the consideration of GenAI tool adoption is still in its infancy — yet, in many areas, corporate risk & fraud professionals are moving first and faster than other professionals. In the survey, for example, only 23% of all respondents said their organization is actively using or has plans to use GenAI — among risk & fraud professionals alone, it’s 30%. And they are the group most likely to say that they are considering the use of GenAI in the near future (41%, compared to 32% of overall respondents). Indeed, it is very likely that risk & fraud professionals currently are, and will be, the first ones to experience the potential gains and challenges of GenAI use.Finding uses for GenAI in their workMore than 80% of corporate risk & fraud professionals said that they already could think of use cases for GenAI in their work. Almost half (49%) said they were hopeful or excited about the possibilities opened up by GenAI-powered tools, compared to 44% of all respondents.Overall, cost reduction and cost savings, as well as increased efficiency, are the top reasons most survey respondents gave for considering GenAI adoption. And at a time when corporate legal, tax, and risk functions are seeking cost reductions and a further streamlining of work processes, GenAI-powered tools are becoming increasingly attractive to achieve those goals.For risk & fraud professionals, the most often cited potential benefits of using GenAI in their work are around gaining ready access to valuable industry insights and being better able to detect fraud trends — mainly through the use of better GenAI-powered data analytic tools.On the other hand, some corporate risk & fraud professionals shared their peers’ top concerns about GenAI, around the accuracy and reliability of GenAI work products.“While generative AI has the potential to be a useful tool, uncontrolled and unthinking use carries significant risks,” said one general counsel within a corporate risk & fraud department, echoing a widespread concern.Organizationally, risk & fraud professionals tend to be more risk averse; however, regarding the adoption of GenAI tools to aid their day-to-day work, these professionals are at the point of the spear, despite some wariness. Among all survey respondents, more than half (54%) said they believed GenAI should be applied to their work, while just 16% said it should not. Yet, more corporate risk & fraud professionals — almost two-thirds (62%) — said GenAI should be applied to their work.The majority of respondents believe that GenAI should be applied to industry work.Clearly, and despite hesitancies and concerns that mirrored their peers with the impact of AI on the future of professionals, corporate risk & fraud professionals have still moved faster to incorporate GenAI tools and remain at the forefront of leveraging this innovative technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness and enhance their value to the organization.Where do corporate risk & fraud professionals go next with GenAI?So far, corporate risk & fraud professionals are not only ahead of their peers in incorporating GenAI, but also in developing education and training around it. Risk & fraud professionals are nearly twice as likely as other professions in the survey to say they have begun education and training activities surrounding the use of GenAI (38%, compared to just 19% of all respondents).When it comes to employee education or training, corporate risk professionals are ahead of their peers.Indeed, part of the reason for this focus on education and training may be to reduce some of the inflated expectations around what GenAI tools can do.One chief legal officer in a corporate risk & fraud function said the industry hesitance is understandable: “[GenAI] can’t replace human reasoning yet may be relied upon to do so.”However, because corporate risk & fraud specialists will likely be first-past-the-post in routine GenAI use, the perceptions and experiences that these professionals have today are of critical importance, especially when it comes to using AI to manage risks. Indeed, their experiences could well shape the speed and specificity of how organizations approach their own GenAI adoption now and in the near future.You can download a full copy of the Thomson Reuters Institute survey report, 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services here.Thomson Reuters is not a consumer reporting agency and none of its services or the data contained therein constitute a ‘consumer report’ as such term is defined in the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. sec. 1681 et seq.

Co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to leave OpenAI, after role in Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring last year

 OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever is leaving the AI pioneer, and has teased a new project that ‘personally meaningful’ to him.
The departure of Ilya Sutskever was confirmed in a blog post by CEO Sam Altman, who described Sutskever as “easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend.”
It comes months after Sutskever had played a role in the shock firing and rehiring of Sam Altman last November.

Ilya Sutskever departure
Sutskever had been on the board of directors that had fired Altman, and soon after he changed his mind and publicly tweeted that he “deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions”, and would do everything he could to reunite the company.
Altman was soon reinstated and Sutskever was removed from the new board of directors.
However there does not seem to any hard feelings between the two men, with Sutskever tweeting it was his decision to leave OpenAI.
“Ilya and OpenAI are going to part ways,” wrote Sam Altman in the blog post. “This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend. His brilliance and vision are well known; his warmth and compassion are less well known but no less important.”
“OpenAI would not be what it is without him,” Altman added. “Although he has something personally meaningful he is going to go work on, I am forever grateful for what he did here and committed to finishing the mission we started together. I am happy that for so long I got to be close to such genuinely remarkable genius, and someone so focused on getting to the best future for humanity.”
OpenAI is appointing Jakub Pachocki as the new Chief Scientist.
Pachocki has previously served as OpenAI’s director of research and led the development of GPT-4 and OpenAI Five.
“Jakub is also easily one of the greatest minds of our generation; I am thrilled he is taking the baton here,” wrote Altman. “He has run many of our most important projects, and I am very confident he will lead us to make rapid and safe progress towards our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits everyone.”
Sutskever has been a notable figure in the AI industry for year now.
Before cofounding OpenAI, he worked as a researcher at Google Brain, but began his career working with Dr Geoffrey Hinton, one of the so-called “godfathers of AI”.
New project
Meanwhile Ilya Sutskever tweeted that it had been a honour and a privilege to work at OpenAI, but he was going to working on a new project that “is very personally meaningful to me.”


Sutskever’s exit comes a day after OpenAI said on Monday that it would release a new AI model called GPT-4o, that features an improved text, video and audio capabilities, as well as a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface.

Researchers discover that 80% of employees ‘bring their own AI’ to work



By Jill Barth

May 16, 2024 

Data indicates that many employees use AI independently at work. However, business leaders may overlook potential opportunities without a strategic plan outlining how artificial intelligence aligns with overall business strategy.

Microsoft and LinkedIn have jointly unveiled the 2024 Work Trend Index report, titled “AI at work is here. Now comes the hard part.” Based on insights from a survey of 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, LinkedIn labor trends, Microsoft 365 productivity data and input from Fortune 500 clients, the report looks at ways AI reshapes global work dynamics.
The report shows a shift from employers simply endorsing casual AI experimentation to leveraging this new technology to achieve concrete business outcomes. This transition represents a typical challenge encountered amid technological disruptions. “AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chairman and CEO. He says the research is an “opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration—and ultimately business outcomes.”
The study findings also reveal a surge in the adoption of generative AI at work, with professionals increasingly showcasing AI skills on their LinkedIn profiles. Moreover, many leaders emphasize the importance of AI proficiency when hiring. However, despite this momentum, there are concerns about the lack of a clear AI strategy within their organizations, compounded by the influx of employee-introduced AI tools.
The report indicates that nearly 80% of AI users are branching out independently, a trend the survey calls “Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI).” This phenomenon creates a data security risk and causes organizations to miss out on the benefits of strategic AI use at scale.
“AI is redefining work, and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. “It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
HR tech in action
Workforce platform Cornerstone introduced Cornerstone Galaxy, an AI-driven platform designed to enhance workforce agility. Spatial learning elements, an AI-powered talent development assistant, data visualizations and more are meant to pinpoint skills gaps and build workforce readiness.

AWS has rolled out Amazon Q, a generative AI assistant tailored to expedite software development and harness internal data within companies. Alongside this debut, AWS introduced Amazon Q Apps, designed to help employees construct generative AI applications using their organization’s data. Jenni Troutman, director of products and services at AWS Training and Certification, told HRE that Amazon’s “AI-ready” commitment will help to bring more diverse skills to workforce populations around the globe. AWS research shows employers are willing to pay an average of 35% more for human resource workers with AI skills.
After nearly a decade of dedicated service, Al Smith will retire from his role as chief technology officer at iCIMS at the end of the summer. During a transition period, Smith—who leaves behind a legacy of impactful contributions—will continue to serve as an advisor. In the wake of Smith’s retirement announcement, Joseph Benjamin will join iCIMS as its new CTO. Benjamin is poised to collaborate closely with Eric Connors, iCIMS’ chief product officer, who recently gained recognition on HRE’s 2024 Top 100 HR Tech Influencer list.

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

But now, a year later, the question isn’t really whether A.I. is too smart and will take over the world. It’s whether A.I. is too stupid and unreliable to be useful. Consider this week’s announcement from OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, who promised he would unveil “new stuff” that “feels like magic to me.” But it was just a rather routine update that makes ChatGPT cheaper and faster.It feels like another sign that A.I. is not even close to living up to its hype. In my eyes, it’s looking less like an all-powerful being and more like a bad intern whose work is so unreliable that it’s often easier to do the task yourself. That realization has real implications for the way we, our employers and our government should deal with Silicon Valley’s latest dazzling new, new thing. Acknowledging A.I.’s flaws could help us invest our resources more efficiently and also allow us to turn our attention toward more realistic solutions.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Julia Angwin, a contributing Opinion writer and the founder of Proof News, writes about tech policy. You can follow her on Twitter or Mastodon or her personal newsletter.

News Release
Biden-Harris administration announces groundbreaking AI principles for worker well-being
WASHINGTON — The Department of Labor today announced the release of a far-reaching set of principles that provide employers and developers that create and deploy artificial intelligence with guidance for designing and implementing these emerging technologies in ways that enhance job quality and protect workers’ rights.Developed as a result of President Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence(link is external), this initiative underscores the administration's commitment to ensuring AI technologies strengthen worker empowerment and well-being while addressing risks to workers.“Workers must be at the heart of our nation’s approach to AI technology development and use,” said Acting Secretary Julie Su. “These principles announced today reflect the Biden-Harris administration’s belief that, in addition to complying with existing laws, artificial intelligence should also enhance the quality of work and life for all workers. As employers and developers implement these principles, we are determined to create a future where technology serves the needs of people above all.Specifically, the AI principles emphasize ethical development; transparency in its use; meaningful worker engagement in system design, use, governance and oversight; protection of workers’ rights; and use of AI to enhance work.The department remains committed to monitoring AI’s impact on the workforce and partnering with companies, unions, and other stakeholders to protect and empower workers. As part of this effort, the department will soon provide employers and developers with best practices to consider as they implement the AI principles.

NASA has given a new role to David Salvagnini as the agency’s Chief Artificial Intelligence (AI) Officer. This is an addition to his current job as Chief Data Officer. The appointment shows NASA’s commitment to using AI technology responsibly.
AI Helps NASA’s Missions
NASA has been using different AI tools for a long time to support its missions and research projects. AI helps analyze data, find patterns, and develop systems that can work on their own to control spacecraft and aircraft.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, “AI has been used safely at NASA for decades, and as it grows, it can speed up discoveries. It’s important that we stay ahead and use AI responsibly. In this new role, David will lead NASA’s efforts to ensure we use AI responsibly in space and on Earth to benefit everyone.”
Following President’s Orders
Salvagnini’s appointment follows President Biden’s order on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI. In his expanded role, Salvagnini will be responsible for the strategic planning and vision for how NASA uses AI across the agency.
Promoting AI Innovation
Salvagnini will champion AI innovation at NASA. He will support the development and risk management of AI tools, platforms, and training. NASA will continue to work with other government agencies, universities, industry partners, and experts to stay at the forefront of AI technology.
Experienced Leader
Salvagnini joined NASA in June 2023 after over 20 years of leadership in technology for the intelligence community. Before NASA, he was the chief architect and director of a group at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Salvagnini has led research, development, engineering, and operations for data, IT, and AI programs. He served in the Air Force for 21 years as a communications and computer systems officer.
AI for Space Exploration
NASA is developing ways to use emerging AI technology for its goals and missions. AI can help analyze images from Earth science, search for data on planets outside our solar system, schedule communications for Mars rovers, and more.
Before Salvagnini, NASA’s Chief Scientist Kate Calvin served as the acting official for responsible AI. With Salvagnini leading AI efforts, NASA aims to embrace new technology responsibly for space exploration and scientific discoveries that benefit humanity.
