Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up decision-making and other HR processes, such as recruitment, work allocation, management decisions and dismissals. The types of decision-making AI is performing in the workplace include:Profiling: using algorithms to categorise data and find correlations between data sets. This can be used to make predictions about individuals; for example, by collecting data on employees to predict and/or conclude they are not meeting targets, potentially leading to capability proceedings or dismissals. Automated decision-making (ADM): where AI is used to make a decision, without human intervention. For example, where a job candidate is required to undertake a personality questionnaire as part of a recruitment process and is automatically rejected on the basis of their scoring. Machine learning: where machines are taught, using algorithms, to imitate intelligent human behaviour. For example, image recognition, which can be used in assessing candidates’ performance in video interviews. Discrimination risk The use of AI in employment brings the risk of ‘algorithmic discrimination’. As the algorithms behind AI are created by humans, they can reflect the biases of their designers. Employers should ensure their use of AI is not falling foul of the Equality Act 2010, which prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics. The ‘decisions’ of the AI software and the underlying data used within it should, therefore, be checked to ensure any apparent discrimination is picked up, or mistakes made by the software (such as disregarding relevant factors) corrected.
An example of the danger of biases embedded within AI software is a case involving Uber, which has been subject to an employment tribunal claim brought by one of its former UK drivers on the basis that its facial recognition software did not work as well with people of colour and resulted in the claimant’s account being wrongly deactivated. Another example of AI making headlines related to Amazon, which had to scrap its AI recruitment tool after it was found to prefer male over female candidates. This was because the data that the software was analysing to make recruitment decisions was based on previous successful candidates, the majority of whom were male because the tech industry is male dominated. In this example, a female candidate could bring an indirect discrimination claim, as the algorithm places her at a substantial disadvantage because of her sex. To defend such a claim, the employer would need to show the use of the technology was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. While the use of technology to streamline the recruitment process may be a legitimate aim, it is difficult to see how such a tool, which can have such significant implications for a prospective employee, can be a proportionate means of achieving that aim without any human oversight. Another issue with AI is where the responsibility for the decisions made lies. For example, it is clear a manager in charge of hiring workers will be subject to anti-discrimination duties in law, but who is held responsible when AI software introduces discrimination into the decision-making process of the employer? The answer to this remains unclear. Data protectionAlthough there is currently no employment legislation preventing or limiting the use of AI in the workplace, data protection law provides some protection for individuals who may find themselves subject to AI decisions.Article 22 of the UK GDPR contains provisions aimed to protect individuals from both automated decision-making and profiling by limiting the use of such processes and placing safeguarding requirements on organisations seeking to use them. However, in September last year the government signalled it might repeal article 22 as part of its proposed changes to the UK data protection regime, so these protections may wane.Possible reformThe EU published a proposal for regulation on AI last year, aiming to address the risks of its use, particularly in areas that have a significant impact on individual lives. It suggested that AI involved in employment decisions should be classified as ‘high risk’ and therefore subject to specific safeguards. It is unclear whether such regulation would be mirrored in the UK if enacted in the EU. In May 2021, the TUC and the AI Consultancy published a report that put forward wide-ranging suggestions for reform, including changing the burden of proof in discrimination claims that seek to challenge AI or ADM systems in the workplace so the employer will have to disprove discrimination (as opposed to the employee proving it). It also called for statutory guidance on steps that may be taken to avoid discrimination where AI is used.AI will undoubtedly continue to drive significant innovation in the world of work. The Office for Artificial Intelligence is expected to set out the UK’s national position on regulating AI soon. It will be interesting to see what proposals are put forward relevant to the workplace. In the meantime, employers should remain vigilant to minimise the risk of claims and retain a degree of human involvement in their processes.Georgia Roberts is an associate and Özlem Mehmet a professional support lawyer in the employment department at Kingsley Napley

Have you ever seen a puppy in a nest emerging from a cracked egg? What about a photo that’s overlooking a steampunk city with airships? Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models — Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches. We want to share a little more about how these models work and their potential.




How text-to-image models workWith text-to-image models, people provide a text description and the models produce images matching the description as closely as possible. This can be something as simple as “an apple” or “a cat sitting on a couch” to more complex details, interactions and descriptive indicators like “a cute sloth holding a small treasure chest. A bright golden glow is coming from the chest.”









In the past few years, ML models have been trained on large image datasets with corresponding textual descriptions, resulting in higher quality images and a broader range of descriptions. This has sparked major breakthroughs in this area, including Open AI’s DALL-E 2.




How Imagen and Parti workImagen and Parti build on previous models. Transformer models are able to process words in relationship to one another in a sentence. They are foundational to how we represent text in our text-to-image models. Both models also use a new technique that helps generate images that more closely match the text description. While Imagen and Parti use similar technology, they pursue different, but complementary strategies.Imagen is a Diffusion model, which learns to convert a pattern of random dots to images. These images first start as low resolution and then progressively increase in resolution. Recently, Diffusion models have seen success in both image and audio tasks like enhancing image resolution, recoloring black and white photos, editing regions of an image, uncropping images, and text-to-speech synthesis.Parti’s approach first converts a collection of images into a sequence of code entries, similar to puzzle pieces. A given text prompt is then translated into these code entries and a new image is created. This approach takes advantage of existing research and infrastructure for large language models such as PaLM and is critical for handling long, complex text prompts and producing high-quality images.These models have many limitations. For example, neither can reliably produce specific counts of objects (e.g. “ten apples”), nor place them correctly based on specific spatial descriptions (e.g. “a red sphere to the left of a blue block with a yellow triangle on it”). Also, as prompts become more complex, the models begin to falter, either missing details or introducing details that were not provided in the prompt. These behaviors are a result of several shortcomings, including lack of explicit training material, limited data representation, and lack of 3D awareness. We hope to address these gaps through broader representations and more effective integration into the text-to-image generation process.




Taking a responsible approach to Imagen and PartiText-to-image models are exciting tools for inspiration and creativity. They also come with risks related to disinformation, bias and safety. We’re having discussions around Responsible AI practices and the necessary steps to safely pursue this technology. As an initial step, we’re using easily identifiable watermarks to ensure people can always recognize an Imagen- or Parti-generated image. We’re also conducting experiments to better understand biases of the models, like how they represent people and cultures, while exploring possible mitigations. The Imagen and Parti papers provide extensive discussion of these issues.




What’s next for text-to-image models at GoogleWe will push on new ideas that combine the best of both models, and expand to related tasks such as adding the ability to interactively generate and edit images through text. We’re also continuing to conduct in-depth comparisons and evaluations to align with our Responsible AI Principles. Our goal is to bring user experiences based on these models to the world in a safe, responsible way that will inspire creativity.

Artificial Intelligence not expected to lead to net job losses - study





Updated / Thursday, 23 Jun 2022 07:18































There are concerns that automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment as machines take over jobs once done by humans












By Brian O'Donovan

Work & Technology Correspondent







A report from a Government advisory group has found that net job losses are not expected as a result of the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs said many jobs will change as certain tasks are taken over by AI and that the technology has the potential to bring substantial productivity increases.
It comes amid concerns that automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment as machines take over jobs once done by humans.
Minister for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation Robert Troy has welcomed the publication of the report.
It highlights the need for everyone, regardless of whether they work in tech or not, to have some level of knowledge and understanding of AI.
""The report finds that AI is not likely to bring about a net loss of jobs, but it will replace certain tasks within many jobs over time,"" Mr Troy said.
""Thus, there is a need for both organisations and individuals to identify where AI will impact their job or their sector and prepare by seeking out the necessary education and training.""
The study focused on four cohorts or groups, identifying skills needs not only for AI developers and experts, but also for public sector employees, for teachers and educators, and for the general public.
It recommends that the curriculum taught by computer science teachers evolves with AI developments.
The report also calls for the development of new apprenticeships in AI and for the promotion of free online AI course for citizens.
The expert group advises the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that affect Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.

Distinct but not detached.
That’s how Assistant Professor of Economics Ekaterina “Kate” Seregina thinks of the 2008 recession, the coronavirus, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Those three events, while separate, are inextricably linked. They all impacted the global economy, and Seregina wants to compare how those impacts differ.
But existing modeling techniques are limited. Utilizing artificial intelligence, Seregina has built her own version of traditional analytical and modeling tools, unlocking the ways that economists can more accurately analyze complex relationships.
Seregina’s work at Colby is an example of how artificial intelligence and machine learning are being incorporated across the economics curriculum, said Amanda Stent, inaugural director of Colby’s Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. She also cited the work of Herbert E. Wadsworth 1892 Professor of Economics Michael Donihue, Associate Professor of Economics Dan LaFave, Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics Ben Scharadin, and others.
“Their work to incorporate techniques from and discussions about machine learning and AI across the economics curriculum will help students acquire a more critical understanding and deeper ability to model data for decision-making,” Stent said, noting that economics students have approached the Davis Institute to talk about AI more than any other major. “Through my experience in industry, I have seen firsthand the relevance of machine learning to finance, economics, and public policy.”
Originally from Russia, Seregina joined Colby in 2020 with a background in statistics and machine learning from her advanced econometrics Ph.D. program at the University of California, Riverside. In pursuing econometrics—a blend of economics and statistics—Seregina found herself using graphical models for complex datasets.
A graphical model is a type of optimization tool used across disciplines, from biology to mathematics. These models help to demonstrate that behavior is best predicted not by examining drives, attitudes, or demographic characteristics, but instead by looking at complex webs of connections. In economics, a graphical model can help estimate how different entities, such as financial institutions in the global economy, may affect each other during and following global or regional events. But such models are limited for economists, Seregina said, making them less widely used, despite their capacity to model large datasets.
Current graphical models can’t account for how connections between individual entities, such as various banks, change over time, Seregina explained, as the economy is not static. Traditional models also can’t distinguish between economic fluctuations that only apply to certain companies or industries, as opposed to all of them. 
“Through my experience in industry, I have seen firsthand the relevance of machine learning to finance, economics, and public policy.”Amanda Stent, Director of the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence
To address these flaws, Seregina is developing a new approach. Her proposed Factor Graphical model integrates graphical modeling with the factor structure to help account for common mistakes in forecasting and the relationships between entities. Taking into account these aspects incorporates AI and machine learning techniques.
Seregina is currently employing her augmented model to study the implications of the recession of 2008, the coronavirus, and the war in Ukraine on the macroeconomy and, separately, on corporate portfolios. The augmented model can better illustrate the impacts of the pandemic, for example, on relationships among firms, which is helpful for macroeconomic forecasts and shareholder decisions. For the latter, the information derived from these relationships can be used to detect stocks or portfolios most sensitive to changes and help investors select mutual funds that may perform the best. 
Ultimately, spreading more awareness of the power of graphical tools—and her augmentation— is key. Seregina was recently invited to write a chapter on graphical models for the forthcoming book Econometrics with Machine Learning published in Springer’s Advanced Studies in Theoretical and Applied Econometrics series. This work is aimed at helping theoretical and applied econometricians as well as graduate students promote the use of machine learning in their scholarship.
In the fall, Seregina will teach a new senior seminar on financial technology, the first of its kind at Colby. Using a grant from the Davis Institute, she developed a curriculum that includes topics such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, machine learning, and AI for finance. 
“Most schools don’t offer these courses in person,” Seregina added. “[They’re] usually offered online, as part of an M.B.A. program. So I think it’s really unique that we get a chance to offer something like that.”
For Seregina, developing improved graphical models is only the beginning. Drawn to Colby for its close-knit learning community, she aspires to mentor and bring students to the forefront of her work.
In her first year at Colby, Seregina hired Yaoyao “Chris” Zhu ’22 as a research assistant and has plans to hire more. “I learned a lot about applying neural network models to real-life data, which will benefit me with my career in economics consulting,” said Zhu, a computer science and economics double major. “In the future, I hope to use my machine learning and AI skills in finance to create innovative approaches to financial modeling.”
