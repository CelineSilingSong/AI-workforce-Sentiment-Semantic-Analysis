Michaila Hancock reports.Worldwide, landslides cause thousands of deaths and injuries and cost billions of pounds of damage every year. The most common ones are induced by rainfall, often transforming into fast-moving debris flows, causing devastation for those who live in mountainous areas.In its 2019 AI Impact Challenge, Google asked non-profit organisations, social enterprises and research institutions across the globe how they would use artificial intelligence (AI) for social good.It was this call that urged Pennsylvania State University associate professor of civil and environmental engineering Chaopeng Shen to build on his initial idea.“We had a good idea that was looking for such an opportunity,” says Shen, who is also the principal investigator of deepLDB, one of 20 projects awarded funding by Google.“Rainfall-induced landslides are a huge risk for people who live in mountainous areas, and we thought there was a possibility to use AI to better forecast them.”  Shen says that many of these events go unreported, complicating efforts to study and eventually predict them.“Most of the information comes from news reports, and there are a lot of missing events,” Shen says. “In order for us to better forecast landslides, we need to start with a good landslide database.”An example of how Google Earth images are used to identify landslide zonesTraining AIWith the availability of satellite images from Google Earth, past landslides could be identified from space. However, to populate a database would require a lot of work, and this is where the AI comes in.“The first goal of our work was to produce an artificial intelligence method to identify these events from the satellite images,” Shen says. “Once the AI is trained – when it can determine what’s a landslide and what’s not – we can apply it to a very large area, and it will automatically find the places with a suspected event.”At the start of the project, Shen and his Pennsylvania State University co-investigators, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering Tong Qiu and associate professor of computer science Daniel Kifer, were provided with an initial data set of known rainfall-induced landslides by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  After finding the landslide events in Google Earth, they used the satellite images as training examples in a process called “supervised learning”.“It’s basically object identification,” Shen says. “By looking at the satellite images over time, you get a sense that there might have been an event because the scene changed dramatically. Most of the visual cues come from the vegetation.”Over time, the AI began recognising the cues it could use to identify a landslide, but it also needed to spot the differences from other occurrences, too. The shape of a disturbance might have indicated a landslide, but it could also have been from a wildfire, an excavated mine or a demolished building.“It has to be able to differentiate the real signals from the noise,” Shen says. “What’s a rainfall-induced landslide, and what’s not?”After a year of training, Shen says the model is now correctly identifying a landslide 97% of the time, but he emphasises more training examples are still needed especially in different landscapes.Data verificationThe researchers have set up a portal (www.deepldb.org) where people can help to verify potential landslides identified by the AI, or even upload and label their own Google Earth images.“If an aerial image of a landslide is not from an area we’ve been focused on, they can help us correct it,” Shen says. “The more data we have, the more accurate the model will be.”According to Shen, the level of precision in the database is what sets deepLDB apart, and it allows them to start moving on to the second goal of the project - prediction.“I think we're 90% way through the first phase, in that the models that we've trained are working,” says Shen.  “We're gradually opening it up to the public, so they can help provide us with more information and then we're utilising that information for prediction.”He adds that work has recently begun on the prediction model. The team has worked with Google AI experts to find the best way to build the AI as it looks for patterns in the growing database.Chaopeng Shen, Pennsylvania State University associate professor of civil and environmental engineering“We have some models being put together, and they are giving us some interesting results, but still a lot of work is needed,” Shen says.“We hope people will join, help label events and help add more data onto our platform. It allows them to upload images and label them and then run our model to automatically pick out the possible cases where there's a landslide. It greatly reduces the effort level.“Previously, if you were to identify these from space, it's very painful, because these are very small features, and you have to look very closely.“Landslides are not there most of the time for most places, and it's a very small portion of places where you have landslides you can see. It becomes quite a straining effort to try to identify these from satellite images.“Our model can do a bulk of the effort for the users; it reduces 90% of the effort and makes it much, much more sustainable.”Affected communitiesThe third phase of the project is to make use of the model, says Shen. This involves getting in touch with the stakeholders, including those who live within the communities affected by landslides.“Basically, making the model useful by actually connecting with the communities that are influenced by landslides, and let them chip in. Let them know about it,” adds Shen.He explains that they are already in touch with a community from Darjeeling in north India.“They live on the southern slope of the Himalayas. They have had big landslides that destroyed the road, which means a few months without communication with the outside world,” says Shen.“We hope to bring their data into our system and try to learn from it. And to see if we can help them, to the best of our capacity.”PredictionShen says that he will be publishing a paper on the project and its results later this year.“The next step is to use AI to associate the events in the database with rainfall and other local conditions to try to predict what’s going to happen next,” Shen says.“The novel aspect of the project is we have a very high spatial accuracy, meaning we know exactly where these events are.“With this kind of precision, we can overlay the events with other data sets like soil texture and elevation and find out some of the fundamental reasons why it happens in one area and not the other. Or why yesterday and not the day before.”Shen adds: “Prediction is a big problem worldwide in both developing and developed countries. It is a very difficult problem, and we know that people are far from nailing it.“The folks that I’ve worked with at Google and their philanthropic organisation, Google.org, really want to create some positive impacts in the world. When we work with them, we truly feel that they are really good people trying to make an impact on the world.”ContactChaopeng Shen can be reached at cshen@engr.psu.edu or via his Twitter account @ChaopengShenWant to read more?

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has created computers that can drive cars, synthesize chemical compounds, fold proteins and detect high-energy particles at a superhuman level.
However, these AI algorithms cannot explain the thought processes behind their decisions. A computer that masters protein folding and also tells researchers more about the rules of biology is much more useful than a computer that folds proteins without explanation.
Therefore, AI researchers like me are now turning our efforts toward developing AI algorithms that can explain themselves in a manner that humans can understand. If we can do this, I believe that AI will be able to uncover and teach people new facts about the world that have not yet been discovered, leading to new innovations.



When machines are left to learn and solve problems through their own experience, this is called reinforcement learning.

Learning from experience
One field of AI, called reinforcement learning, studies how computers can learn from their own experiences. In reinforcement learning, an AI explores the world, receiving positive or negative feedback based on its actions.
This approach has led to algorithms that have independently learned to play chess at a superhuman level and prove mathematical theorems without any human guidance. In my work as an AI researcher, I use reinforcement learning to create AI algorithms that learn how to solve puzzles such as the Rubik’s Cube. 
Through reinforcement learning, AIs are independently learning to solve problems that even humans struggle to figure out. This has got me and many other researchers thinking less about what AI can learn and more about what humans can learn from AI. A computer that can solve the Rubik’s Cube should be able to teach people how to solve it, too.
Peering into the black box
Unfortunately, the minds of superhuman AIs are currently out of reach to us humans. AIs make terrible teachers and are what we in the computer science world call “black boxes.”



Researchers have been trying for decades to understand how AIs solve problems.

A black-box AI simply spits out solutions without giving reasons for its solutions. Computer scientists have been trying for decades to open this black box, and recent research has shown that many AI algorithms actually do think in ways that are similar to humans. For example, a computer trained to recognize animals will learn about different types of eyes and ears and will put this information together to correctly identify the animal. 
The effort to open up the black box is called explainable AI. My research group at the AI Institute at the University of South Carolina is interested in developing explainable AI. To accomplish this, we work heavily with the Rubik’s Cube. 
The Rubik’s Cube is basically a pathfinding problem: Find a path from point A – a scrambled Rubik’s Cube – to point B – a solved Rubik’s Cube. Other pathfinding problems include navigation, theorem proving and chemical synthesis. 
My lab has set up a website where anyone can see how our AI algorithm solves the Rubik’s Cube; however, a person would be hard-pressed to learn how to solve the cube from this website. This is because the computer cannot tell you the logic behind its solutions.
Solutions to the Rubik’s Cube can be broken down into a few generalized steps – the first step, for example, could be to form a cross while the second step could be to put the corner pieces in place. While the Rubik’s Cube itself has over 10 to the 19th power possible combinations, a generalized step-by-step guide is very easy to remember and is applicable in many different scenarios. 
Approaching a problem by breaking it down into steps is often the default manner in which people explain things to one another. The Rubik’s Cube naturally fits into this step-by-step framework, which gives us the opportunity to open the black box of our algorithm more easily. Creating AI algorithms that have this ability could allow people to collaborate with AI and break down a wide variety of complex problems into easy-to-understand steps.



A step-by-step refinement approach can make it easier for humans to understand why AIs do the things they do.

Collaboration leads to innovation
Our process starts with using one’s own intuition to define a step-by-step plan thought to potentially solve a complex problem. The algorithm then looks at each individual step and gives feedback about which steps are possible, which are impossible and ways the plan could be improved. The human then refines the initial plan using the advice from the AI, and the process repeats until the problem is solved. The hope is that the person and the AI will eventually converge to a kind of mutual understanding.
[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]
Currently, our algorithm is able to consider a human plan for solving the Rubik’s Cube, suggest improvements to the plan, recognize plans that do not work and find alternatives that do. In doing so, it gives feedback that leads to a step-by-step plan for solving the Rubik’s Cube that a person can understand. Our team’s next step is to build an intuitive interface that will allow our algorithm to teach people how to solve the Rubik’s Cube. Our hope is to generalize this approach to a wide range of pathfinding problems. 
People are intuitive in a way unmatched by any AI, but machines are far better in their computational power and algorithmic rigor. This back and forth between man and machine utilizes the strengths from both. I believe this type of collaboration will shed light on previously unsolved problems in everything from chemistry to mathematics, leading to new solutions, intuitions and innovations that may have, otherwise, been out of reach.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to rapidly expand and make a big impact on the workplace. Yann LeCun is one of the original creators of AI technology, as he is now a highly respected professor at New York University and is also the Chief AI Scientist at Facebook. LeCun also won the Association for Computing Machinery A.M. Turing Award, which is often considered the “Nobel Prize of Computing.” Recently, LeCun was interviewed about the history of artificial intelligence, as he played a critical role in working with others to develop this innovative technology.
Yann is most well-known for his work in computer vision at Bell Labs by using convolutional neural networks to perform a wide range of activities. For example, this technology allows banks to automatically read checks, provides facial recognition to unlock phones, uses speech recognition to perform searches, and it can even detect tumors through medical imagery. Yann believes that artificial intelligence is specialized to perform a variety of actions to make the world a better place. 






 
The Origin of AI
Understanding what is artificial intelligence is important for anyone interested in the history of this technology. Initially, the concept of AI technology began in the 1940s, as Alan Turing set the foundation for traditional computer science with his innovative research. The first artificial neuron was also proposed by Water Pitts and Warren McCulloch, as they believed that the actions of neurons could be viewed as a computation, which allowed the circuits of neurons to perform logical reasoning.
During this time, researchers also worked on cybernetics, which is essentially the science of how each part of a system communicates with each other. This idea created the term “autopoiesis,” which is a system capable of maintaining and reproducing itself while also learning, regulating, and adapting to its environment. All of this research created a significant amount of interest in this field.
Marvin Minsky (co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AI laboratory) and John McCarthy (co-founder of the Stanford AI Laboratory) organized a conference at Dartmouth College with the help of a couple of scientists at IBM in 1956. This conference gave an opportunity for Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon to debut Logic Theorist, which was a computer program engineered to perform automated reasoning. Ultimately, the term “artificial intelligence” was born, as this conference played a pivotal role in artificial intelligence history and future.
 
1960s-1980s: Understanding the Limitations of AI
The academic community was eventually split into two categories for the next twenty years, as one focused on biology and the human brain while others drew more inspiration from mathematics. Initially, no one was working on what we consider machine learning in the early 1980s, which was when Yann began his career. However, the field gained new interest in 1986 with a paper titled “Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors,” which was published in the Nature Journal. This paper highlighted the potential success of neural network applications and the learning algorithm for backpropagation. However, this excitement was eventually lessened as research found that only a few applications could be solved due to the extensive amount of data that needed to be trained properly. Data was much more expensive during that time, as it couldn’t be easily obtained from open-source data sets or internet archives like today.
 
1990s-2010s: Lack of Development
The history of artificial intelligence during the 1990s through 2010s was known as the “black period” due to the lack of development. Neural nets were ignored and often mocked by other professionals. Yann eventually stopped working on neural nets in 1996 and didn’t return until after 2002. Anyone that clung to neural nets was often viewed as marginal crazy people due to the lack of understanding in the field. 
However, Yann believed that neural networks would eventually be vindicated over time. The limitation of traditional methods for computational was often due to the reliance on front-end hand engineering, while deep learning on convolutional neural nets was much more efficient. In other words, hand-engineered features are designed by very smart people, while a backpropagation algorithm uses data to create the “feature extractors” to fit each task as efficiently as possible. 
This realization of the benefits of artificial intelligence took researchers in the community over twenty years to understand, as Yann believes that the adoption of this technology took longer due to satisfaction of pitting your wits against a problem without the assistance of a machine. However, relegating yourself to a “machine coach” is often a humbling yet very sold decision.
Another way to consider the long-term trends of AI technology is that it initially began with intelligent people focusing on specific tasks that proved successful within the abstract world of which they were created. However, AI technology uses intelligence shaped by empirical evidence that’s fully formed with a specific set of axioms. One of the most interesting challenges of AI is the ability to match “common sense” and the learning ability of a toddler instead of creating synthetic versions of a chess grandmaster.
 
2012: AI Becomes Mainstream
Geoffrey Hinton and Li Deng introduced the use of deep feedforward, non-recurrent networks to recognize speech in late 2009. Neural networks eventually came back in the academic spotlight in October 2012 due to the impressive benchmarks from AlexNet and other submissions to the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge at the European Conference on Computer Vision and the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge. Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng also programmed a computer cluster in 2012 to train itself to recognize images. Later in the fall of 2012, the New York Times cited Dr. Richard F. Rashid’s presentation with Microsoft that highlighted the potential of deep learning with the translation of Mandarin.
Yann also notes that the build-up of neural networks being embraced goes several years back due to the innovative work of several pioneers in the field. Artificial intelligence examples include Yoshua Bengio’s text prediction in the early 2000s and Pascal Vicent’s work with using denoising autoencoders. Jason Weston and Ronan Collobert also played a key role in their work at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton with their 2011 paper that focused on the “Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch.”
 
2013-2017: Significant Advancements in AI Technology
The year 2012 was pivotal in the development of AI technology. All of these recent advancements began to snowball and made a significant impact on artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, Tomas Mikolov, with the help of his colleagues at Google, developed Word2vec, which is an innovative method for learning a representation of words that do not require labeled data while also allowing NLP systems to overlook spelling and focus more on semantics. This AI technology also made it much easier to train multilingual systems, which is especially helpful for speakers of “low-resource” languages to access volumes of information that others take for granted.
Ilya Sutskever published the “Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks” in 2014, as it described a method of creating multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) system that’s suited for tasks such as summarization and automated translation. Dzmitry Bahdanau also published the “Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate” in 2015. A few months later, Google, Microsoft, Facebook all had translation systems that were based on recurrent neural networks. Researchers at Google also proposed a more simple network architecture in 2017 that was solely based on attention mechanisms with their paper “Attention is All You Need.” The use of funny titles is always popular in AI research, as many recent papers include names for Sesame Street characters.
While it took decades for gifted researchers to explore very different approaches, which were often focused on narrow application areas or even on abstract problems, we have finally reached a point that uses a data-driven approach to highlight the value in all types of practical domains. The use of AI theorists will still be needed, but using real-world data has been a critical ingredient in getting all of the answers to apply to real problems.
 
Latest Developments in Artificial Intelligence
Neural networks will continue to be refined and used in a variety of new and exciting ways. Yann believes that the work of Francois Charton and Guillaume Lample in a recent paper shows how each system is surprisingly adept at mathematics, as these problems used to be a particular area of weakness for neural networks. One of the most important advancements in using AI technology isn’t in the research by itself, but it’s how the research is conducted. Now it is perfectly normal for industrial research labs to publish papers that include the code and data to produce the results, instead of being listed internally as a trade secret. This openness in the AI field makes it much easier for other artificial intelligence companies to work together.
Ultimately, Yann believes that this openness with other AI companies will accelerate the development of this technology. For example, Google may publish a new technique, and within a few months, Facebook will make an improvement on it. Similarly, Google may make another improvement, as all of these advancements add up and create a culture of providing “reproducible research” to help spread advancement. This new cultural norm is also spreading in other sciences, as this will benefit everyone in helping to develop new technology.
Self-supervised learning is another exciting development for AI companies. Yann believes that AI technology can transform the health care industry and improve the entire world by making it easier to meet the needs of patients. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to play a key role in the development of new technology while also improving upon existing structures. The world of artificial intelligence will only continue to expand as more companies work with each other in the development of this tech.
 
Closing Thoughts
Understanding artificial intelligence history and the latest developments are essential for anyone interested in how this technology will continue to shape the world. The use of AI technology has rapidly evolved compared to only a few years ago. AI companies will continue to research and find new ways to take advantage of this technology. The rise of AI technology will impact all types of industries, whether it’s in the healthcare field, manufacturing, education, transportation, media, banking, and much more.
The one constant in the world of AI technology is change, as the biggest tech companies look at new ways to utilize this technology and improve their business operations. Today’s work environment is extremely competitive, as utilizing AI technology is essential in gaining an edge over other businesses while also better meeting the needs of customers. 
AI technology will continue to become even more widespread, whether it’s autonomous cars transporting people from place to place or AI-powered robots working alongside humans to manufacture products. The use of AI technology can also assist nurses in monitoring patients while also identifying any potential signs of disease. The world of education will also continue to be impacted by AI, as more textbooks become digitized with the use of AI technology, and virtual tutors can help assist human instructors.
All of these exciting changes will make a big impact on day-to-day life now and in the near future in a wide range of sectors. Learning about the impact of AI technology is a great way to stay up to date with these evolving trends. AI companies will continue to find ways to improve upon this existing technology, as the future looks bright with the ever-increasing advancement of AI technology.

These fall comprehensively into three categories: job loss, ethical issues, and criminal use..More than one-quarter (27%) of all employees state they are stressed that the work they have now will be disposed of within the next five years because of new innovation, robots or artificial intelligence, as indicated by the quarterly CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workplace Happiness review..In certain industries where technology already has played a profoundly disruptive role, employees fear of automation likewise run higher than the normal: Workers in automotives, business logistics and support, marketing and advertising, and retail are proportionately more stressed over new technology replacing their jobs than those in different industries..42% of workers in the logistics industry have better than expected worries about new technology replacing their jobs. The dread stems from the fact that the business is already witnessing it. Self-driving trucks already are compromising the jobs of truck drivers, and it is causing a huge frenzy in this job line..In a new paper published in the Findings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Assistant Professor Xiang Ren and PhD understudy Yuchen Lin at the University of Southern California found that notwithstanding critical advances AI actually doesn't have the common sense required to create conceivable sentences. As Lin disclosed to Science Daily, &quot;Current machine text-generation models can compose an article that might be persuasive to numerous people, yet they're essentially mirroring what they have found in the training stage&quot;..Where these models fizzled was in depicting regular situations. Given the words dogs, frisbee, toss, and catch, one model concocted the sentence &quot;Two dogs are tossing frisbees at one another.&quot; Nothing incorrect in that aside from that it misses what we know through common sense, viz that a canine can't toss frisbees..Another study of Blumberg Capital of 1,000 American adults found that about half are prepared to accept new tech, while the other half are frightened it will remove their jobs. One surprising finding: Most individuals (72%) comprehend that A.I. is proposed to remove the exhausting, dull parts of what they do, freeing them to concentrate on more perplexing and intriguing tasks. All things considered, 81% are so fearful of being supplanted that they're reluctant to surrender their drudge work to an algorithm..When AI dispenses with jobs (all the more precisely, the requirement for them), there is the undeniable loss of pay. This implies less disposable income and a decrease in spending on nice-to-have goods and luxuries. Less demand compels costs to drop. If costs dip under a level where commodity margins are threatened, the organization and at last the business, will crease..Costs of fundamental products will keep on dropping, however contracting margins are somewhat offset by diminishing operational costs (on account of AI-driven automation). Food costs, for instance, could go down..Society overall should then wrestle with the more profound social, financial, and mental consequences of permanent net job losses caused by AI. In reassurance, the deficiency of jobs without (hopefully) loss of lifestyle should give us the time and opportunity to consider these issues..Sociologists will be compelled to rethink and re-plan their models of human association and organization. Financial specialists will be compelled to reevaluate incentives and agency relationships. Politicians will be compelled to create a new manner of speaking for their platforms when the customary political posturings will get moot. Schools will be compelled to battle with a deschooled society..In any case, the day isn't far, caution the analysts, when AI agents will create more commonsensical responses. Already media startups for example, Knowhere and Patch have incorporated AI into their working and even legacy newspapers are fusing a few components of it into their day-to-day working. However, an opinion piece is still some way off..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Their behavior, intonation, and speech is fed to an algorithm that assigns certain traits and qualities.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIHireVue says that an “algorithmic audit” of its software conducted last year shows it does not harbor bias. But the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center had filed a complaint against the company with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019.HireVue CEO Kevin Parker acknowledges that public outcry over the use of software to analyze facial expressions in video was part of the calculation. “It was adding some value for customers, but it wasn’t worth the concern,” he says.AdvertisementThe algorithmic audit was performed by an outside firm, O’Neil Risk Consulting and Algorithmic Auditing. The company did not respond to requests for comment.Alex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied AI hiring, says the idea of using AI to determine someone’s ability, whether it is based on video, audio, or text, is far-fetched. He says it is also problematic that the public cannot vet such claims.“There are parts that machine learning can probably help with, but fully automated interviews, where you’re making inferences about job performance—that’s terrible,” he says. “Modern artificial intelligence can’t make those inferences.”“Fully automated interviews, where you’re making inferences about job performance—that’s terrible.”Alex Engler, fellow, Brookings InstitutionHireVue says that about 700 companies, including GE, Unilever, Delta, and Hilton, use its technology. The software requires job applicants to respond to a series of questions in a recorded video. The company’s software then analyzes various characteristics including the language they use, their speech, and, until now, their facial expressions. It then provides an assessment of the applicant’s suitability for a job, as well as a measure of traits including “dependability,” “emotional intelligence,” and “cognitive ability.”Parker says the company helped screen more than 6 million videos last year, although sometimes this involved simply transcribing answers for an interviewer rather than performing an automated assessment of candidates.

Job seekers screened by HireVue sit in front of a webcam and answer questions. Their behavior, intonation, and speech is fed to an algorithm that assigns certain traits and qualities.
HireVue says that an “algorithmic audit” of its software conducted last year shows it does not harbor bias. But the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center had filed a complaint against the company with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019.
HireVue CEO Kevin Parker acknowledges that public outcry over the use of software to analyze facial expressions in video was part of the calculation. “It was adding some value for customers, but it wasn’t worth the concern,” he says.
The algorithmic audit was performed by an outside firm, O’Neil Risk Consulting and Algorithmic Auditing. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
Alex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied AI hiring, says the idea of using AI to determine someone’s ability, whether it is based on video, audio, or text, is far-fetched. He says it is also problematic that the public cannot vet such claims.
“There are parts that machine learning can probably help with, but fully automated interviews, where you’re making inferences about job performance—that’s terrible,” he says. “Modern artificial intelligence can’t make those inferences.”
HireVue says that about 700 companies, including GE, Unilever, Delta, and Hilton, use its technology. The software requires job applicants to respond to a series of questions in a recorded video. The company’s software then analyzes various characteristics including the language they use, their speech, and, until now, their facial expressions. It then provides an assessment of the applicant’s suitability for a job, as well as a measure of traits including “dependability,” “emotional intelligence,” and “cognitive ability.”
Parker says the company helped screen more than 6 million videos last year, although sometimes this involved simply transcribing answers for an interviewer rather than performing an automated assessment of candidates. He adds that some clients let candidates opt out of automated screening. And he says HireVue has developed ways to avoid penalizing candidates with spotty internet connections, automatically referring those candidates to a human.
AI experts warn that algorithms trained on data from previous job applicants may perpetuate existing biases in hiring. Lindsey Zuloaga, HireVue’s chief data scientist, says the company screens for bias on gender, race, and age by collecting that information in training data and looking for signs of bias.
But she acknowledges that it may be more difficult to know if the system is biased on factors such as income or education level, or if it could be affected by something like a stutter.
“I am surprised they are dropping this, as it was a keystone feature of the product they were marketing,” says John Davisson, senior counsel at EPIC. “That is the source of a lot of concerns around  biometric data collection, as well as these bold claims about being able to measure psychological traits, emotional intelligence, social attitudes, and things like that.”

MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group’s 2020 global executive survey and research report on artificial intelligence and business strategy finds that companies that leverage human-machine collaboration are best positioned for success. To share more specifics about this finding, study coauthors David Kiron and François Candelon recently spoke about the research on a Web Summit panel.
Kiron and Candelon led the audience through the key findings from this fourth annual AI study. First, of over 3,000 organizations surveyed, only about 10% achieve significant financial benefits (defined as 5% to 10% of their overall revenue) with artificial intelligence. The research shows those 10% work with AI differently than other organizations by learning with AI:

They design AI systems that work for themselves.
They engineer systems where AI learns from humans.
They engineer systems where humans learn from AI.

Kiron and Candelon were joined by Mark Maybury, chief technology officer at Stanley Black & Decker, and Gail Evans, global chief digital officer at Mercer, who shared specific examples of how their organizations work toward learning with AI.

(Video: Washington Post Live)Ziad Obermeyer, professor of health policy and management at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, said government regulation of artificial intelligence can have a positive impact, but it can't get ahead of the ""many creative and potentially dangerous uses that people are going to put algorithms toward.” “In a lot of our work what we've found is there is a substantial amount of racial bias in algorithms that are fairly widespread...that's the kind of thing that certainly suggests a role for regulation."" (Video: Washington Post Live)Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said we need to move faster in the next six to eight weeks to vaccinate before new variants are widely spread, adding that we’ve already “broken the healthcare system capabilities.” ""The virus is opportunistic and exponential, we have to be the same."" (Video: Washington Post Live)Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said we're going to see more spread of covid-19 strains if we don't get tighter with procedures like wearing masks, social distancing and better surveillance, explaining that the variants “double each week, at least.” (Video: Washington Post Live)Kimberly Powell, VP of health care at NVIDIA, said President-elect Joe Biden’s plan to release nearly all available vaccine doses “makes perfect sense.” “We have so many that need to be protected we’ve got to logistically figure this out…If you think about how Amazon can logistically get packages to my door in a couple of hours, it seems to me that we could target and get shots in arms to the people who need it most. You know that Amazon and their platform is largely driven by artificial intelligence and technology. We’ve got to understand that this technology exists and we’ve got to use everything in our power to put it in place.” (Video: Washington Post Live)GuestsAndrew Hopkins, CEO, ExscientiaAndrew Hopkins is founder and CEO of the global pharmatech company, Exscientia, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to efficiently discover innovative medicines. For over 20 years, Dr Hopkins’ work and research methods have been driven by a mission to accelerate the time between the start of an idea to a viable new drug candidate for patients. At Exscientia, Dr Hopkins oversaw the discovery of the world’s first precision engineered drug generated by AI to enter phase 1 human clinical trials.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPrior to founding Exscientia, Dr Hopkins was the SULSA Research Professor of Translational Biology and the Chair of Medicinal Informatics at the University of Dundee. Before becoming an academic, he held various research leadership positions at Pfizer for 10 years. Hopkins holds a DPhil from the University of Oxford in Molecular Biophysics. He has been awarded Fellowships from several national academies in the UK.Exscientia has offices in Oxford, Miami, and Osaka.

While many health-care providers were already using AI in their daily work pre-COVID-19 to speed diagnoses and tackle routine paperwork, that trend increased dramatically as they responded to the challenges of COVID-19. Today, hospitals and providers are using AI to maximize efficiency and minimize staff burnout while improving care for a growing number of patients – and they will continue to do so in the future as systems recover, rebuild and reimagine health care going forward. How do we harness this growth as we reimagine a future of health care and what new advances are possible? Join GE Healthcare’s president and CEO of the U.S. and Canada, Everett Cunningham, along with UC Davis School of Medicine/Health System chief research informatics officer (interim), Rachael Callcut, MD, MSPH as they discuss the potential of AI today and in the future.Artificial intelligence is helping clinicians fight COVID-19 and playing a critical role in all facets of care today.

In Augmented Reality News 
January 13, 2021 – Octo, a provider of technology and IT solutions for government clients, has announced that it has been awarded a spot on the US Army’s RS3 92 Situational Awareness and Augmented Reality Technologies contract to provide machine learning and deep learning support to the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System program (IVAS). Octo will partner with security and defence contractor QinetiQ to work on the contract.
The IVAS contract, which went to tender back in August 2018, is part of the US Army’s plan to produce innovative solutions that help to accelerate lethal defensive and offensive capabilities of Army warfighters by utilizing innovative components, including the use of augmented reality (AR). 
The IVAS platform is billed as a “fight-rehearse-train” system, meaning its function on the battlefield is priority, but its AR capabilities, such as real-time mapping, will make it useful for training and rehearsing operations anywhere at any time. As a result, IVAS offers a single platform that allows soldiers to fight, rehearse, and train, improving their sensing, decision making, target acquisition, and target engagement through a next generation, 24/7 situational awareness tool. 

“Octo has a longstanding relationship with the Army, and we are excited to offer AI as part of their mission solutions,” said Rob Albritton, Senior Director of Octo’s AI Center of Excellence. “Enhancing soldier lethality and situational awareness is an Army priority, and IVAS serves as the centerpiece. IVAS will operationalize AI in ways the Army could only imagine two years ago. Supporting our close combat force with emerging technology they can use in the field is an honor.”
Octo’s Chief Technology Officer Sujey Edward said, “Octo has a long history of introducing emerging technology into Federal Government agencies, and Rob is helping us lead the way by giving the Army the kind of advanced tools they need to better protect their warfighters and our nation.”
He continued, “Octo is serious about AI. We have the experience and the people to make AI solutions happen for our Federal Government customers. We’re proud to have Rob bringing with him the level of expertise the armed forces depend on, and we look forward to further supporting them by providing tactical edge AI solutions.”
Mehul Sanghani, Octo’s CEO, added: “Winning contracts like IVAS is part of our focus on emerging technologies as a means of helping the government leverage these newly available solutions to maximize mission effectiveness,” added Mehul Sanghani, Octo’s CEO. 
The company stated that the award demonstrates Octo’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and solutions, however did not disclose a monetary amount for the award. For more information on the US Army’s IVAS contract, please click here.

Some college students struggle with the rigor of a STEM major and often drop out and change majors. 
To help students boost their academic performance and stick with STEM majors, Cal State Fullerton’s Yu Bai, assistant professor of computer engineering, is working on a solution using artificial intelligence — machines that think like humans.
Bai is developing an assisted-learning system using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to identify barriers and help college students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, persist and be successful in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) coursework. Studies show that underrepresented students either switch or drop their engineering major at an alarming higher rate (40%) than their peers (29%), Bai added.
Bai’s research was selected by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine as one of 50 winning projects in its “ideas competition” that attracted projects from higher institutions around the world. The winning ideas were presented at a November symposium, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, to drive change in STEM education and influence funding priorities for NSF and other organizations. 
Bai’s project, called APLES (AI-Driven Personalized Learning System), offers students an individualized academic plan, as well as interventions, such as peer group learning sessions to master course concepts. One of the most innovative aspects is that the AI learning system integrates students’ academic performance, background, and other personal and cultural data to predict their knowledge difficulties in specific STEM courses, Bai noted.
Compared to human efforts, the AI-driven learning system is being developed to predict students’ knowledge difficulties before taking the STEM course; analyze data from homework, labs, quizzes, exams and class discussions to forecast learning challenges; monitor the student’s study habits and knowledge to offer recommendations for campus support and resources; and suggest career paths.
Yu Bai, assistant professor of computer engineering
“This AI learning system can identify the uniqueness of each student, as well as offer information about students to their instructors to allow them to better understand each other so that undergraduate STEM education and learning become a more proactive, collaborative practice in the future,” Bai said.
Bai, who is seeking public and private funding for the project, has submitted a grant proposal to NSF with collaborators from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Cal Poly Pomona. CSUF computer engineering and computer science undergraduates and graduate students also are involved in the research project. 
The end-goal of the project is to develop an intelligent learning system that can be used at colleges and universities across the country, specifically institutions that serve underrepresented students, Bai said. 
“CSUF students will benefit from this research since, by using AI to personalize learning, it eliminates the equity gap between underrepresented and general students,” he said.
As part of the project, in the fall semester, Bai developed an AI algorithm for predicting student performance on exams in his computer science and engineering classes. According to the results, 42% of the students had difficulty grasping the concepts. Based on the prediction results, he performed early interventions to help students do better on the exam, in which students achieved an 86% average (out of 100%) — an 11% improvement over the previous semester. The algorithm can be used for other STEM courses in science and mathematics, Bai added.
“With its powerful processing and predicting ability that can transform fast, personalized and targeted curation of content, artificial intelligence will no doubt revolutionize learning and instruction,” Bai said. “To keep the U.S. leading in the fast advancement of technology, we need to prepare students for the demand of a well-trained, diverse STEM workforce.”

The White House on Tuesday fulfilled its requirement to establish an office responsible for coordinating artificial intelligence research and policymaking across government, industry and academia.
Dubbed the National AI Initiative Office, it will implement a national AI strategy under the leadership of Founding Director Lynne Parker, who also serves as U.S. deputy chief technology officer.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy established the office in accordance with the National AI Initiative Act of 2020, which codified a number of policies and initiatives aimed at ensuring U.S. leadership in the technology globally.
“The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office will be integral to the federal government’s AI efforts for many years to come, serving as a central hub for national AI research and policy for the entire U.S. innovation ecosystem,” said Michael Kratsios, U.S. CTO, in a statement.

The National AI Initiative Act of 2020 was passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 earlier this month.
Additionally the law codified the American AI Initiative to increase research investment, improve access to computing and data resources, set technical standards, build a workforce, and engage with allies.
The White House-based Select Committee on AI was expanded and made permanent to oversee the initiative, and the national AI research institutes and National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan were codified.

A National AI Research Resource for existing compute power and datasets is now required, as is an annual AI budget rollup of all federal investments.
The Industries of the Future Act was also included in the NDAA and requires a plan to double AI R&D investment, as suggested in the Trump administration’s final budget proposal.

As scientists continue making machines smarter and smarter however, some are asking “what happens when computers get too smart for their own good?” From “The Matrix” to “The Terminator,” the entertainment industry has already started pondering if future robots will one day threaten the human race. Now, a new study concludes there may be no way to stop the rise of machines. An international team says humans would not be able to prevent super artificial intelligence from doing whatever it wanted to.
Scientists from the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute have started to picture what such a machine would look like. Imagine an AI program with an intelligence far superior to humans. So much so that it could learn on its own without new programming. If it was connected to the internet, researchers say the AI would have access to all of humanity’s data and could even take control of other machines around the globe.
Study authors ask what would such an intelligence do with all that power? Would it work to make all of our lives better? Would it devote its processing power to fixing issues like climate change? Or, would the machine look to take over the lives of its human neighbors?
Controlling the uncontrollable? The dangers of super artificial intelligence
Both computer programmers and philosophers have studied if there’s a way keep a super-intelligent AI from potentially turning on its human makers; ensuring that future computers could not cause harm to their owners. The new study reveals, unfortunately, it appears to be virtually impossible to keep a super-intelligent AI in line.
“A super-intelligent machine that controls the world sounds like science fiction. But there are already machines that perform certain important tasks independently without programmers fully understanding how they learned it. The question therefore arises whether this could at some point become uncontrollable and dangerous for humanity,” says study co-author Manuel Cebrian, leader of the Digital Mobilization Group at the Center for Humans and Machines, in a university release.
The international team looked at two different ways to control artificial intelligence. The first curbed the power of the superintelligence by walling it up and keeping it from connecting to the internet. It also could not connect to other technical devices in the outside world. The problem with this plan is fairly obviously; such a computer would not be able to do much of anything to actually help humans.
Being nice to humans does not compute
The second option focused on creating an algorithm which would give the supercomputer ethical principles. This would hopefully force the AI to consider the best interests of humanity.
The study created a theoretical containment algorithm that would keep AI from harming people under any circumstance. In simulations, AI would stop functioning if researchers considered its actions harmful. Despite keeping the AI from attaining world domination, the study authors say this just wouldn’t work in the real world.
“If you break the problem down to basic rules from theoretical computer science, it turns out that an algorithm that would command an AI not to destroy the world could inadvertently halt its own operations. If this happened, you would not know whether the containment algorithm is still analyzing the threat, or whether it has stopped to contain the harmful AI. In effect, this makes the containment algorithm unusable,” says Iyad Rahwan, Director of the Center for Humans and Machines.
The study concludes that containing artificial intelligence is an incomputable problem. No single computer program can find a foolproof way to keep AI from acting harmful if it wants to. Researchers add that humans may not even realize when super-intelligent machines actually arrive in the tech world. So, are they already here?
The study appears in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

How the use of robotics is evolving at sorting facilities

A recycling facility operator and a robotics company say artificial intelligence is providing materials recovery firms with much-needed data to analyze changes in the recycling stream. That’s in addition to sortation improvements.

Representatives from AMP Robotics and GFL Environmental spoke about the benefits of robotics during a recent presentation hosted by Greenbiz, a business sustainability media and events company.
The event was tied to an announcement from AMP and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), which recently redesigned its K-Cup coffee pods to produce them in a polypropylene format that is recyclable in many U.S. programs, though not all.
After the product redesign, KDP and AMP Robotics worked together to equip AMP’s robotic sorting systems with the tools to properly identify and sort the cups in a materials recovery facility (MRF). The project partners hailed the collaboration as an example of how producers, equipment/technology companies and other recycling stakeholders can work together to improve sortation.
“It really shows how artificial intelligence can help these facilities adapt quickly and really take advantage of these valuable material streams,” said Matanya Horowitz, founder and CEO of AMP Robotics.
Mitigating workforce and data challenges
The use of robots has grown exponentially in recent years. In 2019, Plastics Recycling Update tallied nearly 100 in use in North America from providers AMP, Bulk Handling Systems (BHS), Machinex and ZenRobotics. Since then, others have entered the market, including Bollegraaf (Van Dyk Recycling Solutions is selling the robot in North America). In November, AMP announced it signed a deal with Waste Connections to deploy two dozen robots to MRFs across the country.
Horowitz of AMP Robotics said artificial intelligence has changed how robotics can be incorporated into MRFs. Machine learning allows robots to, over time, identify more and more items within the recycling stream. That includes materials that are smashed up, moldy, dirty and “generally inconsistent,” he said.
“This is largely what’s kept robots from being used in the recycling industry already,” Horowitz added. His company this month announced it raised $55 million from a number of investment sources.
During the Greenbiz event, Brent Hildebrand, vice president of recycling for GFL, spoke on behalf of the Canadian-headquartered hauler and MRF operator, which is one of the largest in North America. Hildebrand previously worked in positions at AMP, as well as Alpine Waste & Recycling, which was acquired by GFL.
The Denver-area Alpine Waste & Recycling MRF was an early adopter of robotics technology. One factor that led the facility to install robotic sorting systems was the rising cost of running a MRF, Hildebrand said.
“Part of those rising costs is rising labor cost,” Hildebrand said. “And on top of that, it’s just finding labor for these sites.”
The company found robotics to be a promising alternative when the company can’t find enough manual sorting personnel to staff its facilities.
Another driver is the evolving material stream, Hildebrand said. He pointed to PET bottles and aluminum cans as two significant examples of recyclable products that have been made with less and less material over the years.
“That changes the dynamic for what we can produce from a volume standpoint,” Hildebrand said.
Artificial intelligence can help the company respond to these changes in inbound material, he noted. For one, it can help a MRF determine exactly how the material stream is changing, by giving MRF operators the data to perceive changes. Beyond providing efficient material sorting, the artificial intelligence in robots is “really closely tied to a challenge in the industry of extracting information about the process,” Horowitz said.
“Really a core problem for recycling is that there hasn’t been a sensor that would let you tell what’s going on in the material stream, so identify how many bottles, identify whose bottles, identify what bottles are high quality and things like that,” Horowitz said. “And now with artificial intelligence, you sort of have this core capability that you can take advantage of in different ways.”

Precision and customization
In addition to collecting data to develop a baseline of information, the artificial intelligence can help MRFs adapt quickly when new materials are introduced into packaging
“What’s powerful about this technology is that it can provide a new level of identification,” Horowitz said. “Pretty much anything you can teach a person to identify, you can teach our systems to identify as well.”
Robots can learn to identify different packaging from specific brands, types of material, shapes of packaging and more.
These expanded identification abilities have significant practical applications for MRF operators, particularly when it comes to producing higher-value commodities. As an example, Horowitz pointed to the common MRF practice of producing bales of mixed plastics Nos. 3-7, which are sold for typically low prices. But greater sorting can change that equation.
“When you start to do things like separate out the No. 5 plastics, the polypropylene, that can actually have significant value,” Horowitz said. “There are similar patterns in paper. If you separate out the office paper and the newspaper, it’s also more valuable.”
Hildebrand added that this sorting ability even allows MRFs to produce customized commodities for specific end users.
“In our business, we have buyers of these materials and they want a certain specification,” Hildebrand said. For example, buyers might want a bit more OCC included in a mixed-paper bale, depending on the application. MRFs that can meet those custom specifications may fetch a premium for their bales.
“You can kind of tailor these recipes to what your buyers want,” Hildebrand said.

From Google searches and dating sites to detecting credit card fraud, artificial intelligence (AI) keeps finding new ways to creep into our lives. But can we trust the algorithms that drive it?
As humans, we make errors. We can have attention lapses and misinterpret information. Yet when we reassess, we can pick out our errors and correct them.
But when an AI system makes an error, it will be repeated again and again no matter how many times it looks at the same data under the same circumstances. 
AI systems are trained using data that inevitably reflect the past. If a training data set contains inherent biases from past human decisions, these biases are codified and amplified by the system. 
Or if it contains less data about a particular minority group, predictions for that group will tend to be worse. This is called “algorithmic bias”.
Gradient Institute has co-authored a paper demonstrating how businesses can identify algorithmic bias in AI systems, and how they can mitigate it.
The work was produced in collaboration with the Australian Human Rights Commission, Consumer Policy Research Centre, CSIRO’s Data61 and the CHOICE advocacy group.
How does algorithmic bias arise?
Algorithmic bias may arise through a lack of suitable training data, or as a result of inappropriate system design or configuration.
For example, a system that helps a bank decide whether or not to grant loans would typically be trained using a large data set of the bank’s previous loan decisions (and other relevant data to which the bank has access). 
The system can compare a new loan applicant’s financial history, employment history and demographic information with corresponding information from previous applicants. From this, it tries to predict whether the new applicant will be able to repay the loan.
But this approach can be problematic. One way in which algorithmic bias could arise in this situation is through unconscious biases from loan managers who made past decisions about mortgage applications. 
If customers from minority groups were denied loans unfairly in the past, the AI will consider these groups’ general repayment ability to be lower than it is.
Young people, people of colour, single women, people with disabilities and blue-collar workers are just some examples of groups that may be disadvantaged.

Bias harms both individuals and companies
The biased AI system described above poses two key risks for the bank. 
First, the bank could miss out on potential clients, by sending victims of bias to its competitors. It could also be held liable under anti-discrimination laws. 
If an AI system continually applies inherent bias in its decisions, it becomes easier for government or consumer groups to identify this systematic pattern. This can lead to hefty fines and penalties.



Centrelink’s now-scrapped robodebt system automatically raised welfare debts against people it predicted were overpaid. If the recipient didn’t provide income evidence, an algorithm generated a fortnightly income figure for them by averaging data available to the Australia Tax Office. These estimates had major errors.

Mitigating algorithmic bias
Our paper explores several ways in which algorithmic bias can arise. 
It also provides technical guidance on how this bias can be removed, so AI systems produce ethical outcomes which don’t discriminate based on characteristics such as race, age, sex or disability. 
For our paper, we ran a simulation of a hypothetical electricity retailer using an AI-powered tool to decide how to offer products to customers and on what terms. The simulation was trained on fictional historical data made up of fictional individuals.
Based on our results, we identify five approaches to correcting algorithmic bias. This toolkit can be applied to businesses across a range of sectors to help ensure AI systems are fair and accurate.
1. Get better data
The risk of algorithmic bias can be reduced by obtaining additional data points or new types of information on individuals, especially those who are underrepresented (minorities) or those who may appear inaccurately in existing data.
2. Pre-process the data
This consists of editing a dataset to mask or remove information about attributes associated with protections under anti-discrimination law, such as race or gender.
3. Increase model complexity
A simpler AI model can be easier to test, monitor and interrogate. But it can also be less accurate and lead to generalisations which favour the majority over minorities.
4. Modify the system
The logic and parameters of an AI system can be proactively adjusted to directly counteract algorithmic bias. For example, this can be done by setting a different decision threshold for a disadvantaged group.
5. Change the prediction target
The specific measure chosen to guide an AI system directly influences how it makes decisions across different groups. Finding a fairer measure to use as the prediction target will help reduce algorithmic bias. 



The effectiveness of an AI system is highly dependent on the quality of data used to train it.

Consider legality and morality
In our recommendations to government and businesses wanting to employ AI decision-making, we foremost stress the importance of considering general principles of fairness and human rights when using such technology. And this must be done before a system is in-use. 
We also recommend systems are rigorously designed and tested to ensure outputs aren’t tainted by algorithmic bias. Once operational, they should be closely monitored.
Finally, we advise that to use AI systems responsibly and ethically extends beyond compliance with the narrow letter of the law. It also requires the system to be aligned with broadly-accepted social norms — and considerate of impact on individuals, communities and the environment.
With AI decision-making tools becoming commonplace, we now have an opportunity to not only increase productivity, but create a more equitable and just society – that is, if we use them carefully.

Intel names Pat Gelsinger for CEO job replacing Bob Swan


Networking

13/01/2021 

Intel announced the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its chief executive officer, effective Feb. 15, 2021. Pat Gelsinger will succeed Bob Swan, who will remain CEO until Feb. 15.

Intel said today’s announcement is unrelated to Intel’s 2020 financial performance. Intel expects its fourth-quarter 2020 revenue and EPS to exceed its prior guidance provided on Oct. 22, 2020. Intel said the company has made strong progress on its 7nm process technology and plans on providing an update when it reports its full fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results on Jan. 21, 2021.
Most recently, Pat Gelsinger served as the CEO of VMware since 2012, where he transformed the company into a recognized global leader in cloud infrastructure, enterprise mobility and cyber security, almost tripling the company’s annual revenues.
Prior to joining VMware, Pat Gelsinger was president and chief operating officer of EMC Information Infrastructure Products at EMC, overseeing engineering and operations for information storage, data computing, backup and recovery, RSA security and enterprise solutions.
Before joining EMC, Pat Gelsinger spent 30 years at Intel, becoming the company’s first chief technology officer and driving the creation of key industry technologies such as USB and Wi-Fi. He was the architect of the original 80486 processor, led 14 different microprocessor programs and played key roles in the Core and Xeon families.
