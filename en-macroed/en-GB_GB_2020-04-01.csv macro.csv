Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Deloitte, EY, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and KPMG are among the largest service providers in the accounting industry— collectively referred to as the Big Four. Many of the financial and consulting services offered by these firms – such as advising on investment decisions – involve finding patterns in very large sets of data. This data is often beyond the understanding of a single person (or team of persons) and is often “noisy” and without a set format. The Big Four all seem to have artificial intelligence initiatives – and the goal of this article here is to compare and contrast their AI-related efforts (and purported results). A few of the Big Four have invested heavily in innovation labs and claim to embrace a new era of automation and augmentation. In the article below we aim to answer the following three questions: What are the different AI technologies the Big Four are implementing and how? Which services are most likely to be automated first? What are the similarities and differences in the AI initiatives and strategy for each of the Big Four? We’ll explore the AI investments and initiatives of these companies one-by-one, starting with Deloitte.  Deloitte It is one of the biggest accounting brands under which lie several professionals and firms that offer auditing, strategy consulting and tax preparation related services. As with most large consulting firms, Deloitte vies for market share and press through thought leadership – and like the other Big Four – it has increasingly focused it’s white papers and research on the topic of artificial intelligence. A recent Deloitte article breaks down AI technologies into the following discreet categories: Product: AI technology embedded into the product or service itself to provide all the associated end-customer benefits. Process: AI technology to streamline daily workflow and operations to automate and increase day-to-day productivity. Automation can happen in two forms: by either reducing manpower directly or augmenting a worker’s ability to perform a task better/faster. Insight: AI is used to make informed and strategic decisions to provide targeted advice to a company to new or existing businesses. Based on our assessment, most of Deloitte’s own AI-related initiatives seem to fall into the categories of Process and Insight, as we’ll see below. A concrete example of an AI-enabled process is the document-review platform developed by Deloitte US innovation that went live in 2014. Deloitte claims that this platform has automated the process of reviewing and extracting all the relevant information from contracts, and reducing meticulous, laborious human efforts. The company claims that this technology has helped reduce the time spent on reviewing legal contract documents, invoices, financial statements and board meeting minutes by up to 50 percent or more. Deloitte has recently partnered with IBM Watson. The Deloitte touts the partnership as a way to provide end users with cognitive-technology-enhanced solutions for their businesses. Following are some business use-cases as a result of this partnership: LeasePoint– It is powered by IBM TRIRIGA and utilizes Deloittes knowledge in leasing industry to teach the AI-enabled system to develop an end-to-end leasing portfolio Visual inspection of assets– Using IBM’s Maximo technology Deloitte claims to be improving asset inspection on wind farms. Learn more in this video. Deloitte Catalyst – another recent AI initiative from the global consulting giant – is a network of startups, that are working together to translate AI technologies into practical business solutions for client firms. Deloitte offers Catalyst companies funding, and access to Deloitte’s client base in order to partner and flesh out their business applications. Most AI firms are still figuring out exactly how to drive business value with their technology, and Deloitte hopes to forge partnerships with these cutting-edge firms to help bring the latest AI innovations to their clients. The video below explains the initiative (starting around 55 seconds):  Ayasdi, Narrative Science, and Kira are claimed to be among the businesses partnering with Deloitte in their Catalyst program. “Technology like AI can help make these processes more efficient, accurate and comprehensive, helping us get better insights to clients sooner, and empowering our professionals to deliver high-value services to our clients”. – Craig Muraskin, Managing Director, Deloitte U.S. Innovation Group EY Formerly known as Ernst & Young, EY is one of the largest professional service providing firms in the world. It operates as a network of firms which function independently in different countries, collectively offering assurance, audit, tax, consulting and advisory services to companies. The company has recently applied AI to the analysis of lease contracts. The company claims that the use of AI has made it easier to capture relevant information from contracts such as lease commencement date, amount to be paid, and renewal or termination options. According to an article in Accounting Today, EY is working to automate the auditing process. They claim that this reduces the administrative time spent on reviewing audit documents and gives employees more time to participate in the judgment and analytical part of the process. These applications appear to be in pilot phase (which is to be expected). as sifting through the auditing or lease documents can be extremely time consuming. According to EY Global Assurance Innovation Leader Jeanne Boillet in a June 2017 report: “These pilots show that AI tools would make it possible to review about 70%-80% of a simple lease’s contents electronically, leaving the remainder to be considered by a human. With more complex leases (in real estate, for instance), that figure would be more like 40%, but as the tools improve, and the machines learn, it is likely that more complex contracts and data can be read, managed and analyzed.” Another area where EY has applied AI technology is the automation of routine tasks, such as auditing (which we covered in greater depth in our full article on AI in insurance), by using it’s own proprietary Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system. EY claims that this technology, known as  , helps the firm deliver more accurate, efficient audits for its clients. EY Australia has already adopted this digital auditing technology, claiming that 50% of its bank audit confirmations were lodged using the AI-enabled system. This AI-enabled system can accept and confirm audit requests, process and provide the auditors with the relevant documentation for final analysis and judgment. EY has also launched an AI proof-of-concept, using computer vision to enable airborne drones to monitor inventory during the auditing process. For example, this drone can count the number of vehicles in a production plant under audit, and communicate this data directly into the EY Canvas – the global audit digital platform. According to EY, use of drones allows more data to be captured in the process of auditing. It also allows auditors to focus on risk areas rather than taking stock of inventory manually. This drone initiative seems to be in research and development mode at the time being and doesn’t seem to be a service offered broadly to EY’s client base. A screen shot of EY’s press release about their experimentation with drone use for inventory management While overtly embracing the developments in AI, EY is also aware of the threat AI poses to white-collar work, and they appear to be addressing automation seriously in their thought leadership. EY’s recent report on the future of work highlights some of the societal and regulatory concerns of job automation in the decade ahead. A screenshot of EY’s report on the job market implications of AI Predictably, much of EY’s thought leadership touts the benefits of augmentation instead of automation. EY Global Assurance Innovation Leader Jeanne Boillet says that Artificial Intelligence “has the potential to transform audit, but it will never replace the auditor”. We find the word “never” to be downright ridiculous, but we cannot blame EY leadership from having to tout this opinion, and there is no reason to blame Mrs. Boillet for being so black-and-white about the matter, anyone in her shoes would say the same thing. This belief in an “augmented”, not an “automated” future is a common theme among large, people-heavy legacy businesses. Many would argue that businesses of this kind (chock full of knowledge workers working in spreadsheets) are among the biggest “low-hanging fruit” for automation, and it behooves older people-heavy businesses to dispel disturbing thoughts about massive layoffs. By no means are we suggesting that the Big Four are inherently doomed to perish by nimbler, less human-laden competitors. Rather, we want to address the fact that these firms can be expected to have only one opinion on this matter. The impact on employee morale and shareholder value would likely be tragic if EY’s leadership (or the leadership of Accenture, Deloitte, or any other large consulting firm) were to state openly that many of their current jobs may be fully automated, and that some of these jobs would not be replaced. Hence, large firms of this kind are only permitted to give one opinion, an inherently self-serving one, one with a commitment to stave off risk and ensure it’s own survival. We don’t consider this immoral, it’s the same kind of self-preservation we’d see in any other sector or industry. It may not be blameworthy, but it is our job here at TechEmergence to make it known that these opinions should not be taken at face value. Whenever a company has no choice but to tout a single perspective, we’re likely to lay those facts outright so that business readers (like yourself) can make more informed decisions. We should expect to see large, people-heavy legacy companies (For more insight into the kinds of jobs that might be first – or last – to automate, read or listen to our previous interviews with Martin Ford, Kevin LaGrandeur, and Marshall Brain – all of which are focused on the impact of automation on the job market.) PwC The second largest professional services firm by revenue, PwC, claims to have begun adopting AI as well. The International Accounting Bulletin awarded the ‘Audit Innovation of the year’ for PwC’s technology GL.ai in October 2017. GL.ai was developed in collaboration with H2O.ai, a Silicon Valley company that developed an AI-enabled system capable of analyzing documents and preparing reports. Using AI approaches like reinforcement learning, PwC claims that GL.ai learns and becomes more capable with every audit (a common capability for ML applications). GL.ai has already been trained on audit data from Canada, Germany, Sweden and the UK. We were unable to find robust case studies of the technology in our analysis, and – like most of the AI applications at Big Four firms at this time – the technology seems to be in development. They claim to have made a significant investment in Natural Language Processing (NLP)- an AI-enable technology for this purpose. NLP makes sense of complex lease agreements, revenue contracts, and board meeting minutes to form meaningful insights for clients. Anand Rao – Global AI lead at PwC – told TechEmergence about another PwC AI use-case in the automotive industry: “Using ‘digital twin’ technology and ‘future power’ we have helped large auto manufacturers visualize and navigate over 200,000 go-to-market scenarios to fine-tune their strategy and launch a new multi-billion dollar business in ridesharing and autonomous/electric vehicles. This particular application has won the Best Enterprise Award recently and is the wave of next generation of AI on ‘Gamifying Strategy’ – it takes the methods used to create AlphaGo and other game playing programs to the Boardrooms and Strategy Groups. We have done this at more than half-a-dozen clients”.  Like the other Big Four firms, PwC is actively involved in publishing thought leadership (articles, white papers, and more) on the implications of artificial intelligence. A recent PwC analysis of the financial services sector identifies a number of automation and augmentation concerns related to AI – and advice from PwC on how firms might adapt to AI in the future. A screenshot featuring part of PwC’s predictions on the impact of AI in FinTech PwC’s “AI: Sizing the prize” report estimates the percent increase in GDP to be attributed to AI in various economic regions (see below). The image below is only a small snapshot, because of the complexity of the topic (and the inherent challenges in predicting the future), we advise the reader to assess multiple sources and develop their own conclusions. A screen shot of part of the report on PwC’s “AI: Sizing the prize” report “Artificial intelligence can help people make faster, better, and cheaper decisions. But you have to be willing to collaborate with the machine, and not just treat it as either a servant or an overlord”. – Anand Rao, US Analytics Group Innovation Leader   KPMG KPMG has built its own portfolio of AI tools called KPMG Ignite. The KPMG Ignite offering is designed to enhance business decisions and process on a digital platform. Key features of KPMG Ignite include AI tools (a few examples of which are listed below), AI integrators to make these tools compatible with existing IT infrastructure, guidance for client firms and testing, prototype development, and innovation on emerging AI applications. KPMG is also using AI to analyze and extract information from leasing or investment agreements. Following are some of the business process where KPMG claims to have applied AI-enabled technology- Call Center Analytics Engine- Utilizes NLP to design a model to predict future events and even convert customer calls to unstructured text, which is then streamlined to identify keywords, customer sentiment and predict future trends. AI Anomalous Event Predicting Tool- Uses AI techniques to develop a model to predict future business events. Document Compliance Assessment Engine- Uses AI to read a documentation- contract, leasing and investment agreement- in its entirety and yield relevant information. (Learn more about Business implications of AI from KPMG here) KPMG signed a “Participation Agreement” with IBM in June 2016 – apparently with the intention of using IBM Watson to automate audit-related processes. It isn’t clear if this “Participation Agreement” involved paying IBM, or if both firms are looking to prove out a use-case together in a kind of barter. Little seems to be available about the present progress of said agreement. In a 2016 press release, KPMG’s John Kelly (Senior Vice-President, Cognitive Solutions and IBM Research) states: “Auditing and similar knowledge services are increasingly challenged with tackling immense volumes of unstructured data. Cognitive technologies such as Watson can transform how this data is understood and how critical decisions are made. By applying Watson, KPMG is taking a forward-looking approach to extending its expertise, helping professionals and clients gain new insights from critical enterprise information” As we might expect, KPMG has joined the thought leadership game around artificial intelligence – with the intent of informing their clients and appearing ahead of the curve. Like Deloitte, they’ve created a number of layperson-friendly AI explainer videos to explain AI’s potential impact on their work: KPMG’s “ethical compass for automation” highlights some of the societal concerns that they consider to be important in the years ahead. KPMG’s Automation Practice Lead, Todd Loar, explains the fundamental findings of their report in the 5-minute presentation below:  On the Game of Thought Leadership for Consulting Companies As analysts in the AI industry, we’re tasked with sorting out truth from hype. With the popularity of AI (and the growing sentiment of its inevitability in effecting all business sectors), it often behooves companies to seem ahead of the AI curve. In the world of startups, companies increasingly see their competitors use “artificial intelligence” in pitch decks and on their “about” page – and the pressure mounts to do the same (even if they have no AI skills or talent, and even if the product is in no way predicated on artificial intelligence). In the world of consulting firms, the same phenomenon occurs. Businesses must “keep up with the Joneses” in the perception game of AI competence, or else they’ll lose business to someone who puts up a better front. As in the startup world, this leads to a vicious cycle of mutual one-upmanship without the prowess to back up the claims. For some reason I find that business readers often know intuitively that a startup’s pitch deck is self-serving, but they’re often unable to apply that same “taking it with a grain of salt” mentality to white papers and reports, which – like pitch decks – serve the goal of filling a company’s bank accounts, not of portraying truth for its own sake. This disclaimer is important: Thought leadership is perception management, not objective analysis. This isn’t to say that we don’t believe that the Big Four are using AI. These companies have massive revenues and thousands of talented people – and based on our assessment, all four of the Big Four claim to have integrated AI into some of their service offerings, and we’d suspect that this is, in fact, the case. Rather we imply they have no choice but to say that they are on the cutting edge of AI (or they risk losing business to their better-marketed competitors). This isn’t blameworthy, it’s business – and we aren’t here to point fingers, but to lay the situation out as it is. Time will tell which of these companies is leveraging the technology most fruitfully, and we imagine that there will be a rather intense competition among these top firms to improve their service quality and profit margins through automation. Indeed part of our job here at TechEmergence is to do the “digging” ourselves and aim to get behind the bluster of press releases, but we’d like to remind our readers to think like an analyst as they consume information that might affect their strategy and procurement. Concluding Thoughts on AI in the Accounting Big Four In the sections above, we reviewed how AI is being used by all the Big Four. Based on our research on these companies, two common trends seem clear: First, they seem to be investing in AI technologies for accounting services. AI is being integrated into the core of the business and its use is showing a gradual increase. Second, the Four also purport to see AI as a critical factor to give them an edge over others and are in some sense competing with each other to gain AI supremacy. The use of AI holds many promises for the future of these consulting giants. It may take away the pain of flipping through hundreds of pages for hours and making reports. A lot of data collected during auditing and tax preparation is unstructured and prone to human error. AI-enabled technology, trained on this unstructured data is increasingly capable of recognizing the errors and streamlining parts of the process. Next in line for augmentation and automation are advisory services. Using consulting and advisory data, firms are now training AI networks to learn how to interact with client firms looking for business solutions. The decision to relying on AI solutions requires administrative streamlining and strategic planning on many levels. The firms have worked hard to define these strategies to implement and integrate AI technologies in the workplace. For example, Deloitte aims to create process maps to keep track of the organization’s core business processes. Our analysis of machine learning in the finance sector indicates that this industry is among the most likely to adopt more white-collar automation in the years ahead – a trend we see clearly in the analysis of the Big Four. This will help identify business processes where AI might have the most impact. PwC, advises choosing areas that are operational or explanatory in nature and explore AI solutions to these problems before others (source). These strategies can help to facilitate a judicial use of budget, resources, and planning that goes into the use of AI in a business. Given the impact that AI is poised to make, there has to be a discussion about the extent to which we rely solely on machine-based intelligence and decisions. Every industry embracing AI for a business solution is concerned with the impact that this technology can have on humans in the workplace. For the Big Four, this is reason for greater concern, as they operate in a people-centric business – and one that some experts would presume to be ripe for massive disruption through automation. Our analysis reveals that the Big Four are investigating the concerns of workforce automation – though most all of their published thought leadership paints an optimistic future of augmentation, rather than one of automation. Time will tell when it comes to the effects of AI on the knowledge workers within the Big Four. My fingers are crossed that their industry – as with many others – have insight and ability to adopt. They’re certainly working on it.   Header image credit: b4f.eu Related Posts AI-based Business Process Management in Banking - Current Use-CasesBusiness process management (BPM) in banking involves the automation of operations management by identifying, modeling,… The Principles of AI Governance - with Karine Perset of the OECDWe interviewed Karine Perset, from the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation in France… AI Startups in Auto Lending - 2 Well-Funded ExamplesThe auto-lending industry stands to benefit from artificial intelligence in much the same way as… AI in Building Automation - Current ApplicationsIn our previous report, we covered the current use cases for AI in construction and… AI for Compliance in Banking - Where Banks Should Focus NextIn the banking sector, supervisory organizations create and oversee the compliance rules that banks and… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Biotech Get Real
Whether modeling the real world or making sense of real-time data, AI can enhance drug development from candidate screening to trial management

AI may be used to extract insights from millions of experimental affinity measurements and thousands of protein structures to predict the binding of small molecules to proteins. This approach is being realized by Atomwise, the developer of AtomNet, a structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. AtomNet helped Stanford University researchers screen 6.8 million small molecules for their ability to target Miro1, a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease. In the space filling structure for Miro1 shown here, the area in white represents the screening site. The most promising compound, the Miro1 Reducer, appears in the inset.
Artificial intelligence (AI) may sound futuristic, but it already exists in many everyday technologies. For example, it gives our handheld devices voice and facial recognition capabilities. AI is also making its presence felt in biotechnology, where it has become integral to many aspects of drug discovery and development.
AI applications in biotech include drug target identification, drug screening, image screening, and predictive modeling. AI is also being used to comb through the scientific literature and manage clinical trial data.




By leveraging machine learning, AI can manage disparate clinical trial datasets, enable virtual screening, and analyze vast amounts of data. Besides reducing clinical trial costs, AI can gain otherwise unobtainable insights and feed them back into the drug development process.
AI technologies to serve the biotech industry are being developed by several companies. Their services are rapidly becoming indispensable as older methods like classical statistical analysis or manual image scanning reach their practical limits.
A new world of abundance
Atomwise was the first company to apply a common type of machine learning, convolutional neural networking (CNN), to drug design and discovery. CNN is used in familiar everyday applications like Alexa’s speech recognition technology or Facebook’s image tagging feature. Atomwise has 550 ongoing machine learning projects focusing on problems like hit discovery, potency optimization, selectivity optimization, and off-target toxicity testing.







According to Atomwise CEO Abraham Heifets, PhD, there is virtually no limit to the number of small-molecule compounds that can be virtually screened using Atomwise’s algorithm. “We did the largest screen in human history recently—12 billion molecules,” says Heifets. Most of those 12 billion molecules don’t exist in nature and have never existed. Any of them, however, can be synthesized by Atomwise partners. These vendors can quickly synthesize interesting candidate molecules from a set of basic building blocks and deliver them within four to six weeks. Heifets asserts that the availability of those theoretical compounds is increasing rapidly, and soon it may be possible to screen 100 billion molecules.
The problems of drug screening shift with a large abundance of molecules. “If you have 100 billion molecules and you have a 99% accurate model, it sounds pretty good.” Heifets explains. “But that means you have a 1% false-positive rate, and your right answer will be swamped in a billion false positives. In fact, what you need to fruitfully, productively work in this new world of abundance are computational techniques that are far in excess of 99% accuracy—99.999%.”
Like many other disruptive technologies in pharmaceutical research—technologies such as CRISPR gene editing, proteolysis targeting chimera–induced protein degradation, and RNA interference—AI is generating a lot of excitement. “AI,” Heifets maintains, “promises to [help drug developers] go after previously intractable targets.” He points out that early interest in disruptive technologies such as AI tends to precede incredible clinical results. “It is,” he emphasizes, “the promise of opening up greenfield opportunities.”
Autonomous AI in real-world use
Machine learning also offers exciting opportunities in the realm of clinical diagnostics. For example, AI technologies for medical applications are being developed by Eyenuk. The company’s first product to market, EyeArt®, uses AI to detect disease from retinal images. In a clinical trial that included 942 patients and spanned 15 medical centers around the United States, sensitivity for detection of diabetic retinopathy was over 95%.
Eyenuk, an artificial intelligence medical technology and services company, has developed the EyeArt platform, which uses artificial intelligence to detect diabetic retinopathy. EyeArt can autonomously analyze a patient’s retinal images to robustly detect signs of disease and return an easy-to-read report in under 60 seconds.
EyeArt was developed using machine learning to train its algorithms on nearly 2 million images. “Now imagine training your resident with so many images,” says Eyenuk CEO Kaushal Solanki, PhD. “That’s just not possible.”




Experts recommend annual screening for diabetic retinopathy for everyone with diabetes. Currently, the United Kingdom is the only country in the world screening more than 80% of its diabetes population. That’s nearly 2.5 million patients whose retinal images would need to be individually reviewed by experts every year.
The U.K. National Health Service (NHS) carried out a health technology assessment in which EyeArt was compared with several competing technologies. EyeArt was found to be superior by a broad margin. The assessment’s findings, which were published in 2016, showed that EyeArt has 99.6% sensitivity for detecting proliferative disease, and 93.8 % for referable disease. The NHS is now shifting its workflow to adopt EyeArt for its screening programs. Meanwhile, pilot assessments at six centers in the United Kingdom have been completed.
Channeling the data deluge
Traditional methods of data analysis in drug discovery work best with straightforward, homogenous data. However, those methods fall short when the data becomes complex, for example, when patient records chronicle multiple diagnoses, comorbidities, complex treatment plans, and many encounters with clinics and clinicians. AI can integrate that information, analyze it, and produce stratified patient groups. That ability to handle complex, multivariate data is revolutionizing the design and execution of clinical trials.
Sensyne Health is at the forefront of this clinical data movement. Sensyne’s chief of translational medicine, Rabia T. Khan, PhD, says that the traditional model of drug discovery, which burns through  billions of dollars and still produces high failure rates, is unsustainable. She adds, however, that AI promises to reduce costs and failures. Sensyneis partnering with the NHS to capture patient data and enable the stratification of patients for clinical trials.
“Because this data is so noisy and sparse and heterogeneous, you really do need AI,” Khan argues. “If you use classical approaches, you can’t identify subpopulations in heart failure. But when you go on to use more complex machine learning–based methods, you’re able to identify subpopulations of heart failure and show that there are more than just the two well-known subgroups of heart failure.
“There are actually multiple subgroups. We’re currently looking into how drugs are effective in many of those different subgroups.”
She predicts that eventually the industry will move away from classical randomized controlled trials and toward virtual trials. Enabled by AI, virtual trials will do the heavy lifting, providing much of the information that used to require expensive human trials. In fact, this information will be available for a prospective drug before the the drug is ever tested in human beings.
“Instead of taking something from an abstract idea in a dish all the way through to clinical work,” Khan says, “we will start with real-world data, link that to patient samples, and use that for drug discovery, and then we will feed the same information back into the clinical trial.”
Another company focused on managing clinical trial data is Precision Medicine Group. The company’s Precision for Medicine business recently acquired QuartzBio, an AI platform that analyzes biological and clinical data streams to extract knowledge and insights to accelerate drug development.
In clinical trials, there have been many attempts to funnel data from diverse sources to clinical trial investigators, who would then be able to quickly and flexibly interpret the data holistically. These attempts seldom succeed, suggests Cliff Culver, senior vice president of Precision Medicine Group.
“All of that data is generated independently and lives in disconnected formats all over the place,” he says. “For a drug company, multiple people would work for multiple weeks or months to pull all of that together, particularly when the focus involves linking quantifiable ‘reportables’ back to source information—like images or sequencing data—to enable ongoing quality control.
“The result is that analysis is meaningfully delayed, typically until after a trial is complete. And there’s rarely bandwidth to undertake deep data integration across trials within an organization. We do it as a trial is unfolding, so the company has regular insight into what’s happening, and then we do it at an enterprise level to maximize the utility of the data.”
Some of the approaches enabled by the QuartzBio platform bear a superficial resemblance to the unguided AI analyses used by Google, Netflix, or other large technology companies. Still, finding biological insights is different from choosing a movie you might like.
“In drug development, we typically have smaller and less dynamic data sets, and we have a material need to get beyond correlation to understand what’s happening biologically,” says Culver. “Our secret sauce is our ability to both pull all of that data together so you have the richest possible data set to explore and then apply the right data-driven or computational biology analysis, the AI, to derive actionable meaning.”
On-the-fly analyses
Concerto HealthAI is a precision medicine company with a major focus in oncology. It uses AI and machine learning to reveal how patients respond to treatments in real-world settings. The company’s work can guide pharmaceutical research, inform outcomes research and value-based studies, and accelerate drug development.
Concerto HealthAI CEO Jeff Elton, PhD, offers as an example of a typical cancer patient being diagnosed for the first time. That patient would initially be staged based on tumor location and size, metastatic status, and other features of the disease. Then this information would be used to guide treatment. Then, additional information—“on the fly” information about the patient’s progress or changes in disease status of the disease—may become available. It will not, however, automatically become part of the patient’s electronic medical record.
This sort of on-the-fly information is critical for pharmaceutical companies. For example, accurate information on staging at different timepoints in the patient history helps pharmaceutical companies understand why a treatment is or isn’t effective.
“We develop AI models that read the record, compute a stage, and give an accuracy score based on everything that’s in the record—imaging reports, molecular reports, and things of that nature,” says Elton. “We even arrange for analyses to accept data only if it is of a given accuracy.”
Concerto HealthAI’s technology can also be used to make predictions, such as whether a patient is going to be a responder or whether the response is durabile. These predictions can be valuable in the design of a clinical study. And they can offer clinical researchers a direct line of sight into the standard of care, which is important because often physicians will not place patients in a trial if it is too much of a burden compared to the standard of care. Concerto HealthAI’s models can predict patient burden for trial design purposes.
What all these capabilities allow researchers to do, Elton says, is run on-the-fly analyses, accomplishing in real time what would otherwise have required weeks of data preparation.

However, sometimes the technical and data-based complexities of AI challenge technology companies to deliver on their promises. Some companies are choosing to approach these AI challenges not by scaling back their AI ambitions, but rather by using humans to do the task that they are otherwise trying to get their AI systems to do. This concept of humans pretending to be machines that are supposed to do the work of humans is called “pseudo AI”, or more bluntly, just faking it.

Faking it Till You Make It with AI

Most notably, a number of companies have been claiming to use artificial intelligence in order to automate parts of their services such as transcription, appointment scheduling, and other personal assistant work, but in reality have been outsourcing this work to humans through labor marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. While artificial intelligence is actually used for the solution in part or at all, these companies have not been truthful with their claims of using computers to perform these services. 


CNBC published an article critical of Sophia, the AI robot from Hanson Robotics. When the company was approached by CNBC with a list of questions they wanted to ask, Hanson Robotics responded with a list of very specific questions for Sophia. In a followup video, CNBC questions whether the robot is meant to be research into artificial intelligence or is just a PR stunt. They also provided the responses. Even the owner of Hanson Robotics has gone on record as saying most media encounters are scripted.

However, Hanson Robotics is only one of the more notable pseudo-AI encounters to make the news. Popular calendar scheduling services X.AI and Clara Labs were found to both be using humans to schedule appointments and calendar items rather than purely artificial intelligence solutions. The above linked article quotes human workers who wished that the AI system did actually work as promised because the work was such boring drudgery. No doubt while these companies were the unfortunate ones to get unwanted media attention, there are no doubt many others who are pursuing the approach of using humans as a “stop gap” when the AI systems are deficient.
PROMOTED
What’s wrong with Pseudo-AI?
It isn’t unheard of though for companies in the tech industry to fake some or part of their services, especially when they are starting out. While this may work for some tech areas, does it work for AI? Some would say no.
The entire premise of AI is that it can accomplish feats that previously only humans were able to do. So faking AI capabilities actually undermines the very essence of what AI is promising to be able to do. AI is still a very emerging field and new artificial intelligence technology is being developed every day. Emerging companies are pitching technology solutions whose premise is that they can accomplish technically challenging tasks. But rather than delivering on these promises, these companies are simply performing technology-enabled outsourcing to humans, and often at very low wages.

Incidents like this have the potential to create a lot of problems in the tech industry. One of the biggest is the potential for an AI winter if people consistently see products that are being faked regularly. People will be less likely to want to invest in AI technology. AI winters, which are periods of decline of interest and funding in AI, have previously been triggered by substantial overpromising and underdelivering of AI capabilities. The increasing or widespread use of Pseudo-AI to cover up AI deficiencies could lead to disenchantment with AI as a whole, and contribute to widespread AI pullback.

Another big issue with Pseudo-AI approaches is the potential for breaches of privacy and confidentiality. A computer that processes information in isolation can safeguard data to various extents, but putting random humans in the loop is a recipe for potential data privacy breaches.

For example, AI solutions that process information in regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, or government systems can be compromised by humans that are not allowed to view confidential or private information. In one instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was legislated in the United States to help insure patient privacy. If a company lies about using computers to schedule appointments that contain private patient data, it isn’t clear whether or not they are able to uphold the standards set forth by HIPAA for patient information privacy and security. This could get companies employing Pseudo-AI approaches in a lot of hot water. 
Besides these issues, we need to also consider the basic ethical considerations of faking artificial intelligence. If you aren’t disclosing your company’s use of humans, there is a major ethical issue at hand. Is it okay to lie to your customers and the public in general?
Is Pseduo-AI The Exception in the AI Industry or an Increasing Reality?
While there are some companies implementing Pseudo-AI approaches, there are plenty of other companies who are in fact really using artificial intelligence across a range of implementation patterns. Many of them recognize and admit that there are still advancements needing to be made before their technology is perfected. Indeed, there are an increasing number of real-world use cases and case studies from actual implementation of machine learning across an increasing range of applications.
For those that are evaluating third-party solutions that claim AI capabilities, you should maintain an optimistic but skeptical perspective. One area of evaluation for AI solutions should be due diligence to see if the company has any humans in the loop that would otherwise be part of what the AI system should be doing. Ask the solution provider if there is ever a human that views the information, even if it is just to validate it. You can have them attest to the program being solely run by computers when signing contracts with them. 
One question that a lot of people come to when they find that there are faked AI services is: have we hit a wall in artificial intelligence development? At this point, we don’t completely know. Some companies, such as Facebook that have failed at some AI-based programs, but instead have leveraged humans masquerading as machines show that there are problems developing artificial intelligence even amongst the big names.
Only time will tell if we’ve hit a true roadblock in AI development and capabilities, or these stumbles are just speed bumps on the road to progress. What we do know though, is that companies need to take a serious look at how they market their products. Ethics is important not just from the viewpoint of providing a solution that matches customer and user expectations, but also about instilling trust in a technology that some are still very much wary of or dubious. Faking it until you make it is problematic from many perspectives, and we hope that even as a stop gap, this approach quickly falls from usage.

The machines are coming and they want your job, at a minimum. Scary stories are easy to find in all the erudite places where the tech visionaries of Silicon Valley and Seattle, the cosmopolitan elite of New York City, and the policy wonks of Washington, DC, converge—TED talks, Davos, ideas festivals, Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, The New York Times, Hollywood films, South by Southwest, Burning Man. The brilliant innovator Elon Musk and the genius theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking have been two of the most quotable and influential purveyors of these AI predictions. AI poses “an existential threat” to civilization, Elon Musk warned a gathering of governors in Rhode Island one summer’s day.WIRED OPINIONABOUTKevin Scott is the CTO and executive vice president of AI and research at Microsoft. He's the author of the book Reprogramming the American Dream: From Rural America to Silicon Valley—Making AI Serve Us All.Musk’s words are very much on my mind as the car I drive (it’s not autonomous, not yet) crests a hill in the rural southern Piedmont region of Virginia, where I was born and raised. From here I can almost see home, the fields once carpeted by lush green tobacco leaves and the roads long ago bustling with workers commuting from profitable textile mills and furniture plants. But that economy is no more. Poverty, unemployment, and frustration are high, as they are with our neighbors across the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachia and to the north in the Rust Belt. I am driving between Rustburg, the county seat, and Gladys, an unincorporated farming community where my mom and brother still live.I left this community, located down the road from where Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, because even as a kid I could see the bitter end of an economy that used to hum along, and I couldn’t wait to chase my own dreams of building computers and software. But these are still my people, and I love them. Today, as one of the many tech entrepreneurs on the West Coast, my feet are firmly planted in both urban California and rural Southern soil. I’ve come home to talk with my classmates; to reconcile those bafflingly confident, anxiety-producing warnings about the future of jobs and artificial intelligence that I frequently hear among thought leaders in Silicon Valley, New York City, and DC, to see for myself whether there might be a different story to tell.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIIf I can better understand how the friends and family I grew up with in Campbell County are faring today, a generation after one economic tidal wave swept through, and in the midst of another, perhaps I can better influence the development of advanced technologies that will soon visit their lives and livelihoods. In addition to serving as Microsoft’s CTO, I also am the executive vice president of AI and research. It’s important for those of us building these technologies to meet people where they are, on factory floors, the rooms and hallways of health care facilities, in the classrooms and the agricultural fields.I pull off Brookneal Highway, the two-lane main road, into a wide gravel parking lot that’s next to the old house my friends W. B. and Allan Bass lived in when we were in high school. A sign out front proclaims that I’ve arrived at Bass Sod Farm. The house is now headquarters for their sprawling agricultural operation. It’s just around the corner from my mom’s house, and in a sign of the times, near a nondescript cinder-block building that houses a CenturyLink hub for high-speed internet access. Prized deer antlers, a black bear skin, and a stuffed bobcat adorn its conference room, which used to be the family kitchen.W.B. and Allan were popular back in the day. They always had a nice truck with a gun rack, and were known for their hunting and fishing skills. The Bass family has worked the same plots of Campbell County tobacco land for five generations, dating back to the Civil War. Within my lifetime, Barksdale the grandfather, Walter the father, and now W.B. (Walter Barksdale) and brother Allan have worked the land alongside a small team of seasonal workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThousands of families in Campbell County used to grow and sell tobacco, but today only two families continue. Trouble for the tobacco industry began in 1964, when the surgeon general’s report officially recognized the health risks of tobacco. In the years since, between decreased demand, increased foreign competition, and no federal regulation of quotas, tobacco prices have plummeted. Eventually, the industry that was once a major employer in rural Virginia evaporated.AdvertisementThe Bass family grew brightleaf tobacco, commonly known as Virginia tobacco. With “bright” you cultivate the leaves only, about 18 to 22 leaves per stalk, for cigarettes. They also sold dark tobacco, which involves cultivating the whole stalk and using it for chewing tobacco and cigars. By 2005 the Bass family saw the writing on the wall for its once valuable operation, and began to transition their land from tobacco to sod, or turf—a grassy product they sell to construction companies for new and refurbished building landscapes, golf courses, and sports fields. By 2008 they were completely out of tobacco, and today their products are a new shade of green—Bermuda, zoysia, and fescue. They also grow some soybeans. “People gotta eat, but they won’t always need sod,” Allan said.As with any business, the cell phone and PC are ubiquitous at Bass Sod Farm. They also employed some automation technology to assist workers, including a Trebro harvester that rolls up the sod, stacks it on a pallet, and ensures minimum waste. Allan Bass took 40 hours of training to learn how to use it, and he has now put in about 3,000 hours of operation. According to Allan, “it’s an art and a science” to harvest the sod just right. The Bass brothers recently added GPS technology to their sprayers, significantly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. That transition is still a work in progress. “We don’t have it down pat yet,” Allan admits.What bugs them, though, is that technology is not as transparent as it used to be. The problem with self-driving tractors and GPS-guided sprayers is that you can’t see what’s broken, or at least your average farmer can’t. Their biggest worry is not some threat from AI, but making sure that the technology they do have is self-healing: “If something fails, you spend lots of time debugging it.” And the time Allan spends debugging his farm equipment is a big productivity hit for their small business.They regard tools enhanced with what I would describe as advanced machine learning, or early AI, as something that will be helpful in gathering intelligence on their crops. Drones, for instance, can take scores of pictures of “hot spots” on their crops to find irrigation problems, insects, and disease. They can be trained to find out about most potential calamities and provide an early warning system, likely saving many of the human jobs that would have been lost if the problem went undetected and the crops were ruined. Although the Basses feel their human solution has worked —“What we’ve got is working. Humans know what to look for”—it is time-consuming and costly for their small workforce to comb through acres of farmlands, looking for minute details. They’d much rather deploy human capital to expansion, quicker delivery, and product innovation—anything but walking mile after mile.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe Bass boys are optimistic. Business is good, and W.B.’s son chose to remain in Campbell County even though he’s become a computer engineer in nearby Lynchburg. The green shoots of the next Industrial Revolution can be seen at Bass Sod Farm.But not every business in the area is facing sudden transformation. Nearby, in Brookneal, Virginia, Sheri Denton Guthrie manages the finances at Heritage Hall Nursing Home. Heritage cared for three of my grandparents in their final years. I want to better understand how AI will one day affect a place I know all too well, the sort of place that millions of baby boomers will also soon know.Heritage has 17 homes scattered across rural Virginia. It has 60 residents and as many as 80 staff depending on occupancy. Sheri manages the homes’ books and has an astonishing amount of training on a range of health care systems, PointClickCare and Toughbook to name a few. Even with all the available technologies, she says it’s still too hard. Heritage gets paid based on individual residents’ “RUG scores,” short for a Resource Utilization Group calculation for Medicare and Medicaid. Staff go around with Toughbooks and log things like minutes of physical, speech, and occupational therapy; a doctor’s visit; a mental health consult; an IV; help from the nurse assistants. These services all add up to an overall RUG score for which the nursing home is reimbursed.Like the Bass brothers, Sheri is less worried about AI stealing jobs and more concerned about mundane things, like needing her financial system reports to line up on a printer. A few years ago, hackers stole personal records from their health care insurance provider, Anthem, so she also worries about privacy and security. AI-infused robots could almost certainly be trained to do many tasks in the nursing home, from inputting medical data to generate insights to providing medications and even treating wounds. Health care is transforming rapidly, but not uniformly. Sheri has one caveat for the near-term use of advanced technologies: “For our generation, yes, but not this generation. They’d beat the robot with a cane.”After a quick stop at the Golden Skillet for fried chicken, lima beans, and iced tea, I pay a visit to Hugh E. Williams, who manages a small team of workers at American Plastic Fabricators. Hugh E, as all our classmates know him, is a tall, strongly built man with a red beard that is only beginning to hint at his age, with a streak of gray down the middle. Hugh E and I grew up together. He’s proud to show me his plant, now located in an abandoned Bassett-Walker textile factory. Started in 1936 as Bassett Knitting Corporation an hour and a half west of Brookneal in Bassett, Virginia, the old mill was part of a storied Southern industry that turned cotton into clothes. Cotton textiles once dominated the South’s economy, but cheaper labor abroad and earlier forms of automation decimated the workforce. This mill in Brookneal closed with little hope of ever reopening.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDBut years later, a local entrepreneur began a modest company to shape small, precision plastic parts that were needed by a wide range of customers, from theme parks to defense contractors. The business, essentially a job shop, was hit hard by the financial crisis of 2008, but began to grow again in the aftermath by offering competitive pricing on polyethylene and high-density plastics fabrication. Eventually, with more than 20 employees and in need of a larger space, they took over the defunct textile mill. The day I visited, one of the workers was using a sophisticated milling machine controlled by a computer to create an intricate piece for Disneyland’s Jumpin’ Jellyfish ride. Disney sent Hugh E the specifications, workers programmed the machine, and voilà, one by one these young workers carve plastic into industrial works of art. A machinist's diploma from Southside Virginia Community College and a little on-the-job training can land a person a well-paying job in a small town that was once counted out.As I’ve witnessed firsthand, and as many working Americans have experienced personally, manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades now, moving overseas where things can be built cheaper. In Brookneal and across the country, in rural and urban settings alike, new manufacturing jobs are being created because AI, robotics, and advanced automation are becoming more capable and cheaper by the day, making it feasible to build things in the US and other markets where labor costs are high. As automation becomes less expensive and more powerful, small companies are able to lower their unit costs of production and become more competitive. This allows them to grow their businesses and create even more, higher-paying jobs.Combining the best of human skill with the best of automation can result in incredible prosperity. Look no further than Germany’s so-called Mittelstand. These are small- and medium-size enterprises generating less than 50 million euro in revenue annually. Collectively, it accounts for 99.6 percent of German companies, 60 percent of jobs, and over half of Germany’s gross domestic product. These companies are ingenious at finding narrow but valuable markets to serve, then using highly skilled labor and advanced automation to efficiently produce high-quality products. My friend Hugh E’s employer would be in the Mittelstand, along with 3.3 million others. The US should study and improve upon Germany’s model.Microsoft data indicate that manufacturing is among the fastest-growing segments for AI talent and skills. According to LinkedIn, demand for AI skills increased 190 percent between 2015 and 2017. The idea of creating new, skilled, well-paying manufacturing jobs in rural Brookneal would have been implausible a couple of decades ago. Now it is reality—that’s good news. And the better news is that the underlying automation trend will continue to provide ever more powerful, ever cheaper technology that will create even more opportunities for entrepreneurs and workers alike, in both rural and urban America.In the future, it’s likely that some of this automation will be able to do work that humans are doing today. That’s a good thing when it replaces repetitive labor, enabling humans to focus on higher-value work and ideas. That’s what automation has been doing for centuries. From the vantage point of the developed world in the early 21st century, it means more business and more jobs can be repatriated from overseas, that we can build new businesses with new jobs that would be economically infeasible or technically impossible today, and that we all will get higher-quality, cheaper, more innovative goods and services. In his book Hit Refresh, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reports on one such example: Kent International, maker of Bicycle Corporation of America–branded bikes.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDKent made news when it moved 140 jobs from China back to Manning, South Carolina, where the company had invested in robotics to automate many of the tasks once performed by people. What was once a low-tech, high-labor business is going through its own digital transformation and plans. CEO Arnold Kamler told us he plans to add 40 jobs per year, which is considerable growth in a small town. In fact, a number of states competed to land the plant. “A lot of people have that misconception that automation decreases jobs,” a production manager on the line said. “It’s just a different type of job, a more skilled job.” Without the robots, the human jobs wouldn’t exist.It’s likely that AI can help us equalize some of the inequities that have come as a result of late 20th century global free trade. It’s far less likely that we will achieve AI and robotics that are capable of completely replacing human workers in arbitrary manufacturing and service jobs anytime soon. And that’s especially true if we choose to place our thumb on the scale and deliberately pursue the former path versus the latter.In the face of increasingly wild hypothetical scenarios about AI’s potential dominance over humans, the reality of what AI is capable of now, and will be capable of in the near future, is more humbling. Even though AI is progressing incredibly quickly, we still have a way to go before it is able to dramatically transform the world ... for good or ill.My visits with the Bass brothers, Sheri, and Hugh E remind me that sharp intellect and attention to detail and optimism, rooted in today’s tech reality, remain strong among blue-collar, mid-skill rural—and I suspect Rust Belt—leaders and entrepreneurs. AI, robotics, drones, and data will continue to augment, not replace, workers in communities like Gladys and Brookneal for generations to come. Every week of every year I sit in product demonstrations and strategy sessions on AI development. Whether it’s in my role at Microsoft or as an investor in Silicon Valley, I am increasingly assured that AI will ultimately be about human empowerment, not displacement.As the autumn darkness descends on Campbell County, I turn the car around and head back to Mom’s house, just as I did so many times as a kid. I’ve been inspired by my old friends. That night, as sleep comes slowly, I imagine what I could do here to create jobs and help rebuild the local economy.From the book REPROGRAMMING THE AMERICAN DREAM: From Rural America to Silicon Valley—Making AI Serve Us All by Kevin Scott.

From here I can almost see home, the fields once carpeted by lush green tobacco leaves and the roads long ago bustling with workers commuting from profitable textile mills and furniture plants. But that economy is no more. Poverty, unemployment, and frustration are high, as they are with our neighbors across the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachia and to the north in the Rust Belt. I am driving between Rustburg, the county seat, and Gladys, an unincorporated farming community where my mom and brother still live.
I left this community, located down the road from where Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, because even as a kid I could see the bitter end of an economy that used to hum along, and I couldn’t wait to chase my own dreams of building computers and software. But these are still my people, and I love them. Today, as one of the many tech entrepreneurs on the West Coast, my feet are firmly planted in both urban California and rural Southern soil. I’ve come home to talk with my classmates; to reconcile those bafflingly confident, anxiety-producing warnings about the future of jobs and artificial intelligence that I frequently hear among thought leaders in Silicon Valley, New York City, and DC, to see for myself whether there might be a different story to tell.
If I can better understand how the friends and family I grew up with in Campbell County are faring today, a generation after one economic tidal wave swept through, and in the midst of another, perhaps I can better influence the development of advanced technologies that will soon visit their lives and livelihoods. In addition to serving as Microsoft’s CTO, I also am the executive vice president of AI and research. It’s important for those of us building these technologies to meet people where they are, on factory floors, the rooms and hallways of health care facilities, in the classrooms and the agricultural fields.
W.B. and Allan were popular back in the day. They always had a nice truck with a gun rack, and were known for their hunting and fishing skills. The Bass family has worked the same plots of Campbell County tobacco land for five generations, dating back to the Civil War. Within my lifetime, Barksdale the grandfather, Walter the father, and now W.B. (Walter Barksdale) and brother Allan have worked the land alongside a small team of seasonal workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico.
Thousands of families in Campbell County used to grow and sell tobacco, but today only two families continue. Trouble for the tobacco industry began in 1964, when the surgeon general’s report officially recognized the health risks of tobacco. In the years since, between decreased demand, increased foreign competition, and no federal regulation of quotas, tobacco prices have plummeted. Eventually, the industry that was once a major employer in rural Virginia evaporated.
The Bass family grew brightleaf tobacco, commonly known as Virginia tobacco. With “bright” you cultivate the leaves only, about 18 to 22 leaves per stalk, for cigarettes. They also sold dark tobacco, which involves cultivating the whole stalk and using it for chewing tobacco and cigars. By 2005 the Bass family saw the writing on the wall for its once valuable operation, and began to transition their land from tobacco to sod, or turf—a grassy product they sell to construction companies for new and refurbished building landscapes, golf courses, and sports fields. By 2008 they were completely out of tobacco, and today their products are a new shade of green—Bermuda, zoysia, and fescue. They also grow some soybeans. “People gotta eat, but they won’t always need sod,” Allan said.
As with any business, the cell phone and PC are ubiquitous at Bass Sod Farm. They also employed some automation technology to assist workers, including a Trebro harvester that rolls up the sod, stacks it on a pallet, and ensures minimum waste. Allan Bass took 40 hours of training to learn how to use it, and he has now put in about 3,000 hours of operation. According to Allan, “it’s an art and a science” to harvest the sod just right. The Bass brothers recently added GPS technology to their sprayers, significantly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. That transition is still a work in progress. “We don’t have it down pat yet,” Allan admits.
What bugs them, though, is that technology is not as transparent as it used to be. The problem with self-driving tractors and GPS-guided sprayers is that you can’t see what’s broken, or at least your average farmer can’t. Their biggest worry is not some threat from AI, but making sure that the technology they do have is self-healing: “If something fails, you spend lots of time debugging it.” And the time Allan spends debugging his farm equipment is a big productivity hit for their small business.
They regard tools enhanced with what I would describe as advanced machine learning, or early AI, as something that will be helpful in gathering intelligence on their crops. Drones, for instance, can take scores of pictures of “hot spots” on their crops to find irrigation problems, insects, and disease. They can be trained to find out about most potential calamities and provide an early warning system, likely saving many of the human jobs that would have been lost if the problem went undetected and the crops were ruined. Although the Basses feel their human solution has worked —“What we’ve got is working. Humans know what to look for”—it is time-consuming and costly for their small workforce to comb through acres of farmlands, looking for minute details. They’d much rather deploy human capital to expansion, quicker delivery, and product innovation—anything but walking mile after mile.
The Bass boys are optimistic. Business is good, and W.B.’s son chose to remain in Campbell County even though he’s become a computer engineer in nearby Lynchburg. The green shoots of the next Industrial Revolution can be seen at Bass Sod Farm.
But not every business in the area is facing sudden transformation. Nearby, in Brookneal, Virginia, Sheri Denton Guthrie manages the finances at Heritage Hall Nursing Home. Heritage cared for three of my grandparents in their final years. I want to better understand how AI will one day affect a place I know all too well, the sort of place that millions of baby boomers will also soon know.
Heritage has 17 homes scattered across rural Virginia. It has 60 residents and as many as 80 staff depending on occupancy. Sheri manages the homes’ books and has an astonishing amount of training on a range of health care systems, PointClickCare and Toughbook to name a few. Even with all the available technologies, she says it’s still too hard. Heritage gets paid based on individual residents’ “RUG scores,” short for a Resource Utilization Group calculation for Medicare and Medicaid. Staff go around with Toughbooks and log things like minutes of physical, speech, and occupational therapy; a doctor’s visit; a mental health consult; an IV; help from the nurse assistants. These services all add up to an overall RUG score for which the nursing home is reimbursed.
Like the Bass brothers, Sheri is less worried about AI stealing jobs and more concerned about mundane things, like needing her financial system reports to line up on a printer. A few years ago, hackers stole personal records from their health care insurance provider, Anthem, so she also worries about privacy and security. AI-infused robots could almost certainly be trained to do many tasks in the nursing home, from inputting medical data to generate insights to providing medications and even treating wounds. Health care is transforming rapidly, but not uniformly. Sheri has one caveat for the near-term use of advanced technologies: “For our generation, yes, but not this generation. They’d beat the robot with a cane.”
After a quick stop at the Golden Skillet for fried chicken, lima beans, and iced tea, I pay a visit to Hugh E. Williams, who manages a small team of workers at American Plastic Fabricators.

Today’s report represents the first of those conclusions — 43 of them in fact, tied to legislative language that can easily be inserted by Congress during the fiscal year 2021 budget process.RELATED5 concerns the US must tackle to compete in AIThe National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hopes to roll its recommendations into congressional budgets as time goes on.By Aaron MehtaBob Work, the former deputy secretary of defense who is the vice-chairman of the commission, said the report is tied into a broader effort to move DoD away from a focus on large platforms.“What you’re seeing is a transformation to a digital enterprise, where everyone is intent on making the DoD more like a software company. Because in the future, algorithmic warfare, relying on AI and AI enabled autonomy, is the thing that will provide us with the greatest military competitive advantage,” he said during a Wednesday call with reporters.Among the key recommendations:The government should “immediately double non-defense AI R&D funding” to $2 billion for FY21, a quick cash infusion which should work to strengthen academic center and national labs working on AI issues. The funding should “increase agency topline levels, not repurpose funds from within existing agency budgets, and be used by agencies to fund new research and initiatives, not to support re-labeled existing efforts.” Work noted that he recommends this R&D to double again in FY22.The commission leaves open the possibility of recommendations for increasing DoD’s AI investments as well, but said it wants to study the issue more before making such a request. In FY21, the department requested roughly $800 million in AI developmental funding and another $1.7 billion in AI enabled autonomy, which Work said is the right ratio going forward. “We’re really focused on non-defense R&D in this first quarter, because that’s where we felt we were falling further behind,” he said. “We expect DoD AI R&D spending also to increase” going forward.The Director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) should report directly to the Secretary of Defense, and should continue to be led by a three-star officer or someone with “significant operational experience.” The first head of the JAIC, Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, is retiring this summer; currently the JAIC falls under the office of the Chief Information Officer, who in turn reporters to the secretary. Work said the commission views the move as necessary in order to make sure leadership in the department is “driving"" investment in AI, given all the competing budgetary requirements.The DoD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) should establish a steering committee on emerging technology, tri-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Principal Deputy Director of ODNI, in order to “drive action on emerging technologies that otherwise may not be prioritized” across the national security sphere.Government microelectronics programs related to AI should be expanded in order to “develop novel and resilient sources for producing, integrating, assembling, and testing AI-enabling microelectronics.” In addition, the commission calls for articulating a “national for microelectronics and associated infrastructure.”Funding for DARPA’s microelectronics program should be increased to $500 million. The commission also recommends the establishment of a $20 million pilot microelectronics program to be run by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), focused on AI hardware.The establishment of a new office, tentatively called the National Security Point of Contact for AI, and encourage allied government to do the same in order to strengthen coordination at an international level. The first goal for that office would be to develop an assessment of allied AI research and applications, starting with the Five Eyes nations and then expanding to NATO.RELATEDNew Pentagon budget request invests in 4 advanced technologiesThe Pentagon wants to focus its fiscal year 2021 research investments in four broad areas of emerging technologies: hypersonics, artificial intelligence, 5G/microelectroncs, and autonomous platformsBy Nathan StroutOne issue identified early by the commission is the question of ethical AI. The commission recommends mandatory training on the limits of artificial intelligence in the AI workforce, which should include discussions around ethical issues. The group also calls for the Secretary of Homeland Security and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to “share their ethical and responsible AI training programs with state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officials,” and track which jurisdictions take advantage of those programs over a five year period.Missing from the report: any mention of the Pentagon’s Directive 3000.09, a 2012 order laying out the rules about how AI can be used on the battlefield. Last year C4ISRNet revealed that there was an ongoing debate among AI leaders, including Work, on whether that directive was still relevant.While not reflected in the recommendations, Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive who chairs the commission, noted that his team is starting to look at how AI can help with the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, saying ""“We’re in an extraordinary time… we’re all looking forward to working hard to help anyway that we can.”The full report can be read here.Mike Gruss contributed to this report.About  Aaron MehtaAaron Mehta was deputy editor and senior Pentagon correspondent for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and acquisition at the highest levels of the Defense Department and its international partners.Share:More In Artificial IntelligenceSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",Panel wants to double federal spending on AI,"{'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/resizer/av5AMkLDVgx9vUm3-6u-icEKJHk=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/RRPSPGCAR5AODC7B54JJDUHMCI.jpg', '@type': 'ImageObject'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aaron Mehta'}]",,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'C4ISRNet', 'url': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png?d=124'}}","{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/'}",2022-08-18T23:38:13.425Z,2020-04-02T14:11:16.362Z,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/,Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/04/01/panel-wants-to-double-federal-spending-on-ai/,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher

AI a smart career for migrant workers


          
          China Daily |

HANGZHOU-Gong Fei used to work at a construction site in Shandong province, but he has recently found a new job as an artificial intelligence trainer.
Gong, 26, works as an AI trainer for a company in his home city of Tongren, Guizhou province.
AI trainers help computers and machines ""understand"" the human world by categorizing and labeling text, pictures and videos, which are then analyzed by the devices.
Every day, Gong arranges hundreds of pictures on a computer screen into two categories. For images of a soccer match, he needs to annotate them with ""score"" and ""non-score"".
""I need to teach the computer how to recognize the pictures according to the annotations,"" he said. ""These days, more people have higher demands. They want to see more of their favorite stars or some particular scenes, and this is what I do; I make the systems smarter in regard to catering to people's needs.""
Gong said the job is not easy and requires extreme patience.
""Sometimes a picture needs to have up to 100 annotations, and it can take six or seven hours just to do one picture,"" he said.
""But I am glad they offered me this job during this difficult time.""
Gong said he can work from home and reduce his costs, which are much lower than the expenses he incurred while working outside his home province.
During the coronavirus outbreak, many migrant workers who usually leave the countryside for better-paying jobs in big cities have found new professions.
A total of 250,000 programs were added on Alipay, the mobile payment app of e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, during the epidemic. These programs offered 750,000 jobs. In provinces with large numbers of migrant workers, such as Shaanxi and Guizhou, thousands of workers have chosen to stay in their hometowns to become AI trainers.
The jobs are permanent and pay well. Alibaba said it had turned out 100,000 AI trainers, with their average payment expected to rise by at least 50 percent.
""I heard that my job has been officially recognized as a new profession by the government,"" Gong said.
Early last month, the government listed 16 jobs as new professions, including AI trainers.
Yang Weiguo, a professor of labor and human resources at Renmin University, said stabilizing and increasing employment is important. ""The digital era has created new professions,"" he said.
Lyu Peng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: ""The internet has truly played an important part during the epidemic. It digitalized China's service industry and became a new engine to power employment.""

Most organizations have begun to invest in AI to guide their sales representatives as it helps organizations stay adaptable to changing customer needs and evolving markets. AI guided selling usually takes the form of machine learning generated advice offered to reps on their CRM or other software. It’s primarily designed to help salespeople stay organized, prioritize leads, choose the customer most likely to buy for their next sales call, and so on. When its impact is fully realized, it gives salespeople more time to sell and information that they leverage to sell more effectively. I’ve seen solutions like this work, even quite well. With such great promise, companies are investing in and designing their own custom solutions. Many start-ups are developing solutions and makers of CRM software have widgets designed to address AI-guided selling. In my experience most companies are struggling to implement this approach.


Although most of these initiatives fail, an investment in AI is more critical now than ever. But why do they fail? After many conversations with business leaders about these failures, I’ve noticed a pattern: Many leaders point to absence of sufficiently robust data to fuel machine learning models. Without enough data, AI can’t make accurate predictions and if the system fails to make salespeople more insightful or effective, adoption plummets. Sales organizations find themselves in this situation for many reasons, from the inability to stitch together a comprehensive view of customers to transaction data that resides in siloed repositories, to poor CRM data or the inability to stitch the data together to enable sophisticated analysis. But it’s almost always more than data that limits the success of such efforts and solving these challenges are essential to driving the success of such initiatives. These include alignment across leadership, leveraging first line managers, picking the right models and fitting in with current processes.

1. Align leadership and evolve the metrics. Alignment among leadership on the vision for how AI will enable sales is critical to long-term success. This is a journey that requires alignment around different priorities at each stage. At first, AI guided selling may be about getting salespeople to try and then adopt the solution, while over time it may evolve to recommendation acceptance rates and participation in the feedback loop, and so on. While revenue matters, in the end, success is about embedding the right habits in place. Revenue and customer success will follow adoption.

2. Involve first line sales managers. The importance of first line sales managers can’t be overstated. They play several important roles in any sales organization including but not limited to managing sales representatives, customers and the business. In AI guided selling, if managers aren’t engaged early and often, from bringing the solution to life to ensuring that reps participate, adoption will lag. So thinking through how to get managers aligned with the objectives of such an initiative and familiar with the details of such an implementation is critical. And since managers play an active role in guiding how salespeople strategize and execute in their territories, driving this kind of behavior change across the sales organization requires the integration of AI in all rep-to-manager interactions.

3. The model must fit the need and be effective. First, models must fit their environments. For example, when enabling an inside salesperson who has responsibility for a hundred or more accounts, you’ll need a model that provides the right information about the right customer at the right time. Arguably, it’s difficult for a sales person to know and stay in touch with all customers across multiple products so this functionally is useful. In contrast, when enabling a salesperson with few, large strategic accounts, you’ll need a model that can coordinate sales efforts across myriad activities and individuals. Secondly, models must appropriately balance accuracy and explainability. With the current state of AI, greater accuracy comes at the cost of sacrificing clarity about why it’s made certain decisions. (The more complex the calculation, the harder it is to explain to a user with any efficiency.) If a salesperson receives a recommendation with limited explanation as to why it’s being made, she’ll be less likely to trust it, which will harm adoption.

4. Don’t let data insufficiency stop you. Yes, better data leads to more robust predictions but finding adequate data is a journey for most organizations and while it’s a worthwhile investment, it’s likely to take time. Data insufficiency, however, doesn’t have to mean you do not begin. There are many paths to addressing this challenge, including beginning with educated guesswork while a more comprehensive data journey is considered. For example, organizations can direct salespeople to call on customers who have not been called on in the recent past. Such simple heuristics will generate customer insights that will be useful for guided selling and lead to increased sophistication over time.

5. Augment the customer engagement process. AI guided selling solutions must enrich and augment the current customer engagement process. If an AI guided selling initiative requires salespeople to change the customer engagement process to accommodate, adoption will be difficult. AI guided selling solutions must fit within the natural workflow of the sales representative.
