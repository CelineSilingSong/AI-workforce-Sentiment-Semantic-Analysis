Every minute, creators upload 300 hours of video to the platform. With this number of users, activity, and content, it makes sense for YouTube to take advantage of the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to help operations. Here are a few ways YouTube, owned by Google, uses artificial intelligence today. 
The Amazing Ways YouTube Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine LearningAdobe Stock

Automatically remove objectionable content 

In the first quarter of this year, 8.3 million videos were removed from YouTube, and 76% were automatically identified and flagged by artificial intelligence classifiers. More than 70% of these were identified before there were any views by users. While the algorithms are not foolproof, they are combing through content much more quickly than if humans were trying to monitor the platform singlehandedly. In some cases, the algorithm pulled down newsworthy videos mistakenly seeing them as “violent extremism.” This is just one of the reasons Google has full-time human specialists employed to work with AI to address violative content. 

In fact, according to Cecile Frot-Coutaz, head of EMEA, YouTube’s “number one priority” is to protect its users from harmful content. In pursuit of that, the company invested in not only human specialists but the machine learning technology to support the effort. AI has contributed greatly to YouTube's ability to quickly identify objectionable content. Before using artificial intelligence, only 8% of videos containing ""violent extremism"" (banned on the platform) were flagged and removed before ten views had occurred; but after machine learning was used, more than half of the videos removed had fewer than ten views. 

PROMOTED
One of the main drivers for YouTube's diligence in removing objectionable content is the pressure from brands, agencies, and governments and the backlash that's experienced if ads appear alongside offensive videos. When ads started appearing next to YouTube videos supporting racism and terrorism, Havas UK and other brands began pulling their advertising dollars. In response, YouTube deployed advanced machine learning and partnered with third-party companies to help provide transparency to advertising partners. 
The company also has a “trashy video classifier” in use which scans YouTube’s homepage and “watch next” panels. It looks at the feedback from viewers who might report a misleading title, inappropriate or other objectionable content.

New effects on videos 
Move over Snapchat, Google’s artificial intelligence researchers trained a neural network to be able to swap out backgrounds on videos without the need for specialized equipment. While it's been possible to do this for decades—think green screens that are replaced by digital effects—it was a complicated and time-consuming process. The researchers trained an algorithm with carefully labeled imagery that allowed the algorithm to learn patterns, and the result is a fast system that can keep up with video.

“Up Next” feature 
If you have ever used YouTube’s “Up Next” feature, you benefited from the platform’s artificial intelligence. Since the dataset on YouTube is constantly changing as its users upload hours of video every minute, the AI required to power its recommendation engine needed to be different than the recommendation engines of Netflix or Spotify. It had to be able to handle real-time recommendations while new data is constantly added by users. The solution they came up with is a two-part system. The first is candidate generation, where the algorithm assesses the YouTube history of the user. The second part is the ranking system that assigns a score to each video.

Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google employee and founder of an initiative urging greater transparency known as AlgoTransparency, explained that the metric used by YouTube’s algorithm to determine a successful recommendation is watch time. This is good for the platform and the advertisers, but not so good for the users, he said. This situation could amplify videos that have outlandish content, and the more people spend time watching it, the more it gets recommended.  
Training on depth prediction 
With so much data, YouTube videos provide a fertile training ground for artificial intelligence algorithms. Google AI researchers used more than 2,000 ""mannequin challenge"" videos posted on the platform to create an AI model with the ability to discern the depth of field in videos. The ""mannequin challenge"" had groups of people in a video stand still as if frozen while one person goes through the scene shooting the video. Ultimately, this skill of depth prediction could help propel the development of augmented reality experiences. 
With the continuing crisis of mass shootings plaguing America, President Trump requested that social media companies, ""develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike."" With the assistance of artificial intelligence, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook already work to delete terrorist content, but what's new in the President's request is that they work with the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies. There are many questions about how such a partnership would work, if social media channels could detect actual terrorists before they act and the potential to impact the civil liberties of innocent people. Whether YouTube and other social media companies could use artificial intelligence to stop terrorists while not infringing on the rights of others remains to be seen.

The following are a few hypotheses as to why Artificial Intelligence projects fail and some observations on company reactions (technical and organizational) to AI projects lack of delivered value. Please note these opinions do not reflect on any current or prior employers, but are a synthesis of conversations with data scientists, engineers, product managers and architects across industries.Hypothesis #1: Data Science initial models don’t scale or are too experimental to be used by internal or external customers.Projects often start here as companies hire on a few data scientists who build their models in Python or R, only to discover quickly that there is a difference in mindset between data scientists and engineers. In the short run this problem is often solved by having machine learning engineers or other software engineers take the code, rewrite it and follow standard dev-ops processes in order to scale and deploy the application. Given the stochastic nature of results, Quality Engineering also needs to scale to the task. During this transition period, business users (and/or their proxy product managers) can be left out of the process and the requirements or underlying data may change.Organizationally, some companies take the next step of hiring engineers into the data science group to help the data scientists learn more about scaling for production and deployments. The goal with this approach is to alleviate the handoff process. The challenges are that this research/engineering organization can become siloed away from the rest of the production support workflow. “Data Scientists don’t wear pagers on call”.Hypothesis #2: Data science/ML models while brilliant and innovative don’t meet the business requirements or are too fragile to respond to change in the supporting data.At the recommendation of consulting groups, some companies make the decision that in order to foster innovation, “innovation teams” need to be isolated from the “non-digital” cultures which surround them. But while isolated innovation teams can lead to great opportunities for experimentation and those teams can learn and develop interesting solutions, when the resultant projects then need to be “pushed” to the market or internal customers, there is often minimal adoption. While the solution may meet the specific challenge, the experience for the user is often less than optimal. Lack of a less complex model to fall back upon if the data changes can also present a challenge. On the upside, the research can be published in academic journals read by other data scientists to further overall industry knowledge.In response to this non-adoption problem, some innovation/data science teams may add product marketers to their organization to “promote” their work internally and to try to market their concepts to customers directly.Hypothesis #3: AI initiatives are driven by the company’s internal IT organizations and inherit “waterfall” challenges.As part of a “digital transformation”, some companies see AI as part of an overall data warehouse initiative or as part of an automation effort for customer management or marketing applications. The need for “labelled” (appropriately tagged) data in AI or Machine Learning means that companies will also need to have a fairly mature analytics and data capture infrastructure in place. While it may seem rational to approach AI and Machine Learning as part of an overall IT data project, without an accompanying experimental/prototyping initiative, AI projects can be buried as a consequence. Ironically, when the data is finally ready in the data pipelines, the customer needs may have changed completely (ex: optimizing around CD distribution while the company strategy moves to streaming).Hypothesis #4: Companies don’t have the patience for the time it takes to deliver on AI/ML projects.Given the uncertainty of success and timelines for many proposed AI/ML projects, they may die before they even have a chance to begin. Add to this the newness of the technology and the head-start dominance of Google, Amazon and Microsoft and the result is that non-direct consumer-oriented enterprise companies may talk AI, but start with Business Process Automation tools as their first foray and wait for things to settle (capturing data along the way for the future).Hypothesis #5: A lack of a “Product” approach to AI/ML projects is core to project failure and increased risk.The role of Product Manager/Owner in Agile software development is clear in software development. Product Managers work as part of a team including UX, Engineering, QA and Project Management. What seems to be missing in AI projects is this same “Product” mindset. Good Product Managers understand how to ask or find the highest value business questions. Experienced Product Managers are experts at managing the uncertainty of product delivery. Seasoned Analytics Product Managers understand where the data is missing or buried. So, the question of the day may not be “Where are all the data scientists we need?”, but rather “Where are all the AI Product Managers who know how to ask the right questions?”Summary:Fundamentally AI/ML projects will not succeed unless the same “Agile” “Lean” Product approach is taken up by technically savvy product managers to meet the challenges of risk, territory battles and failure to solve or answer the business questions. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers need to be integral to product development teams. Much as “Design Thinking” brought UX on board to software development teams, so “AI thinking” needs to integrate AI research into product development. AI product managers need business executive support to guide the business value evaluation process and to balance technology/data science agendas.While the shake-up continues in AI Cloud Platforms and while tooling is changing rapidly, companies who step up and train or hire AI Product Managers with the requisite technical or data skills and challenge them to find a business question to answer with a team of UX Designers, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Software Engineers, coordinated by a project manager who understands and can communicate uncertainty rationally will be a long ways down the road to leverage AI to success.Companies who already have tagged data streams like those in e-commerce and finance/payments have a head start and provide good models for others on how to scale, but it will be by asking the right questions and leveraging and scaling ML/NLP/AI to get the right answers that some of them will lead the pack over the next decades.",,2019-08-23T11:10:42.223Z,7c6b2c456d41,['Alison Doucette'],https://towardsdatascience.com/five-hypotheses-as-to-why-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-projects-fail-7c6b2c456d41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organizations are beginning to grasp the severity of burnout and the impact it has on your life and health in the long term. Work can be stressful, and due to many factors including a combination of hours, tasks, measurement and intensity, some jobs result in mental, physical and emotional exhaustion. If stress accumulates to a breaking point, you reach overload, fatigue and ultimately burnout.

Job Burnout On The Rise
A survey reported this month by Skye Learning found that a majority of American workers report job burnout. Gallup studied nearly 7,500 full-time employees and found that 23% reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes. Recently the World Health Organization officially recognized “employee burnout” as a medical condition. Burnout costs organizations in the form of high employee turnover, increased medical and insurance costs and drops in productivity. It can be even more dangerous for you, the employee, because it puts your well-being and mental health at risk.
Your Decision-Fatigued Brain 
When you make decisions after working days on end, chances are they’ll be different from the ones you’d make after your brain has a rest period. Why? Scientists have discovered a phenomenon known as decision fatigue—which is what happens when your brain is worn out, depleted of mental energy. Decision fatigue is why many wage earners have little mental energy left over for activities outside of work. After hours of nonstop working, your brain can suffer from cognitive overload, compassion fatigue and burnout. The longer you work and the more choices you make in those extended work hours, the more difficult it is for your strained mind to make sound decisions. It becomes hard to make even ordinary choices, such as what to wear, where to eat, how much to spend or how to prioritize work projects. So you start to take short cuts, permitting your newly licensed teenager to drive the car on an icy night or opting out of responsibilities and decision making at work. You’re short with coworkers and loved ones; you eat junk food instead of healthy meals; you tell your spouse to pick the restaurant for dinner.
PROMOTED
Artificial Intelligence And Burnout Prevention
To prevent decision fatigue and burnout, your brain needs restorative rest just like your body does when you’re tired. You can change bad habits and prevent stress accumulation and burnout by engaging in certain activities such as brisk exercise, relaxing in nature, power napping and in practices such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, prayer, meditation, laughing, yoga, massage and tai chi. While these tools never go out of style, some of the world’s top companies such as MetLife and Humana are employing innovative new technology to offset burnout by enhancing employee engagement, improving customer experience and providing a more emotionally intelligent and empathetic workplace.
Dr. Skyler Place, Chief Behavioral Science Officer and Head of People at Cogito, told me, “One significant working population that is highly susceptible to burn out is call center workers, of which there are an estimated five million in the U.S. alone. Their working environment leads them to feel a lack of support and control. They are caught between customers who are often frustrated and management who is under pressure to achieve corporate goals. Performing repetitive tasks and carrying the burden of emotionally tense situations is extremely draining, even for the most seasoned professional. In the call center specifically burnout and churn are on the rise, and many organizations can experience churn of greater than 50%, according to the 2018 Contact Babel Decision Maker’s Guide.”
According to Dr. Place, some organizations are looking at new technological advancements that can help alleviate cognitive overload, compassion fatigue and employee burnout: “One such technology comes from Cogito, which leverages a foundation of behavioral science in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide employees, especially during stressful customer interactions, empowering them and helping them perform better. One large insurance company has stated how employee churn has decreased by 10% amongst agents as a result of Cogito’s in-call communication guidance, more objective feedback from supervisors and better customer rapport. Cogito is unique in its application, where traditionally technology was deployed exclusively to provide insights to management and ignored the emotional state of the employee. Cogito is designed to recognize the behavioral dynamics of each individual and deliver in-the-moment coaching that helps them professionally manage a given situation. Cogito applies AI to augment an employee’s—and specifically call center agent’s—natural abilities, giving them the assistance they need to better help emotional customers and meet their performance goals.”
Cogito’s AI coach analyzes human behavior through voice and provides in-the-moment feedback during conversations. The software provides nudges to call-center agents via the display of in-the-moment cues—for example a coffee cup when energy is low or a heart when a customer’s emotional state changes, indicating a need for empathy. It guides agents during conversations to be more emotionally intelligent, which takes some of the cognitive burden off of them and helps better control conversations. It also helps them lead customers through challenging situations without taking on the emotional burden. The nudges Cogito applies lead to positive behavior change that helps the agent and the customer while driving operational value for the organization.
Dr. Place concludes that this win-win dynamic comes from applying behavioral science in a way that can reduce burnout while increasing value to the corporation, “This is the true calling for AI—augmenting humans in ways that increase their quality of life, providing in-the-moment and on-the-job training and allowing their organizations to be competitive in the market.”

            The robots. They’re coming for your jobs. All of you.
    

            Long the prediction of futurists and philosophers, the lived reality of technology replacing human work has been a constant feature since the cotton gin, the assembly line and, more recently, the computer.
    

            What is very much up for debate in the imaginations of economists and Hollywood producers is whether the future will look like “The Terminator,” with self-aware Schwarzenegger bots on the hunt, or “The Jetsons,” with obedient robo-maids leaving us humans very little work and plenty of time for leisure and family. The most chilling future in film may be that in Disney’s “Wall-E,” where people are all too fat to stand, too busy staring at screens to talk to each other and too distracted to realize that the machines have taken over.
    

            We’re deep into what-ifs with those representations, but the conversation about robots and work is increasingly paired with the debate over how to address growing income inequality – a key issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
    

        The workplace is changing. How should Americans deal with it?


            “There’s no simple answer,” said Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley, an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at UC San Francisco and the author of a forthcoming book, “Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control.” “But in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away, so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy. “
    

            In his book, Russell writes, “One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary.”

            That’s either a very frightening or a tantalizing prospect, depending very much on whether and how much you (and/or society) think people ought to have to work and how society is going to put a price on human labor. 
    

            There will be less work in manufacturing, less work in call centers, less work driving trucks, and more work in health care and home care and construction.
    

            MIT Technology Review tried to track all the different reports on the effect that automation will have on the workforce. There are a lot of them. And they suggest anywhere from moderate displacement to a total workforce overhaul with varying degrees of alarm. 
    

            One of the reports, by the McKinsey Global Institute, includes a review of how susceptible to automation different jobs might be and finds that hundreds of millions of people worldwide will have to find new jobs or learn new skills. Learning new skills can be more difficult than it sounds, as CNN has found at car plants, such as the one that closed in Lordstown, Ohio.

        More robots means more inequality


            Almost everyone who has thought seriously about this has said that more automation is likely to lead to more inequality.

            It is indisputable that businesses have gotten more and more productive but workers’ wages have not kept pace.

            “Our analysis shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution,” according to McKinsey. “Some occupations that are currently low wage, such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants, will also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupations will have the largest employment declines.”
    

            “The likely challenge for the future lies in coping with rising inequality and ensuring sufficient (re-)training especially for low qualified workers,” according to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
    

            One Democratic presidential candidate – Andrew Yang, the insurgent nonpolitician – has built his campaign around solving this problem. Yang blames the automation of jobs more than outsourcing to China for the decline of American manufacturing and draws a direct line between that shrinking manufacturing sector and the rise of Donald Trump.
    

            “We need to wake people up,” Yang recently told The Atlantic. “This is the reality of why Donald Trump is our President today, because we already blasted away millions of American jobs and people feel like they have lost a path forward.”
    

        If automation takes the jobs, should all people get a government paycheck? 


            Yang’s answer to the problem is to give everyone in the US, regardless of need, an income – he calls it a “freedom dividend” – of $1,000 per month. It would address inequality, both economic and racial, he argues, and let people pursue work that adds value to the community.
    

            It’s not a new idea. Congress and President Richard Nixon nearly passed just such a proposal in the early 1970s as part of the war on poverty. But now, after decades of the GOP distancing itself from social programs, the idea of a universal basic income seems about as sci-fi as the new “Terminator” movie (yes, they’re making another one) that’s coming out this year.

            “Ninety-four percent of the new jobs created in the US are gig, temporary or contractor jobs at this point, and we still just pretend it’s the ’70s, where it’s like, ‘You’re going to work for a company, you’re going to get benefits, you’re going to be able to retire, even though we’ve totally eviscerated any retirement benefits, but somehow you’re going to retire, it’s going to work out,’ ” Yang said in that Atlantic interview. “Young people look up at this and be like, ‘This does not seem to work.’ And we’re like, ‘Oh, it’s all right.’ It’s not all right. We do have to grow up.”
    

            He specifically points to truck driving as a profession that is key to the US economy today but could and may be fully automated in the very near future. Automating trucking will help the environment, save money and help productivity, he says. But it won’t help truck drivers.
    

            On the other hand, truck driving, while honorable work, might not be many people’s life’s ambition. In this way, robots would be taking jobs that humans might not want unless they had to do them, which they currently do. 
    

            “When you accept these circumstances, that we’re going to be competing against technologies that have a marginal cost of near zero, then quickly you have to say OK, then, how are we going to start valuing our time? What does a 21st century economy look like in a way that serves our interests and not the capital efficiency machine?” he says. And that’s how he, and a lot of liberal economists and capitalists like Elon Musk, arrive at the idea of a basic income.
    

            Yang argued at a CNN town hall this year that it’s not enough for people to organize as workers in unions to protect jobs.
    

            “I don’t think we have the time to remake the workforce in that way,” he said. “We should start distributing value directly to Americans.”
    

            Creating a population that can subsist on a basic income, without work, would end up reshaping how society works altogether.
    

            “For some, UBI represents a version of paradise. For others, it represents an admission of failure – an assertion that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society,” writes Russell. “They can be fed and housed – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices.”
    

            Yang is focused more on the immediate threat he says automation poses to American jobs. And politicians aren’t talking about it honestly because they are too focused on being optimistic.
    

            “You’re a politician, your incentives are to say we can do this, we can do that, we can do the other thing and then meanwhile society falls apart.”
    

        What to do with our time?


            Not everyone thinks society would fall apart, and there’s actually been a lot of serious concern about what people will do when productivity increases to a point where they don’t have to work as much.
    

            In an important paper in 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that humans would have to grapple with their leisure in the generations to come.
    

            “To those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet – until they get it,” he wrote, later adding that “man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”
    

            Rather than grappling with the problem of leisure, automation can often lead to unforeseen problems. The cotton gin made it so slaves in the American South did not have to remove seeds from cotton, but it also led to an explosion of slavery as cotton became more easily produced.
    

            And while it makes life easier on individual workers, managing the transition from one type of economy to the next (farmer to manufacturer, to information specialist and now beyond) has been a key long-term reality for the American worker.
    

        Is the pace of change different this time?


            No one has thought more about this than labor unions. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler agrees with Yang that automation is one of the biggest challenges we’re facing as a country and it’s not getting the attention it deserves. But she’s not yet worried about dystopia.
    

            “The scare tactics are a little extreme,” she said in an interview, arguing that reports of tens of millions of American jobs lost by 2030 are probably overstated.
    

            “Every time a technological shift has taken place in this country there have been those doomsday scenarios,” she said in an interview. 
    

            It was already an issue in the 1950s, Shuler pointed out. “You have (then-United Auto Workers President) Walter Reuther testifying before Congress talking about how automation was going to change work and people were making these wild predictions that if you brought robots into auto plants that there would be massive unemployment,” she said. 
    

            Reuther’s testimony is really interesting to read, by the way. Check it out. “The revolutionary change produced by automation is its tendency to displace the worker entirely from the direct operation of the machine,” he said. He argued that unions weren’t opposed to automation but that they wanted more help from companies and from the government for workers dealing with a changing workplace. 
    

            “What ended up happening is what they call bargained acquiescence,” said Shuler, “where the unions went to the table and said ‘OK, we get it, this technology is coming, but how are we going to manage the change? How are we going to have a worker voice at the table? How are we going to make sure that working people benefit from this and the company is able to be more efficient and successful?’ “
    

            Yang counters that argument by noting that automation has sped up, making it harder for workers, employers and the government to adjust. “Unlike with previous waves of automation, this time new jobs will not appear quickly enough in large enough numbers to make up for it,” he said on his website.
    

        Somewhere in the middle is where we’ll end up


            Shuler said American workers need to have the conversation about the future of work more urgently today.
    

            “We all have a choice to make,” she said. “Do we want technology to benefit working people, and our country, as a result, does better? Or do we want to follow a path of this dark, dystopian view that work is going to go away and people are going to have nothing to do and we’re just going to be essentially working at the whims of a bunch of robots?” 
    

            Somewhere in the middle, she argued, is where we’ll end up. 
    

            “We’re going to work alongside technology as it evolves. New work is going to emerge. We want to make sure working people can transition fairly and justly and responsibly and we can only do that if working people have a seat at the table.”
    

        The long-term future


            Shuler has an interest in workers and their rights today, but Russell writes that long-term, as automation of work becomes more tangible, the country will have to change its entire outlook on work and what we teach children and people to strive for. 
    

            “We need a radical rethinking of our educational system and our scientific enterprise to focus more attention on the human rather than the physical world,” he writes. “It sounds odd to say that happiness should be an engineering discipline, but that seems to be the inevitable conclusion. “
    

            In other words: We will have to figure out how to be happy with the robots and the automation, because they are coming.

Yang’s answer to the problem is to give everyone in the US, regardless of need, an income – he calls it a “freedom dividend” – of $1,000 per month. It would address inequality, both economic and racial, he argues, and let people pursue work that adds value to the community. It’s not a new idea. Congress and President Richard Nixon nearly passed just such a proposal in the early 1970s as part of the war on poverty. But now, after decades of the GOP distancing itself from social programs, the idea of a universal basic income seems about as sci-fi as the new “Terminator” movie (yes, they’re making another one) that’s coming out this year. “Ninety-four percent of the new jobs created in the US are gig, temporary or contractor jobs at this point, and we still just pretend it’s the ’70s, where it’s like, ‘You’re going to work for a company, you’re going to get benefits, you’re going to be able to retire, even though we’ve totally eviscerated any retirement benefits, but somehow you’re going to retire, it’s going to work out,’ ” Yang said in that Atlantic interview. “Young people look up at this and be like, ‘This does not seem to work.’ And we’re like, ‘Oh, it’s all right.’ It’s not all right. We do have to grow up.” He specifically points to truck driving as a profession that is key to the US economy today but could and may be fully automated in the very near future. Automating trucking will help the environment, save money and help productivity, he says. But it won’t help truck drivers. On the other hand, truck driving, while honorable work, might not be many people’s life’s ambition. In this way, robots would be taking jobs that humans might not want unless they had to do them, which they currently do.  “When you accept these circumstances, that we’re going to be competing against technologies that have a marginal cost of near zero, then quickly you have to say OK, then, how are we going to start valuing our time? What does a 21st century economy look like in a way that serves our interests and not the capital efficiency machine?” he says. And that’s how he, and a lot of liberal economists and capitalists like Elon Musk, arrive at the idea of a basic income. Yang argued at a CNN town hall this year that it’s not enough for people to organize as workers in unions to protect jobs. “I don’t think we have the time to remake the workforce in that way,” he said. “We should start distributing value directly to Americans.” Creating a population that can subsist on a basic income, without work, would end up reshaping how society works altogether. “For some, UBI represents a version of paradise. For others, it represents an admission of failure – an assertion that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society,” writes Russell. “They can be fed and housed – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices.” Yang is focused more on the immediate threat he says automation poses to American jobs. And politicians aren’t talking about it honestly because they are too focused on being optimistic. “You’re a politician, your incentives are to say we can do this, we can do that, we can do the other thing and then meanwhile society falls apart.” What to do with our time? Not everyone thinks society would fall apart, and there’s actually been a lot of serious concern about what people will do when productivity increases to a point where they don’t have to work as much. In an important paper in 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that humans would have to grapple with their leisure in the generations to come. “To those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet – until they get it,” he wrote, later adding that “man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.” Rather than grappling with the problem of leisure, automation can often lead to unforeseen problems. The cotton gin made it so slaves in the American South did not have to remove seeds from cotton, but it also led to an explosion of slavery as cotton became more easily produced. And while it makes life easier on individual workers, managing the transition from one type of economy to the next (farmer to manufacturer, to information specialist and now beyond) has been a key long-term reality for the American worker. Is the pace of change different this time? No one has thought more about this than labor unions. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler agrees with Yang that automation is one of the biggest challenges we’re facing as a country and it’s not getting the attention it deserves. But she’s not yet worried about dystopia. “The scare tactics are a little extreme,” she said in an interview, arguing that reports of tens of millions of American jobs lost by 2030 are probably overstated. “Every time a technological shift has taken place in this country there have been those doomsday scenarios,” she said in an interview.  It was already an issue in the 1950s, Shuler pointed out. “You have (then-United Auto Workers President) Walter Reuther testifying before Congress talking about how automation was going to change work and people were making these wild predictions that if you brought robots into auto plants that there would be massive unemployment,” she said.  Reuther’s testimony is really interesting to read, by the way. Check it out. “The revolutionary change produced by automation is its tendency to displace the worker entirely from the direct operation of the machine,” he said. He argued that unions weren’t opposed to automation but that they wanted more help from companies and from the government for workers dealing with a changing workplace.  “What ended up happening is what they call bargained acquiescence,” said Shuler, “where the unions went to the table and said ‘OK, we get it, this technology is coming, but how are we going to manage the change? How are we going to have a worker voice at the table? How are we going to make sure that working people benefit from this and the company is able to be more efficient and successful?’ “ Yang counters that argument by noting that automation has sped up, making it harder for workers, employers and the government to adjust. “Unlike with previous waves of automation, this time new jobs will not appear quickly enough in large enough numbers to make up for it,” he said on his website. Somewhere in the middle is where we’ll end up Shuler said American workers need to have the conversation about the future of work more urgently today. “We all have a choice to make,” she said. “Do we want technology to benefit working people, and our country, as a result, does better? Or do we want to follow a path of this dark, dystopian view that work is going to go away and people are going to have nothing to do and we’re just going to be essentially working at the whims of a bunch of robots?”  Somewhere in the middle, she argued, is where we’ll end up.  “We’re going to work alongside technology as it evolves. New work is going to emerge. We want to make sure working people can transition fairly and justly and responsibly and we can only do that if working people have a seat at the table.” The long-term future Shuler has an interest in workers and their rights today, but Russell writes that long-term, as automation of work becomes more tangible, the country will have to change its entire outlook on work and what we teach children and people to strive for.  “We need a radical rethinking of our educational system and our scientific enterprise to focus more attention on the human rather than the physical world,” he writes. “It sounds odd to say that happiness should be an engineering discipline, but that seems to be the inevitable conclusion. “ In other words: We will have to figure out how to be happy with the robots and the automation, because they are coming.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190823190831-20190823-robots-automation-2020.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_fill",en,P0Y0M0DT0H9M4S,2041.0,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'contentUrl': '/business/2019/03/05/caption/gm-lordstown-closing.cnn-business_ios_1240.mp4', 'dateModified': '2019-03-06T13:07:44Z', 'uploadDate': '2019-03-06T12:18:56Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=business/2019/03/05/gm-lordstown-closing.cnn-business&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_cd4e5ccdc1153ba1e3ac64838619c2a5@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H02M27S', 'caption': [{'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'vtt', 'url': '/business/2019/03/05/caption/gm-lordstown-closing.cnn-business_2495826_ios__en.vtt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}, {'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'srt', 'url': '/business/2019/03/05/caption/gm-lordstown-closing.cnn-business.srt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}, {'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'vtt', 'url': '/business/2019/03/05/caption/gm-lordstown-closing.cnn-business_1280x720_3500k.vtt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}], 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': 'After 52 years, Lordstown must face life after GM', 'headline': 'After 52 years, Lordstown must face life after GM', 'description': ""GM has been a critical part of this Ohio town's economy for decades.

              Plunging into the Artificial Intelligence Wave
          












The Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology has taken an adventurous leap into the world of artificial intelligence by offering a new bachelor’s degree in the field this fall. Applications of AI are rapidly advancing across industries. Whether it is analyzing risk management in corporate finances, finding tumors in medical images, building an autonomous vehicle to explore other worlds, or designing a horrible supervillain for the next hot video game, AI allows computer scientists to flex their creativity to solve problems in all corners of society.Illinois Tech, the only tech-focused university in Chicago, is taking a lead in cultivating talent in this expanding discipline by becoming one of just a handful of universities in the country to offer an AI bachelor’s degree, and the only one in the Midwest.“AI is the future,” says Aron Culotta, an associate professor of computer science and director of Illinois Tech’s Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence program.“We want to train a workforce that can tackle the challenges and opportunities of the future, which includes AI and machine learning.” While many schools offer courses and concentrations in AI, Illinois Tech—with its long history of preparing innovators who have changed the technology landscape—made the bold decision to create this specially designed degree program.Graduates will be well prepared to work across many sectors, including tech, medicine, finance, robotics, business intelligence, law, and insurance. In addition to software development positions at large tech firms, graduates will also be prepared for AI engineering careers in drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, and web technologies.AI has broad applications that extend far beyond robots and is used daily by anyone who shops online, uses a smartphone, or plays video games. AI technology is used to help first responders prioritize emergency calls, to improve crop yields in agriculture, and to provide virtual teaching assistants for education.“Artificial intelligence is one of the top growth areas in the tech industry and is projected to continue growing in size and importance for the foreseeable future. AI-related job openings have increased nearly five-fold over the past few years, according to various job sites,” Culotta continues.As AI continues to percolate into the daily lives of everyday people,graduates must be equipped with a strong ethical base and highly conscious of how biases can corrupt the fulfillment of AI’s promises. Illinois Tech has integrated ethical thinking into technical courses, which affords critical training in issues of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and bias.“The growing impact of AI on society demands that graduates are capable and ethical collaborators, able to ensure the safe and effective adoption of new technologies across domains,” Culotta says.Also beginning this fall, Illinois Tech is offering a Master of Artificial Intelligence degree designed for computer science professionals who want to advance their career, recent computer science graduates looking to extend their knowledge of artificial intelligence for a competitive edge in the workforce, or those without a computer science degree looking to make a career change into a growing field.

Machines are getting better at writing. They can finish our sentences. They can reply to our emails. They can write news reports and even novels. But just because they can doesn’t mean they should.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is launching a technology revolution that will transform business over the next decade. The most powerful use for AI may be in the area of decision support, where algorithms feed us streams of knowledge and advice as we go about our work. Gartner says AI augmentation alone will create $2.9 trillion (with a “t”) in business value in 2021.
AI evolution is necessary for enterprise security, too, if only because the cybercriminals will use it to build better malware. We’ll benefit from AI in manufacturing, design, transportation and in countless other areas.











 
 
 
In short, AI will prove to be a huge boost to business.

But as we embark on this partnership with artificial intelligence, it’s important that we safeguard human intelligence. And the biggest threat to human intelligence is software that writes.
The creeping takeover of business writing
The mainstreaming of AI business writing began with Google Smart Reply four years ago. Google Inbox users were offered a few colorless options for a reply to most emails. The feature still exists in Gmail, and with a single click you can respond with “Thanks!” or “I’ll send it to you” or “Let’s do Friday!”











 
 
 
Last year Google added Smart Compose, which finishes the sentences you start. You can choose Google’s words by pressing the tab key.
Using Smart Reply and Smart Compose saves time but makes replies dull. They’re dull because Google makes sure the replies are generic and designed to not annoy or offend anyone (for example, Google’s AI never uses gendered pronouns like “he” or “she”), and also because millions of other Gmail users are using the exact same wording for their replies. We all sound the same in our replies.
Google is not alone. Lightkey makes a Windows application that works like Google’s Smart Compose.











 
 
 
Quillbot is a cloud-based tool that can rephrase what you write (or what you copy and paste from others’ writing). It typically produces awkward prose. Machines have no ear for language.
StoryAI is a tool based on OpenAI that will write a whole story if you write the beginning. I tried it by pasting in the opening paragraph of this column. You can read the column StoryAI wrote and decide who did a better job.
We find ourselves in the tragicomic place where AI writes financial news stories mainly for human consumption, but other AI also reads those stories to provide input for automated trading systems. AI does the writing. AI does the reading. And at some point AI is just going to cut humans out of the trade and keep all the money.











 
 
 
Automated writing will not only get better, it will be increasingly built into the tools we use to write things. The temptation to just let the machines do the writing will only grow. What’s wrong with that?
Here’s what’s wrong with that
The main problem with letting AI write for us is that writing isn’t just writing. Writing is one component of literacy, which includes reading, writing and thinking.
Writing involves revision, which clarifies thinking. We think. We write what we think. Then by reading what we write we realize the errors in our thinking, or at least in the way we have expressed our thinking. We rewrite until our thoughts are clearly and accurately and fully expressed. This practice is at the core of our ability to analyze, create, make good decisions and make progress in our lives and in our work.











 
 
 
Literacy and thinking are connected. This was the point of George Orwell’s Newspeak idea in the novel 1984. The totalitarian government in that book used restrictions on language to make complex thought impossible. Its purpose was “to diminish the range of thought” in order to pacify and enervate the public.
Writing, even writing business emails, forces us to confront our own thoughts in black and white. And this makes us cultivate our ability to think clearly.
It’s also the foundation of our ability to talk with logic and coherence. You’ll notice that good writers tend to speak well.











 
 
 
And writing aids memory. Just letting AI communicate for us, even if we choose from a menu of options, makes it easier to forget what “we” said.
More to the point, writing ability is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition, and AI systems that write for us could make us gradually lose it.
By allowing writing tools to do the writing for us, our literacy fades, and we begin to base our decisions on superficial impressions, rather than critical or analytical thinking.











 
 
 
The critical faculty is already under siege with conventions like emoji. By using cartoons in place of words, we communicate vague impressions rather than specific thoughts. As such, it’s not necessary to think specific thoughts in the first place. Textspeak, SMS abbreviations, autocorrect, emojis —- we’re slouching toward idiocracy. AI that writes our business communication for us is the professional version of all that.
Our relationship with literacy exists on a spectrum.
At one end, we’re fully realized humans with language and literacy to think and communicate better. At the other end we’re less human. We’re “echoborgs” — meat puppets who mindlessly regurgitate the words fed to us by AI.











 
 
 
We should be trying to move toward the good end of that spectrum, not the bad one.
Fearmongering over AI is common nowadays — AI, we’re told, will take our jobs and ultimately have no use for us, other than to keep us as pets. This AI technopanic is based on the knowledge that the machines will just keep getting smarter. We should be more worried that AI will make us all dumber.
The most efficient way for AI to make us dumber is to take the task of writing away from us. Our critical and creative faculties will atrophy. Our minds will become dull. And we’ll all become so boring that the machines may not even want us around as pets.











 
 
 
If you’re concerned about AI making us all redundant, you can do something about it today and every day: Don’t let AI put words in your mouth. Reject automated writing in all its forms. Do your own writing. Think for yourself.
The risk isn’t that machines will get smarter. It’s that humans will get dumber.

One-third of activities in about 60% of occupations worldwide could be automatable, according to a 2017 report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. As the technology advances, AI has gained increasing presence. It could perform a widening range of tasks that were previously done by humans and has been used in recruiting and management processes. The increasing prevalence of AI has boosted efficiency and reduced costs for companies but has also drawn concerns about job losses and hidden discrimination. Reuters last year unveiled that Amazon abandoned an AI recruiting tool in development, as the tech giant cannot fix its bias against women. Uber’s facial recognition technology reportedly didn’t process and recognize transgender drivers. A study published by New York University's AI Now Institute in April shows how many AI systems favor white people and males. Talking about such concerns around AI, Joshua Feast, Cogito Inc.’s co-founder and CEO said its software doesn’t mean to replace anybody. “We’re a coach,” he said. “We're sort of proud as a company that we're helping workers do well on the job, helping customers have better experiences on the phone and helping our clients keep those customers.” The company, which works with call centers of large insurance companies, including MetLife and Humana, retail banks and credit card issuers, says it has more than 25,000 users. It helps to minimize bias that Cogito's algorithm analyzes biological signaling mechanism, which is largely independent on language and culture, Feast said. The company has also deployed a secondary algorithm and a human annotation team to check for bias, he added. AI comes into play when humans get tired sometimes and suffer from “compassion fatigue,'' according to Feast. “What the AI is really doing is helping somebody be more consistent in the course of the day."" The software also provides tools for supervisors to track the performance of team members and guide workers accordingly, though Feast said Cogito doesn’t function as ""a performance management system."" A customer agent at Humana handles 30 to 40 calls a day on average, according to Mark Morse, vice president of Humana Pharmacy’s service operations. “When you're tired or on any given day, what happens at home and frustrations in life can come into the contact center,” he said. But showing empathy is always important as the customers of life insurance companies are usually “in the midst of some of the most challenging moments of their lives, from going on disability to the loss of a loved one,"" said Kristine Poznanski, head of global customer solutions at MetLife. Using Cogito is not compulsory at Humana, but the company is considering integrating Cogito's assessment into its bonus mechanism to promote the software's usage, said Morse. When asked if human customer agents would one day disappear, Feast said he doesn't think so, though the trend of automation has been growing – the share of customer service interactions completely handled by AI will reach 15% by 2021, according to research company Gartner. That's a 400% increase from 2017.“I don't think they (human customer agents) will be completely replaced,"" Feast said. ""Humans will always want to talk to other humans,” Feast said. “The reason is that only other humans really understand us.”Follow Frances Yue on Twitter: @FrancesYue_.Why CVS, Walgreens allow pharmacists to deny birth control Georgia residents can claim embryo as a dependent on their state taxes As online shopping slows, Amazon closes or pauses 40 warehouses is Gen Z underestimating how much money it will need to retire?

Like with every other field, women in tech, too, faced the challenge of making a name for themselves in an industry full of men. But the space is now changing. Now, we have women who aren't just holding staff positions in big technology startups but are actually spearheading them, from innovation to final execution.Here, we'll get to know more about Indian women who are killing it in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. 1. Aditi Avasthi, Founder and CEO, Embibe TwitterAditi Avasthi’s unrelenting passion for improving the state of education in India is evident from the fact that students who have used Embibe's learning programs have gone on to achieve remarkable results in unfavourable situations. Embibe’s pilot project was with the tribal students of Rajasthan who didn't know how to use computers before Embibe’s intervention. The students were not only confident but also went on to crack the most competitive pre-engineering and pre-medical exams in India. Embibe, a deep personalisation platform, is designed to deliver learning and life outcomes for students. Aditi Avasthi was awarded 'Accenture Vaahini Innovator of The Year' at Economic Times Prime Women Leadership Awards 2019.2. Chandralika Hazarika, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Bigthinx TwitterAn MBA graduate, Chandralika has earlier worked at ITC and Space Matrix. The marketing professional, who has about 10 years of experience, was always keen on developing simple but highly intuitive tech products that could be adopted by any and everyone. Today, her company Big Thinx's flagship product, the Lyflike app, lets you create your own customised clothing by controlling materials, size, lengths, style, fit, mixing and matching, and viewing them on personalised, walkabout avatars in immersive simulation. Here, a user gets to engage in immersive shopping through real-time visual searches and virtual reality, too. 3. Ashwini Asokan, CEO, Mad Street Den TwitterAshwini Asokan's brilliant innovation can be witnessed in her company's flagship product Vue.ai. Vue.ai is the retail industry’s leading artificial intelligence platform that promises Intelligent Retail Automation. Using Image Recognition & Data Science, Vue.ai extracts product data from images, analyzes it along with user behaviour thereby helping different retail teams make better, faster decisions. The platform delivers on two primary value propositions. One, automating retail processes across catalog management, merchandising and fashion photography, significantly reducing time to market; and two, personalising the customer journey across channels through AI enabled styling, outfitting and more. The company counts marquee retailers and brands as its customers, and is rapidly becoming the preferred AI solution suite for retailers across the globe. 4. Meghna Saraogi, Founder, MirrARTwitterThanks to MirrAR, shoppers can now try on jewellery on the digital platforms of client brands, including iPads installed at various locations, without actually having to wear the pieces. Shoppers also get instant fashion advice from experts, bloggers and influencers from around the world. The AR tech is seamlessly integrated with their fashion advice platform that enables users to get real-time advice. 5. Amrutha Valli, Founder and CEO, PurpleApple TwitterPurpleApple Infosystems products allow enterprises to 'Engage, Entertain & Educate' the customers effectively to promote the products and services which, in turn, works to boost revenue. PurpleApple is one of the Top 50 Women Entrepreneur Program by NSRCEL (IIM Bangalore), one of top 30 Women Entrepreneur Empowerment Program by WEE Foundation (IIT Delhi) & XLR8AP (Andhra Pradesh Innovation Society, University Of Texas & FICCI).
