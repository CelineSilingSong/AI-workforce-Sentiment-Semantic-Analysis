End of the essay? UK lecturers urged to review assessments amid ChatGPT concerns
Ian Sample Science editorFri 13 Jan 2023 11.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 6 Feb 2023 04.44 ESTShareSince its launch in November last year, ChatGPT has become an extraordinary hit. Essentially a souped-up chatbot, the AI program can churn out answers to the biggest and smallest questions in life, and draw up college essays, fictional stories, haikus, and even job application letters. It does this by drawing on what it has gleaned from a staggering amount of text on the internet, with careful guidance from human experts. Ask ChatGPT a question, as millions have in recent weeks, and it will do its best to respond – unless it knows it cannot. The answers are confident and fluently written, even if they are sometimes spectacularly wrong.The program is the latest to emerge from OpenAI, a research laboratory in California, and is based on an earlier AI from the outfit, called GPT-3. Known in the field as a large language model or LLM, the AI is fed hundreds of billions of words in the form of books, conversations and web articles, from which it builds a model, based on statistical probability, of the words and sentences that tend to follow whatever text came before. It is a bit like predictive text on a mobile phone, but scaled up massively, allowing it to produce entire responses instead of single words.The significant step forward with ChatGPT lies in the extra training it received. The initial language model was fine-tuned by feeding it a vast number of questions and answers provided by human AI trainers. These were then incorporated into its dataset. Next, the program was asked to produce several different responses to a wide variety questions, which human experts then ranked from best to worst. This human-guided fine-tuning means ChatGPT is often highly impressive at working out what information a question is really after, gathering the right information, and framing a response in a natural manner.Lecturers urged to review assessments in UK amid concerns over new AI toolRead moreThe result, according to Elon Musk, is “scary good”, as many early users – including college students who see it as a saviour for late assignments – will attest. It is also harder to corrupt than earlier chatbots. Unlike older chatbots, ChatGPT has been designed to refuse inappropriate questions and to avoid making stuff up by churning out responses on issues it has not been trained on. For example, ChatGPT knows nothing in the world post-2021 as its data has not been updated since then. It has other, more fundamental limitations, too. ChatGPT has no handle on the truth, so even when answers are fluent and plausible, there is no guarantee they are correct.Prof Michael Wooldridge, director of foundational AI research at the Alan Turing Institute in London, says: “If I write a text message to my wife that starts: ‘I’m going to be ...’ it might suggest the next words ‘in the pub’ or ‘late’, because it’s looked at all the messages I’ve sent to my wife and learned that these are the most likely ways I’ll complete that sentence. ChatGPT does exactly the same thing on a massively large scale.“These are the first systems that I can genuinely get excited about. It would take 1,000 human lifetimes to read the amount of text the system was trained on and hidden away in all of that text is an awful lot of knowledge about the world.”As OpenAI notes: “ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers” and “will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behaviour.” It can also give long-winded replies, a problem its developers put down to trainers “preferring long answers that look more comprehensive”.“One of the biggest problems with ChatGPT is that it comes back, very confidently, with falsities,” says Wooldridge. “It doesn’t know what’s true or false. It doesn’t know about the world. You should absolutely not trust it. You need to check what it says.“We are nowhere near the Hollywood dream of AI. It cannot tie a pair of shoelaces or ride a bicycle. If you ask it for a recipe for an omelette, it’ll probably do a good job, but that doesn’t mean it knows what an omelette is.” It is very much a work in progress, but a transformative one nonetheless.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsComputingConsciousnessCaliforniaChatGPTexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Image: The Verge via LexicaA trio of artists have launched a lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney, creators of AI art generators Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, and artist portfolio platform DeviantArt, which recently created its own AI art generator, DreamUp. The artists — Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz — allege that these organizations have infringed the rights of “millions of artists” by training their AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web “with­out the con­sent of the orig­i­nal artists.” The lawsuit has been filed by lawyer and typographer Matthew Butterick along with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which specializes in antitrust and class action cases. Butterick and Saveri are currently suing Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI in a similar case involving the AI programming model CoPilot, which is trained on lines of code collected from the web. In a blog post announcing the suit, Butterick describes the case as “another step toward mak­ing AI fair & eth­i­cal for every­one.” He says the capacity of AI art tools like Stable Diffusion to “flood the mar­ket with an essen­tially unlim­ited num­ber of infring­ing images will inflict per­ma­nent dam­age on the mar­ket for art and artists.”Since AI art tools exploded in popularity over the past year, the art community has reacted strongly.

The creators of AI art tools generally argue that the training of this software on copyrighted data is covered (in the US at least) by fair use doctrine.

These include the location of organizations behind these tools (as the EU and US have subtly different legal allowances for data scraping) and the purpose of these institutions (Stable Diffusion, for example, is trained on the LAION dataset, which is created by a German-based research non-profit, and non-profits may be treated more favorably than regular companies in fair use cases). The lawsuit launched by Butterick and the Joseph Saveri Law Firm has also been criticized for containing technical inaccuracies. For example, the suit claims that AI art models “store com­pressed copies of [copyright-protected] train­ing images” and then “recombine” them; functioning as “21st-cen­tury col­lage tool[s].” However, AI art models do not store images at all, but rather mathematical representations of patterns collected from these images. The software does not piece together bits of images in the form of a collage, either, but creates pictures from scratch based on these mathematical representations.

In 1942, Walter Pitts, a teenage mathematician and logician, and Warren McCulloch, a mid-career neurologist, teamed up to unravel the mysteries of how the brain worked. It was already known that neurons fire or do not fire due to an activation threshold. ""If the sum of the inputs to a neuron exceeded this activation threshold, then the neuron would fire; otherwise, it would not fire,"" explains Christian.McCulloch and Pitts immediately saw the logic in the activation threshold — that the pulse of the neuron, with its on and off states, was a kind of logic gate. In the 1943 paper that came out of their early collaboration, they wrote, ""Because of the 'all-or-none' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic."" The brain, they realized, was a kind of cellular machine, says Christian, ""with the pulse or its absence signifying on or off, yes or no, true or false. This was really the birthplace of neural networks.""A Model of the Brain, Not a CopySo artificial intelligence (AI) was inspired by the human brain, but how much is it really like the brain? Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer in deep learning and artificial neural networks, is careful to point out that AI is a model of what's going on in the brain, not a copy. ""A lot of inspiration from the brain went into the design of neural networks as they're used now,"" says Bengio, professor of computer science at the University of Montreal and scientific director of the MILA-Quebec AI Institute, ""but the systems we have built are also very different from the brain in many ways."" For one thing, he explains, state-of-the-art AI systems don't use pulses but rather floating point numbers. ""People on the engineering side don't care to try to reproduce anything in the brain,"" he says. ""They just want to do something that's going to work.""Read More: The Pros and Cons of Artificial IntelligenceBut as Christian noted, what works in artificial neural networks is remarkably similar to what works in biological neural networks. While agreeing that these programs aren't exactly like the brain, Randall O'Reilly says, ""Neural network models are a closer fit to what the brain is actually doing than to a purely abstract description at the computational level."" O'Reilly is a neuroscientist and computer scientist at the University of California Davis. ""The units in these models are doing something like what actual neurons do in the brain,"" he says. ""It's not just an analogy or a metaphor. There really is something shared at that level."" Similar to Artificial IntelligenceThe newer transformer architecture that powers large language models, such as GPT3 and ChatGPT, is even more similar to the brain in some ways than previous models. These newer systems says O'Reilly, are mapping how different areas of the brain work, not just what an individual neuron is doing. But it's not a direct mapping; it's what O'Reilly calls a ""re-mix"" or a ""mash-up.""The brain has separate areas, such as the hippocampus and the cortex, each of which specializes in a different form of computation. The transformer, says O'Reilly, blends those two together. ""I picture it as a sort of puree of the brain,"" he says. This puree is spread through every part of the network and does some hippocampus-like things and some cortex-like things.O'Reilly likens the generic neural networks that preceded the transformers to the posterior cortex, which is involved in perception. When the transformers arrived, they added some functions similar to those of the hippocampus, which, he explains, is good at storing and retrieving detailed facts — for example, what you ate for breakfast or the route you take to get to work. But instead of having a separate hippocampus, the entire AI system is like one massive — pureed — hippocampus.Whereas a standard computer has to look up information by its address in memory or some sort of tag, the neural net can automatically retrieve information based on prompts (what did you have for breakfast?). This is what O'Reilly calls the ""superpower"" of neural networks.Yet, the Brain is DifferentThe similarities between human brains and neural nets are striking, but the differences are, perhaps, profound. One way these models differ from the human brain, says O'Reilly, is that they don't have the essential ingredient for consciousness. He and others working in this area posit that in order to have consciousness, neurons must have a back-and-forth conversation. ""The essence of consciousness is really that you have some sense of the state of your brain,"" he says, and getting that takes bidirectional connectivity. However, all existing models have only one-way conversations among AI neurons. O'Reilly is working on it, though. His research deals with just this kind of bidirectional connectivity.Not all attempts at machine learning have been based on neural networks, but the most successful ones have. And that probably shouldn't be surprising. Over billions of years, evolution found the best way to create intelligence. Now we're rediscovering and adapting those best practices, says Christian. ""It's no accident, no mere coincidence,"" he says, ""that the most biologically inspired models have turned out to be the best performing.""",https://schema.org,,BreadcrumbList,AI and the Human Brain: How Similar Are They?,https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/ai-and-the-human-brain-how-similar-are-they,https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/ai-and-the-human-brain-how-similar-are-they,https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/7o423uE3Y0NvyeAl1AW1sU/fea517ea1aad053804b6a9aed823c3bd/shutterstock_2052051122.jpg?fm=jpg&fl=progressive&w=350&h=233&fit=fill,https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/7o423uE3Y0NvyeAl1AW1sU/fea517ea1aad053804b6a9aed823c3bd/shutterstock_2052051122.jpg,Technology Article,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Avery Hurt', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/author/avery-hurt'}",,"{'name': 'Discover Magazine', '@type': 'Organization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/assets/globalAssets/siteLogo.png', 'width': '224px', 'height': '64px'}}",,2023-01-14T09:00-06:00,2023-01-14T15:00:07.774Z,,Discover Magazine,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/assets/globalAssets/siteLogo.png', 'width': '224px', 'height': '64px'}","['https://www.facebook.com/DiscoverMag', 'https://twitter.com/discovermag', 'https://www.instagram.com/discover.magazine/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/discovermagazine', 'https://soundcloud.com/its-only-science-discover-magazine']",False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': 'article'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/ai-and-the-human-brain-how-similar-are-they', 'name': 'AI and the Human Brain: How Similar Are They?'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As technology continues to advance, it’s important to understand the ways in which it will affect the future of jobs across different sectors. In this blog, we’ll take a closer look at how AI is likely to impact the job market in different industries, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges for each sector.Image — https://www.premierline.co.uk/knowledge-centre/will-ai-take-my-job-in-the-future.htmlHealthcare IndustryFirst, let’s take a look at the healthcare industry. According to a recent study by Deloitte, the use of AI in healthcare could lead to a savings of up to $150 billion per year by 2026. This is because AI can help with things like making medical diagnoses, analyzing images, and finding new drugs. AI can be used to look at medical images and find early signs of cancer or other diseases. This means that people can get treatment sooner and have better outcomes. AI can also be used to help find new medicines by looking at a lot of data to find possible new treatments.However, the use of AI in healthcare also poses some challenges. For example, it's important to make sure that AI systems are designed and used in a fair and unbiased way, especially when it comes to diagnosing and treating certain conditions. There may also be a need for new rules and oversight to make sure that AI in healthcare is safe and effective. Additionally, AI can be used to create virtual assistants that can help patients manage their health, schedule appointments, and communicate with their healthcare providers. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the healthcare sector is projected to create 2.3 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Manufacturing SectorAnother industry that is likely to be impacted by AI is the manufacturing sector. According to a recent study by McKinsey, the use of AI in manufacturing could lead to savings of up to $3.7 trillion per year by 2030. This is due to the ability of AI to assist with tasks such as process optimization, quality control, and predictive maintenance. For example, AI can be used to optimize production processes by analyzing data from sensors and other sources to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks. Additionally, AI can be used to perform quality control by analyzing images of products to detect defects.However, the use of AI in manufacturing also poses some challenges. For example, there may be a need for new regulations and oversight to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI in manufacturing. Additionally, there may be a need for new training and retraining programs to ensure that workers are able to adapt to new technologies and processes. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, the manufacturing sector is projected to create 1.4 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Retail SectorAnother industry that is likely to be impacted by AI is the retail sector. According to a recent study by PwC, the use of AI in retail could lead to a savings of up to $300 billion per year by 2030. This is due to the ability of AI to assist with tasks such as personalization, inventory management, and fraud detection. For example, AI can be used to personalize the shopping experience by analyzing data from customer interactions to create personalized recommendations and offers. Additionally, AI can be used to perform inventory management by analyzing data from sensors and other sources to identify trends and patterns in sales and customer behavior.However, the use of AI in retail also poses some challenges. For example, there may be a need for new regulations and oversight to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI in retail. Additionally, there may be a need for new training and retraining programs to ensure that workers are able to adapt to new technologies and processes. According to a report by the National Retail Federation, the retail sector is projected to create 1.2 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Financial SectorThe finance sector is also expected to see significant changes as a result of AI and Chat GPT. AI-powered chatbots are being used to provide financial advice and help customers with their banking needs. Chat GPT is also being used to generate financial reports and identify patterns in financial data that can help predict market trends. According to a study by PwC, AI could potentially save the finance industry $1 trillion by 2030.However, Chat GPT can be used to create virtual assistants that can help customers manage their finances and communicate with their financial advisors. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the financial sector is projected to create 1.0 million jobs related to AI by 2026.ConclusionIn conclusion, AI is expected to have a significant impact on the future of jobs in various sectors. These technologies are being used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better customer service. As these technologies continue to evolve, it is important for workers to adapt and develop new skills to stay relevant in the job market. The healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing sectors are expected to see the most significant changes as a result of AI and Chat GPT, with potential savings in the trillions of dollars. As these technologies continue to advance, it is important for companies to stay ahead of the curve to ensure they remain competitive in the global market.Thanks for reading!Note -“We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails.”Don’t forget to give me your 👏 !",http://schema.org,,NewsArticle,Is AI going to take my Job?☹️ - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,https://becominghuman.ai/is-ai-going-to-take-my-job-%EF%B8%8F-4a99bed2defc,https://becominghuman.ai/is-ai-going-to-take-my-job-%EF%B8%8F-4a99bed2defc,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/0*9JTS6MP1UCPQ9Glr.jpg'],,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Akalbir Singh Chadha', 'url': 'https://akalbir.medium.com'}",['Akalbir Singh Chadha'],"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",2023-01-14T13:38:33.981Z,2023-01-14T13:38:33.981Z,2023-01-18T21:16:15.793Z,,Is AI going to take my Job?☹️ - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,4a99bed2defc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teach With It.OpenAI’s new chatbot is raising fears of cheating on homework, but its potential as an educational tool outweighs its risks.Share full article363Read in appCredit...Nata MetlukhBy Kevin RooseJan. 12, 2023Recently, I gave a talk to a group of K-12 teachers and public school administrators in New York. The topic was artificial intelligence, and how schools would need to adapt to prepare students for a future filled with all kinds of capable A.I. tools.But it turned out that my audience cared about only one A.I. tool: ChatGPT, the buzzy chatbot developed by OpenAI that is capable of writing cogent essays, solving science and math problems and producing working computer code.ChatGPT is new — it was released in late November — but it has already sent many educators into a panic. Students are using it to write their assignments, passing off A.I.-generated essays and problem sets as their own. Teachers and school administrators have been scrambling to catch students using the tool to cheat, and they are fretting about the havoc ChatGPT could wreak on their lesson plans. (Some publications have declared, perhaps a bit prematurely, that ChatGPT has killed homework altogether.)Cheating is the immediate, practical fear, along with the bot’s propensity to spit out wrong or misleading answers. But there are existential worries, too. One high school teacher told me that he used ChatGPT to evaluate a few of his students’ papers, and that the app had provided more detailed and useful feedback on them than he would have, in a tiny fraction of the time.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Am I even necessary now?” he asked me, only half joking.Some schools have responded to ChatGPT by cracking down. New York City public schools, for example, recently blocked ChatGPT access on school computers and networks, citing “concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.” Schools in other cities, including Seattle, have also restricted access. (Tim Robinson, a spokesman for Seattle Public Schools, told me that ChatGPT was blocked on school devices in December, “along with five other cheating tools.”)It’s easy to understand why educators feel threatened. ChatGPT is a freakishly capable tool that landed in their midst with no warning, and it performs reasonably well across a wide variety of tasks and academic subjects. There are legitimate questions about the ethics of A.I.-generated writing, and concerns about whether the answers ChatGPT gives are accurate. (Often, they’re not.) And I’m sympathetic to teachers who feel that they have enough to worry about, without adding A.I.-generated homework to the mix.But after talking with dozens of educators over the past few weeks, I’ve come around to the view that banning ChatGPT from the classroom is the wrong move.Instead, I believe schools should thoughtfully embrace ChatGPT as a teaching aid — one that could unlock student creativity, offer personalized tutoring, and better prepare students to work alongside A.I. systems as adults. Here’s why.It won’t workThe first reason not to ban ChatGPT in schools is that, to be blunt, it’s not going to work.Sure, a school can block the ChatGPT website on school networks and school-owned devices. But students have phones, laptops and any number of other ways of accessing it outside of class. (Just for kicks, I asked ChatGPT how a student who was intent on using the app might evade a schoolwide ban. It came up with five answers, all totally plausible, including using a VPN to disguise the student’s web traffic.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSome teachers have high hopes for tools such as GPTZero, a program built by a Princeton student that claims to be able to detect A.I.-generated writing. But these tools aren’t reliably accurate, and it’s relatively easy to fool them by changing a few words, or using a different A.I. program to paraphrase certain passages.A.I. chatbots could be programmed to watermark their outputs in some way, so teachers would have an easier time spotting A.I.-generated text. But this, too, is a flimsy defense. Right now, ChatGPT is the only free, easy-to-use chatbot of its caliber. But there will be others, and students will soon be able to take their pick, probably including apps with no A.I. fingerprints.Even if it were technically possible to block ChatGPT, do teachers want to spend their nights and weekends keeping up with the latest A.I. detection software? Several educators I spoke with said that while they found the idea of ChatGPT-assisted cheating annoying, policing it sounded even worse.“I don’t want to be in an adversarial relationship with my students,” said Gina Parnaby, the chair of the English department at the Marist School, an independent school for grades seven through 12 outside Atlanta. “If our mind-set approaching this is that we have to build a better mousetrap to catch kids cheating, I just think that’s the wrong approach, because the kids are going to figure something out.”

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.Instead of starting an endless game of whack-a-mole against an ever-expanding army of A.I. chatbots, here’s a suggestion: For the rest of the academic year, schools should treat ChatGPT the way they treat calculators — allowing it for some assignments, but not others, and assuming that unless students are being supervised in person with their devices stashed away, they’re probably using one.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThen, over the summer, teachers can modify their lesson plans — replacing take-home exams with in-class tests or group discussions, for example — to try to keep cheaters at bay.ChatGPT can be a teacher’s best friendThe second reason not to ban ChatGPT from the classroom is that, with the right approach, it can be an effective teaching tool.Cherie Shields, a high school English teacher in Oregon, told me that she had recently assigned students in one of her classes to use ChatGPT to create outlines for their essays comparing and contrasting two 19th-century short stories that touch on themes of gender and mental health: “The Story of an Hour,” by Kate Chopin, and “The Yellow Wallpaper,” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Once the outlines were generated, her students put their laptops away and wrote their essays longhand.The process, she said, had not only deepened students’ understanding of the stories. It had also taught them about interacting with A.I. models, and how to coax a helpful response out of one.“They have to understand, ‘I need this to produce an outline about X, Y and Z,’ and they have to think very carefully about it,” Ms. Shields said. “And if they don’t get the result that they want, they can always revise it.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCreating outlines is just one of the many ways that ChatGPT could be used in class. It could write personalized lesson plans for each student (“explain Newton’s laws of motion to a visual-spatial learner”) and generate ideas for classroom activities (“write a script for a ‘Friends’ episode that takes place at the Constitutional Convention”). It could serve as an after-hours tutor (“explain the Doppler effect, using language an eighth grader could understand”) or a debate sparring partner (“convince me that animal testing should be banned”). It could be used as a starting point for in-class exercises, or a tool for English language learners to improve their basic writing skills. (The teaching blog Ditch That Textbook has a long list of possible classroom uses for ChatGPT.)Even ChatGPT’s flaws — such as the fact that its answers to factual questions are often wrong — can become fodder for a critical thinking exercise. Several teachers told me that they had instructed students to try to trip up ChatGPT, or evaluate its responses the way a teacher would evaluate a student’s.ChatGPT can also help teachers save time preparing for class. Jon Gold, an eighth grade history teacher at Moses Brown School, a pre-K through 12th grade Quaker school in Providence, R.I., said that he had experimented with using ChatGPT to generate quizzes. He fed the bot an article about Ukraine, for example, and asked it to generate 10 multiple-choice questions that could be used to test students’ understanding of the article. (Of those 10 questions, he said, six were usable.)Ultimately, Mr. Gold said, ChatGPT wasn’t a threat to student learning as long as teachers paired it with substantive, in-class discussions.“Any tool that lets students refine their thinking before they come to class, and practice their ideas, is only going to make our discussions richer,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTChatGPT teaches students about the world they’ll inhabitNow, I’ll take off my tech columnist hat for a second, and confess that writing this piece has made me a little sad. I loved school, and it pains me, on some level, to think that instead of sharpening their skills by writing essays about “The Sun Also Rises” or straining to factor a trigonometric expression, today’s students might simply ask an A.I. chatbot to do it for them.I also don’t believe that educators who are reflexively opposed to ChatGPT are being irrational. This type of A.I. really is (if you’ll excuse the buzzword) disruptive — to classroom routines, to longstanding pedagogical practices, and to the basic principle that the work students turn in should reflect cogitation happening inside their brains, rather than in the latent space of a machine learning model hosted on a distant supercomputer.But the barricade has fallen. Tools like ChatGPT aren’t going anywhere; they’re only going to improve, and barring some major regulatory intervention, this particular form of machine intelligence is now a fixture of our society.“Large language models aren’t going to get less capable in the next few years,” said Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “We need to figure out a way to adjust to these tools, and not just ban them.”That’s the biggest reason not to ban it from the classroom, in fact — because today’s students will graduate into a world full of generative A.I. programs. They’ll need to know their way around these tools — their strengths and weaknesses, their hallmarks and blind spots — in order to work alongside them. To be good citizens, they’ll need hands-on experience to understand how this type of A.I. works, what types of bias it contains, and how it can be misused and weaponized.This adjustment won’t be easy. Sudden technological shifts rarely are. But who better to guide students into this strange new world than their teachers?Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Jan. 13, 2023, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I., Once the Future, Has Become The Present.

In 2022, OpenAI – one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence research laboratories – released the text generator ChatGPT and the image generator DALL-E 2. While both programs represent monumental leaps in natural language processing and image generation, they’ve also been met with apprehension. 
Some critics have eulogized the college essay, while others have even proclaimed the death of art. 
But to what extent does this technology really interfere with creativity? 
After all, for the technology to generate an image or essay, a human still has to describe the task to be completed. The better that description – the more accurate, the more detailed – the better the results. 
After a result is generated, some further human tweaking and feedback may be needed – touching up the art, editing the text or asking the technology to create a new draft in response to revised specifications. Even the DALL-E 2 art piece that recently won first prize in the Colorado State Fair’s digital arts competition required a great deal of human “help” – approximately 80 hours’ worth of tweaking and refining the descriptive task needed to produce the desired result.

It could be argued that by being freed from the tedious execution of our ideas – by focusing on just having ideas and describing them well to a machine – people can let the technology do the dirty work and can spend more time inventing.
But in our work as philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston, we have written about the effects of AI on our everyday decision-making, the future of work and worker attitudes toward automation.
Leaving aside the very real ramifications of robots displacing artists who are already underpaid, we believe that AI art devalues the act of artistic creation for both the artist and the public.
Skill and practice become superfluous
In our view, the desire to close the gap between ideation and execution is a chimera: There’s no separating ideas and execution. 
It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it. Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.
The focus on the idea and the framing of the artistic task amounts to the fetishization of the creative moment.
Novelists write and rewrite the chapters of their manuscripts. Comedians “write on stage” in response to the laughs and groans of their audience. Musicians tweak their work in response to a discordant melody as they compose a piece.

In fact, the process of execution is a gift, allowing artists to become fully immersed in a task and a practice. It allows them to enter what some psychologists call the “flow” state, where they are wholly attuned to something that they are doing, unaware of the passage of time and momentarily freed from the boredom or anxieties of everyday life.
This playful state is something that would be a shame to miss out on. Play tends to be understood as an autotelic activity – a term derived from the Greek words auto, meaning “self,” and telos meaning “goal” or “end.” As an autotelic activity, play is done for itself – it is self-contained and requires no external validation. 
For the artist, the process of artistic creation is an integral part, maybe even the greatest part, of their vocation.
But there is no flow state, no playfulness, without engaging in skill and practice. And the point of ChatGPT and DALL-E is to make this stage superfluous.
A cheapened experience for the viewer
But what about the perspective of those experiencing the art? Does it really matter how the art is produced if the finished product elicits delight? 
We think that it does matter, particularly because the process of creation adds to the value of art for the people experiencing it as much as it does for the artists themselves.
Part of the experience of art is knowing that human effort and labor has gone into the work. Flow states and playfulness notwithstanding, art is the result of skillful and rigorous expression of human capabilities. 
Recall the famous scene from the 1997 film “Gattaca,” in which a pianist plays a haunting piece. At the conclusion of his performance, he throws his gloves into the admiring audience, which sees that the pianist has 12 fingers. They now understand that he was genetically engineered to play the transcendent piece they just heard – and that he could not play it with the 10 fingers of a mere mortal. 
Does that realization retroactively change the experience of listening? Does it take away any of the awe? 
As the philosopher Michael Sandel notes: Part of what gives art and athletic achievement its power is the process of witnessing natural gifts playing out. People enjoy and celebrate this talent because, in a fundamental way, it represents the paragon of human achievement – the amalgam of talent and work, human gifts and human sweat.

Is it all doom and gloom?
Might ChatGPT and DALL-E be worth keeping around? 
Perhaps. These technologies could serve as catalysts for creativity. It’s possible that the link between ideation and execution can be sustained if these AI applications are simply viewed as mechanisms for creative imagining – what OpenAI calls “extending creativity.” They can generate stimuli that allow artists to engage in more imaginative thinking about their own process of conceiving an art piece. 
Put differently, if ChatGPT and DALL-E are the end results of the artistic process, something meaningful will be lost. But if they are merely tools for fomenting creative thinking, this might be less of a concern. 
For example, a game designer could ask DALL-E to provide some images about what a Renaissance town with a steampunk twist might look like. A writer might ask about descriptors that capture how a restrained, shy person expresses surprise. Both creators could then incorporate these suggestions into their work. 
But in order for what they are doing to still count as art – in order for it to feel like art to the artists and to those taking in what they have made – the artists would still have to do the bulk of the artistic work themselves. 
Art requires makers to keep making.
The warped incentives of the internet
Even if AI systems are used as catalysts for creative imaging, we believe that people should be skeptical of what these systems are drawing from. It’s important to pay close attention to the incentives that underpin and reward artistic creation, particularly online.
Consider the generation of AI art. These works draw on images and video that already exist online. But the AI is not sophisticated enough – nor is it incentivized – to consider whether works evoke a sense of wonder, sadness, anxiety and so on. They are not capable of factoring in aesthetic considerations of novelty and cross-cultural influence. 
Rather, training ChatGPT and DALL-E on preexisting measurements of artistic success online will tend to replicate the dominant incentives of the internet’s largest platforms: grabbing and retaining attention for the sake of data collection and user engagement. The catalyst for creative imagining therefore can easily become subject to an addictiveness and attention-seeking imperative rather than more transcendent artistic values.
It’s possible that artificial intelligence is at a precipice, one that evokes a sense of “moral vertigo” – the uneasy dizziness people feel when scientific and technological developments outpace moral understanding. Such vertigo can lead to apathy and detachment from creative expression. 
If human labor is removed from the process, what value does creative expression hold? Or perhaps, having opened Pandora’s box, this is an indispensable opportunity for humanity to reassert the value of art – and to push back against a technology that may prevent many real human artists from thriving.

		As companies scramble to fill jobs at a time when talent is hard to find, many are turning to artificial intelligence to find, interview, and match candidates to much needed skills.	




 









Amid a recent spate of high-profile layoffs and a recognition many companies rushed to hire to fill pandemic-driven business needs, organizations are now refocusing on quality of hiring — and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid in those efforts.
From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects in the coming year, according to two recent studies.
Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchases of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by online enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire.











 
 
 
More recently, AI has been applied to the task of creating job requisitions and similar materials shared by the employer that are gender and ethnicity neutral; the goal is to eliminate as much human bias as possible in hiring and increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

The shift comes as the US unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% last month — and just 1.8% in the tech sector — making it hard for organizations to recruit top talent even as many companies lay off workers hired in haste during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many organizations rushed to bring in employees to address business goals such as digitization projects, distributed work models, and the rollout of data analytics and business intelligence platforms. In some cases, companies lowered hiring standards to find anyone who could meet the minimum job qualifications.
Now there is an increased need to identify high-quality job candidates and make hiring decisions quickly, and that has upped AI adoption, according to Bret Greenstein, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) partner and Data Analytics and AI researcher.











 
 
 
“There were a lot of factors that drove this need, from the Great Resignation, to the rapid hiring and recovery in 2021, to the recession period now causing a large influx of tech workers into the market,” Greenstein said. “In all cases, recruiters need better tools to be efficient in matching candidates and ensuring interviews are used efficiently by ensuring candidates are well-matched up front. Additionally, they needed ways to do this in highly remote settings, due to the initial lack of travel and the later trend towards roles which are inherently remote.”
A reversal of reactionary hiring
In 2023, the reactionary hiring of recent years is expected to be replaced by a focus on quality, which can include hiring employees without college degrees but with passion and drive to learn on the job.
However, as many as 49% of candidates turn down a job offer because of poor recruiting experiences, according to PwC’s Future of Recruiting survey. Along with improving the candidate interview experience, organizations need higher quality candidates who are also more likely to remain, and they’re turning to AI to find, cull, and woo job candidates.











 
 
 
AI use in hiring is well entrenched for data manipulation and resume analysis, according to Lisa Rowan, a vice president of human capital management research at IDC.
“If you think about it, recruiting is a data-centric function with a lot of unstructured data found in people’s resumes and CVs (curriculum vitae),” Rowan said. “The sophistication in this process of matching has evolved from matching up skills with requirements to include analysis that helps determine candidate fitness for the role.”
According to Modern Hire’s fifth annual Hiring Report, 45% of companies worldwide are using AI to improve recruiting and human resource functions. The survey of 300 senior level talent acquisition and HR professionals also found for the first time in two years that quality of hires (QoH) was considered a top technology investment priority. (A PwC survey conducted last year found 35% of companies plan to use AI to hire and train employees this year.)











 
 
 
“Quality of hires” is a metric used to determine how well a new hire performs, their engagement and promotability, as well as how likely new employees are likely to stay at the company over time.
Hiring right is better for retention
Hiring right the first time is vital to retention and creating value in a well-run organization, Modern Hire said in its report. Additionally, the skills and competencies needed for most jobs are more complex and more urgent than they were even a few years ago, as digital 21st-century skills become table stakes.
Resume matching to job descriptions is the most common use of AI, but Greenstein has also seen a lot of work enabling AI to analyze patterns, including factors affecting retention and segmentation of candidates based on experience, education, and skills to aid in recruiting.











 
 
 
“Chatbots have also become more popular as an aid for candidates to help answer questions about everything from benefits to how the company is organized and operates,” Greenstein said.
In 2023, AI hiring technology will also include intelligent interviewing, according to Modern Hire. Talent acquisition professionals can get a further assist from automated AI-based scoring.
“Now, AI techniques allow us to attach a valid and fair numerical score to the words a candidate speaks during an interview, yielding job-relevant, competency-based scores and rankings that can be used in decision making,” Modern Hire reported.











 
 
 
Beyond AI scoring, hiring intelligence is increasingly allowing companies to match candidates to jobs they’re likely to fit — before they become formal applicants. Early matching is an indication that organizations recognize the need for a two-way fit — it is no longer enough for companies to “gift” candidates with a job only when they deem them worthy. Candidates also pick the company, and especially the job.
“Because metrics such as on-the-job performance is not consistently tracked, quality of hire is often the hardest metric to measure accurately,” Modern Hire CEO Karin Borchert said in a statement. “By leveraging trusted science-based interview and assessment tools based on job relevancy and fair candidate experiences, hiring teams are relieved of these stressors, and can rely on the technology to deliver data-driven insights and quality outcomes.”
The traditional interview process — long fraught with inefficiency, inconsistency, bias, and poor experience — is on the chopping block in 2023, as science and next-gen technology address the urgency felt by companies, and frustration felt by candidates, to move the interview experience to the next level, according to Modern Hire’s study. “The next-level intelligent interview is one that uses data and candidate feedback to continuously learn, improve, and evolve,” it stated.











 
 
 
Specifically, Modern Hire said an intelligent interview should embrace:

The use of science, analytics, and AI for greater automation and insight and reduced bias;
Clarity, accessibility, transparency, and humanity in the candidate experience;
Global candidate reach through multilingual capabilities and support for international talent markets;
Seamless workflows and extreme ease of use.

In 2023, hiring technology will include built-in structured interviews across job families and roles with questions designed to be job-relevant and focused on factors related to job success. Adding in automated AI-based scoring allows companies to more objectively evaluate candidate responses, yielding job-relevant, competency-based scores and rankings that can be used in hiring, according to Modern Hire.
What about built-in bias?
Problems still exist, however. While AI was supposed to eliminate subjectivity in terms of gender and race, experts say self-selection is still sometimes baked into AI software.











 
 
 
“It is often said that technology can only be as unbiased as the humans programming it,” Rowan said. “It is a challenge to eliminate bias from every angle. We are getting there, but it is an iterative and evolutionary process.”
Greenstein was more blunt: “The risk of bias in AI recruiting systems is still very relevant and has not been eliminated.”
Greenstein suggests HR reps and hiring executives be the ones to ensure the people deciding on policy and tools represent corporate diversity goals. And, they should  ensure the data used to train AI systems reflects diversity, too.











 
 
 
“There are techniques for de-biasing that can be used to correct for bias in data, but it requires leaders who understand it to ensure this is addressed well,” Greenstein said. “AI systems are able to assist in talent acquisition today. However, it is important to leverage AI to augment the recruiting process and not automate it.”
While AI can help scan resumes — and review, edit, and generate job descriptions — it is important to ensure that people validate the effectiveness of AI systems rather than blindly accepting the results, Greenstein said.
AI-powered virtual reality simulations can also bolster virtual recruitment, open access to talent in far-flung geographies, help monitor remote workers and upskill employees, Greenstein said.











 
 
 
“Companies are increasingly using AI/ML, including simulations, to model and predict retention – including simulating different policy decisions, understanding how candidates’ skills and experience match to job descriptions, and predicting acceptance rates on offers,” Greenstein said. “It also includes using analytics to understand where your company is positioned in your market and your city when it comes to hiring and promotions.”
Data driven approaches are so much more important now that candidates and workers are more remote now than ever. Additionally, the introduction of VR technologies has enabled virtual reality based onboarding and virtual exploration of the workplace.
“This is still in early stages, but there is a generation of new hires who expect more immersive experiences as part of their recruiting and onboarding, and as remote workers, this has the potential to bring the workplace to them,” Greenstein added.











 
 
 
AI-based talent acquisition software runs the gamut across different areas of the recruiting landscape, said IDC’s Rowan. For example, Beamery offers job recruit marketing software. For applicant tracking, there are software and services providers such as iCIMS, Jobvite, Smartrecruiters, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, and Workday. And for data analysis, firms such as Modern Hire, Seekout, Eightfold, and Phenom are among the leaders.
When choosing an AI-based talent acquisition application or service, Greenstein said organizations need to be transparent, “so people are not surprised or put off by it. Assure people that you properly manage AI systems to be fair and to assist the work of HR,.”
Don’t discount the effect AI can have on talent acquisition, he said, and don’t fear bias.











 
 
 
“Instead, put in business leaders who help define and select AI systems who understand the issue of bias, and who understand the HR and skills strategy of your business,” he added. “AI is not a technology to just build and deploy. It is a tool that needs to be managed by people who understand the strengths and risks, and who also understand your business.”

Source: iStockphoto / GettyKey PointsAI technology is evolving rapidly, with further advances expected in 2023.AI is changing the way we work, and the types of jobs that are available to humans.Jobs that require ""uniquely human skills"" are likely to be less vulnerable to disruption.Artificial intelligence (AI) is on the rise, and the increasingly powerful technology is expected to upend the way humans work - rendering some jobs obsolete while simultaneously creating new opportunities.In 2023, the world is on the brink of being completely transformed by AI, according to Alex Jenkins, director of the WA Data Science Innovation Hub at Curtin University.“The technology is evolving extremely fast,"" he said.Advertisement""We're now at that leap in functionality where these tools are becoming incredibly useful both for generating new content, and conversing in a human style. So we're really starting to see these tools act in a way that is comparable to human-level capability.“Eventually, these tools will probably become smarter than most humans and more capable than most humans. That is both an exciting and dangerous future.”So what do workers need to know about AI and is it possible to future-proof your career against it?What’s all the fuss about ChatGPT?One AI tool in particular has sent shockwaves around the world in recent months due to its ability to respond in writing in a sophisticated human-like manner.ChatGPT was launched to the public in November by AI research and deployment firm OpenAI.OpenAI says its mission is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity”.Since its launch, ChatGPT has sparked debate over issues including how the technology could be used by students to cheat on assignments, its potential application in fields ranging from medicine to law, and the types of jobs it could displace humans from.ChatGPT's successor, ChatGPT-4, is set to launch in 2023. Source: NurPhoto / Getty“ChatGPT is an incredible example of the evolution of a set of AI models called large language models. These models work by pulling in enormous amounts of text, from the internet and from books, and absorbing this knowledge and building an understanding of the world that can then be used to generate new written content,” Mr Jenkins explained.Mr Jenkins said these tools have been around for a while but previous versions ""didn't quite understand"" what humans were talking about. ""But now with ChatGPT, we're seeing these models come to the point where it feels like you're almost talking to a person, it feels like you're talking to a system that understands your intent, and what you would like to achieve from the tool.”ChatGPT-4, the next iteration of ChatGPT, is set to launch in 2023, and it’s expected to be a game-changer.“It will be like ChatGPT, but it will be even more capable. And that that will be a significant disruption for the workforce and the economy as a whole,” Mr Jenkins said.READ MOREI asked this AI chatbot if it will replace me. This is what it said“It is probably going to be the biggest technology revolution that we've seen for a number of years. It's certainly as big as the shift from mobile phones to smartphones, and the creation of the internet.”Which jobs will AI replace?AI tools pose an immediate and growing threat to a range of jobs, from copywriting to data entry and administration.Mr Jenkins estimates that roughly 20-30 per cent of knowledge and office-based jobs are “likely to change in the next few years” due to the rise of AI.“If I was a copywriter, I would be looking to familiarise myself with ChatGPT very, very, very soon,"" he said.""I don't believe it will be possible for a copywriter — unless they're the world's most creative copywriter — to compete against what ChatGPT can provide in that space. It is very, very capable of doing that type of work,” Mr Jenkins said.“If you're the world's best author, and in the very top end of town, then you'll probably be OK at the moment. But for large parts of that workforce, they will need to adjust to using these tools today.”Lawyers may also be vulnerable to the AI revolution, with an AI-powered legal assistant created by US firm DoNotPay set to defend a client in court next month in what would be a world-first.READ MOREAn AI lawyer is set to appear in court in a world first. Does it spell the end for costly legal fees?According to a report released last year by Sydney-based research firm McCrindle, jobs that are on the way out due to the rise of automation and AI include data entry clerks, administrative and executive secretaries and accounting, bookkeeping and payroll clerks.“As harsh as it sounds, almost anything that can be automated will be automated. And I think it's natural for people to be scared about that and be a bit nervous,” McCrindle’s Director of Advisory Ashley Fell told SBS News.“The big downside, particularly with regards to the future of work is that [AI] will replace jobs traditionally done by humans, like we saw a few years ago now with [technology such as] self-checkouts at the airport and shopping centres.”What kind of jobs are safe from AI disruption?According to McCrindle's report, jobs that are increasing in demand include data analysts and scientists, AI and machine learning specialists, and big data specialists.Some jobs will also be protected from the AI revolution by their uniquely human nature.  “We're not going to replace the human-to-human interaction with these AIs. They aren't capable of that kind of thing,” Mr Jenkins said.Ms Fell said people looking to future-proof their career against AI disruption should focus on jobs that require “uniquely human skills”.“As we think about the future of work, and the particular jobs, or industries that are at a higher risk of automation replacing them, we do think it is those sort of lower-skilled, repetitive tasks or jobs that don't lend themselves as much to those uniquely human skills like creative thinking, critical thinking, empathy, compassion, leadership, almost like those soft skills, things that can't sort of be as easily replicated or repeated,” she said.How can we make the most of AI?Mr Jenkins’ advice to workers worried about AI disruption is to embrace, rather than fear, the technology.“Instead of being scared of the technology, start using it straightaway, and understand its strengths and weaknesses … use the technology to amplify your strengths, your individual characteristics, the things that you are strong at,” he said.“One way to think of this technology is that you're a manager, and the AI are your staff members. It does take some work to figure out well, what's the best way to get my staff to produce the best and the most amount of work for our team?“So start thinking like you have an assistant. That will be the best way for people who are concerned about the technology to understand how their job might change.”Today’s workers and future workers will need to embrace “lifelong learning” in order to keep pace with changing technology.READ MOREA Google worker went public with fears about a chatbot having feelings. Could conscious AI become a reality?“Lifelong learning is being driven largely by automation (growth of robotics, data analytics, smarter software), globalisation (greater degree of outsourcing and growth in digital platforms) and demographic realities (such as an ageing population where people live longer and work later),” the McCrindle report said.“This requires a new mindset and an increased focus on retraining and skills. Gone are the days where one to four years of study after school was sufficient. Rather, workers will increasingly need to develop a habit of refreshing existing skills and learning new ones.”Governments and regulators around the world also have a major role to play in ensuring that society as a whole benefits from the AI revolution.“If we have AI models that are open source and can be used and built on by anyone, then we all as a society have a chance to profit from the model,” Mr Jenkins said.“If the models are kept closed up behind single companies, then we risk being dependent on these companies for these models, and that a large amount of wealth will be generated by a very, very small number of people.”Share8 min readPublished 16 January 2023 5:46amBy Isabelle LaneSource: SBS NewsAvailable in other languagesTagsScienceArtificial intelligenceAustraliaShare this with family and friendsCopy linkShareRecommended for you'Dramatic' shift in world's population could impact how we live our livesPopulation of Australia 'Hang up the phone': Scam warning issued in wake of major IT outageComputer networkingWhy you shouldn't bank on a refund after lodging your tax return this yearTax ReturnWhat we know about the Russian-born Australian couple charged with espionageArrestsUnwelcome, looked down on and excluded: Australia's racism hotspotsRacismPhilippines police reviewing CCTV footage after Australian couple found dead in hotelCrimeThink it's cold now?

Rather, workers will increasingly need to develop a habit of refreshing existing skills and learning new ones.&amp;#x201D; Governments and regulators around the world also have a major role to play in ensuring that society as a whole benefits from the AI revolution. &amp;#x201C;If we have AI models that are open source and can be used and built on by anyone, then we all as a society have a chance to profit from the model,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins said. &amp;#x201C;If the models are kept closed up behind single companies, then we risk being dependent on these companies for these models, and that a large amount of wealth will be generated by a very, very small number of people.&amp;#x201D;', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'SBS News', 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/_next/static/img/news/schema-logo-d79dd3e.png', 'width': '144', 'height': '144'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/sbsnews/', 'https://twitter.com/sbsnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/sbsnews_au', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldNewsAustralia', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@sbsnews_au', 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news/feeds']}, 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-ai-revolution-is-upon-us-these-are-the-jobs-at-risk-and-in-demand/izjijemns'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And Humanoid robots are one of the most popular forms of AI. They have even been portrayed in several Hollywood movies. There is no doubt that a robot can perform in an assembly line, but there is no consensus on whether it can ever be intelligent like humans. In some way, today's AI machines are able to replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability and are outpacing human experts in several areas, specifically in the diagnosis of critical diseases like cancer..Initially, the prime objective of AI for humanoids was for research purposes. They were utilized for research on how to create better prosthetics for humans. But now, humanoids are being built for several purposes beyond research. They are developed to perform a wide range of human tasks and reside in different roles in the employment sector. Some of the roles they could take are that of personal assistants, receptionists, and front desk officers, among others..The process of creating a humanoid robot is quite complex and requires a lot of work and research into the process. Most of the time, developers and engineers face crucial challenges, too. In this regard, first-grade sensors and actuators are imperative and a small mistake could result in glitches. With the assistance of certain features like sensors and actuators, humanoids move, talk, and carry out actions effectively..Not all humanoids resemble humans as some are modeled after only some specific human parts such as the human head. Humanoid robots are typically either Androids – a humanoid robots designed to resemble a male human, or Gynoids – who look like female humans. They work through certain features, as well as they have sensors assisting them in sensing their surrounding environments. They also have cameras that allow them to see clearly and motors that are placed at strategic points to guide them in moving and making gestures. These motors are usually referred to as actuators..For humanoid robots to become as intelligent as human beings, they will have to be instilled with the ability to comprehend natural human language, known as natural language processing (NLP). As the development of humanoids still is in its embryonic phase, a lot of work and research is required to make these robots mimic humans..Humanoid Robots – Applications and Influences to the Real World.Humanoids have been assisting humankind in various capacities, widely leveraged in the domain of Healthcare, Education, and Entertainment, among others. As we have mentioned earlier that these robots are used for various purposes alongside researchers, their applications have commonly been categorized into healthcare, education, and social humanoid robots..Healthcare humanoid robots are designed and used by individuals at home or healthcare centers to treat and improve patients' medical conditions. These robots either require a human controller or are pre-programmed to aid patients. Conversely, educational humanoid robots are mainly aimed at and equipped for students. They are used in education centers or homes to advance education quality and bolster involvement in studies. These robots are typically but not always manually controlled robots..For instance, Aldebaran Robotics' Nao, a small 2-inch-tall humanoid robot, is used globally by universities as a research platform and educational tool. Nao has become the face of social robotics and has also replaced Sony's Aibo robot dog and has become the standard platform for the Robocup..Social humanoid robots are utilized by individuals or organizations to assist people in their daily life activities. These robots are commonly pre-programmed to perform mundane and tedious tasks. For instance, in 2014, Softbank Robotics launched Pepper, which swiftly became the leading commercially available social robot. Pepper was rolled out in Softbank's mobile stores in Japan and since then, it has been used in Carrefour and Renault stores across France..Humanoids are even used for customer engagement roles, equipped with advanced facial recognition, emotion recognition, and speech recognition capabilities. These robots provide a playbook for customer engagement and can be seen as an evolutionary step from self-service kiosks to conversational commerce, coalescing the two in smart and unique ways..Besides healthcare and education, retail, financial services, travel and hospitality, Aerospace, and quick service restaurants are also well-positioned to capitalize on humanoid robots. Airbus, for instance, in collaboration with researchers from Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL), reportedly began developing humanoid robots for its factories to take over several monotonous, hazardous and intricate tasks that will free up skilled human workers for higher-valued jobs..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And so are the artificial intelligence engineers. Very rarely a common person is aware of what it is like to be an AI engineer. Many times it so happens that even well-informed or AI-trained people are confused between AI engineering and machine learning or lack a proper understanding of the scope and challenges therein of different job roles in artificial intelligence. AI engineering will rule the tech world erasing the line between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. There will be no dearth of demand for them as the industry grows in the coming few decades. So, to understand if it is the role for you, it is very much necessary to get to the bottom of it. Let's dive in..The difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning .AI and ML are both part of computer science and most of the time they are used together because they are interrelated. But for someone who is specialized in designing AI or ML models, the differences are stark. Artificial intelligence is a broad term applied to all the techniques that make a system mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It helps AI systems to make predictions and take decisions without having to be explicitly programmed for the purpose. The machine learning algorithms learn by themselves using historical data..What do Artificial Engineers do?.An AI engineer's typical responsibilities include using programming algorithms to assemble, test, and convey AI models. They are troubleshooters with the responsibility to ensure the proper implementation of AI systems and the corresponding infrastructure. They build, deploy and maintain AI-based systems and develop the software for the systems after taking inputs from business leaders. Apart, they are also responsible for implementing Machine Learning (ML) processes as part of their job role. Natural Language Processing, building chatbots, building recommendation engines, and data pipelines are other major job responsibilities. Precisely, AI engineering is all about processing software engineering, data science, and automation to build functional AI systems..The Dark Side of AI Engineering Career.Building an AI product is as difficult as building a software product. Particularly when you are not a software engineer, building real AI products will be difficult. AI is a dynamic field with every improvement being a technological specialization in itself. Nothing you learn today would probably be relevant in the next two years leaving you fumbling over the new technologies. This is the nature of AI in general and accepting it becomes one's first responsibility. Image processing is another typical area, a seasoned AI engineer finds perfunctory. And finally, when the commercial point of a business is brought into the picture, it becomes an entirely different roller-coaster. The fact that you can build a product will not translate into a business idea unless it is economically viable and worth taking the risk. A certain idea might deliver the desired results but the cost overruns, millions of dollars, might outrun its very purpose, i.e., saving money..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
