The release of the film “Dolittle” has landed with a thud. During its first week, the box office receipts came to a disappointing $29.5 million. Keep in mind that the film–which stars Robert Downey Jr.–cost Universal Pictures $175 million to produce. 


Of course, Hollywood film-making is a boom-bust business. But might fast evolving technologies like AI improve the odds?

Perhaps so.

Just look at Warner Bros. The company recently struck a deal with Cinelytic, which has built an AI-infused project management system. It is focused on the green-lighting process, such as by helping to predict the potential profits on new films. 

PROMOTED
Now this is not to imply that Cinelytic has essentially cloned the genius of Steven Spielberg or James Cameron. Rather, the technology helps with the myriad of smaller tasks, such as analyzing the impact on territories, the bidding process for talent and so on. This should free up time for filmmakers to work on more important tasks. 
There are other startups gunning for this market opportunity, like Pex. The company has an AI-driven platform that analyzes movie trailers to determine the potential revenue generation. This is done by crunching data like views, shares, likes and other forms of online engagement. As a result, a studio can change a trailer to make it more impactful.

AI in Hollywood is still in the early stages. There will certainly be lots of trial and error. But it also seems likely there will be much growth in the coming years.
Here’s what some other experts have to say:

Richard Boyd, who is the co-founder and CEO of Tanjo: “AI is absolutely an effective solution to the question of content development. Netflix, Amazon and Google all know that if you want to understand people, you don’t ask them questions, you monitor what they do with their time, money, and attention.”
Bret Greenstein, who is the Global Vice President and Head of AI at Cognizant: “AI can absolutely help Hollywood reduce risk, in the same way it is reducing risk in other industries. This has nothing to do with computer generated imagery (CGI). Rather, it is about quantifying and analyzing content, understanding and predicting audience preferences, and creating models that allow more experimentation with color, images, costumes, cgi, and dialog to predict the best outcomes for a film. With AI, it may be possible to quickly edit content based on sudden societal changes that would impact the audience. Understanding, for example, recent news and events might cause a director to decide to rapidly adjust dialog or even visuals to avoid backlash.” 
Ganesh Sankaralingam, the Director of Data Science and Machine Learning at Latent View Analytics: “Today there's a wealth of actionable data available that movie studios and streaming entertainment companies can use to manage risk. Using AI and advanced analytics can not only help mitigate against box office flops, but also identify potential hits. After all, every Hollywood studio except Paramount turned down ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and there are countless other examples. So by keeping close tabs on what audiences watch and categorizing that data, studios can develop ‘taste communities.’ These communities can highlight overlaps between actors, directors and genres that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.”

The Nagging Issues
There should still be tempering of expectations with AI and Hollywood. Let’s face it, how much do we really know about the creative process? Well, it’s still very sketchy.
And besides, there are so many variables that can determine the success or failure of a film.
“AI might find that certain actors and types of dialogue and plot structures worked well in the 1980s and without any current movies with similar properties there is no reason for an AI to expect that the same recipe that worked in the 1980s won't still work now,” said Noah Giansiracusa, who is an assistant professor of Mathematics and Data Science at Bentley University. “Of course, such a movie may in fact do well for reasons of nostalgia, but whether the AI ‘grasps’ this nostalgia effect really comes down to whether there are enough similar movies produced in recent times to develop an expectation of modern performance. Another serious issue is that AI reflects all the biases and prejudice that have become embedded in data. If women and minorities have not done as well as white men as leads and writers and directors in the box office, then every AI algorithm we currently have will anticipate that trend continues and could potentially trap us in shortsighted thinking rather than recognizing that change is possible.”
In other words, don’t expect AI to put creative people out of work any time soon. But then again, the technology is likely to be a great help in the film-making process. 
“AI is a tool,” said Greenstein. “Judgement of people is essential. Judgement informed by AI will make big money in the box office.”

Job Search 2020: AI Is the New Gatekeeper to Your Dream Career
Not only do we have to worry about robots stealing our jobs, but we also have to worry about a machine not hiring us.

Many companies have turned to artificial intelligence to lead job candidacy searches and cherry pick job applicants… Welcome to the ‘Wild West of Hiring.’ Pixabay
The new job search question to ask yourself: What if AI doesn’t like me?

This is the obstacle now faced by college graduates hoping to land their first dream job. Yes, the human resources departments at companies are steering further away from humans and embracing artificial intelligence in their job candidacy searches.
SEE ALSO: Can Artificial Intelligence Determine If You Have a Toxic Workplace?
So now, job seekers, it’s all about winning the algorithm game.
According to CNN, career counselors at bigwig schools, such as Duke University, Purdue University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, are priming students on what companies use AI—and how to outfox the algorithms.
Gone are such job interview preparations as mentioned in this old-timey video from the archaic days of 2010.

Companies looking to fill internships and entry-level positions are steering more toward using platforms, such as HireVue, to help conduct a vast number of interviews via video that are analyzed by AI. HireVue, whose headquarters is in Salt Lake City, is used by over 800 companies including CNN, Hilton and Unilever. (That’s up from 50 companies in 2018.)
CEO Kevin Parker told The Wall Street Journal that the company’s platform removes human biases from the job interview process. And he said that… like it’s a good thing.
And this is becoming the new norm, in terms of job interview preparation: how to make a good job interview video.

“We’ll interview probably a million college kids this year,” Parker told CNN.
You can see the appeal for a company to use the HireVue platform. The candidates simply answer a set of predetermined questions via their laptop or smartphone camera. And then, the videos are run through the algorithm ringer—noting such details as facial expressions (captured by facial analysis software), voice tonality, word usage and grammar. (Sorry, foreign job candidates and those with botox.)
The applicants’ performance is then compared to actual company employees and then a score is given. The analysis is said to determine which candidates would make a good team member (who also happen to have good facial expressions and voice tonality).
The job applicant rejects, on the other hand, will have their videos posted immediately on YouTube for the world to mock. (This part isn’t true, I repeat, not true—but you never know what the future holds.)
Do you foresee any problems with AI breaking down job candidates into a series of ones and zeros? Gone from this equation is personal interactions, a sense of soul and actually looking someone directly in the eye.
Now that companies are turning to AI to be the job hiring gatekeeper, does artificial intelligence have the capacity to determine humor, irony and, in general, the heart and kindness of a person? The same type of questions were asked when we dove into whether or not artificial intelligence could determine if you have a toxic workplace.
Here’s more on the nuts and bolts of how AI cherry picks job applicants, which has been called “the Wild West of hiring.”

So not only do we have to worry about robots stealing our jobs, but we also have to worry about a machine not hiring us.
What’s next in our present job quest dystopia? Will job applicants also have to take the VK test from Blade Runner?

HireVue believes its platform can be helpful for ushering a massive number of people through the interview process quickly and reviewing them in a fair, consistent way. The big fear is that AI has the potential to replace humans doing the same job. (In this case, it’s humans doing human resource manager jobs.) In the medical field, using AI makes sense for things, such as scanning for breast cancer. It’s becoming a tool to assist real-life doctors by giving an analytical second opinion. Therefore, it complements the profession—and saves lives. 
But in this case, in which AI is the job gatekeeper, it simply allows companies to throw as many plates of job seeker spaghetti against the wall with no added effort. All it really does is waste the time of the optimistic job applicants. No time is wasted by the company to allow a million job seeking monkeys to send out a million job seeking application videos—in hopes that one algorithm will produce the entire works of Shakespeare—and be hired.
Basically, these entry-level, intern-seeking graduates are the guinea pigs for an AI-produced workforce of tomorrow. What flaws will we find in this system and what future lawsuits will arise?

Increasingly, artificial intelligence is being used in assessing job applications. It’s you versus the robot. How is a human to prevail? By making key adjustments to how you present yourself to the technology, advises a South Korean careers consultant Park Seong-jung. He is among the growing number of professionals who focus on helping clients successfully deal with A.I.While this eventuality is yet to take off equally everywhere, some countries like South Korea have seen quicker implementation of hiring technology. About a quarter of top 131 corporations already utilize or plan to use AI in making personnel decisions. This trend has spawned the growth of classes like Seong-jung’s.One concrete tip he offers students – if you were to do a video interview involving facial recognition software that can analyze character, you have to think about how your face appears. “Don’t force a smile with your lips,” suggests the consultant, according to a profile in Reuters. Instead “Smile with your eyes,” he says.In one example of an AI-conducted interview, taken by Reuters reporters, the technology asked interviewees to introduce themselves while examining facial expressions and processing word choices. The AI was also not averse to asking unexpectedly difficult questions like the scenario “You are on a business trip with your boss and you spot him using the company (credit) card to buy himself a gift. What will you say?”Another aspect to be aware of – AI often utilizes “gamification” tests to analyze your personality and how adaptable you are. It can get as specific as figuring out 37 capabilities of the interviewee and their likelihood in fitting into the position for which they are being considered, explained Chris Jung, a chief manager of software firm Midas IT. What’s more – some games have no right or wrong answers. They are used to understand the problem-solving approach of the candidate.


Conscious machines: How will we test artificial intelligence for feeling?
Conscious machines: How will we test artificial intelligence for feeling?If AI is like a shrink in the machine, how do you convince it you’re the best person for the job? It’s important to study your competition and to understand the culture of the company you are trying to work at. Nathan Mondragon, the head psychologist at HireVue, which creates hiring software for such clients as Goldman Sachs and Unilever, described just how pervasive the AI analysis can really get in an interview with the Guardian.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” said Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes.”All the data Mondragon’s software gathers becomes a score that can be compared to the scores of the company’s best employees. It makes sense to hire the kind of people who have already been successful for you.Another way AI can weed you out before your resume even gets to a human’s eyes is through Applicant Tracking Systems (APS), which increasingly rely on artificial intelligence. These are intelligent software scanners that can go through massive pools of data to identify candidates based on certain keywords and assigned data factors. According to a list from the millennial job recruitment site Muse, key ways you can right away improve your presentation to the APS is through streamlining your resume and cover letter. In particular, they recommend keeping the formatting of any documents you send in simple and using the right keywords (checking them with services like Wordle and TagCrowd). More pointers – don’t overdo acronyms, and get rid of career objectives.Last bit of wisdom that bears repeating – run a spell-check.

The world is interconnected through global trade on the
basis of a transportation industry. And, it will continue to grow, with a
predicted rise of nearly a third in seaborne-trade towards 2030, and with
increases in tonne-mileage up to 74,000 billion over the forecast period.  
In other words, the ocean will experience substantial
increases in traffic, pressure will get much higher and risk of marine
accidents and incidents at sea will persist. It is estimated that roughly 90%
of marine casualties and incidents caused by human mistakes, costing over
EUR1.4 billion in marine liability insurance claims. 
This in fact has urged businesses to invest in automation
underpinned by transformational technologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and machine learning, as the ultimate solution to improve productivity,
efficiency and safety by eliminating human errors.
Statistics have shown that AI has the capability to boost
the transportation and logistics industry performance by almost 90%,
potentially increase the industry’s annual revenue up to EUR0.45 trillion.
“Autonomous shipping is the future of the maritime industry.
As disruptive as the smartphone, the smart ship will revolutionise the
landscape of ship design and operations”
Mikael Mäkinen, President, Marine at Rolls-Royce Plc. 
Definition of
Autonomous Shipping
By definition, the term ‘autonomous shipping’ is mainly used to describe a self-sailing crewless vessel, but there are actually various autonomy levels. According to Lloyd’s Register, autonomy levels (AL) ranges from ‘AL0’ meaning traditional manned ship to ‘AL6’ referring to a fully autonomous ship with the operating system being able to calculate all the consequences and risks, and make decisions by itself, without any human interference. 

This means that, an autonomous ship does not have to be
unmanned, while the remote control of an unmanned ship means, it is not, in
fact autonomous. 
Benefits of
Autonomous Shipping
Attractive benefits of autonomous and unmanned ships is
increasingly being identified and discussed among maritime businesses.
According to research, while cheaper labour cut cost by 60%, automation could
cut labour costs by 90%. 
As stated by Rolls-Royce “Many facilities and systems on
board are only there to ensure that the crew is kept fed, safe, and
comfortable. Eliminate or reduce the need for people, and vessels could be
radically simplified.”
According to studies, the removal of the accommodation structure can result in a 6% reduction of fuel and another 5% reduction in construction costs, while opens up for more cargo space and thus higher freight income.

MUNIN project predicted a saving of more than EUR6 million
per ship over a 25-year period in fuel consumption and crew expenditures — the
most critical expense in vessel operating cost. 

It is no doubt that these kinds of ships will give
possibilities for headcount savings, eliminate human tragedy, and allow for
more efficient use of space in ship design. Autonomous ships would also
optimise maintenance activities and maximise fuel utilisation, consequently
leave a smaller carbon footprint. 
The advantages of autonomous ships are plentiful, and
autonomous shipping is not just a fanciful idea that could happen in the
future, or at least not anymore. It is being developed now by a number of
initiatives set up worldwide. 
The autonomous ships market size is predicted to grow from EUR5.5 billion in 2018 to EUR12.5 billion by 2030, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.00% during the forecast period.

How Many Challenges
This Digital Disruption Would Pose?
But despite the potential benefits especially the
operational savings, first, there will be a large capital expenditure in
initially investing in the technology, especially in the early stages of its development.

According to statistics, at least EUR23 million has been
spent for projects from Sea Machines Robotics, 
EU’s MUNIN, SINTEF’s Seatonomy, and Rolls-Royce’s Advanced Autonomous
Waterborne Applications Initiative.  
There will also be investments in setting-up of onshore
operations to monitor fleet movements, especially when there are
incompatibilities between the current marine infrastructure and an unmanned
vessel. 
However, if the estimates are correct, there won’t be any results until 2025, when the first remote controlled, unmanned coastal vessels is launched and, by 2035 we might see fully autonomous, unmanned ocean–going ships.

In addition to construction cost, fuel cost can increase as
autonomous vessels must run on higher-grade fuel such as Marine Diesel Oil
(MDO) or Marine Gas Oil (MGO) to ensure smooth operation of engines.
Estimations show that MDO/MGO would have to decrease about 12% in price to
justify an investment in an autonomous bulker in the current market.
Secondly, there are unanswered legal questions — companies
don’t yet know how international laws will apply to vessels that have no humans
on them, as implementation of unmanned ship is illegal according to the minimum
crew requirements regulation. Also, who is liable if an accident takes place?
Considering shipping is an international practice, such
modification would have to consider a complex political, societal and economic
matrix. As stated by World Maritime University, it is unlikely that there will
be any agreed international guidelines and regulations regarding autonomous
ships within the next decade. And what if governments and authorities can not
make an agreement and all the efforts go back to zero? 
Furthermore, it is believed that these remote controlled vessels will lack the skills, knowledge and experience which professional seafarers provide, according to the International Transport Worker’s Federation (ITF). What would happen if there are problems requiring immediate attention — such as cyber-attack, machinery maintenance or breakdown, or sudden changes in routes due to unforeseen events, natural or man-made?

Digital Disruption Is
a People Problem
Many in the industry, though, point out that most of these
concerns are being addressed. However, there seems to be a bigger and most
pressing challenge is to gain public acceptance, especially concerns about
technologies eating up jobs. 
The industry employs an estimated 1.6 million people on ships and on land, who currently are the protagonists of 90 per cent of world trade.  According to a study published by the International Transport Federation (ITF) and the International Federation of Shipmasters’ Associations (IFSMA), more than 80 per cent of seafarers voiced their anxiety about possible job losses with the advent of automation and AI, as the new technology has already surpassed certain human capabilities.

In fact, this industrial revolution could replace up to 35%
of UK workers and 47% of American jobs over the next 20 years, as researched by
Oxford University. The technology is expected to eliminate not just low-skilled
jobs but also high-skilled groups — such as traders, financial advisors, legal
assistants — as the technology possesses cognitive technology that can think
like a human, enabling it to analyze and interpret all of your data, including
unstructured text, images, audio and video. 
In other words, no one is safe from the increasing use of
technology. Many seafarers will have troubles to get work ashore after their
jobs disappearing with automation and AI. According to World Maritime
University, the introduction of autonomous ships will potentially decrease the
demand for seafarers, leading to a reduction of 22 per cent by 2040. 
The International Chamber of Shipping also expresses their
concerns on seafarer mental issues as the number of people on ships decreases,
as well as their functions are taken by machines. This will result in less
social interactions, leading to loneliness and potentially depression. 
Automation and AI will become so ubiquitous that displaced
workers will have nowhere to go with their current knowledge and competences.
As a result, it will pose a serious threat on many economic and social issues.
Society cannot afford to presume that this digital revolution will create jobs
as quick as eliminating them. 
”It’s one of the dirty secrets of economics: technological progress does grow the economy and create wealth, but there is no economic law that says everyone will benefit”

What should be
happening?
Automation and AI  is
the future that we can not avoid, but would unmanned ships become one, we are
not so certain. However, the industry still need to act now in order to prepare
our current and future workforce — such as reforming education, boosting
training programs that support seafarers to work with AI and automation. 
So, instead of removing human factors and replacing completely with technology, shipping businesses should elevate human potential through technology by using available AI-powered tools to predict operational risks, navigation solution, voyage optimisation, and the like to reduce maritime accidents.

SDG 8.7 is a commitment to end modern slavery, with the ambition to reduce that number by 10,000 people every day. James Cockayne, Director, Centre for Policy Research, United Nations University, is confident that we are “nowhere near” that target. The reasons for this systemic and enduring failure are the result of the “mispricing” of labour, where true social costs are not quantified. Worse still, companies are rewarded for driving down their labour costs. It is a market failure of massive proportions, present in just about every country on earth, generating an estimated $150 billion of profit globally and is the third-largest global crime, after drug trafficking and counterfeit goods smuggling. Forced migration and natural disasters increase the risks of human exploitation, so the looming spectre of climate change puts the spotlight on this issue. The price of modern slaveryModern slavery is at the heart of efforts to transform markets and to create a cohesive and sustainable world. As Cockayne says, “We must price modern slavery risk into our market practices.”Like so many global challenges, the success of any response relies on data: Where are the world’s modern slaves, which global supply chains are they a part of and how can we predict increased risks for human exploitation?The University of Nottingham, UK has applied artificial intelligence to satellite imaging to map forced labour patterns and predictions. An example is mapping brick kilns in South Asia, which have proven in the past to be hotspots for forced labour and debt bondage. This analysis is one example of innovation included in the presentation on Modern Slavery developed by United Nations University and Carnegie Mellon University at the Annual Meeting 2020 in Davos. Government Response (2018) – Walk Free Foundation conducted assessments of 181 governments’ actions towards the achievement of five milestones: survivor support, criminal justice, coordination, addressing risk, and supply chains. Image: earthtime.orgThe technology is visually arresting. It can highlight the nuances of modern slavery – showing regional patterns, involuntary work for adults versus children, and even industry-specific statistics. There is further work to be done, however, to develop a more granular picture of localized differences, showing more variation within countries and regions. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also recently published a report tracking a sector-by-sector evaluation, which charts whether foreign or local supply chains are driving the slave trade. Certain industries – construction, fishing and the palm sector – tend to generate labour rights violations. Conditions for workers in these sectors can be isolated and/or dangerous. Using the data to take action on modern slaveryArmed with this data, there are powerful examples of successful action against modern slavery. These tend to take shape as trade embargoes, such as restrictions on access to European markets for a group of the 25 worst-offending countries. Similarly, US Customs can impound goods for import that have an illegal supply-chain history. In the last few months alone, there have been 17 such cases. Another case involved the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund divesting in 33 palm oil companies discovered to rely on illegal labour supply chains. The knock-on effects were profound. A number of leading US banks followed suit. When Australian financial services company, Westpac, was linked to financing child trafficking, top jobs were lost and the bank was hard hit. Multilateral action is also gaining momentum. Two years ago, 85 countries endorsed a collective pledge to work with companies that are transparent about supply-chain risk – a pledge backed by the G20. The EU is moving towards the adoption of mandatory human rights practices. The Liechtenstein Initiative is a collective-action framework that seeks to use finance as a lever to address the market failure of modern slavery.These examples provide some hope that the 10,000 people-a-day target is achievable, but ultimately the technology needs more development, more investment and a holistic approach at a policy level, where survivors are at the heart of efforts to reduce risk. An approach that is limited to trade embargoes risks shifting the burden as companies go out of business and labourers become even more vulnerable. The key, then, is to ensure that importers act responsibly so that ethical and legal supply chains become the norm and slavery is no longer “modern”.Don't miss any update on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and CommunitiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Jobs and the Future of WorkSustainable DevelopmentShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

But the latest wave of advancements in artificial intelligence may be bring the prospect of machine replacement beyond blue collar work. Developers are creating algorithms that promise to take over vast amounts of work in white collar fields like law and medicine, potentially upending traditionally high-status fields. For people in those once-secure positions, the questions are whose jobs may be changed, how soon, and what new opportunities may arise to take their place.Knowledge work that involves repetitive tasks or large amounts of data, such as lawyers’ often arduous document discovery process, is particularly ripe for disruption from AI, experts say. Tasks that require human-to-human interaction or some element of creativity are likely to be safer. “Pattern recognition in general is something that these technologies seem good at,” says Mark Muro, one of the authors of a recent Brookings Institution report that suggests high-paid, educated workers will be highly exposed to new AI technology. “That is a contribution to a lot of white collar activities.”MIT economics professor David Autor says middle management positions are particularly susceptible to this new wave of automation, particularly in fields like finance and inventory management, where humans are in charge of translating data into concrete business decisions. But he also argues that displacement from machine learning is likely to create new opportunities. “Historically, tons of new work comes into existence as a result of automation,” Autor says. “The whole industrial revolution came about as a result of the automation of artisanal tasks, but it would have been impossible for anyone at the dawn of that period to foresee where that would go.”That optimism may come as cold comfort for the artisans of 2020: the millions of paralegals, human resource managers, IT professionals and other knowledge industry workers whose positions are prime targets for a new wave of automation. McKinsey predicts across-the-board cuts in such fields over the next decade. Some fields, like office financial support personnel, are likely to lose more than one in four positions.Some economists predict even more dramatic changes in the coming years, including a radical shift in top-tier white collar work. Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva argues that AI, coupled with outsourcing enabled by new advances in telecommunications, will sharply reduce white collar employment. He believes those twin drivers could displace professionals in elite sectors from media and finance to architecture and law, at least until people find new ways to put themselves to work. “What we have is displacement being driven at the pace of digital technology, but job creation being driven at the pace of human ingenuity,” Baldwin says. “What I’m worried about is that job displacement driven by digital will outstrip job creation driven by ingenuity.” Recent advancements illustrate the extent of possible change in some of society’s most illustrious professions. This month, a team of researchers announced they had created an AI algorithm that outperformed radiologists in detecting breast cancer in mammograms. Trained on tens of thousands of mammogram images, the algorithm measurably reduced both false positives and false negatives compared to human doctors. Of course, radiology involves a lot more than classifying images. With demand for radiologists surging, it’s not likely the field will die off any time soon. “AI will not replace radiologists,” says Kevin Lyman, CEO of AI radiology startup Enlitic. “But radiologists using AI will replace those who do not.” Of course, there are winners in any mass economic reorientation. The explosion in AI development has already created thousands of high-paying jobs for those with the skill sets to design, test, and sell such systems. Hiring growth for “AI Specialists” grew by 74% annually over the past four years, according to LinkedIn data. Carnegie Mellon University, a premier school for computer science, reports a recent explosion of interest in hiring their graduates, with three times as many tech companies recruiting in 2019 compared to just three years earlier. Over the same period, the number of data analytics, information technology, and software engineering jobs posted to CMU’s recruitment portal also tripled. Even within the tech campuses of Silicon Valley, machine learning automation may be making inroads. San Francisco-based startup Kite has developed a plugin that uses AI to offer auto-complete suggestions for coders. CEO and Founder Adam Smith predicts the technology will eventually do much more. “Instead of Kite predicting the line of code you’re currently typing, the human will just tell us what they want the piece of code to do and we’ll synthesize that code for them,” says Smith. But while coders may be working faster, he maintains that the obsolescence of software engineers is a long way off.Even as some high-status professions face possible AI disruption, economists are generally optimistic about the future of employment. Few are predicting anything like the end of work as we know it in coming decades. The challenge, says Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor of management science and information technology at MIT, is finding ways to transition people away from work where machines are outpacing humans and into jobs where they will be most needed. “In healthcare, in childcare, cleaning the environment, in creative work, science, entrepreneurship, the arts — these are all areas where machines can’t hold a candle to humans,” he says. “We’ve got plenty of work for people to do.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First OpinionHealth care needs AI. It also needs the human touch

As friends who work as pediatricians, we’ve had several conversations recently about artificial intelligence and its growing role in medicine. Machine learning and computer algorithms, it seems, are on the cusp of changing the medical profession forever.
Prestigious medical journals publish a steady stream of studies demonstrating the potential of deep learning to replace tasks that are currently the bread and butter of highly trained physicians, like reading CT scans of the head.advertisement

We are attuned to artificial intelligence in part because our city, Montreal, has become an international AI hub. One of the city’s biggest teaching hospitals, the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, just launched an AI school for health professionals. And to the south of Canada, U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang has built a political campaign around planning for a future disrupted by AI.
We see the writing on the wall, yet it’s hard for us in our day-to-day clinical work to imagine a time when artificial intelligence will have a real impact on what we do.

It might be that, as physicians who work in a public health care system that relies on fax machines, carbon copies, and actual rubber stamps, a system run by AI seems like science fiction. But the prospect of a purely technological health care system also irks us and strikes us as undesirable.advertisement

We aren’t alone in feeling this way. According to a recent Harvard Business Review report, “patients believe that their medical needs are unique and cannot be adequately addressed by algorithms.”
So is an AI-driven health care future one that patients will want and accept?
There is no question that machine-learning algorithms are increasingly rapid and accurate in analyzing medical data. Diagnostic medical specialties like radiology, which deal more with the interpretation of data than with direct patient interactions, are the first to see artificial intelligence integrated into their practice. But no clinical discipline will be unaffected: Tools such as counseling chat bots and machine-learning algorithms that use data from patient monitors are being developed for more hands-on work, such as mental health and intensive care.
Artificial intelligence clearly has the potential to pitch in where physician judgment falters. When doctors are tired or behind schedule, they are more likely to prescribe opioids and unnecessary antibiotics. They also achieve lower vaccination and cancer screening rates. The reason? Decision fatigue, by which doctors who make countless decisions each day lose steam as the day unfolds and increasingly rely on suboptimal default options. Algorithms that never get tired or hungry do not experience decision fatigue.
Still, techno-utopianism does not appear to be what patients want. In the Harvard Business Review report, people preferred receiving health advice from a human, even when a computer was more accurate. This makes intuitive (and self-serving) sense to us as clinicians. Seeking care is built around receiving the undivided attention of real human beings, flawed as they may be. Patients, it seems, see doctors’ humanity less as a bug and more as a feature.

As a medical student, one of us (O.D.) saw an 83-year-old man in a surgical oncology clinic who was recovering from prostate cancer. After being greeted and asked the simplest of questions, “How are you doing today?” the man began to cry. He confessed feeling that, even though his cancer was cured, his life would never be the same. He felt he had been forever scarred by his illness. Who knows if Siri or Alexa would have triggered such a response?
An algorithm could have calculated the man’s life expectancy and determined exactly how frequently he needed follow-up imaging and blood tests to detect a recurrence of his cancer. But would that have been health care?
It probably depends on who you ask. In our experience, feeling properly cared for means more than just receiving scripted advice and prescriptions for tests and medications, something a smart, Watson-like AI physician could conceivably do.
We have both experienced moments as clinicians when an apparently cursory or incomplete encounter left patients dissatisfied, even if it was rational and evidence-based. For instance, patients expect doctors to perform elements of the physical exam that are not strictly speaking necessary and will have no impact on the final treatment plan. Once you’ve diagnosed an ear infection in a child with fever, you usually don’t need to look for strep throat as well, but many parents feel good only once everything has been checked.
The truth is that every medical encounter contains an element of ritual and performance that is therapeutic. Patients want us to ask, look, and touch in response to their concerns, their bodies, and their unique circumstances. Few people appreciate a physician who seems to be working from a script, in the room but not truly present or connected. Who is, in other words, behaving like a machine.

							The rise of artificial intelligence means doctors must redefine what they do						




It’s worth asking where high-performing AI “clinicians” would ultimately lead us. Potentially to a less expensive and more accurate health care system that leaves human carers in the dust, relegated in their imperfection to simpler, lower-stakes tasks they can’t mess up. Perhaps, in an act of self-preservation, doctors would demand to be repurposed as medical bureaucrats, rubber stamping the machines’ indefatigably consistent and unimpeachable work.
Although it can be exciting to think about the outcomes that a minimally flawed and maximally accurate artificial intelligence system would yield, such as a 100% detection rate for potentially deadly skin cancers like melanoma, it’s still worth considering whether that’s the health care we really want.
How much of health care is about outcomes, and how much is about humans’ deeply social nature? Is healing someone a purely technical endeavor, or is it part of human culture, something we have done since we decided we were better off banding together than simply killing one another to get the next meal and sleep in the better cave?
These questions echo broader anxieties about the impending shocks that artificial intelligence will visit upon society in the form of massive disruptions to major industries and fundamental transformations to how people make their living and spend their time. In the face of these changes, Andrew Yang speaks of the importance of promoting a “human-centered capitalism” in which the basic unit of value is each person, not each dollar. His message is that we must remain focused on what the human project is supposed to be about: taking care of each other.
We aren’t arguing for a dismissal of AI in medicine. Missing this opportunity to harness powerful tools to improve patient care and outcomes would be foolish. But we are arguing to keep artificial intelligence in its place, and to stake a claim to ours.
Physicians should embrace technology that will help us make better decisions and give us more time to focus on what we do best. Whether it is delivering babies, accompanying individuals through their dying days, or announcing a new diagnosis of leukemia to the parents of a 4-year-old, physicians’ greatest contribution resides in informing, guiding, and supporting patients.
Human doctors still have a monopoly on what people want most: human care.

OK, computer: Let's bring text-generating artificial intelligence into the classroom

Artificial intelligence-based (AI) programs are quickly improving at writing convincingly on many topics, for virtually no cost. It's likely in a few years they'll be churning out C-grade worthy essays for students.





We could try to ban them, but this software is highly accessible. It would be a losing battle.
Long-form writing, especially essay writing, remains one of the best ways to teach critical analysis. Teachers rely on this mode of assessment to gauge students' understanding of a topic.
Thus, we need to find ways to help students of all disciplines thrive alongside advanced automation and smart systems, rather than resist them. This involves training students to work with AI tools, rather than banning them.
What are AI-powered text generators?
In February 2019, GPT-2, an AI-powered text generating system was released by OpenAI. Those interested can try the system themselves by following these instructions, or experiment with Talk to Transformer, an online tool made using GPT-2.
The idea behind GPT-2 is similar to the predictive text function on a smartphone. A machine learning system was given 8 million web pages, and told to look at blocks of text to predict what word would come next.
The system compared its guess with the actual text to ""learn"". This was repeated billions of times, resulting in the GPT-2 software.






Often within minutes, GPT-2 can generate texts that look like they were written by a human. They're grammatically correct, thematically coherent, engaging and even informative.
I gave GPT-2 this prompt: ""The global system of university ranking has recently…"". Here are some sentences it generated: ""The global system of university ranking has recently been the subject of heated debate, with many arguing that it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. In a report published in May, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the system has become increasingly irrelevant, with the gap between the best and the worst universities in the world narrowing in recent years. The OECD found that in the past decade, the average quality of a university's research output has fallen to its lowest level since the late 1970s"".
There are several signs of a non-human hand at work, notably the repetition of ""increasingly irrelevant"". There's also the matter that no such OECD report exists. It was dreamt up by the machine.
That said, with a few revisions, the text could probably pass as being authored by a human.
There are a number of systems similar to GPT-2, including Google's BERT, ERNIE2.0, XLNet and Facebook's RoBERTa. But GPT-2 has caught on with tinkerers across the web—lauded for its power and ease of use in generating new texts.
Available now near you
GPT-2 comes in forms that let anyone use it easily, even without a powerful computer. Such tools are a looming problem for schools and universities.
In an experiment, I fed the system 188 student papers on Keith Basso's book Wisdom Sits in Places, written for an anthropology course I teach. GPT-2 ""learned"" for about thirty minutes, after which it generated some paragraphs.
One begins: ""In this essay, I will show how conceptions of wisdom connect with place-names in Wisdom Sits in Places, by explaining how place-names serve as moral compass. I will also cover the cultural sphere of 'notions of morality,' which is explained by the stories behind the place-names.""
The text reads like an essay. It's divided into four paragraphs and describes what appears to be examples from the book.
I would have failed the text as is. The writing isn't perfect, and in places the writer seems to lose their train of thought. However, with slight human revision, an essay worthy of a C would be within reach.
Adapt, don't resist
People are already experimenting with GPT-2 for poetry, text-based role-playing games, and plays written in a Shakespearean style. Worryingly, it can also produce endless streams of fake news.






What can institutions do about such ""plagiarized"" work flooding their classrooms?
One response would be to ban AI tools. Leaders of 40 universities in the UK have taken this approach against essay mills, pushing to make them illegal. Essay mills are run by people who charge students a fee in exchange for completing their work.
But it's unclear how such a ban could be enforced once AI software is as easy to access as Candy Crush. Institutions could look to existing rules against academic misconduct, but accurate detection becomes a problem. As AI-generated texts get better, how will we prove (without watching them) that a student did or didn't write a text themselves?
We can't, so we should take a page from cyborg chess play, where players embrace chess-playing computers to become better themselves.
Rather than pretending AI doesn't exist, it might be time to train people to write with AI.
Most good writers don't write in isolation; they talk and revise their work with others. Also, 90% of writing is revision, which means the ideas and arguments in a text change and develop as a writer reads and edits their own work.
Thus, systems such as GPT-2 could be used as a first-draft machine, taking a student's raw research notes and turning them into a text they can expand on and revise.
In this model, teachers would evaluate a work, not just on the basis of the final product, but on a student's ability to use text-generating tools.
Powerful AI tools could help us analyze and communicate complex ideas.
What should we judge our students on?
All of the above prompts a question we need to consider if we're to live in an AI-friendly world: why do we teach students to write at all?
One major reason is many jobs rely on being able to write. So, when teaching writing, we need to think about the social and economic implications of a type of text.
Much of today's media landscape, for instance, runs on the continuous production and circulation of blog posts, tweets, listicles, marketing reports, slide presentations, and e-mails.
While computer writing might never be as original, provocative, or insightful as the work of a skilled human, it will quickly become good enough for such writing jobs, and AIs won't need health insurance or holidays.
If we teach students to write things a computer can, then we're training them for jobs a computer can do, for cheaper.
Educators need to think creatively about the skills we give our students. In this context, we can treat AI as an enemy, or we can embrace it as a partner that helps us learn more, work smarter, and faster.

Susan Schneider, associate professor of philosophy and cognitive science and director of the AI, Mind and Society (AIMS) Group at UConn, has gained a national and international reputation for her writing on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence (AI). She writes about the nature of the self and mind, AI, cognitive science, and astrobiology in publications including the New York Times, Scientific American, and The Financial Times and her work has been widely discussed in the media, such as Science, Big Think, Nautilus, Discover, and Smithsonian. She was named NASA-Baruch Blumberg Chair for the Library of Congress and NASA and also holds the Distinguished Scholar Chair at the Library of Congress. In her new book, Artificial You: AI and the Future of Your Mind (Princeton University Press, 2019), she examines the implications of advances in artificial intelligence technology for the future of the human mind.
Q: What is the focus of your newest book?
A: This book is about the future of the mind. It explores the nature of the self and consciousness in a not so distant future, using today’s work in artificial intelligence and brain enhancement technologies. Consciousness is the felt quality to experience—what it feels like to be you. When you smell the aroma of your morning coffee, hear the sound of a Bach concerto, or feel pain, you are having conscious experience. Indeed, every moment of your waking life, and even when you dream, it feels like something from the inside to be you. This book asks: assuming we build highly sophisticated artificial intelligences at some point in the future, would they be conscious beings? Further, how would we detect consciousness in machines? These questions are addressed in the first half the book. The second half of the book is on the nature of the self. I illustrate that AI isn’t just going to change the world around us. It’s going to go inside the head, changing the human mind itself, but I’m concerned about the potential uses of invasive AI components inside of our heads. I urge that we need to understand deep philosophical questions about the self, consciousness, and the mind before we start playing with fire and start replacing parts of our brains with artificial components. When it comes to the self and mind, we are faced with vexing philosophical questions that have no easy solution.
Q: You report about such experimentation with neural implants for things like Alzheimer’s disease but return to the question of, if there’s an artificial intelligence when does it become aware of itself?
A: There are all kinds of impressive medical technologies underway, and I’m very supportive of the use of invasive brain chips to help individuals with radical memory loss or locked in syndrome, in which individuals entirely lose their ability to move. I think innovations to help these people are important and exciting. What I get worried about, though, is the idea that humans should engage in widespread and invasive AI-based enhancement of their brains. For instance, Elon Musk has recently declared that we will eventually need to keep up with super-intelligent AI – a hypothetical form of AI that vastly outsmarts us — and we need to do that by enhancing our brains. He also thinks doing so will help us keep up with technological unemployment that many economists claim will happen because AI will outmode us in the workforce. Musk and others talk about “merging with AI and I” through gradually augmenting intelligence with AI technology until, in the end of the day, we are essentially AIs ourselves. Musk has recently founded a company to do this, and Facebook and Kernal are also working on this. But I argue in the book and in op-eds for the New York Times and the Financial Times that the idea we could truly merge with artificial intelligence in the ways that a lot of tech gurus and transhumanists advocate is actually not philosophically well-founded. We have to think things through more carefully
Q: You use examples of AI from science fiction, including one with the Star Trek: Next Generation character Lt. Commander Data, who is under attack on a planet and he uploads his brain’s memories to a computer on the Enterprise. You ask: Will he still be the same Data that he was before being destroyed? Will he really survive?
A: I think people assume that AIs will have the capacity to be immortal because they can just keep uploading and downloading copies of themselves whenever they are in a jam. By this they mean the android be practically immortal, living until the end of the universe. This makes them almost God-like. I am skeptical. In the book I use the Data example to illustrate that if Data found out that he was on a planet that was about to be destroyed, he couldn’t upload and genuinely survive. I think the idea that you could transfer your thoughts to a different format and still be you, surviving impending death, is conceptually flawed. It is flawed in both the human case and the case of androids. Believe it or not, there are advocates of uploading the human brain to survive death at places like the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute. I am skeptical.
Q: One of the points that you make in the book is that we have come far technologically but haven’t heard anything yet from an alien culture. You suggest we should prepare for alien contact by including the involvement of sociologists and anthropologists and philosophers.
As the NASA chair at NASA and the Library of Congress, I love to think about the Fermi paradox, which is the question: Given the vast size of the universe, where is all the intelligent life? Where is everybody? Nowadays, the question can be framed in terms of all of the intriguing exoplanet research that identifies habitable planets throughout the universe, but are these exoplanets actually inhabited (not just inhabitable), and if they are inhabited, does life survive into technological majority? Or are we alone? Why haven’t we heard anything? To the extent that we even do find life out there, my guess is that we will first find microbial life. There’s dozens of gloriously fun answers to the Fermi paradox.
Q: In the work that you’re doing with Congress, what kinds of questions are you being asked and what we should be thinking about going forward with all this technology?
There’s been a lot of concern over the last few years about deep fake videos. Nobody likes it; your career could be ruined by a deep fake video that has you saying something really rotten that you never said. Algorithmic discrimination is a big issue, the fact that algorithms that are based on deep learning technologies will be data-driven, so if the data itself has implicit bias, hidden biases in it, it can actually lead to a bad result which discriminates against certain groups. There are many members of Congress who’ve been concerned about that. That’s why we really need AI regulations. AI regulation could do tremendous work. And so I do hope we move forward on all of these issues.

An artificial intelligence tool—trained on roughly a million screening mammography images—can identify breast cancer with approximately 90% accuracy when combined with radiologist analysis, a new study finds.
The study examined the ability of a type of artificial intelligence (AI), a machine learning computer program, to add value to the diagnoses a group of 14 radiologists reached as they reviewed 720 mammogram images.
“The ultimate goal of our work is to augment, not replace, human radiologists.”
“Our study found that AI identified cancer-related patterns in the data that radiologists could not, and vice versa,” says senior study author Krzysztof Geras, assistant professor in the radiology department at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
“AI detected pixel-level changes in tissue invisible to the human eye, while humans used forms of reasoning not available to AI,” adds Geras, also an affiliated faculty member at the Center for Data Science. “The ultimate goal of our work is to augment, not replace, human radiologists.”
In 2014, women (without symptoms) in the United States got more than 39 million mammography exams to screen for breast cancer and determine the need for closer follow-up. Women whose test results yield abnormal mammography findings are referred for biopsy, a procedure that removes a small sample of breast tissue for laboratory testing.

In the new study, the research team designed statistical techniques that let their program “learn” how to get better at a task without being told exactly how. Such programs build mathematical models that enable decision-making based on data examples fed into them, with the program getting “smarter” as it reviews more and more data.
Modern AI approaches, which take inspiration from the human brain, use complex circuits to process information in layers, with each step feeding information into the next, and assigning more or less importance to each piece of information along the way.
The authors of the current study trained their AI tool on many images matched with the results of biopsies performed in the past. Their goal was to enable the tool to help radiologists reduce the number of biopsies needed moving forward. This can only be achieved, says Geras, by increasing the confidence that physicians have in the accuracy of assessments made for screening exams (for example, reducing false-positive and false-negative results).
For the current study, the research team analyzed images collected as part of routine clinical care over seven years, sifting through the collected data and connecting the images with biopsy results. This effort created an extraordinarily large dataset for their AI tool to train on, the authors say, consisting of 229,426 digital screening mammography exams and 1,001,093 images. Most databases the researchers used in studies to date have been limited to 10,000 images or fewer.
Thus, the researchers trained their neural network by programming it to analyze images from the database for which cancer diagnoses had already been determined. This meant that researchers knew the “truth” for each mammography image (cancer or not) as they tested the tool’s accuracy, while the tool had to guess. The researchers measured accuracy in the frequency of correct predictions.
In addition, the researchers designed the study AI model to first consider very small patches of the full resolution image separately to create a heat map, a statistical picture of disease likelihood. Then the program considers the entire breast for structural features linked to cancer, paying closer attention to the areas flagged in the pixel-level heat map.
Rather than have the researchers identify image features for their AI to search for, the tool is discovering on its own which image features increase prediction accuracy. Moving forward, the team plans to further increase this accuracy by training the AI program on more data, perhaps even identifying changes in breast tissue that are not yet cancerous but have the potential to be.
“The transition to AI support in diagnostic radiology should proceed like the adoption of self-driving cars—slowly and carefully, building trust, and improving systems along the way with a focus on safety,” says first author Nan Wu, a doctoral candidate at the Center for Data Science.
The study appears in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.
Additional coauthors are from NYU, SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, the University of Cambridge, and Jagiellonian University.
Support for the work came, in part, from the National Institutes of Health. The model used in this study has been made available to the field to drive innovation.

This is especially an important factor for rural schools. In fact, we’re also organising mobile AI labs, which can travel between hard-to-reach villages, so as to have maximum reach.”.While it all may sound tech-heavy, Subodh says that AI can be used to facilitate projects across disciplines, from humanities to engineering and social as well as hard sciences.“We’re working with students across the spectrum. If we’re teaching one student interested in conservation how to use AI to compile and extrapolate data affecting different species, another class 11 student wanting to become a molecular biologist is learning how AI can aid in discovering new medical drugs.”.Highlights of the initiativeThe AI Youth Lab is an initiative by 1M1B in collaboration with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the year 2030. 1M1B works with youth in urban as well as rural schools to fulfil the UN SDGs. 1M1B is working closely with UN-ECOSOC and the United Nations Department of Global Communications. .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2020/Jan/23/the-kids-are-artificial-intelligence-right-2093306.html', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/TNIE/import/2020/1/23/original/The_Kids___.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",

Ohio State futurist visits Air Force Research Lab












Published Jan. 22, 2020

                        By Mary Pacinda
                        
                    
Air Force Research Laboratory


WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio — An unusual guest speaker recently challenged researchers and administrators at the Air Force Research Lab to think about artificial intelligence and machine learning and how they will change the home and workplace as well as institutions of higher learning.
Speaker Dr. David Staley, an Ohio State University history professor, advised his audience that, as a futurist, he was not in the prediction business. He was just interested in what is going to happen next. And one of the biggest—and perhaps surest—things that will happen next is the ever-expanding role of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is a topic of special interest at AFRL, where a lot of work is being done on machine learning. Staley saw some of this work firsthand as he visited two of several labs on site. In one, the chemistry foundry, researcher Dr. Luke Baldwin led a briefing about recent efforts to bring synthetic chemistry into the digital age of the 21st century.
Baldwin provided a perspective on how chemistry has historically been done and how established practices often make chemists resistant to change. He then focused on recent progress in automation and machine-assisted chemistry and how AFRL is supporting this concept in the chemistry foundry. Baldwin’s presentation also included another AFRL field of research, synthetic biology, a revolutionary concept that redesigns organisms to perform new reactions.
Continuous flow chemistry, a lab-scale method for synthesizing molecules in an accelerated process, was also discussed as well as demonstrated. One of the points raised during Baldwin’s presentation was the need to train the next generation of computer and physical scientists to work together from an early educational age, thereby ensuring continued progress in materials research using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Staley’s tour also included a visit to an additive manufacturing lab, where Dr. Andrew Gillman introduced the concept and history of topology optimization. Topology optimization is a mathematical process for deciding where material can be removed from a part or a structure to make it lighter while limiting the effect on its strength. Often the resulting complex redesign is impossible to fabricate using such traditional means as metal stamping, casting and welding. However, additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing, has the potential to actually produce these complex parts, which are designed by a computer using topology optimization algorithms.
Gillman also explained that “machine learning” comes into play as both the number of simulations and additive manufacturing experiments can become incredibly large, making it challenging for humans to learn from and understand any underlying patterns, and then decide upon future design changes. Machine learning techniques are being explored to automatically detect these patterns and trends, while improving human intuition about complex manufacturing processes, and automatically making decisions for redesign. This cycle of testing, redesigning and re-producing can happen very quickly without any human involvement once the process begins. Doing the same kind of research and analysis without artificial intelligence and machine learning would take months or years, if it could be accomplished at all.
Also part of this tour stop, researchers Matt Jacobsen and Dr. Dan Berrigan described how the way we store and represent data is critical toward moving from data simply as information to collectively representing knowledge and intelligence. They also explained how we are developing smart manufacturing systems that make these tools intelligent teammates, resulting in humans and machines making decisions and performing complex tasks together.
Looking at current trends, Staley expects that dependence on artificial intelligence as an essential tool will continually increase. Instead of feeling threatened or intimidated, however, humanity needs to teach this tool to be a teammate rather than a master or a slave. Such a relationship is already taking root as people commonly accept AI’s assistance in their everyday lives, consulting Google or querying Alexa, for example.
But what about the danger of AI replacing humanity? Staley assured his audience that, in the near term at least, technology will replace jobs, not humanity. And even then, AI does not willfully take anyone’s job. The decision to use a “robot” instead of a human being is made by another human being. “If a machine is as good as or better than a human, and cheaper,” Staley said, “technology replaces human labor every time.” He then referred to economist Carl Benedikt Frey, saying that 47 percent of all jobs have the potential of being automated in the next 10 to 15 years. Most of those jobs will be “high-end” jobs that currently require technical college degrees. One example Staley gave was that of accountant.
So, where does this leave higher education? If earning a degree in a discipline such as accounting likely guarantees that the graduate will be unemployable, then what should universities teach and how should they teach it? Even today, employers claim they are facing a shortage of employees with important “soft” skills like innovation, creativity, time management and the ability to prioritize. Such skills will become even more valuable in the workplace of the future. According to Staley, higher education is not ready for the changes that will be taking place in the workforce over the next 10 to 15 years. “Citizens have little confidence in higher education’s ability to prepare someone for working in a new autonomous world,” said Staley.
The change in needed skills has already been happening. While touring one of AFRL’s labs where machine learning is used, Staley asked the researchers if they had had formal training or education in that field. Their response was that they had learned by doing, on-the-job, mainly because no such coursework existed when they were earning their degrees.
One solution that Staley sees being applied even now is for companies to teach their own coursework or to even have their own learning institutions. An example already in use is McDonald’s Hamburger University, where employees can earn 23 college credits in areas such as restaurant management.
Employees also may find their college degree increasingly irrelevant and themselves subject to losing a job because of “downsizing” that results from increased automation. To avoid this problem, companies can use another form of employee education Staley called “upskilling.” This does not mean retraining someone to do a different job. It means continually building upon and adding to employees’ skills to make them more relevant in a continually changing workplace.
Staley spoke of yet another solution in what he called “Interface University.” While machines are good at crunching data, they do not have human cognition. Therefore, humans and computers working together are more productive than either working alone. At Interface University, humans will be taught to “think with computers.”
This would not be the first time that humans have paired cognition with technology. Staley pointed out that the invention of writing was a technology, and not simply a tool. With writing, humans could “engage in a level of cognition not possible with the human brain alone.”
Finally, to make this pairing of humans with artificial intelligence work, the human half of the team must be proficient in certain beneficial human attributes. Those attributes, which can and must be taught at the university level, include imagining, creating, inductive and deductive reasoning and critical thinking. This means that universities need to reconsider their current strategy, which is to focus nearly exclusively on teaching STEM. Staley suggests that students need to be taught how to interpret literature, to fathom meaning from a book, for example, instead of simply reading to acquire information. This is one of those complex cognitive skills that can never be learned by an algorithm. And according to Staley, this is not “just a nice thing to do; it’s a survival strategy.”

One of his research interests is the history and future of higher education. He recently authored Alternative Universities: Speculative Design for Innovation in Higher Education.

How the Application of Neuroscience in Design Can Separate Us from Artificial Intelligence
Intuitively, most people can see a well-designed space and say, “Yes, that looks nice.” But what is it that makes us respond this way? Why do some spaces appeal to our senses better than others? And in an era of artificial intelligence, how can designers tap into those sciences to design spaces that help us continue to develop our humanistic traits and skills?
Frederick Marks, president of the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture, shares that “neuroscience is a multidisciplinary branch of biology that deals with the structure or function of the nervous system and the brain. This includes psychology, physiology, anatomy, molecular and developmental biology, neurochemistry, cytology, and mathematical modeling.”

According to Marks, “Neuroscience is an emerging field whose focus is primarily, because of need and available funding, on the prevention of disease and treatment. But what is being learned has potential secondary applications for design and architecture. The environments we live, work, and play in are changing our brains and our behavior all the time. As explained by one neuroscientist, while the brain controls our behavior and genes control the blueprint of our brain, our environment can modulate the function of genes and, ultimately, the structure of our brain.”
Because this research shows that design plays such an active role in the continuous formation of our brain, the science behind how we respond to and interact with different environments is coming to the forefront. And its applications are fascinating. Let’s take a look.

The importance of designing spaces that cater to our continued desire to learn
According to architecture, design, and planning firm Gensler, one of the keys to scientifically backed design is an understanding of how our built environment can best support cognitive development. Separate from the research conducted by the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture, research led by Amrita Kulkarni and Vincenzo Centinaro of Gensler Chicago suggests that “‘creative’ behaviors like critical thinking, problem-solving, empathy, and emotional intelligence are foundational skills of tomorrow’s workforce and are traits that make us intrinsically human.”

These researchers have deducted that, contrary to popular belief, learning is not a fourth work mode beyond focus, collaboration, and socialization, but instead it is a continuous path that occurs every moment during our workday. And Kulkarni and Centinaro suggest there are four distinct kinds of learning dimensions we transition to throughout the day: training-based, mentorship-based, chance-based, and platform-based.

Designing for each learning environment
Training-based learning traditionally takes place in formal or structured learning environments such as classroom settings designed for CEUs or certification. According to Kulkarni and Centinaro, designers focusing on training-based learning need to adapt their designs to prioritize cross-training and forge connections among learners. These types of learning scenarios should offer an open-concept feel, with the ability to have breakout sessions, as seen with activity-based workstations.
Contrarily, mentorship-based learning happens in more informal ways, in environments like management offices or even in cafeterias or common places. Organizations have an opportunity to amplify learning by demonstrating commitment, offering protected time, coaching on critique styles, facilitating dialogue among unexpected groups, and encouraging opinion sharing openly throughout the workplace. To facilitate this, we often see designs that prioritize water cooler conversations or spontaneous touchdowns, complete, of course, with amenities and technology like smart boards, teleconferencing capabilities to loop in remote workers, and adjustable workstations for groups to congregate as they see fit.
In chance-based learning, people learn in unplanned and unstructured ways by creatively thinking about problems they face. These creative learners often request environments filled with visualization and co-creation tools so they can problem solve wherever the creativity strikes. Again, a popular method here is activity-based workstations and unassigned seating, allowing learners to position themselves where they can collaborate best.
And lastly, in platform-based learning, curators need to boost participation through seamlessness, friendliness, persistence, and diversity in available platforms. This type of learning occurs in formal settings such as fireside chats, town halls, or even in online forums, resulting in the need for a variety of workstations, from conference rooms to even less formal settings like café workstations or even outdoor work spaces.
Deloitte’s 2018  Future of Work study suggests that 65 percent of our future jobs—those that today’s primary school children will grow into—don’t exist yet. Because of this, Kulkarni and Centinaro suggest that skills that separate us from artificial intelligence—things like critical thinking, creative problem-solving, empathy and emotional intelligence, systemic understanding, interdisciplinary collaboration, camaraderie and fellowship, comfort with ambiguity, and iterating contexts—are all foundational skills of tomorrow’s workforce. By fostering these skill sets through design elements that encourage learning, we can continue to nurture the very elements that make us human.
In this spirit, Marks leaves us with this prediction for the future of neuroscience and design: “As knowledge grows in neuroscience and provides insight into how and why neurons fire in response to certain conditions, data also will increase relevant to the built environment. The hope is that a branch of neuroscience will emerge that is dedicated to understanding how humans interact with space and place. Designers are ultimately in the business of creating experience. The more they may know about pattern statistics and visual perception, how sound waves enter the ear, how the skin reacts to various textures and temperatures, what smells initiate pleasure, and what is retained in our collective memory, the more they will be proficient at their craft.”
